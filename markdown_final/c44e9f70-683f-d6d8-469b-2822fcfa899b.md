## Question

What are the specific treatment targets for hypertension in patients with CAD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the specific treatment targets for hypertension in patients with coronary artery disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, current guidelines and their exact numeric targets. Then, I should verify how these recommendations differ from older guidance and why. Next, I will examine the evidence base supporting those targets, including randomized trials and meta-analyses. After that, I need to check for conflicting data, especially around the J-curve and diastolic thresholds. Finally, I will consider special populations, practical implementation, and synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable recommendation with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the most current guideline positions. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP chronic coronary disease guideline explicitly recommends a blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mmHg for adults with chronic coronary disease and hypertension to reduce cardiovascular disease events and all-cause mortality, and this is a Class 1, Level B-R recommendation, which is strong and evidence-based for this population [^7f02f1f7] [^23531eb2]. Wait, let me verify the European perspective; the 2023 ESH guideline states that patients with coronary artery disease should generally have the same treatment targets as the general hypertensive population, which in ESH 2023 is less than 130/80 mmHg for adults under 65 years, with more lenient targets for older adults, implying that many patients with CAD will indeed be targeted to less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^91a0a27f] [^12762716]. I should also confirm that the 2024 ESC guidance aligns with using beta-blockers and/or calcium channel blockers when angina is present, reinforcing the same therapeutic principle even if it does not restate a numeric target de novo [^ae6bc069].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the historical context and why the target shifted. Earlier guidance often used less than 140/90 mmHg broadly, with consideration of less than 130/80 mmHg in selected high-risk patients, but the 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP update codifies less than 130/80 mmHg as the default for chronic coronary disease based on contemporary evidence and risk reduction estimates, marking a clear evolution from older thresholds [^8dfc452a] [^7f02f1f7]. Let me reconsider the European stance; while ESH emphasizes tailoring by age and tolerance, its default for adults under 65 with hypertension, including many with CAD, remains less than 130/80 mmHg, which functionally converges with the U.S. recommendation in many cases [^91a0a27f] [^12762716].

> Next, I should review the evidence base supporting the less than 130/80 mmHg target. The ACC/AHA/ACCP document cites that reducing systolic blood pressure to less than 130 mmHg reduces CVD complications by about 25% and all-cause death by about 27% in high-risk patients, which underpins the recommendation for chronic coronary disease [^4c686d95]. I need to ensure this aligns with trial signals; although SPRINT excluded diabetes and included only a subset with CAD, post hoc analyses in CAD subgroups show a reduction in all-cause mortality with intensive therapy, albeit with attenuated composite cardiovascular outcomes and more hypotension, supporting a careful, individualized push toward less than 130/80 mmHg rather than a blanket less than 120 mmHg approach [^2e190412] [^7ba76cbe]. But wait, what if lower is not always better; I should double-check the balance of benefits and harms, and indeed, intensive targets increase hypotension and electrolyte disturbances without clear reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events in CAD-specific analyses, reinforcing a moderated intensification rather than aggressive downward titration in all cases [^2e190412] [^7ba76cbe].

> I will now examine the J-curve concern, especially for diastolic blood pressure, because coronary perfusion is diastolic. Large observational cohorts in stable CAD, such as CLARIFY, show increased risks when systolic blood pressure is less than 120 mmHg and when diastolic blood pressure is less than 70 mmHg, with particularly strong signals below 60 mmHg, suggesting a J-shaped relationship and the need to avoid excessive diastolic lowering in patients with fixed coronary stenoses [^a1b9e22f]. Let me verify physiologic plausibility; myocardial perfusion pressure approximates diastolic pressure minus coronary venous pressure, and modeling indicates that at diastolic pressures around 60 mmHg, a substantial fraction of patients with coronary stenoses may have critically low perfusion pressure, which supports caution with overly aggressive diastolic lowering in CAD [^25ee40fe]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the optimal diastolic range was universally 70 to 80 mmHg; I should correct that nuance — while many guidelines and reviews cite 70 to 80 mmHg as a pragmatic sweet spot, the strongest adverse signal emerges below 70 mmHg, and some analyses suggest risk may begin to rise even before 70 mmHg in certain subgroups, so I should frame 70 to 80 mmHg as a reasonable target window with vigilance for symptoms or ischemia if diastolic pressure falls further [^a1b9e22f] [^25ee40fe].

> Let me consider special populations where targets may differ. In older adults, particularly those 80 years and above, ESH recommends higher thresholds, often 140 to 150 mmHg systolic, given frailty, falls, and limited trial evidence for benefit with intensive targets, so I should avoid pushing less than 130/80 mmHg rigidly in this group unless exceptionally tolerated [^12762716]. For patients with diabetes and CAD, the INVEST analysis showed no outcome advantage to tight systolic control less than 130 mmHg versus 130 to 139 mmHg, and even suggested higher mortality with systolic pressure less than 115 mmHg, so a target of less than 130/80 mmHg is reasonable if tolerated, but I should be cautious not to overshoot into harmful lows, especially for diastolic pressure [^e57a899a] [^4652c41f]. In acute coronary syndromes or immediately post-MI, stabilization takes precedence; beta-blockers and renin-angiotensin blockade are prioritized, and aggressive downward titration of blood pressure should be deferred until hemodynamic stability and ischemia are controlled, with targets individualized thereafter [^328079e5].

> Next, I should review implementation details and monitoring. Nonpharmacologic therapy is first-line for elevated blood pressure in chronic coronary disease and can meaningfully reduce systolic pressure, so I need to ensure lifestyle measures are optimized alongside medications [^52c9c88c] [^617067e0]. For drug selection, ACE inhibitors or ARBs and beta-blockers are preferred first-line when there are compelling indications such as prior MI or angina, with calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuretics added as needed to reach the target, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists considered in resistant cases or when heart failure is present [^a050bdee] [^266d9df3]. I should confirm that heart rate control is also emphasized in symptomatic CAD; ESH suggests targeting 60 to 80 bpm when feasible with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, which can further balance myocardial oxygen supply and demand in angina [^71460dc1] [^79b57ac6]. Hold on, I should verify measurement strategy; given white-coat and variability effects, home or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring improves accuracy and can guide safer titration toward less than 130/80 mmHg without inadvertently plunging diastolic pressure too low [^878ef6f0].

> I need to ensure I weigh conflicting evidence transparently. Meta-analyses of trials comparing lower versus standard targets in established cardiovascular disease have not consistently shown mortality benefits and highlight more adverse events and treatment withdrawals with lower targets, which tempers enthusiasm for universal intensification beyond 130/80 mmHg in CAD and argues for individualized decisions rather than a one-size-fits-all approach [^c202a50b] [^5e3ad0b6]. Let me reconsider the balance; while population-level risk reduction is attractive, the J-curve signal for diastolic pressure and the lack of consistent composite outcome benefit in CAD-specific intensification trials mean that less than 130/80 mmHg is appropriate for most, but not all, and that diastolic pressure should not be allowed to drift below about 70 mmHg whenever possible in patients with obstructive CAD [^a1b9e22f] [^25ee40fe].

> Putting this together, my final synthesis is as follows. For most adults with chronic coronary disease and hypertension, a reasonable and evidence-aligned target is less than 130/80 mmHg, provided it is tolerated and diastolic pressure remains at or above about 70 mmHg, with careful attention to symptoms, orthostasis, and renal function during titration [^7f02f1f7] [^23531eb2]. I should confirm that in patients older than 80, those with frailty, or those with symptomatic hypotension, higher targets such as less than 140/90 mmHg or even 140 to 150 mmHg systolic may be more appropriate, and in diabetes with CAD, I should individualize toward less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated but avoid sustained systolic pressure less than 120 mmHg or diastolic pressure less than 70 mmHg given observed harms in observational datasets [^12762716] [^e57a899a] [^a1b9e22f]. If angina limits attainment of systolic targets, I should prioritize beta-blockers and/or calcium channel blockers for symptom control and heart rate reduction, recognizing that perfect blood pressure control is secondary to ischemia relief in that acute context [^ae6bc069] [^42eebcde].

The recommended blood pressure target for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is **< 130/80 mmHg** [^7f02f1f7] to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality [^4c686d95]. This target applies to most adults with CAD and hypertension, provided it is tolerated and there is no symptomatic hypotension or adverse effects [^23531eb2]. For older adults (≥ 65 years), especially those ≥ 80 years or with frailty, **individualize to < 140/90 mmHg** if < 130/80 mmHg is not tolerated [^12762716] [^b55cc296]. Avoid **diastolic BP < 60 mmHg** because it may compromise coronary perfusion and increase ischemic risk [^a1b9e22f] [^25ee40fe]. Use beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and add calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics as needed to reach the target [^a050bdee] [^266d9df3].

## Recommended blood pressure targets

### General target for CAD patients

The **target BP** is < 130/80 mmHg for most adults with CAD and hypertension, which reduces cardiovascular events and mortality [^7f02f1f7] [^4c686d95]. The **rationale** is that lowering BP to < 130/80 mmHg reduces cardiovascular complications by ~25% and all-cause mortality by ~27% in high-risk patients [^4c686d95].

---

### Special considerations for older adults

In adults ≥ 65 years, especially those ≥ 80 years or with frailty, **individualize to < 140/90 mmHg** if < 130/80 mmHg is not tolerated [^12762716] [^b55cc296]. The **reasoning** is that older adults have higher risks of hypotension, falls, and cognitive impairment, so targets should be adjusted to tolerance and comorbidities [^625ed7be].

---

### Lower limits and J-curve phenomenon

Avoid **diastolic BP < 60 mmHg** because it may reduce coronary perfusion and increase ischemic risk, particularly in patients with fixed coronary stenoses [^a1b9e22f] [^25ee40fe]. The **evidence** shows a J-curve relationship, with increased cardiovascular events when diastolic BP falls below 60–70 mmHg [^a1b9e22f] [^341a458c].

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line antihypertensive agents

- **Beta-blockers**: First-line for CAD with hypertension, especially post-MI or with angina, to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and ischemia [^a050bdee] [^266d9df3].
- **ACE inhibitors or ARBs**: Recommended for CAD with hypertension, particularly with LV dysfunction or diabetes, to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality [^a050bdee] [^266d9df3].
- **Calcium channel blockers**: Add if additional BP control is needed or if beta-blockers are contraindicated [^a050bdee] [^266d9df3].
- **Thiazide diuretics**: Consider for resistant hypertension or when other agents are contraindicated [^a050bdee] [^266d9df3].

---

### Combination therapy

Most patients require **combination therapy** to achieve < 130/80 mmHg; tailor regimens to comorbidities, tolerance, and adverse effects [^a050bdee] [^266d9df3].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological therapy is **first-line for elevated BP (120–129/ < 80 mmHg)** in CAD and includes:

- **Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)**: Reduces SBP by ~11 mmHg in hypertension [^617067e0].
- **Sodium restriction**: < 2.3 g/day; reduces SBP by ~4–5 mmHg [^notfound].
- **Weight loss**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m²; reduces SBP by ~5 mmHg per 10 kg lost [^notfound].
- **Regular aerobic exercise**: ≥ 150 minutes/week; reduces SBP by ~4–8 mmHg [^notfound].
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 1 drink/day (women) or ≤ 2 drinks/day (men); reduces SBP by ~2–4 mmHg [^617067e0].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Home BP monitoring**: Encourage to improve adherence and detect white-coat or masked hypertension [^878ef6f0].
- **Regular follow-up**: Adjust therapy based on tolerance, adverse effects, and cardiovascular outcomes [^23531eb2].
- **Individualized targets**: Modify goals for frailty, comorbidities, or intolerance [^12762716].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended bp target** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| General CAD patients | < 130/80 mmHg | Reduce cardiovascular events and mortality [^7f02f1f7] [^4c686d95] |
| Older adults (≥ 65 years) | Individualize to < 140/90 mmHg | Adjust based on tolerance and comorbidities [^12762716] [^b55cc296] |
| Diastolic BP lower limit | Avoid < 60 mmHg | Risk of reduced coronary perfusion [^a1b9e22f] [^25ee40fe] |

---

The target BP for CAD patients is **< 130/80 mmHg** if tolerated, with individualization for older adults and avoidance of diastolic BP < 60 mmHg. Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and combination therapy are key, with lifestyle measures as foundation.

Context

Most guidelines for treatment of hypertension including the Joint National Committee-7 recommend a blood pressure (BP) goal of <140/90 mm Hg for hypertensive patients and a more aggressive goal of <130/80 mm Hg for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), based largely on expert consensus.

Objective

To evaluate the BP targets in patients with CAD DATA SOURCES: PUBMED, EMBASE and CENTRAL Study Selection: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of antihypertensive therapy in patients with CAD, enrolling at least 100 patients, with achieved systolic pressure of <=135 mm Hg in the 'intensive BP' group and <=140 mm Hg in the 'standard BP' group with follow-up for at least 1 year and evaluating cardiovascular outcomes.

Data Extraction

The following efficacy outcomes were extracted- all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, angina pectoris, heart failure and revascularisation.

Results

We identified 15 RCTs enrolling 66,504 participants with 276,328 patient-years of follow-up. Intensive BP group (≤ 135 mm Hg) was associated with a 15% decrease in heart failure rate and 10% decrease in stroke rate, driven largely by trials with a more intensive BP group (≤ 130 mm Hg), with similar outcomes for death and cardiovascular death and was associated with a 105% increase in the risk of hypotension. More intensive BP group (≤ 130 mm Hg) was also associated with a reduction in myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. The results were similar in a Bayesian random effects model. In addition, lower seemed to be better (based on regression analysis) for the outcomes of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and perhaps angina.

Conclusions

The present body of evidence suggests that in patients with CAD, intensive systolic BP control to ≤ 135 mm Hg and possibly to ≤ 130 mm Hg is associated with a modest reduction in stroke and heart failure but at the expense of hypotension. Lower was better, although not consistently so for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and perhaps angina. Further trials are needed to prove these findings.

Conclusions

The mechanism of hypertension in T2DM is complex, involving multiple neuro-humoral and metabolic factors, and both conditions share several similar aspects of pathophysiology. For type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, the optimal BP targets (especially for diastolic BP) vary based on clinical status in a given individual, and the strategy of BP control should be individualized to minimize adverse events and maximize benefits. Novel information as such is useful for clinicians and researchers to further add new knowledge on pathophysiology and therapeutic goal in diabetes and hypertension.

Background

Controversies exist regarding the optimal blood pressure (BP) level that is safe and provides cardiovascular protection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coexistent coronary artery disease. Several new glucose-lowering agents have been found to lower BP as well, making the interaction between BP and T2DM even more complex.

Methods

With the reference to recent literature, this review article describes the potential mechanisms of increased risk of hypertension in T2DM and outlines the possible optimal BP levels based upon recommendations on the management of hypertension by the current guidelines, in combination with our research findings, for type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.

Results

The development of hypertension in T2DM involves multiple processes, including enhanced sympathetic output, inappropriate activation of renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, endothelial dysfunction induced through insulin resistance, and abnormal sodium handling by the kidney. Both AGE-RAGE axis and adipokine dysregulation activate intracellular signaling pathways, increase oxidative stress, and aggravate vascular inflammation. Pancreatic β-cell specific microRNAs are implicated in gene expression and diabetic complications. Non-pharmacological intervention with lifestyle changes improves BP control, and anti-hypertensive medications with ACEI/ARB, calcium antagonists, β-blockers, diuretics and new hypoglycemic agent SGLT2 inhibitors are effective to decrease mortality and prevent major adverse cardiovascular events. For hypertensive patients with T2DM and stable coronary artery disease, control of BP<130/80 mmHg but not<120/70 mmHg is reasonable, whereas for those with chronic total occlusion or acute coronary syndromes, an ideal BP target may be somewhat higher (<140/90 mmHg). Caution is advised with aggressive lowering of diastolic BP to a critical threshold (<60 mmHg).

Conclusions

Hypertension and T2DM share certain similar aspects of pathophysiology, and BP control should be individualized to minimize adverse events and maximize benefits especially for patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^0bcf0073]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Large-scale prospective studies have demonstrated that elevated blood pressure (BP) is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). The prevalence of hypertension ranges from 30 to 70% in individuals with pre-existing CAD, and a previous study demonstrated that a 20 mm Hg rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or a 10 mm Hg rise in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) results in a twofold increase in the risk of mortality among patients with ischemic heart disease aged 40–69 years. Meanwhile, a reduction in SBP of 5 mm Hg can decrease the risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) by 9%. Currently, few clinical trials are primarily designed to evaluate optimal BP targets in patients with CAD. Therefore, there are no standardized BP targets for patients with CAD, and current clinical practice is largely based on expert consensus with scant clinical trial evidence. Recent practice guidelines recommend a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg in individuals with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), although it was acknowledged that this recommendation was supported by limited data. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that adopting a “lower is better” approach for BP is far from ideal and that the BP targets vary depending on patient characteristics.

In hypertensive patients with CAD, atherosclerotic lesions and arterial stiffness tend to be more severe, resulting in a lower DBP and increased pulse pressure. Patients who have undergone coronary revascularization seem to be more tolerant of lower DBP than those who had not, which may be partly explained by improved myocardial perfusion. When performed using the proper revascularization strategy for appropriate patients, coronary revascularization can offer survival benefits in CAD; however, there is a need for further research to define the optimal BP target and therapeutic benefit of intensive BP treatment in this population.

The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) examined the effect of intensive BP treatment (SBP target <120 mm Hg) in hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risk. Using data from the SPRINT trial, we conducted a post-hoc analysis to investigate the optimal BP in CAD populations and in a subset of CAD patients who had undergone revascularization.

Initiate additional antihypertensive medications (such as dihydropyridine CCBs, long-acting thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) as needed to optimize BP control.

BP levels in diabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease

The beneficial effects of anti-hypertensive drugs on clinical and cardiovascular outcomes are well established, and strict BP control is strongly recommended by most previous guidelines for general patients [–,]. However, this therapeutic strategy has been challenged in hypertensive patients with T2DM, especially for those with coronary artery disease.

### Treatment of hypertension in patients with coronary artery disease. A case-based summary of the 2015 AHA / ACC / ASH scientific statement [^8dfc452a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The 2015 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/American Society of Hypertension Scientific Statement "Treatment of Hypertension in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease" is summarized in the context of a clinical case. The Statement deals with target blood pressures, and the optimal agents for the treatment of hypertension in patients with stable angina, in acute coronary syndromes, and in patients with ischemic heart failure. In all cases, the recommended blood pressure target is <140/90 mm Hg, but <130/80 mm Hg may be appropriate, especially in those with a history of a previous myocardial infarction or stroke, or at high risk for developing either. These numbers may need to be revised after the publication of the SPRINT data. Appropriate management should include beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and in the case of heart failure, aldosterone antagonists. Thiazide or thiazide-like (chlorthalidone) diuretics and calcium channel blockers can be used for the management of hypertension, but the evidence for improved outcomes compared with other agents in hypertension with coronary artery disease is meager. Loop diuretics should be reserved for patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure or with a glomerular filtration rate of <30 mL/min.

### Knowledge of blood pressure levels and targets in patients with coronary artery disease in the USA [^fb99d5d5]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Little is known about patient awareness of nationally recommended blood pressure targets, especially among patients with cardiac disease. To examine this issue, we interviewed 738 patients hospitalized with coronary artery disease to assess their knowledge of their systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels as well as corresponding national targets. We used bivariate and multivariate analyses to determine if any patient demographic or clinical characteristics were associated with blood pressure knowledge. Only 66.1% of patients could recall their own systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Only 48.9% of all patients could correctly name targets for these values. Knowledge of target blood pressure levels was particularly poor among patients who were female (odds ratio (OR) 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.98), aged > or =60 years (OR 0.70, CI 0.51-0.97), without any college education (OR 0.48, CI 0.35-0.65), without a documented history of hypertension (OR 0.57, CI 0.39-0.84), and with known diabetes (OR 0.46, CI 0.33-0.66). Patients in the highest risk group, according to Joint National Committee guidelines stratification, were no more knowledgeable about their blood pressure levels and targets than lower risk patients. A significant proportion of patients hospitalized with coronary artery disease do not know their own blood pressure levels or targets. Current blood pressure education efforts appear inadequate, particularly for certain patient subgroups in which hypertension is an important modifiable risk factor.

BP management for type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease

The anti-hypertensive strategies most appropriate to type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease have been widely studied.

General considerations

It becomes increasingly important to individualize BP treatment to minimize adverse events and maximize benefits. Non-pharmacological modalities include weight loss, increased potassium-based diet, reduced total intake of sodium and fat (especially saturated fat), and regular physical activity and exercise. Although the cardiovascular benefits of lifestyle changes were not evaluated in type 2 diabetic patients, their implementation seems reasonable as these measures could favorably affect glycemia, lipid profile and BP level. Certainly, pharmacological therapy is effective to decrease mortality, prevent major adverse cardiovascular events including non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure, and slow the progression of pre-existing kidney disease in patients with T2DM. Based on available evidence, type 2 diabetic patients with persistent BP > 140/90 mmHg should be started on anti-hypertensive drug therapy. Notably, the anti-hypertensive strategy (including the choice of BP lowering agents) for type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease should be individualized according to the clinical conditions of the patients. It is important to keep in mind that the degree of BP reduction per se is the major determinant of reduction in cardiovascular risk, superseding the choice of anti-hypertensive drugs; a dictum that is valid in patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease. Monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) can attain BP target in certain type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, especially when BP is only modestly elevated. However, combination therapy is eventually required in many individuals with T2DM and coronary artery disease, and most guidelines recommend adding a calcium antagonist or diuretic to RAAS inhibitors as add-on therapy [,,,–]. The superiority of a calcium channel blocker over a thiazide as an addition to ACEI or ARB was shown in terms of reduction of cardiovascular events, renal protection and improvement in insulin resistance. In obese patients or when volume overload is present, diuretics may be used as well, and sometimes the escalation of double-drug treatment to triple-drug therapy is required to improve BP control in type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension. Fixed-dose combinations in a single pill may increase compliance compared with corresponding free-drug components given separately, as it simplifies treatment and thereby can improve adherence on the part of the patients.

### AHA releases guidelines for hypertension management in adults (...) [^328079e5]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Management of Hypertension in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes Data are lacking on the impact of anti-hypertensive treatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes, particularly non–ST-elevation MI. However, hypertension increases mortality rates in patients with acute coronary syndromes, and most patients will respond to standard methods of hypertension control. The cornerstone of hypertension management in patients with acute coronary syndromes is the modification of the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand plus anticoagulant and platelet inhibitor therapy. UNSTABLE ANGINA OR NON–ST-ELEVATION MI Treatment for hypertension in hemodynamically stable patients with unstable angina or non–ST-elevation MI should initially include a short-acting beta. 1-selective beta blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, usually administered intravenously, plus a nitrate for symptom control.

Oral beta blockers may be substituted later during hospitalization or considered in initial therapy. An ACE inhibitor or an ARB should be added if the patient has anterior MI, if hypertension persists, if there is evidence of LV dysfunction or heart failure, or if the patient has diabetes. In hemodynamically unstable patients, beta blocker therapy should be delayed until the patient is stable. Diuretics may be added for blood pressure control and management of heart failure. If beta blockers are contraindicated or cause adverse effects and there is no LV dysfunction, a nondihydropyridine CCB may be substituted. If the initial regimen does not control the angina or hypertension, a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB may be added. Aldosterone antagonists should be avoided in patients with elevated serum creatinine or potassium levels.

CCBs have not been shown to reduce mortality rates in patients with ST-elevation MI; however, a nondihydropyridine CCB may be substituted in patients without LV dysfunction if beta blockers are contraindicated or cause adverse effects. If the initial regimen does not control the angina or hypertension, a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB may be added. Management of Hypertension in Patients With Heart Failure In patients with heart failure, hypertension management should include sodium restriction and a closely monitored exercise program. Drugs that have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with heart failure generally also lower blood pressure. Patients should receive thiazide or loop diuretics, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, beta blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists.

### Does the benefit from treating to lower blood pressure targets vary with age? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^0e3bdc11]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recommendations differ regarding how blood pressure targets should vary with age. Crucial to this controversy is whether treatment benefit varies with age.

Methods

Systematic searches were conducted for trials randomizing treatment in intensive arms to the recommended SBP targets: 120-140mmHg. Head-to-head meta-analyses and meta-regression were conducted.

Results

Sixteen trials met criteria. Relative to higher targets, lower targets reduced cardiovascular events, but treatment benefit differed significantly among trials due to patient age. Treatment significantly benefited older patients (mean age 77, SD=72-81), relative risk (RR)=0.77 (0.61,0.97), P=0.025, but not younger patients (mean age 61, SD=53-70), RR=0.90 (0.78,1.03), P=0.121, even though the latter had much greater statistical power. The (RR in 80 year olds)/(RR in 55 year olds)=0.68 (0.47,0.97), P=0.036. Though statistically nonsignificant, corresponding trends for more specific outcomes favored older patients: Coronary artery disease 0.80, stroke 0.85, heart failure 0.54, and total mortality 0.76. For adverse effects this trend was 0.86 (0.33,2.26). The number needed to treat to lower targets to prevent one cardiovascular event over 10 years in eight populations declined with age by 94%+.

Conclusion

In these novel results, for both RR and absolute risk, treating to SBPs of 120-140mmHg versus higher targets benefited older patients more than younger patients without an age-related increase in the RR for adverse effects. Nonetheless, because all clinical trials excluded the most frail older patients, clinicians must consider individual patient characteristics such as frailty, autonomy, and cognitive ability when choosing blood pressure targets.

### Searching for optimal blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^878ef6f0]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical perspective

The available literature and results of recent clinical studies and meta-analyses suggest that the primary BP goal in patients with established coronary artery disease is below 140/90 mmHg. Control of BP < 130/80 mmHg but not < 120/70 mmHg is reasonable for hypertensive and type 2 diabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease, whereas for those with CTO or acute coronary syndromes, an ideal BP target may be somewhat higher (< 140/90 mmHg) as recommended by the current guidelines [,–,]. Caution is advised with aggressive lowering of diastolic BP to a critical threshold (< 60 mmHg) which may result in no benefits but rather harmful particularly for hypertensive patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease. Likewise, in type 2 diabetic patients undergoing PCI for CTO, any excessive decrease in BP (especially low diastolic BP) before restoring anterograde flow of a chronic totally occluded lesion should be avoided during the procedure, because it may compromise collateral perfusion and exacerbate ischemia in the presence of at least moderate stenosis of the PCDA. In contrast, lower BP targets might be appropriate in those patients at higher risk of stroke and other micro-vascular complications such as chronic kidney disease, but this issue requires further study.

Most previous studies concerning the BP management of type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease rely heavily on in-office BP measurement, however, ambulatory BP monitoring certainly improves baseline BP assessment and risk stratification after anti-hypertensive treatment. Recent guidelines strongly recommended the use of ambulatory BP recording for accurate diagnosis of hypertension and individualized BP target in the treatment of patients with hypertension [–,]. Notably, concurrent masked hypertension and blunt response to nocturnal hypotension are not uncommon in patients with T2DM, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. A large body of clinical evidence supports that BP lowering reduces macro- and micro-vascular complications in patients with T2DM. In future, it remains important to educate type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease for increasing their treatment compliance and guideline adherence and improving the control rate of BP goal. In addition, observational studies have demonstrated that there is often poor control of other cardiovascular risk factors in patients with T2DM. Thus, to achieve the greatest risk reduction for the incidence of cardiovascular disease, the ultimate goal of treatment should be to achieve target control of glucose, BP, and lipids.

### Potential impact of the 2017 ACC / AHA guideline on high blood pressure in normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease: insights from the CLARIFY registry [^5ddd0ae9]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Aims

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline on high blood pressure (BP) lowered the threshold defining hypertension and BP target in high-risk patients to 130/80 mmHg. Patients with coronary artery disease and systolic BP 130–139 mmHg or diastolic BP 80–89 mmHg should now receive medication to achieve this target. We aimed to investigate the relationship between BP and cardiovascular events in ‘real-life’ patients with coronary artery disease considered as having normal BP until the recent guideline.

Methods and results

Data from 5956 patients with stable coronary artery disease, no history of hypertension or heart failure, and average BP <140/90 mmHg, enrolled in the CLARIFY registry (November 2009 to June 2010), were analysed. In a multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, after a median follow-up of 5.0 years, diastolic BP 80–89 mmHg, but not systolic BP 130–139 mmHg, was associated with increased risk of the primary endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio 2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.22–3.81 vs. 70–79 mmHg and 1.12, 0.64–1.97 vs. 120–129 mmHg). No significant increase in risk for the primary endpoint was observed for systolic BP <120 mmHg or diastolic BP <70 mmHg.

Conclusion

In patients with stable coronary artery disease defined as having normal BP according to the 140/90 mmHg threshold, diastolic BP 80–89 mmHg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk, whereas systolic BP 130–139 mmHg was not, supporting the lower diastolic but not the lower systolic BP hypertension-defining threshold and treatment target in coronary artery disease.

### Aafp grading system (...) [^d668bc20]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Guideline Scope and Purpose The purpose of this guideline is to provide recommendations relevant to primary care for blood pressure treatment targets. This guideline will not discuss specific pharmacologic or other hypertension treatments. The target audience includes family physicians and other primary care clinicians. The target patient population is adults with hypertension, with or without CVD. The most common pharmacologic treatments for reducing blood pressure include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers. Selection of medications should include cost, ease of use, adverse effect profile, and comorbid conditions. Accurate measurement of blood pressure is essential to the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Ambulatory and home blood pressure measurements can be useful in diagnosis and monitoring.

Although the optimal method for blood pressure measurement remains unclear and under investigation, diagnosis requires two or more blood pressure readings on two or more occasions that meet the criteria for hypertension. The goal of treatment is to reduce morbidity and mortality while minimizing risk of harms from medical intervention. Significant debate exists as to the ideal blood pressure targets for treatment of hypertension, and clinicians and patients are faced with conflicting recommendations from different organizations. The AAFP endorsed the Eighth Joint National Committee guidelines for the management of hypertension in 2014 and reaffirmed it in 2019 as part of its five-year review process. 10 Additionally, the AAFP developed a joint guideline with the American College of Physicians in 2017 that provided evidence-based recommendations for blood pressure treatment targets in adults older than 60 years.

Moderate-quality evidence showed treating adults who have hypertension to a lower blood pressure target further reduced the risk of myocardial infarction. In the included systematic review, eight RCTs evaluated the incidence of myocardial infarction in patients treated with a lower target compared with those with a standard target. Conclusions and Future Research The purpose of this guideline is to provide clinical recommendations for primary care physicians on blood pressure goals for adult patients with and without existing CVD. The AAFP recommends primary care clinicians treat adults with hypertension to a standard blood pressure target because there was no additional benefit to reduce risk of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality or stroke compared with a lower blood pressure target.

### Searching for optimal blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^2ae0d740]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic studies have shown that hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are global public health issues and become the major cause of disease burden and mortality. The World Health Organization estimated that 40% of adults worldwide have hypertension (about 90% are classified with essential hypertension), and approximately 422 million adults were living with diabetes(more than 90% are T2DM). In addition, hypertension is present in more than half of type 2 diabetic patients and contributes significantly to macro- and micro-vascular complications. The development of T2DM is often asymptomatic and subclinical for a long period, and before diagnosis of T2DM, individuals can reside in the high-risk state of prediabetes, defined as impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Recently, the prevalence of hypertension and T2DM is increasing in many Asian countries, with a number of countries with blood pressure (BP) and glucose above the global average. The Chinese National Report of Cardiovascular Disease 2018 pointed out that the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes reaches 23.2% and 10.9%, respectively, leading to an estimate of about 290 million of adult people suffering from cardiovascular disease in China. The major goal for cardiovascular care is to prevent morbidity and mortality by controlling glucose, normalizing BP, and reducing other cardiovascular risk factors. Data frequently suggest an existence of the relationship between BP and cardiovascular risks as low as 110–115 mmHg for systolic BP and 70–75 mmHg for diastolic BP. Every 20 mmHg systolic and 10 mmHg diastolic BP increase above the threshold has shown to double the risk of mortality from ischemic heart disease and stroke. For decades, clinical practice guidelines vary in determining the optimal BP target in patients with T2DM. Whereas several guidelines recommend a BP goal of < 140/90 mmHg, some recommend a lower target of systolic and diastolic BP in certain diabetic population. The newly released American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High BP in adults supports a more aggressive diagnostic and treatment approach, recommending hypertensive patients to maintain their BP < 130/80 mmHg. Although the adoption of new guideline is expected to increase the prevalence of hypertension, endorsing the aggressive approach including lifestyle change and medical treatment would lead to reduced risk of major adverse cardiac events and improvement in overall clinical outcome. However, controversies exist regarding the optimal level of BP attained with therapeutic interventions that is safe and provides cardiovascular protection, especially in patients with T2DM and coexistent coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the class of drugs most appropriate for the treatment of hypertensive diabetics is also unclear and different guidelines emphasize use of different classes for anti-hypertensive treatment in type 2 diabetic patients. Particularly, several new glucose-lowering agents for the treatment of diabetes have been found to lower BP as well, making the interaction between BP and T2DM even more complex. In this review, we will outline the possible optimal BP levels based upon recommendations on the management of hypertension by the current guidelines, in combination with our research findings, for type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.

### Potential impact of the 2017 ACC / AHA guideline on high blood pressure in normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease: insights from the CLARIFY registry [^c86b7c5f]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline defined hypertension as a blood pressure (BP) ≥130/80 mmHg.Following that change, patients with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease, with systolic BP between 130 and 139 mmHg or diastolic BP between 80 and 89 mmHg, previously considered as non-hypertensive patients, should now receive BP-lowering treatment for their newly defined hypertension, with a target of <130/80 mmHg. In normotensive patients with coronary artery disease, treated or not with BP-lowering antianginal medication, the new target is now a BP <130/80 mmHg. This lowered threshold largely results from the reduced rate of cardiovascular events observed in the intensive arm of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) trial.However, patients in SPRINT were carefully followed-up in the setting of a randomized trial, and unattended automated BP measurements yielded values approximately 7 mmHg lower than average daytime ambulatory measurement,and expected to be approximately 15 mmHg lower than standard office BP measurement. Whether translating the results of SPRINT to real-life patients with standard office BP measurements will result in a lower cardiovascular event rate is debated. Furthermore, very few patients in SPRINT had previous coronary artery disease and were normotensive. The potential impact of the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline on high BP in real-life patients with coronary artery disease requires careful attention.

In the present post hoc analysis, we evaluated the association between BP level and cardiovascular outcomes, including cardiovascular mortality, in patients with normal BP (<140/90 mmHg) and stable coronary artery disease from the CLARIFY registry. These patients represent the epitome of high-risk patients to whom the lowered pharmacological intervention threshold in the recent ACC/AHA guideline applies. Our goal was to determine whether there is an increased risk associated with systolic and diastolic BP values higher than 130 and 80 mmHg (vs. 120–129 and 70–79 mmHg, respectively) in the individuals classified as having normal BP according to the previous guidelines.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^2e190412]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

To investigate the optimal blood pressure (BP) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), we conducted subgroup analysis using SPRINT data. The study sample included 1206 participants with CAD (of whom 692 underwent coronary revascularization) and 8127 participants without CAD. Participants were randomized into two groups (systolic BP target of 140 mm Hg vs. 120 mm Hg). The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular events. After a median follow-up of 3.9 years, the hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary outcome were 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–0.79) and 1.05 (95% CI 0.76–1.46) among those in the non-CAD and CAD subgroups, respectively (P value for interaction 0.02). Intensive BP treatment was a protective factor for all-cause death (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.96) in the CAD subgroup, compared with standard BP treatment. The HRs (95% CI) for stroke were 3.57 (1.17–10.85) and 1.03 (0.29–3.62) among those in the coronary revascularization and non-revascularization subgroups, respectively (P value for interaction 0.13). For safety events, intensive BP treatment increased the risk of hypotension (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.06–3.79) and electrolyte abnormalities (HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.25–4.56) in the CAD subgroup, while the risk of serious adverse events did not increase (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88–1.20). These results suggest that positive benefits from intensive BP treatment might be attenuated in patients with CAD who are under better secondary prevention. The risk of stroke might increase at the systolic BP target of 120 mm Hg in case of coronary revascularization, although the confidence interval was wide.

### Cardiovascular event rates and mortality according to achieved systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with stable coronary artery disease: an international cohort study [^a1b9e22f]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimum blood pressure target in hypertension remains debated, especially in coronary artery disease, given concerns for reduced myocardial perfusion if diastolic blood pressure is too low. We aimed to study the association between achieved blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension.

Methods

We analysed data from 22672 patients with stable coronary artery disease enrolled (from Nov 26, 2009, to June 30, 2010) in the CLARIFY registry (including patients from 45 countries) and treated for hypertension. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures before each event were averaged and categorised into 10 mm Hg increments. The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, using the 120-129 mm Hg systolic blood pressure and 70-79 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure subgroups as reference.

Findings

After a median follow-up of 5·0 years, increased systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more and diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or more were each associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. Systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg was also associated with increased risk for the primary outcome (adjusted HR 1·56, 95% CI 1·36-1·81). Likewise, diastolic blood pressure of less than 70 mm Hg was associated with an increase in the primary outcome (adjusted HR 1·41 [1·24-1·61] for diastolic blood pressure of 60-69 mm Hg and 2·01 [1·50-2·70] for diastolic blood pressure of less than 60 mm Hg).

Interpretation

In patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease from routine clinical practice, systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of less than 70 mm Hg were each associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including mortality, supporting the existence of a J-curve phenomenon. This finding suggests that caution should be taken in the use of blood pressure-lowering treatment in patients with coronary artery disease.

### The J-curve between blood pressure and coronary artery disease or essential hypertension: exactly how essential? [^d3401c7d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The topic of the J-curve relationship between blood pressure and coronary artery disease (CAD) has been the subject of much controversy for the past decades. An inverse relationship between diastolic pressure and adverse cardiac ischemic events (i.e., the lower the diastolic pressure the greater the risk of coronary heart disease and adverse outcomes) has been observed in numerous studies. This effect is even more pronounced in patients with underlying CAD. Indeed, a J-shaped relationship between diastolic pressure and coronary events was documented in treated patients with CAD in most large trials that scrutinized this relationship. In contrast to any other vascular bed, the coronary circulation receives its perfusion mostly during diastole; hence, an excessive decrease in diastolic pressure can significantly hamper perfusion. This adverse effect of too low a diastolic pressure on coronary heart disease leaves the practicing physician with the disturbing possibility that, in patients at risk, lowering blood pressure to levels that prevent stroke or renal disease might actually precipitate myocardial ischemia. However, these concerns should not deter physicians from pursuing a more aggressive control of hypertension, because currently blood pressure is brought to recommended target levels in only approximately one-third of patients.

Chronic coronary disease—blood pressure management recommendations: For adults with chronic coronary disease (CCD) and elevated blood pressure, nonpharmacologic strategies are a Class 1, Level A recommendation as first-line therapy for elevated BP defined as 120-129/<80 mm Hg. For adults with CCD who have hypertension, a Class 1, Level B-R recommendation targets <130/<80 mm Hg to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and all-cause death. For adults with CCD and hypertension, defined as systolic BP ≥130 and/or diastolic BP ≥80 mm Hg, in addition to nonpharmacological strategies, guideline-directed ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta blockers are recommended as first-line therapy for compelling indications such as recent MI or angina, with add-on agents including dihydropyridine CCBs, long-acting thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists as needed to optimize BP control.

### Potential impact of the 2017 ACC / AHA guideline on high blood pressure in normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease: insights from the CLARIFY registry [^3dbd09f0]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This observational study conducted in a large population of patients with coronary artery disease, no history of hypertension, and average follow-up BP <140/90 mmHg, treated according to standard care, showed that a systolic BP between 130 and 139 mmHg was not associated with an increased cardiovascular risk compared with a systolic BP between 120 and 129 mmHg. However, the risk associated with a diastolic BP between 80 and 89 mmHg was significantly greater than that of a diastolic BP between 70 and 79 mmHg. Although observational, our data do not support initiation of BP-lowering therapy (or more-intensive treatment in those receiving antianginal BP-lowering drugs) in patients newly defined as hypertensive according to the 2017 AHA/ACC guideline because of a systolic BP between 130 and 139 mmHg.

The CLARIFY registry provides a unique population of patients with stable coronary artery disease, including nearly 6000 normotensive patients, as defined from the 140/90 mmHg threshold, a third of whom were in the 130-139 mmHg range, to study the relationship between BP and cardiovascular events. Indeed, evidence supporting the new definition of hypertension and lower targets in patients with coronary artery disease is lacking. BP-intervention trials included a large majority of hypertensive patients, and very few trials until SPRINT lowered systolic BP below 130 mmHg, with overall no significant reduction in cardiovascular events except stroke below this threshold.In the Prevention of Events with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) trial,which tested trandolapril vs. placebo in patients with stable coronary artery disease and normal or slightly reduced left ventricular function (more than half of whom were normotensive), patients in the treatment arm reached a mean BP below 130 mmHg, which was not associated with a reduced rate of cardiovascular events. However, the BP difference between the two groups was only 3 mmHg. In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) and SPRINT trials, which randomized patients to an intensive (<120 mmHg) or a standard (<140 mmHg) treatment target, inclusion criteria did not mandate hypertension (only a systolic BP ≥130 mmHg). In both trials, approximately 10% of the patients did not receive BP-lowering drugs, and as some patients may have had systolic BP between 130 and 139 mmHg, only a small fraction of the populations were normotensive according to the 140/90 mmHg threshold. In addition, 33% of the ACCORD, and 17% of the SPRINT populations had a previous cardiovascular event, which leaves very few patients with normotension and coronary artery disease. Overall, even though the combined analysis of these trials favoured intensive treatment,no clear conclusion can be drawn on intensive BP-lowering in normotensive patients with coronary artery disease. Noteworthy, in SPRINT, mean age was 7 years older than in CLARIFY, and patients with diabetes or previous stroke were excluded, also limiting the comparison between these two studies. In the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) BP target trial, in which the intensive target systolic BP was <130 mmHg in patients with previous stroke, there was no significant reduction in recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, or death, but only 25% were normotensive, and 11% had previous coronary artery disease.The randomized Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE)-3 trial included a large proportion of normotensive patients (62%) and showed no benefit associated with the candesartan–hydrochlorothiazide therapy despite achieved BP below 130 mmHg in the treatment arm; however, this trial included intermediate-risk patients with no cardiovascular disease at baseline.

The optimal BP targets in hypertensive patients with CAD remain controversial as few randomized clinical trials have directly evaluated this important clinical question. There are several existing studies nested with CAD populations, but these did not examine specific SBP targets. The INternational VErapamil SR Trandolapril STudy (INVEST) conducted by Pepine et al. evaluated 22,576 hypertensive CAD patients aged 50 years or older and found the verapamil-trandolapril-based strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based strategy, suggesting that reducing SBP is a far more important clinical consideration than the choice of antihypertensive drug class. A post-hoc analysis of INVEST evaluated 8354 participants ≥60 years of age with hypertension and CAD and concluded that these patients may benefit from reducing their SBP below 140 mm Hg. Similar patterns were also observed in the PRavastatin Or atorVastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (PROVE IT-TIMI) 22 trial, which found that the lowest event rates were associated with an SBP range of 130–140 mm Hg in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The Comparison of Amlodipine vs Enalapril to Limit Occurrences of Thrombosis study conducted by Nissen et al. included 1991 CAD patients with an average baseline BP of 129/78 mm Hg and demonstrated that treatment with amlodipine resulted in reduced adverse cardiovascular events in normotensive patients with CAD. The above studies suggest that the optimal SBP level in patients with CAD is clearly lower than 140 mm Hg and perhaps in 120 mm Hg range. According to the recent findings of a network meta-analysis, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guideline updated its recommendation for an SBP target to <130 mm Hg in adults with SIHD.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^00e374db]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results indicate that CAD and coronary revascularization status influence the effect of BP treatment on clinical outcomes. Intensive BP treatment decreased the risk of major cardiovascular events in participants without CAD, but not in those with CAD. For CAD participants, intensive BP treatment is associated with a reduced risk for all-cause death but does not affect other clinical outcomes, compared with standard BP treatment. The cardiovascular benefits from intensive BP treatment were further attenuated and the risk of stroke might increase in patients with CAD and a history of coronary revascularization.

The results of this study add to the complex evidence for the interaction and association of BP control with CAD status and coronary revascularization. We found a lower risk of clinical outcomes with an SBP target of 120 mm Hg among hypertensive patients without CAD. Attar et al. performed a further analysis of SPRINT participants categorized based on the baseline 10-year Framingham risk, and their results indicated that intensive BP treatment is beneficial for primary prevention of CVD and mortality in patients with high risk (above 10%). In contrast, another clinical trial (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial, ONTARGET) found that reducing SBP below 130 mm Hg failed to reduce cardiovascular mortality and that the optimal SBP was 135–145 mm Hg in patients with high cardiovascular risk.

### Effects of lowering diastolic blood pressure to... [^34c9a8a4]. Hypertension Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The target of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remains controversial in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We systematically searched PubMed/Medline and the Cochrane Central database for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of reducing DBP in CAD patients from January 1965 to July 2017. Seven placebo-controlled RCTs enrolling 34,814 CAD patients who achieved DBP<80mmHg were included in the drug-intervention group. The average achieved blood pressures (BPs) were 126.3/75.1 and 131.5/77.8mmHg in the drug-intervention and placebo-control groups, respectively. Drug intervention was associated with an 11% reduction in coronary revascularization and a 31% reduction in heart failure. In the drug-intervention group, all-cause death, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and stroke were reduced with marginal significance, whereas hypotension was increased by 123%. A meta-analysis of four RCTs, in which the achieved DBP was<75mmHg, showed that the drug intervention was associated with a 22% reduction in heart failure. These results suggest that reducing DBP to 80mmHg or less would significantly reduce coronary revascularization and heart failure but at the expense of causing hypotension in CAD patients. Further trials are warranted to prove this issue.

Clinical Implications and Future Direction

Despite the recommendations of the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guidelines looking at the totality of evidence including the present paper by White et al, it is hard to recommend an across‐the‐board BP goal of <130/80 mm Hg for all patients with DM and hypertension. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 It seems evident that there is heterogeneity of the effects of intensive BP‐lowering on coronary versus cerebral events, and the effects can also vary based on the presence or absence of comorbid conditions in a given individual (such as those with recent acute coronary syndrome as described in the present study by White et al. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 The available evidence from RCTs suggest that in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease, specifically coronary heart disease, it is prudent not to lower SBP ≤130 mm Hg; however, for those at higher risk of stroke (such as black and Asian patients) who do not have preexisting coronary heart disease, it may be beneficial to reduce SBP <120 mm Hg if this can be done without any harm. Overall, it seems reasonable that a BP target of <140/90 mm Hg as recommended in several recent guidelines will be safe and effective in reducing the risk of coronary events in patients with DM and hypertension. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10 Lower BP targets might be appropriate in those at higher risk of stroke and other microvascular complications such as chronic kidney disease. As suggested by White et al and in view of the ongoing controversy regarding optimal BP level in high‐risk patients with DM and CAD, prospective RCTs are needed to examine and demonstrate appropriate target BP that can be safely attained and beneficial.

### AHA / ACC / ASH release guideline on the treatment of hypertension (...) [^c2393aa3]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice • A blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in most patients with CAD and hypertension. • A target of 130/80 mm Hg is reasonable in selected patients with CAD, including those with previous MI, stroke, or CAD risk equivalents. • Recommended medications for patients with hypertension and chronic stable angina include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics. • Medications with evidence that they reduce risks in patients with ACS include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and possibly aldosterone antagonists. From the AFP Editors The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and American Society of Hypertension have released a guideline on the management of hypertension in patients with coronary artery disease. It updates a previous AHA guideline to reflect newer data.

There is a strong association between hypertension and CAD. This guideline uses the best available evidence to make recommendations about blood pressure reduction and the management of CAD and its varying manifestations. Recommendations BLOOD PRESSURE GOALS In patients with CAD and hypertension, a blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg is reasonable for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. A lower target of 130/80 mm Hg may be acceptable in some of these patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack, or CAD risk equivalents. MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN PATIENTS WITH CAD AND STABLE ANGINA The management of symptomatic CAD, particularly angina pectoris, focuses on relieving the angina and preventing the progression of CAD and development of coronary events.

The recommended pharmacologic regimen for patients with hypertension and chronic stable angina includes beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics. If there are no contraindications to beta blockers, the initial therapy for hypertension in patients with ACS should be an oral short-acting beta.

### Potential impact of the 2017 ACC / AHA guideline on high blood pressure in normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease: insights from the CLARIFY registry [^fb0bbac4]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The higher risk observed for diastolic BP of 80–89 mmHg compared with 70–79 mmHg is in line with meta-analyses of more- vs. less-intensive BP-lowering trials, even those conducted before SPRINT. However, no such trial with a mean achieved BP in both groups across the 80 mmHg threshold was conducted in patients with coronary artery disease. In a recent post hoc analysis from the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) and Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in ACE iNtolerant participants with cardiovascular Disease TRANSCEND patients with achieved systolic BP between 120 and 139 mmHg, a diastolic BP of 80–89 mmHg compared with 70–79 mmHg, was associated with a higher risk for stroke and hospitalization for heart failure.

Although there are observational data on optimal BP targets in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease,, no observational study was conducted specifically in normotensive patients with coronary artery disease. However, in the post hoc analysis of the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial,which included 10 001 patients with coronary artery disease, 46% of whom were normotensive at baseline, the relationship between systolic or diastolic BP and a composite endpoint of cardiovascular events showed a J-curve, with nadir values of 146 and 81 mmHg, respectively. There was no interaction with hypertension, suggesting similar results in normotensive patients. These results concur with the present observations, showing a benefit of BP reduction down to a threshold lower than the standard 90 mmHg for diastolic BP but not lower than the 140 mmHg threshold for systolic BP.

The rationale for more-intensive treatment in high-risk patients is the greater absolute risk reduction as baseline cardiovascular risk increases.Patients with established coronary artery disease are clearly one such high-risk group. However, the benefits of more-intensive BP control have not been consistently observed in patients with coronary artery disease,potentially because low BP—particularly low diastolic BP—may also be deleterious in this population, as described in several observational studies.

Blood Pressure

High blood pressure (BP) is an important risk factor for CHD and an even stronger risk factor for stroke. It also is associated with the development of AF, heart failure (HF), left ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure, and dementia. – Results from meta‐analyses with >61 million adults show that each 20‐mm Hg increase in SBP or 10‐mm Hg increase in diastolic BP doubles the risk of a fatal coronary event.

New BP recommendations (not sponsored by any national organization) were recently published from the group appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8).

The new recommendations (Figure) are largely similar to the JNC 7 guidelines with 2 important changes. First, they liberalize the systolic treatment goal from <140 to <150 mm Hg for patients aged ≥60 years; however, the panel did not recommend reducing pharmacological treatment to allow for increased BP in older patients that are tolerant of a SBP <150 mm Hg. Considerable controversy has followed this change, and a group of committee members on the JNC 8 panel published a dissenting review of the age‐specific SBP treatment goal,citing substantial CV benefit from SBP <140 mm Hg based on observational data and no new evidence since publication of the JNC 7 guidelines to suggest significant harm from treating to SBP <140 mm Hg. In addition, BP treatment guidelines from other major international organizations have recommended either a universal treatment goal of <140 over <90 mm Hg or a change in the target SBP target to <150 mm Hg for patients aged ≥80 years. – These treatment goals represent reasonable alternatives to the JNC 8 guideline committee recommendations. Currently, a large randomized controlled trial is ongoing and is randomizing >9000 patients to either standard or intensive BP control and assessing the first occurrence of MI, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, HF, or CVD death.

Chronic coronary disease—blood pressure targets and outcomes: Among patients with increased cardiovascular risk, reducing systolic blood pressure to <130 mm Hg has been shown to reduce CVD complications by 25% and all-cause death by 27%, and optimal diastolic BP for clinical outcomes appears to be 70 to 80 mm Hg. In the HOPE trial, ramipril therapy in patients with CVD or at high risk for CVD reduced the risk of MI, stroke, or CVD by 22% compared with placebo.

### Applying the evidence: do patients with stroke, coronary artery disease, or both achieve similar treatment goals? [^c184c1e8]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The importance of early and aggressive initiation of secondary prevention strategies for patients with both coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is emphasized by multiple guidelines. However, limited information is available on cardiovascular protection and stroke prevention in an outpatient setting from community-based populations. We sought to evaluate and compare differences in treatment patterns and the attainment of current guideline-recommended targets in unselected high-risk ambulatory patients with CAD, CVD, or both.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, cohort study was conducted from December 2001 to December 2004 among ambulatory patients in a primary care setting. The prospective Vascular Protection and Guidelines-Oriented Approach to Lipid-Lowering Registries recruited 4933 outpatients with established CAD, CVD, or both. All patients had a complete fasting lipid profile measured within 6 months before enrollment. The primary outcome measure was the achievement of blood pressure (BP) <140/90 mm Hg (or <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes) and LDL cholesterol <2.5 mmol/L (<97 mg/dL) according to the Canadian guidelines in place at that time (similar to the National Cholesterol Education Program's value of 100 mg/dL). Secondary outcomes include use of antithrombotic, antihypertensive, and lipid-modifying therapies.

Results

Of the 4933 patients, 3817 (77%) had CAD only; 647 (13%) had CVD only; and 469 (10%) had both CAD and CVD. Mean+/-SD age was 67+/-10 years, and 3466 (71%) were male. Mean systolic and diastolic BPs were 130+/-16 and 75+/-9 mm Hg, respectively. Minor but significant differences were observed on baseline BP, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol measurements among the 3 groups. Overall, 83% of patients were taking a statin and 93% were receiving antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents). Compared with patients with CAD, those with CVD only were less likely to achieve the recommended BP (45.3% vs 57.3%, respectively; P<0.001) and lipid (19.4% vs 30.5%, respectively; P<0.001) targets. Among patients with CVD only, women were less likely to achieve the recommended BP and lipid targets compared with their male counterparts (for LDL cholesterol <2.5 mmol/L, 18.7% vs 23.8%, respectively; P=0.048). In multivariable analysis, patients with CVD alone were less likely to achieve treatment success (BP or lipid targets) after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, and use of pharmacologic therapy.

Conclusions

Despite the proven benefits of available antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies, current management of hypertension and dyslipidemia continues to be suboptimal. A considerable proportion of patients failed to achieve guideline-recommended targets, and this apparent treatment gap was more pronounced among patients with CVD and women. Quality improvement strategies should target these patient subgroups.

Reflections

Although differences in guidelines are invariably highlighted, it is notable that the core advice in the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines is remarkably similar in most important areas of practice (Table 9). Even for the area of greatest difference, the definition of hypertension, there is still considerable overlap. In both guidelines, adults with an average SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg are designated as having hypertension and treatment with a combination of lifestyle counseling and antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended. Those with an average SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg are designated as having stage 1 hypertension in the ACC/AHA and high normal BP in the ESC/ESH. However, both guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for most adults in this BP category, the addition of antihypertensive drugs only being recommended for the ≈30% of US adults with CVD or a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥10% in the ACC/AHA guideline and only to be considered in very-high-risk patients, especially those with coronary artery disease, in the ESC/ESH CPG. For many other treatment differences, the 2 guidelines provide overall advice that is similar but sometimes discrepant in the specifics. For example, both guidelines recommend combination antihypertensive drug therapy but the specific application for this advice is somewhat different. The ESC/ESH places great emphasis on single-pill combination drug therapy, whereas the ACC/AHA encourages single-pill combinations when possible but notes that many of the combination pills available in the United States use hydrochlorothiazide rather than chlorthalidone and often use a diuretic dose that is lower than what has been used in the landmark treatment trials. Likewise, both guidelines recommend a lower BP target during treatment compared with what was advised in previous guidelines, including in older adults. Overall, the difference lies in the ESC/ESH taking a more stepped approach, first recommending achievement of an SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg before targeting a lower BP, if tolerated, and identifying SBP 120 mm Hg and DBP 70 mm Hg as the lower safety boundary for BP reduction in adults 18 to 65 years of age (130 mm Hg in those with CKD). The ACC/AHA recommends a single SBP/DBP target of <130/80 mm Hg in most adults but SBP <130 mm Hg in older well adults, if tolerated.

### 2014 eighth Joint National Committee panel recommendation for blood pressure targets revisited: results from the INVEST study [^f0547c99]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee panel recommendations for management of high blood pressure (BP) recommend a systolic BP threshold for initiation of drug therapy and a therapeutic target of <150 mm Hg in those ≥60 years of age, a departure from prior recommendations of <140 mm Hg. However, it is not known whether this is an optimal choice, especially for the large population with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate optimal BP in patients ≥60 years of age.

Methods

Patients 60 years of age or older with CAD and baseline systolic BP >150 mm Hg randomized to a treatment strategy on the basis of either atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide or verapamil-SR (sustained release)/trandolapril in INVEST (INternational VErapamil SR Trandolapril STudy) were categorized into 3 groups on the basis of achieved on-treatment systolic BP: group 1, <140 mm Hg; group 2, 140 to <150 mm Hg; and group 3, ≥150 mm Hg. Primary outcome was first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, total MI, nonfatal MI, total stroke, nonfatal stroke, heart failure, or revascularization, tabulated separately. Outcomes for each group were compared in unadjusted and multiple propensity score-adjusted models.

Results

Among 8,354 patients included in this analysis with an accumulated 22,308 patient-years of follow-up, 4,787 (57%) achieved systolic BP of <140 mm Hg (group 1), 1,747 (21%) achieved systolic BP of 140 to <150 mm Hg (group 2), and 1,820 (22%) achieved systolic BP of ≥150 mm Hg (group 3). In unadjusted models, group 1 had the lowest rates of the primary outcome (9.36% vs. 12.71% vs. 21.32%; p < 0.0001), all-cause mortality (7.92% vs. 10.07% vs. 16.81%; p < 0.0001), cardiovascular mortality (3.26% vs. 4.58% vs. 7.80%; p < 0.0001), MI (1.07% vs. 1.03% vs. 2.91%; p < 0.0001), total stroke (1.19% vs. 2.63% vs. 3.85%; p <0.0001), and nonfatal stroke (0.86% vs 1.89% vs 2.86%; p<0.0001) compared with groups 2 and 3, respectively. In multiple propensity score-adjusted models, compared with the reference group of <140 mm Hg (group 1), the risk of cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01 to 1.77; p = 0.04), total stroke (adjusted HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.82; p = 0.002) and nonfatal stroke (adjusted HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.06 to 2.72; p = 0.03) was increased in the group with BP of 140 to <150 mm Hg, whereas the risk of primary outcome, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, total MI, nonfatal MI, total stroke, and nonfatal stroke was increased in the group with BP ≥150 mm Hg.

Conclusions

In hypertensive patients with CAD who are ≥60 years of age, achieving a BP target of 140 to <150 mm Hg as recommended by the JNC-8 panel was associated with less benefit than the previously recommended target of <140 mm Hg.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^ef23a77b]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

We analyzed the baseline characteristics of participants with and without CAD or coronary revascularization. We observed that traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including heart rate, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and use of aspirin and statins, were better controlled in participants who had CAD or had undergone coronary revascularization than in those who had not. In light of this, we postulate that the benefits of further intensive BP treatment might have been diluted in this population due to existing well-executed secondary prevention. It is, however, undeniable that the relatively limited subject number reduced the power of the study.

Several limitations of the present study should be noted. First, it was based on a post-hoc analysis of data obtained from a randomized controlled trial. The number of participants with CAD was relatively small, which may reduce the power of our statistical analysis. Second, the SPRINT study population excluded patients with a history of diabetes mellitus or stroke; thus, our study conclusions may not apply to other subsets of patients. Third, BP measurements in an unattended office are not an alternative to home BP measurements, given the low correlation and wide range of differences between the two groups. Therefore, these results should be carefully interpreted and further validated through future studies.

In conclusion, the present study suggested that patients without CAD whose SBP is around 120 mm Hg have greater benefits for clinical outcomes, while this benefits might be attenuated in patients with CAD who are under better secondary prevention. The risk of stroke was increased by intensive BP treatment in patients with a history of coronary revascularization, though the confidence interval was wide. These findings may serve to inform current clinical practice and future trial design.

Summary

What is known about the topic

The prevalence of hypertension in individuals with pre-existing CAD ranges from 30 to 70%.
Uncontrolled BP increased mortality in patients with CAD.
Recent practice guidelines recommend a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg in individuals with SIHD.

What this study adds

The optimal SBP level in hypertensive patients without CAD and diabetes mellitus is around 120 mm Hg.
In non-diabetic hypertensive patients with CAD who are under better secondary prevention, the benefit from intensive BP treatment might be attenuated.
The risk of stroke is increased by an SBP target of 120 mm Hg in patients with a history of coronary revascularization, though the confidence interval was wide.

### Blood pressure targets in the treatment of high blood pressure: a reappraisal of the J-shaped phenomenon [^d8c9d606]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

The risk that lowering blood pressure (BP) excessively increases the incidence of cardiovascular disease-the J-shaped phenomenon-has been a matter of concern endorsed by many experts, particularly in patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes. The results of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Type 2 Diabetes (ACCORD) trial strengthened the idea that it may be futile to lower BP more intensively in patients with diabetes. Nevertheless, there seems to be no direct J-shaped relation between BP-lowering treatment and outcome. Patients with normal or low BP and high or very high cardiovascular risk could have their BP reduced further by treatment. Placebo-controlled clinical trials of BP-lowering agents in patients with BP within normal values and concomitant cardiovascular disease demonstrated consistent reduction of recurrent and newer cardiovascular events. The use of BP agents in such conditions, as in patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes and in patients recovered from a stroke has been endorsed by guidelines. Although is likely that there is a J-shaped relationship of BP with outcomes in cohort studies, clinical trials that tested more intensive versus standard goals and clinical trials done with patients with low BP demonstrated that the J-shaped phenomenon should not be a concern in the treatment of high BP.

### Effect of intensive structured care on individual blood pressure targets in primary care: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^b849c60c]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although the absolute difference in change in blood pressure between the groups might be considered modest, they not only contributed to more people achieving the primary endpoint in the intervention group but also favourably altered both the absolute risk of future cardiovascular events (a clinically meaningful 1% difference in mean scores between groups) and the relative risk reduction of future coronary artery disease (−6% difference in mean risk) and strokes (−11% difference) in favour of the intervention (data not shown). The expected trade-off between more intense blood pressure control and an increase in adverse events occurred, with more participants in the intervention group withdrawn on this basis (1.1% v 0.2%) or requiring active change to their treatment (7.9% v 1.9%). This needs to be carefully considered against the overall difference (8.8% in favour of the intervention group) in the primary endpoint. Overall, the number and frequency of adverse events was consistent with the nature and size of the patient cohort and the drugs being prescribed. Whereas there seems to be a gradient in blood pressure control according to the amount of drug treatment (with greater control achieved in those assigned to immediate combination therapy at randomisation), spending additional clinical time (>1 hour over six months) with participants probably also contributed. Such a conclusion is consistent with previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses,and the patient centred approach advocated by contemporary guidelines.This observation is further strengthened by the initial response to the run-in phase of the study where information on non-drug measures was provided with only low dose monotherapy (19% blood pressure control) and substantial anecdotal evidence from participants who appreciated the “beyond pharmacological” approach to their management.

### Searching for optimal blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^4652c41f]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Systolic BP

Data from several landmark trials and meta-analyses demonstrate benefit of decreased systolic BP with intensive BP control in reducing the risk of ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke for patients with T2DM and hypertension. Recently, the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) reported that for non-diabetic patients with increased cardiovascular risk, intensive BP control (target systolic BP < 120 mmHg) was associated with 25% lower rate of primary composite outcome after 3.26 years of follow-up compared with standard BP goal (target systolic BP < 140 mmHg). However, these beneficial effects of intensive BP lowering seen in non-diabetic patients have not been demonstrated in patients with T2DM [,–]. In fact, the results of prospective ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) trial showed no differences in composite outcome of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke between intensive and standard BP control. An observational analysis of the INVEST (International Verapamil SR-Trandolapril) study revealed that all-cause mortality was increased in diabetic patients with systolic BP < 115 mmHg. A subgroup analysis of the INVEST study involving 6400 patients who were at least 50 years old and had diabetes and coexistent coronary artery disease showed that tight control of systolic BP was not associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes compared with usual BP control. In an international, prospective, longitudinal registry including 22,672 patients with stable coronary artery disease and treated for hypertension, systolic and diastolic BP before each event were averaged and categorized into 10 mmHg increments. After a median follow-up of 5 years, systolic BP > 140 mmHg or < 120 mmHg was correlated with increased risks of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Recently, Bohm et al. reported the results of the secondary analyses of ONTARGET (Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and TRANSCEND (Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE Intolerant Subjects with CV Disease). These trials aimed to assess the risk in patients with and without diabetes over the whole spectrum of achieved systolic and diastolic BP. The results have shown that mean achieved in-trial systolic BP < 120 mmHg was associated with 1.53-fold increased risk for combined outcome in patients with diabetes. The overall findings thereby underscore the need for caution when aggressive lowering BP therapy is applied, and further question the concept of ‘lower BP is better’ for hypertensive patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease.

### Blood pressure trajectories and associations with treatment intensification, medication adherence, and outcomes among newly diagnosed coronary artery disease patients [^1d783a92]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Blood pressure (BP) control among coronary artery disease patients remains suboptimal in clinical practice, potentially due to gaps in treatment intensification and medication adherence. However, longitudinal studies evaluating these relationships and outcomes are limited.

Methods and Results

We assessed BP trajectories among health maintenance organization patients with hypertension and incident coronary artery disease. BP trajectories were modeled over the year after coronary artery disease diagnosis, stratified by target BP goal. Treatment intensification (increase in BP therapies in the setting of an elevated BP), medication adherence (percentage of days covered with BP therapies), and outcomes (all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) were evaluated in multivariable models: 9569 patients had a <140/90 mm Hg BP target and 12,861 had a <130/80 mm Hg BP target. Within each group, 4 trajectories were identified: good, borderline, improved, and poor control. After adjustment, increasing BP treatment intensity was significantly associated with better BP trajectories in both groups. Medication adherence had inconsistent effects. There were no significant differences in combined outcomes by BP trajectory, but among the diabetes and renal disease cohort, borderline control patients were less likely to have myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.93), and good control patients were less likely to have myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.84) or a revascularization procedure (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.93) compared with poor control patients.

Conclusions

In this health maintenance organization population, treatment intensification but not medication adherence significantly affects BP trajectories in the year after coronary artery disease diagnosis. Better BP trajectories are associated with lower rates of myocardial infarction and revascularization.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^0f072e9f]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source and study population

Data were collected from the SPRINT study, which is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored trial. SPRINT was a randomized, controlled, multicenter open-label trial that evaluated the effects of standard (SBP target <140 mm Hg) versus intensive (SBP target <120 mm Hg) BP treatment among 9361 adults with hypertension (SBP of 130–180 mm Hg). Patients with diabetes mellitus, prior stroke, congestive heart failure, and advanced chronic kidney disease were excluded. In this study, patients diagnosed with CAD by a physician were randomized to either a standard or intensive group. Patients were followed up monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter until 5 years or closeout. Coronary revascularization was defined by self-report of a history of percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. The detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in the SPRINT study.

Interventions and measurements

BP measurements were taken with the participants in a seated position using the same automatic device in an unattended office. The mean of three measurements was included in the analysis. During a median follow-up of 3.9 years, BP-lowering medications were adjusted to an SBP target of 135–139 mm Hg in the standard group and to less than 120 mm Hg in the intensive group.

Clinical outcomes and safety events

Composite events of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular death were defined as the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included all-cause death and the various elements of the composite primary outcome.

In this study, the following conditions were recorded as safety events: hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormality, injurious fall, acute kidney injury, and bradycardia. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as fatal events that first caused significant dysfunction and required medical intervention or hospitalization.

### Prevalence, predictors, and outcomes in treatment-resistant hypertension in patients with coronary disease [^80b417a6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Increasingly, apparent treatment-resistant hypertension has been recognized. However, much of the prevalence, predictors, and outcomes are largely unknown, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.

Methods

We evaluated 10,001 patients with coronary artery disease who were enrolled in the Treating to New Targets trial. Apparent treatment-resistant hypertension was defined as blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg despite 3 antihypertensive agents or <140 mm Hg with ≥ 4 antihypertensive agents. The primary outcome was major cardiovascular events (composite of fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and stroke).

Results

Among the 10,001 patients in the trial, 1112 (11.1%) had apparent treatment-resistant hypertension. In a multivariable model adjusting for baseline differences, the treatment-resistant hypertension group had a 64% increase in primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.94; P < .001), driven by a 69% increase in coronary heart disease death (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.22, 2.34; P = .001) and 73% increase in nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.39-2.16, P < .0001) when compared with the no apparent treatment-resistant hypertension group. In addition, patients with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension had a 71% increase in major coronary event (P < .0001), 45% increase in death (P = .001), 33% increase in heart failure (P = .05), 53% increase in any cardiovascular event (P < .0001), 60% increase in any coronary event (P < .0001), 68% increase in angina (P < .0001), and 51% increase in coronary revascularization (P < .0001) when compared with the no apparent treatment-resistant hypertension group. Results were largely similar whether the definition of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension was based on a blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg despite 3 agents or a blood pressure <140 mm Hg with ≥ 4 agents.

Conclusions

In patients with coronary artery disease, apparent treatment-resistant hypertension is associated with a marked increase in the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including an increase in all-cause death.

### What should be the target blood pressure in elderly patients with diabetes? [^b55cc296]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension is very common in elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes. The coexistence of hypertension and diabetes can be devastating to the cardiovascular system, and in these patients, tight blood pressure (BP) control is particularly beneficial. Little information is available regarding the target BP levels in elderly hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, and therefore extrapolation from data in the general population should be done. However, it is difficult to extrapolate from the general population to these frail individuals, who usually have isolated systolic hypertension, comorbidities, organ damage, cardiovascular disease, and renal failure and have a high rate of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension. On the basis of the available evidence, we provide arguments supporting the individualized approach in these patients. Target BP should be based on concomitant diseases, orthostatic BP changes, and the general condition of the patients. It is recommended to lower BP in the elderly patient with diabetes to <140-150/90 mmHg, providing the patient is in good condition. In patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the same target is reasonable providing the diastolic BP is >60 mmHg. In patients with coronary artery disease and in patients with orthostatic hypotension, excessive BP lowering should be avoided. In elderly hypertensive patients with diabetes, BP levels should be monitored closely in the sitting and the standing position, and the treatment should be tailored to prevent excessive fall in BP.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^c202a50b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^c033aabc]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Because coronary perfusion occurs mainly during diastole, DBP has gradually become the focus of attention in hypertensive patients with CAD. A secondary analysis using data obtained from the INVEST observed a J-shaped association between BP and cardiovascular events, in which the J-curve was relatively more prominent in diastole than in systole. Moreover, the authors found that patients who had coronary revascularization seemed to have the potential to tolerate the lower DBP, compared with those who had not. The current BP management guideline recommends a target DBP of <80 mm Hg in patients with SIHD. In addition, the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial suggested a DBP < 70 mm Hg may be dangerous in patients with high-risk unstable angina. Furthermore, the Treating to New Targets Trial revealed that a low DBP of less than 60–70 mm Hg was accompanied by an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with CAD. Similar findings were observed in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Therefore, DBP should be considered during hypertension treatment. Unlike the secondary analysis of the previous studies, our results showed that a DBP around 65 mm Hg in patients with CAD was still safe and did not increase CVD events.

In addition, we found that participants with a history of coronary revascularization had lower DBP regardless of antihypertensive treatment, compared to those without such a history. The most probable explanation is that individuals with revascularization have worse atherosclerotic lesions and poorer arterial elasticity. The loss of arterial elasticity results in a decline in DBP and impairment of the auto-regulatory process of coronary circulation. Although revascularization opens culprit vessels and restores blood flow to ischemic areas, such a procedure per se cannot prevent atherosclerotic progression. On the one hand, it is not recommended to achieve an SBP target of 120 mm Hg in CAD patients with coronary revascularization, as our results suggest that this may increase the risk of stroke. On the other hand, excessive diastolic hypotension may have attenuated the benefits from intensive SBP treatment. Further research is required to evaluate the minimum DBP target that has no effect on myocardial perfusion while ensuring adequate reduction in SBP in CAD patients with coronary revascularization.

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^4e58d579]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Study cohort and population characteristics

Of the 9361 participants in the SPRINT study, there were 1206 participants with CAD (of whom 692 underwent coronary revascularization) and 8127 participants without CAD at baseline (Supplementary Fig. 1). There were significant differences in baseline characteristics between participants with and without CAD (Supplementary Table 1). The baseline characteristics of participants with and without coronary revascularization are shown in Supplementary Table 2.

The baseline characteristics of participants with CAD were comparable (P > 0.05) between the standard and intensive groups (Table 1). At baseline, the mean BP was 136.9 ± 16.2/73.6 ± 12.0 mm Hg in the standard group and 138.6 ± 15.5/74.7 ± 12.1 mm Hg in the intensive group. In both groups, the mean BP levels were controlled to within the target range (133.7 ± 3.0/71.0 ± 1.4 mm Hg vs. 120.9 ± 2.5/64.6 ± 1.6 mm Hg) during follow-up. The mean number of BP-lowering medications in the standard and intensive groups was 2.1 and 3.0, respectively (Fig. 1). The BP-lowering medications of different groups are summarized in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.

Chronic coronary disease—nonpharmacologic blood pressure management details expected systolic blood pressure (SBP) reductions with specific doses. A healthy diet using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) pattern reduces SBP by −11 mm Hg in hypertension and −3 mm Hg in normotension. Dynamic resistance exercise prescribed as 90–150 min/wk at 50%–80% of 1 repetition maximum with 6 exercises, 3 sets/exercise, 10 repetitions/set lowers SBP by −4 mm Hg in hypertension and −2 mm Hg in normotension. Isometric resistance training using 4×2 min (hand grip) with 1 min rest between exercises at 30%–40% maximum voluntary contraction, 3 sessions/wk for 8–10 wk reduces SBP by −5 mm Hg and −4 mm Hg, respectively. Moderation in alcohol intake for individuals who drink alcohol—Men: ≤2 drinks daily; Women: ≤1 drink daily—is associated with SBP reductions of −4 mm Hg in hypertension and −3 mm Hg in normotension.

### Medical management of stable coronary artery disease-AAFP (...) [^14e606cb]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Therapy Statins limit the synthesis of cholesterol and increase the catabolism of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. There is substantial evidence that statins can benefit patients with CAD, as shown in. 8, 9 The National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III recommends using statins to achieve LDL levels of less than 100 mg per dL in patients with CAD. 2 The American College of Cardiology recommends that patients with CAD have a target LDL measurement of less than 100 mg per dL, and for those at very high risk, a goal of less than 70 mg per dL or treatment with intensive statin therapy should be considered. 3, 8.

16 Antihypertensive Agents The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends lowering blood pressure to 140/90 mm Hg or less for patients with CAD; however, the American Heart Association recommends a goal of 130/80 mm Hg or less, just as for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. 19 The reduction should be limited to a minimum diastolic pressure of 55 mm Hg. 17 Besides reducing blood pressure, antihypertensive drugs improve mortality in patients following MI and can relieve anginal symptoms. Antihypertensive treatment works by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand, lowering left ventricular ejection fraction, and preventing left ventricular hypertrophy. 17, 18.

BETA BLOCKERS Beta blockers are first-line antihypertensive agents for patients with CAD 20; if tolerated, beta blockers are also indicated for patients who do not have hypertension. These drugs block and β 1 and β 2 adrenergic receptors, causing a decrease in heart rate, an increase in diastolic filling time, and a decrease in cardiac contractility. ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be used in patients with CAD following MI, those who have diabetes, or those with left ventricular dysfunction. They also should be considered a treatment for hypertension in all other patients with CAD once beta-blocker therapy has been established.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^5e3ad0b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2019: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensives to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. Other issues such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined were also considered to downgrade the quality evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 2 studies, 690 participants; very low-quality evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.90 mmHg, 95% CI -13.24 to -4.56; 6 studies, 8546 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.24; 6 studies, 8588 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Impact of the 2014 expert panel recommendations for management of high blood pressure on contemporary cardiovascular practice: insights from the NCDR PINNACLE registry [^a5e1904f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Since 2003, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC-7) has been the predominant guideline for blood pressure management. A 2014 expert panel recommended increasing the blood pressure targets for patients age 60 years and older, as well as those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the 2014 expert panel blood pressure management recommendations on patients managed in U.S. ambulatory cardiovascular practices.

Methods

Using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry PINNACLE Registry, we assessed the proportion of patients who met the 2003 and 2014 panel recommendations, highlighting the populations of patients for whom the blood pressure goals changed.

Results

Of 1,185,253 patients in the study cohort, 706,859 (59.6%) achieved the 2003 JNC-7 goals. Using the 2014 recommendations, 880,378 (74.3%) patients were at goal. Among the 173,519 (14.6%) for whom goal achievement changed, 40,323 (23.2%) had a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, and 112,174 (64.6%) had coronary artery disease. In addition, the average Framingham risk score in this group was 8.5 ± 3.2%, and the 10-year ASCVD risk score was 28.0 ± 19.5%.

Conclusions

Among U.S. ambulatory cardiology patients with hypertension, nearly 1 in 7 who did not meet JNC-7 recommendations would now meet the 2014 treatment goals. If the new recommendations are implemented in clinical practice, blood pressure target achievement and cardiovascular events will need careful monitoring, because many patients for whom the target blood pressure is now more permissive are at high cardiovascular risk.

KDIGO 2021—very low baseline DBP: In people with very low baseline diastolic BP (e.g., <50 mm Hg), particularly with coronary artery disease, intensive BP lowering could theoretically increase myocardial infarction risk because coronary perfusion depends on DBP; nevertheless, in SPRINT the lowest-DBP subgroup had similar CV and survival benefits from intensive SBP reduction as those with higher baseline DBP.

### Blood pressure and outcomes in very old hypertensive coronary artery disease patients: an INVEST substudy [^18b8b466]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Our understanding of the growing population of very old patients (aged >or=80 years) with coronary artery disease and hypertension is limited, particularly the relationship between blood pressure and adverse outcomes.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of the INternational VErapamil SR-Trandolapril STudy (INVEST), which involved 22,576 clinically stable hypertensive coronary artery disease patients aged >or=50 years. The patients were grouped by age in 10-year increments (aged >or=80, n=2180; 70-<80, n=6126; 60-<70, n=7602; <60, n=6668). Patients were randomized to either verapamil SR- or atenolol-based treatment strategies, and primary outcome was first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

Results

At baseline, increasing age was associated with higher systolic blood pressure, lower diastolic blood pressure, and wider pulse pressure (P <.001). Treatment decreased systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure for each age group. However, the very old retained the widest pulse pressure and the highest proportion (23.6%) with primary outcome. The adjusted hazard ratio for primary outcomes showed a J-shaped relationship among each age group with on-treatment systolic and diastolic pressures. The systolic pressure at the hazard ratio nadir increased with increasing age, highest for the very old (140 mm Hg). However, diastolic pressure at the hazard ratio nadir was only somewhat lower for the very old (70 mm Hg). Results were independent of treatment strategy.

Conclusion

Optimal management of hypertension in very old coronary artery disease patients may involve targeting specific systolic and diastolic blood pressures that are higher and somewhat lower, respectively, compared with other age groups.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^76604b0e]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

In the GDG recommended guidelines (Figure 3), the evidence base for recommendation on target BP consisted of systematic reviews as well as a review of relevant trials. – In patients with comorbidity (CAD, DM, CKD), there is consistent benefit with lower targets (variable thresholds); however, data in these subgroups were imprecise and the evidence was less certain. Therefore, the GDG cautions against applying this evidence to lower-risk patients with raised BP or hypertension. Adverse events such as dizziness in intensive control group and ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease can shift the balance of benefits and harms in older individuals (those aged 65 years or older). Concern about lower adherence due to the need for extra patient and provider effort to reach lower targets should also be balanced against intensive control. The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be moderate, with large benefits and moderate harms. The GDG made a judgement that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects at a treatment goal of <140/90 mm Hg in all patients with hypertension without comorbidities and SBP <130 mm Hg in high-risk patients with hypertension—those with high CVD risk, diabetes, and CKD. More evidence is required about treatment of those in the SBP 130 to 139 range who fall into one or more of the following subgroups: diabetes, CKD, heart failure, 65 years or older.

CVD risk assessment strategy for those without existing CVD can be based on age, sex, body mass index, BP, previous antihypertensive treatment, smoking, diabetes, and history of CVD.

Most patients with an average SBP ≥140 or DBP ≥90 mm Hg are at high risk for CVD and initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy is indicated. Although helpful, cardiovascular (CVD) risk assessment is not mandatory before initiating antihypertensive drug treatment. CVD risk assessment is most important for guiding decisions about initiating pharmacological treatment for hypertension in those with a lower average SBP (130–139 mm Hg). In all adults with hypertension, it is important that other risk factors for CVD be identified and treated appropriately to lower total cardiovascular risk. Many CVD risk-assessment instruments are available. In the absence of a calibrated equation for the local population, the choice should depend on the resources available, and the acceptability and feasibility of the available CVD risk predicting tools. Whenever CVD risk assessment may impede the timely initiation of hypertension treatment and/or patient follow-up, it should be postponed and included as a follow-up strategy.

### The ongoing saga of optimal blood pressure level in patients with diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease [^73be1b90]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Although it is well established that increased blood pressure (BP) is a major contributor to the increased risk of cardiovascular events in diabetes mellitus (DM), there is still ongoing controversy regarding the optimal level of BP attained with therapeutic interventions that is safe and provides cardiovascular protection, especially in patients with DM and coexistent coronary artery disease (CAD). 1, 2 The article in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) provides yet more evidence for the wealth of data already available in showing that intensive reduction of BP to levels <130/80 mm Hg as recommended by the recent 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Hypertension Guidelines might indeed not be safe in diabetic patients with coexistent CAD. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 In the present study by White et al, the investigators have performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the optimal level of BP in patients with DM and recent acute coronary syndrome enrolled in the EXAMINE (Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care trials) trial. The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate the appropriate target BP in these high‐risk patients with DM and CAD, given the recent recommendations of the 2017 ACC/AHA BP Guidelines for the target BP <130/80 mm Hg in patients with DM. These investigators examined the relationship between the clinician‐measured BP values and risks of major adverse cardiac events and heart failure using the BP values of 131 to 140 mm Hg for systolic and 81 to 90 mm Hg for diastolic as a referent as recommended by the 2015 ACC/AHA/ASH (American Society of Hypertension) Guidelines and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2017 guidelines. 3, 4, 5 The results revealed a U‐shaped relationship between cardiovascular outcomes and BP values. Specifically, the findings demonstrated that the risk of major adverse cardiac events and cardiovascular death or heart failure were higher for both systolic BP <130 mm Hg as well as diastolic BP <80 mm Hg. 3 These findings described by White et al raise concern about the appropriateness of the BP goal of <130/80 mm Hg across the board for all patients with DM as recommended by the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. 4 It is important to note that the 2017 Guidelines recommendations for BP control in DM are in contrast to several other national and international guidelines, which recommend a BP target of <140/90 mm Hg for diabetic patients and suggest considering BP goal of <130/80 mm Hg in selected high‐risk patients when it can be achieved without any harm. 5, 6, 10 We might then question as to what evidence or data compelled the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines to recommend the goal of <130/80 mm Hg. Although there does not appear to be any specific overwhelming evidence in support of this recommendation, it has been stated that it is based on evaluation of the prediabetes cohort in the SPRINT database (diabetics were excluded) as well as the findings from some of the recent meta‐analyses. 11, 12 It is crucial to keep in mind that these analyses did not specify patient characteristics and might not have included diabetic patients with CAD who are likely to be adversely affected by excessive lowering of BP. Furthermore, the recommendations made by the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines are clearly in contrast to the findings available from previous large prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that have specifically examined the BP target of <130/80 mm Hg in diabetics and high risk patients with CAD/cardiovascular disease. 13, 14 These studies including the results from the ACCORD (Action to Control Risk of Diabetes) study revealed that there was no significant demonstrable benefit of lowering BP values to <130/80 mm Hg for overall risk reduction in major adverse cardiac events (although ACCORD results did show reduction in nonfatal stroke rates with intensive BP reductions). 13, 14 The findings described in the present study by White et al lend further support to the findings of previous studies and further demonstrate the potential for harm with aggressive BP‐lowering therapy specifically in patients with DM and recent acute coronary syndrome. 3 Their findings also emphasize the adverse consequences of intensive BP reduction in high‐risk patients with DM and CAD reported in the recent analyses of the data from the INVEST (The International Verapamil‐Trandolapril Study), CLARIFY (Prospective Observational Longitudinal Registry of Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease), as well as the ONTARGET (Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and TRANSCEND (Telmisartan Randomised Assessment Study in ACE Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease) studies. 7, 8, 9 All of these studies showed that systolic BP of <120 mm Hg and diastolic BP <70 mm Hg were associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes except for reduced risk of stroke in those achieving lower BP values. 7, 8, 9

### Intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^732449c0]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The effect of intensive blood pressure (BP) reduction on the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes remains unclear. This study evaluated the impact of intensive BP-lowering on cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes compared to standard treatment. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted, comparing intensive treatment (target systolic BP<130mmHg or diastolic BP<80mmHg) with standard treatment in patients with diabetes. Eligible studies were identified through Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Ichushi. Outcomes included cardiovascular events, coronary artery disease, stroke, all-cause and cardiovascular death, and serious adverse events. Data were analyzed using a random-effects model. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effects of systolic and diastolic BP targets separately. The search identified eight eligible trials comprising 16634 patients with diabetes. Intensive BP-lowering treatment significantly reduced cardiovascular events (risk ratio: 0.848; 95% confidence interval: 0.760, 0.947) and stroke (risk ratio: 0.705; 95% confidence interval: 0.541, 0.918), but not coronary artery disease or all-cause death in analyses including J-DOIT3 trial. Sensitivity analyses showed that DBP-targeted treatment was not associated with the risk of cardiovascular events. Incorporating the latest RCT strengthened the association between intensive treatment and reduced coronary artery disease risk, without significantly increasing the risk of serious adverse events. These findings recommend an intensive BP-lowering strategy targeting SBP<130mmHg or DBP<80mmHg to prevent cardiovascular events, particularly stroke, in patients with diabetes.

### INVEST: results of combined strategies to control blood pressure [^adeef3cd]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension continues to be challenging due to the lack of understanding regarding underlying modulators of blood pressure as well as co-existing conditions such as atherosclerosis and diabetes. This has led to uncertainty regarding treatment strategy and intensity. The INternational VErapamil SR/trandolapril STudy (INVEST) is designed to evaluate the relationship between cardiovascular risk and blood pressure modulators. Based on a review of preliminary data, it appears that the treatment regimen used in the INVEST trial has been more successful than other studies at controlling systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse pressure. These preliminary data from INVEST suggest that a high proportion of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with hypertension should receive combination therapy to achieve contemporary blood pressure targets.

### Tight blood pressure control and cardiovascular outcomes among hypertensive patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease [^e57a899a]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Hypertension guidelines advocate treating systolic blood pressure (BP) to less than 130 mm Hg for patients with diabetes mellitus; however, data are lacking for the growing population who also have coronary artery disease (CAD).

Objective

To determine the association of systolic BP control achieved and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in a cohort of patients with diabetes and CAD.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Observational subgroup analysis of 6400 of the 22,576 participants in the International Verapamil SR-Trandolapril Study (INVEST). For this analysis, participants were at least 50 years old and had diabetes and CAD. Participants were recruited between September 1997 and December 2000 from 862 sites in 14 countries and were followed up through March 2003 with an extended follow-up through August 2008 through the National Death Index for US participants.

Intervention

Patients received first-line treatment of either a calcium antagonist or beta-blocker followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a diuretic, or both to achieve systolic BP of less than 130 and diastolic BP of less than 85 mm Hg. Patients were categorized as having tight control if they could maintain their systolic BP at less than 130 mm Hg; usual control if it ranged from 130 mm Hg to less than 140 mm Hg; and uncontrolled if it was 140 mm Hg or higher.

Main Outcome Measures

Adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including the primary outcomes which was the first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

Results

During 16,893 patient-years of follow-up, 286 patients (12.7%) who maintained tight control, 249 (12.6%) who had usual control, and 431 (19.8%) who had uncontrolled systolic BP experienced a primary outcome event. Patients in the usual-control group had a cardiovascular event rate of 12.6% vs a 19.8% event rate for those in the uncontrolled group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-1.71; P < .001). However, little difference existed between those with usual control and those with tight control. Their respective event rates were 12.6% vs 12.7% (adjusted HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.93-1.32; P = .24). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.0% in the tight-control group vs 10.2% in the usual-control group (adjusted HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.99-1.45; P = .06); however, when extended follow-up was included, risk of all-cause mortality was 22.8% in the tight control vs 21.8% in the usual control group (adjusted HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32; P = .04).

Conclusion

Tight control of systolic BP among patients with diabetes and CAD was not associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes compared with usual control.

### Searching for optimal blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^341a458c]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diastolic BP

Since physiological coronary blood flow predominantly occurs during diastole, diastolic BP would be expected to have greater clinical relevance. The INVEST study showed that cardiovascular risk was reduced for type 2 diabetic patients with a diastolic BP < 90 mmHg but was increased for those with a diastolic BP < 70 mmHg. Similarly, the results of the secondary analyses of ONTARGET and TRANSCEND trials also showed that a diastolic BP < 70 mmHg was associated with increased risk for the combined outcome in diabetic and non-diabetic patients, and also for all other endpoints except stroke. These data suggest that cardiovascular risk may be defined by diastolic BP levels, despite optimally achieved systolic BP. In patients with hypertension, the Framingham Heart Study also showed that the same cutoff point of diastolic BP was associated with increased cardiovascular events. Furthermore, the risk was increased among those with both low diastolic BP and a wide pulse pressure.

The importance of optimal diastolic BP levels in determining clinical outcomes for patients with coronary artery disease was further substantiated by several recent studies. Peri-Okonny et al. assessed the relationship between reduced diastolic BP and occurrence of angina in a cohort of 1259 patients with stable coronary artery disease (more than one-third of them had diabetes). In the unadjusted model, diastolic BP was associated with angina with a J-shaped relationship (p for nonlinearity = 0.027), with a progressive increase in odds of angina as diastolic BP below 70–80 mmHg. Patients with a diastolic BP of 60 mmHg had 1.37-fold increased risk of angina compared with those having a diastolic BP of 80 mmHg. This association remained significant after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, heart rate, systolic BP, and anti-angina and anti-hypertensive medications.

### Relation between blood pressure and vascular events and mortality in patients with manifest vascular disease: J-curve revisited [^0e30c672]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Recent studies have challenged the notion that "lower is better" for blood pressure in relation to vascular events and mortality in patients with vascular disease, whereas practice guidelines currently recommend to lower blood pressure to <130/80 mm Hg. We reassessed this J-curved relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with various manifestations of vascular disease. For this purpose, 5788 patients with symptomatic vascular disease enrolled in the Secondary Manifestations of Arterial Disease Study were followed-up for the occurrence of new vascular events (ie, myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death) and all-cause mortality. During a median of 5.0 years (interquartile range: 2.6-8.1 years), 788 patients experienced a new vascular event, and 779 died. Overall, the covariate-adjusted relationship between mean baseline systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure and the occurrence of vascular events followed a J-curve with increased event rates above and below the nadir blood pressure of 143/82 mm Hg. A similar nonlinear relationship was found for diastolic pressure and all-cause mortality. Elevated blood pressure was not associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with recently diagnosed coronary artery disease, ≥65 years, and having >60 mm Hg pulse pressure. Importantly, especially in these subgroups, low blood pressure could also be a symptom rather than a cause of disease. Blood pressure level below and above 143/82 mm Hg is, thus, an independent risk factor for recurrent events in patients with manifest vascular disease. Uncertainty of whether this association is causal provides a strong rationale for trials evaluating blood pressure treatment targets.

### Coronary artery calcium to guide a personalized risk-based approach to initiation and intensification of antihypertensive therapy [^a6aeac75]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The use of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk to personalize systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment goals is a topic of increasing interest. Therefore, we studied whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) can further guide the allocation of anti-hypertensive treatment intensity.

Methods

We included 3733 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with SBP between 120 and 179 mmHg. Within subgroups categorized by both SBP (120-139 mmHg, 140-159 mmHg, and 160-179 mmHg) and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk (using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocation pooled-cohort equations), we compared multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the composite outcome of incident ASCVD or heart failure after further stratifying by CAC (0, 1-100, or >100). We estimated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for an intensive SBP goal of 120 mmHg by applying the treatment benefit recorded in meta-analyses to event rates within CAC strata.

Results

The mean age was 65 years, and 642 composite events took place over a median of 10.2 years. In persons with SBP <160 mmHg, CAC stratified risk for events. For example, among those with an ASCVD risk of <15% and who had an SBP of either 120 to 139 mmHg or 140 to 159 mmHg, respectively, we found increasing hazard ratios for events with CAC 1 to 100 (1.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.6] or 2.0 [1.1-3.8]) and CAC >100 (3.0 [1.8-5.0] or 5.7 [2.9-11.0]), all relative to CAC=0. There appeared to be no statistical association between CAC and events when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg, irrespective of ASCVD risk level. Estimated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for a SBP goal of 120mmHg varied substantially according to CAC levels when predicted ASCVD risk <15% and SBP <160mmHg (eg, 10-year number-needed-to-treat of 99 for CAC=0 and 24 for CAC>100, when SBP 120-139mmHg). However, few participants with ASCVD risk <5% had elevated CAC. Furthermore, 10-year number-needed-to-treat estimates were consistently low and varied less among CAC strata when SBP was 160 to 179 mmHg or when ASCVD risk was ≥15% at any SBP level.

Conclusions

Combined CAC imaging and assessment of global ASCVD risk has the potential to guide personalized SBP goals (eg, choosing a traditional goal of 140 or a more intensive goal of 120 mmHg), particularly among adults with an estimated ASCVD risk of 5% to 15% and prehypertension or mild hypertension.

Subgroup analysis by CAD status

After a median follow-up of 3.9 years (interquartile range 3.4–4.4 years), primary composite events were documented in 150 participants with CAD (70 in the standard group and 80 in the intensive group) (Table 2). Intensive BP treatment was associated with a lower risk of all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–0.96) and a trend for an increased risk of stroke (adjusted HR 2.08, 95% CI 0.94–4.58), compared with standard BP treatment (Fig. 2 A, B). The primary outcome, as well as most secondary outcomes, were similar in the two groups (Table 2, Fig. 2C). The landmark analysis showed that the HRs for the primary outcome were 1.10 (95% CI 0.79–1.54) and 0.57 (95% CI 0.18–1.79) within and after the first 3.4 years, respectively (Fig. 2D).

### Intensive blood pressure treatment in coronary artery disease: implications from the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) [^c638fd9b]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Standard descriptive statistics were applied to baseline characteristics of CAD status and coronary revascularization status. Further, we compared the baseline characteristics by BP treatment arms among patients with CAD.

We calculated mean SBP and DBP every 3 months and the mean number of BP-lowering medications every 6 months using all values from the two BP treatment groups during follow-up. These results were summarized in a line graph. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were plotted, and clinical outcomes and safety event rates were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for covariates, including demographic characteristics (age and gender), health habits (smoking status), and health condition (body mass index; levels of fasting plasma glucose, lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides; estimated glomerular filtration rate; and use of BP-lowering medications). In addition, we conducted landmark analysis to compare primary outcomes between groups. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was used to assess the effects of CAD status and coronary revascularization status on BP treatment strategies, and these data were presented in a forest plot. All tests were two-sided, and the significance level was set at P < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software, version 25 (Chicago, IL, USA) and R 3.6.3.

### Myocardial perfusion pressure in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease: implications for DBP targets in hypertension management [^25ee40fe]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The target blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) has been controversial. Whether patients with both diabetes mellitus and CAD should follow targets for either diabetes mellitus or CAD is uncertain. Focusing only on one determinant of coronary blood flow (CBF) - myocardial perfusion pressure (MPP) - coronary BP in patients with hypertension was used to estimate the impact of setting BP targets.

Methods

A consecutive series of 101 patients referred for coronary angiography for stable angina pectoris or possible CAD had BP measurements proximal and distal to coronary artery stenosis. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) was measured from adenosine-induced maximal hyperemia. DBP after the coronary stenosis was the MPP. The most severe coronary lesion for each person was selected.

Results

Of 101 patients, 65.0±10.6 years (mean±SD), there were 69 with hypertension and 33 with diabetes mellitus of whom 25 had diabetes mellitus along with hypertension. In hypertension, FFR was 0.83±0.08, range from 0.49 to 0.97, with 40% having FFR less than 0.8. There was a significant linear relationship between systemic DBP and MPP. CBF approximates zero with MMP of 50 mmHg under resting conditions and 40 mmHg with coronary vasodilatation. On the basis of our findings in hypertension, if DBP were 80, 70, 65 and 60 mmHg, 1.4, 7.1, 15.7 and 54.3%, respectively, of patients would have an MPP of less than 50 mmHg. The values were similar for patients with diabetes mellitus.

Conclusion

In our patient group with moderate coronary artery stenosis, a target DBP of 60 mmHg or less would be associated with unacceptably low MPPs. In patients with diabetes mellitus, the presence and severity of CAD stenosis may be more important factor in setting BP targets for treatment of hypertension. Because the degree of coronary stenosis is unknown in most patients with hypertension and CAD, guideline recommendations should consider cautioning clinicians about the potential for myocardial ischaemia at low DBP.

### Proceedings from the 3rd European clinical consensus conference for clinical trials in device-based hypertension therapies [^ecf68d60]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Who should be investigated in device-based hypertension trials?

The primary guiding rule when selecting the appropriate patient population for each specific device/technology is that the procedural risk must not exceed the underlying risk of the untreated condition for each individual patient. This is particularly relevant since a class effect likely does not exist with device therapies for hypertension, and each much be considered on their individual risks. As priority candidates for further clinical trials, this group considered targeting high-risk hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, and other comorbidities, followed by studies in patients with masked hypertension or white-coat hypertension. For everyday clinical care, patients with difficult-to-control hypertension remain at the greatest need for device-based hypertension therapies, particularly in the setting of widespread non-adherence with drug therapy; whereas a second priority in daily care may be to provide access for high-risk patients, as well as those with mild-to-moderate hypertension in presence of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) or severe comorbidities.

### Serious adverse events in patients with target-oriented blood pressure management: a systematic review [^625ed7be]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Worldwide, arterial hypertension affects about 1.39 billion people. The diagnosis of high blood pressure is often delayed, due to its typically asymptomatic course. Arterial hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor of death in men, and the second most common in women. Untreated hypertension increases the risk of ischemic, coronary and hypertensive heart diseases; ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke; and chronic kidney disease. The risk of a cardiovascular event with systolic hypertension is highly correlated with age. The prevalence rises with increasing age, up to 60–70% among individuals over 60 years old.

Antihypertensive therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. However, a relevant issue in hypertension treatment is the difficulty in determining the degree of blood pressure lowering. Extensive meta-analyses have suggested that ‘the lower [the blood pressure], the better’. Large-scale trials that investigated the efficacy of lowering blood pressure showed that risk could be reduced by up to 22% for coronary heart disease and 40% for stroke, with a 10-mmHg reduction in blood pressure. However, defining the optimal blood pressure target range is challenging, because the effect on risk follows a ‘J-shaped curve’, wherein more harm than benefit is incurred at very low blood pressure levels.

In 2017, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommended that the target blood pressure should be below 130/80 mmHg, except in patients who require secondary stroke prevention and patients with low cardiovascular risk; in the latter cases, a target level of less than 140/90 mmHg was advised. Lower blood pressure targets require an extensive therapy regime, and the risk of adverse events increases. Adverse events can be a direct effect of the antihypertensive agent (e.g. angioedema, cough, rash) or a consequence of low blood pressure (e.g. hypotension, syncope). Antihypertensive treatment in the older population is particularly challenging, due to comorbidity, frailty, polypharmacy and cognitive impairments. In this population, a single serious adverse event, such as a syncope, could have major consequences; thus, a very strict blood pressure-regime might not be adequate, and higher blood pressure levels can be tolerated. Few meta-analyses have focused on the frequencies of adverse events at different blood pressure targets.

In this review, we analysed results from randomized studies to assess the frequencies of various serious adverse events associated with blood pressure target-level oriented therapies.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^ad0feaf0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of the review published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2018: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included more than 50 participants per group and provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg).Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data.We found no change in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; low-quality evidence). Studies reported more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower target group by 8.9/4.5 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group, but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of a difference in total mortality, serious adverse events, or total cardiovascular events between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on adverse events, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to examine this topic.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^12762716]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

BP grade classifications and definitions did not change between the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guideline and updated 2023 ESH guideline. As a result, significant differences in BP classification and definition of hypertension between guidelines remain, with ACC/AHA using “stages” and ESH using “grades” for BP categorization (Figure 1). ESH defines hypertension as BP ≥140/90 mm Hg, while ACC/AHA uses a threshold of ≥130/80 mm Hg. ESH classifies systolic BP between 130 and 139 mm Hg or diastolic ranges between 85 and 89 mm Hg as “high-normal” BP, while ACC/AHA guideline defines this as “stage 1” hypertension.

Recommendations on BP treatment targets also differ. For most patients, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends treating to a BP target of <130/80 mm Hg. The ESH, on the other hand, recommends tailoring treatment based on age, clinical comorbidities, and patient-specific tolerance. For adults between ages 18 and 64 years, the ESH guideline recommends a BP target <130/80 mm Hg, similar to what is recommended by the ACC/AHA guideline. However, the ESH guideline recommends higher targets for older patients. For adults aged 65 to 79 years, ESH recommends targeting BP <140/80 mm Hg, but notes that if tolerated by the patient, a target of <130/80 mm Hg should be used. The threshold for very old patients (≥80 years old) is even higher, targeting SBP between 140 and 150 mmHg. For special populations including hypertensive patients with CKD, the ESH guideline recommends treatment to a higher BP target of <140/90 mm Hg compared to the recommended ACC/AHA BP target of <130/80 mm Hg. For other comorbidities including diabetes, CAD, cerebrovascular disease, both guidelines recommend the same BP target of <130/80 mm Hg. While significant differences still exist between the guidelines, for high-risk patients and individuals between ages 18 and 79 years old, there is consensus to achieve BP goal <130/80 mm Hg.

### Implications of new hypertension guidelines in the United States [^b8107e36]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association Task Force released a scientific statement in 2007 for the treatment of hypertension in the prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). These guidelines recommend more aggressive control of blood pressure (BP) among those at high risk for CAD: individuals with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, or a 10-year Framingham risk score ≥10%. These individuals are advised to maintain a BP <130/80 mm Hg. We estimated the burden of uncontrolled BP among those at an increased risk of CAD using the updated task force guidelines. We used a cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2008 participants. Participants were 24 989 adults aged 18 to 85 years. Using the old definition of hypertension (>140/90 mm Hg), 98 million (21%) Americans have hypertension. Using the updated guidelines, an additional 52 million (11%) American adults now have elevated BP requiring treatment, for a total of 150 million adults (32%). Adults with diabetes mellitus have the greatest population burden of uncontrolled BP (50.6 million), followed by adults with chronic kidney disease (43.7 million) and cardiovascular disease (43.3 million). Although individuals at a higher risk for CAD are more likely to be aware of their hypertension and to be taking antihypertension medication, they are less likely to have their BP under control. Additional efforts are needed in the treatment of elevated BP, especially among individuals with an increased risk of CAD.

### Weight-dependent and weight-independent effects of dulaglutide on blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes [^a2f52d16]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is highly prevalent and is reported in about three-fourths of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The role of elevated BP in both macrovascular and microvascular complications is well-established in patients with T2D and is recognized as a common and robust predisposing risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Importantly, relatively small reductions in the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) (2–5 mmHg) are sufficient to reduce cardiovascular events and death in a population (Fig. 1). In a meta-analysis of recent blood pressure trials, the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration reported that a 5-mmHg reduction in SBP lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by 10%, and the benefit was independent of the baseline presence of cardiovascular disease. In a large meta-regression analysis of patients with diabetes, the risk of stroke decreased by 13% for each 5-mmHg reduction in SBP and by 11.5% for each 2-mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Similarly, results from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed that among patients with mean SBP ranging from 159–160 mmHg, a 10-mmHg reduction in SBP decreased diabetes-related mortality by 15% and all-cause mortality by 12%.

Adapted from Whelton PK, et al.

The current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association multi-society guideline recommends individualized BP treatment targets for patients with T2D based on cardiovascular risk, with a goal of < 130/80 mmHg; individualized targets should account for patient tolerance of the BP level. However, up to half of patients do not achieve these goals. Since small reductions in BP occur with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) treatment, it has been proposed that these reductions in BP and the specific mechanisms contributing to BP reduction with GLP-1 RAs may be relevant to decreases in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) observed with GLP-1 RA treatment. The specific mechanisms contributing to BP reduction with GLP-1 RAs are unknown, but improvement in arterial stiffness is a probable mechanism.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9795 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Five RCTs provided individual patient data for 6775 participants.We found no change in total mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, no differences were found in serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low-quality evidence). There was a reduction in fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization or death from congestive heart failure) with the lower target (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98; ARR 1.6% over 3.7 years; low-quality evidence). There were more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower' target group by 9.5/4.9 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence of a difference in total mortality and serious adverse events was found between treating to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target in people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This suggests no net health benefit from a lower systolic blood pressure target despite the small absolute reduction in total cardiovascular serious adverse events. There was very limited evidence on adverse events, which lead to high uncertainty. At present there is insufficient evidence to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to answer this question.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^784259f9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic coronary disease (CCD) with hypertension—treatment targets and drug classes: “Reducing SBP to <130 mm Hg can lower cardiovascular risk and mortality in adults with CCD and hypertension.” When SBP is already below this threshold, “when SBP is <130 mm Hg, a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is associated with reduced cardiovascular events without an increase in serious adverse events.” Regarding therapies, “ACEi, ARB, and BB have been shown to reduce CVD events and all-cause death in adults with CCD and hypertension,” though “Conflicting evidence exists regarding the long-term use of BB therapy (>1 year).” If further agents are required, “If additional antihypertensive medications are needed to achieve BP control, CCBs, thiazide-type diuretics, and/or MRA are recommended.”

### Characteristics of patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension: a report from INVEST [^d3a1a58b]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

In all, 22,599 patients with coexisting hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) from around the world are enrolled in the INternational VErapamil SR/trandolapril STudy (INVEST). As a result, much will be learned regarding the use of treatment strategies using verapamil SR and atenolol with and without trandolapril and/or hydrochlororthiazide in patients with hypertension and CAD, all of whom are at high risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This trial will provide meaningful data on optimal treatment strategies for hypertension, especially among patients who are elderly, have diabetes, have left ventricular hypertrophy, or who are dyslipidemic. This trial will be the first to use Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) guidelines as blood pressure goals to determine the relative benefits of a calcium antagonist versus a beta-blocker strategy in reducing morbidity and mortality. In addition, women and Hispanic patients participating in INVEST will provide the largest controlled experience in the management of hypertensive patients with CAD, facilitating the development of future guidelines.
