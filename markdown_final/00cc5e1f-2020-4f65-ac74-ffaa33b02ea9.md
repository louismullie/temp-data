## Question

Can BiPAP be used to treat sleep apnea?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether BiPAP can be used to treat sleep apnea and under what circumstances it is appropriate to do so. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what BiPAP is and how it differs from CPAP, APAP, and ASV. Then, I should distinguish obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) from central sleep apnea (CSA) because the role of BiPAP differs by phenotype. Next, I will review guideline positions for OSA and when BiPAP is reasonable after CPAP/APAP. After that, I should examine the guidance for CSA, including where BiPAP-ST fits and where ASV is contraindicated. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and conclude with safety and adherence considerations, anchoring the analysis to AASM and ERS guidelines and supportive evidence where available.

> Let me first confirm definitions to avoid confusion. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP, or BPAP) delivers two pressure levels — an inspiratory PAP (IPAP) and a lower expiratory PAP (EPAP) — unlike CPAP, which uses a single fixed pressure, and APAP, which auto-adjusts pressure; BiPAP devices may also offer a backup rate in "spontaneous/timed" modes that can provide ventilatory support for central events, whereas adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) is a different modality tailored to suppress central instability with algorithmic ventilatory support.

> Hold on, let me verify the phenotypes impacted here because the indication hinges on pathophysiology. OSA results from recurrent upper airway collapse with continued respiratory effort, whereas CSA reflects absent or reduced respiratory effort from ventilatory control instability; these mechanisms imply that pressure "splinting" is foundational in OSA, while ventilatory support and control stabilization are central in CSA management strategies.

> Next, I should review the first-line recommendations for OSA before considering exceptions. The AASM 2019 guideline recommends CPAP or autotitrating PAP (APAP) as routine first-line therapy for adult OSA and, importantly, prefers these over bilevel PAP for uncomplicated cases, reflecting equivalent efficacy with greater simplicity and lower cost in most patients [^113V56sM] [^116REiLS].

> But wait, what if CPAP is not tolerated or very high pressures are required? I need to check where BiPAP can be considered in OSA. BiPAP is reasonable in patients with CPAP pressure intolerance, difficulty exhaling against higher pressures, or those requiring very high therapeutic pressures, where BiPAP can improve comfort and sometimes usage; small trials and programmatic interventions demonstrate improved adherence in selected CPAP-intolerant populations when switched to bilevel, although effects are modest and not universal [^116vcifY] [^1169EDMc] [^1136Jcp8].

> I should double-check the broader evidence base before overstating benefit. Systematic reviews comparing pressure-modification strategies have not shown a consistent adherence advantage for bilevel in unselected patients, suggesting that routine substitution of BiPAP for CPAP does not improve usage and should be reserved for specific intolerance phenotypes after optimizing mask fit, humidification, and education first [^114akdr4] [^112wjFe3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, perioperative contexts sometimes get cited as indications; let me verify the evidence there. After bariatric surgery, expert recommendations support continuing CPAP or bilevel PAP in patients with known OSA for 3–6 months postoperatively with reassessment, whereas isolated observational reports suggesting omission of postoperative CPAP/BiPAP are low-credibility and should not override guideline-directed practice in at-risk patients; so my earlier thought that routine omission might be acceptable needs to be corrected toward continuing PAP with monitoring in established OSA unless contraindicated by surgical specifics [^115epns3] [^115bFZGM].

> Now, I will examine the CSA pathway, as this is where the role of bilevel can be quite different. For CSA related to heart failure, the AASM 2012 guideline suggests considering bilevel PAP in spontaneous/timed mode targeted to normalize AHI only after adequate trials of CPAP, ASV, and supplemental oxygen have failed, which operationally places BiPAP-ST as a third- or fourth-line option in this phenotype [^111qG3vy].

> Hold on, I should verify how ASV safety interacts with this, because it influences the sequence. ASV reduces central events but is contraindicated in patients with heart failure and LVEF ≤ 45% due to increased mortality observed in SERVE-HF, leading to recommendations against ASV in HFrEF and reinforcing careful selection of modality; CPAP should also not be continued long term in CSA if it fails to suppress central events, which underscores the need to reassess efficacy objectively [^112pZxHW] [^115bXti9] [^117TZw56].

> Let me think about idiopathic and other CSA contexts to avoid overgeneralizing. Guidelines emphasize CPAP or ASV as primary approaches depending on comorbidity, with bilevel mentioned only in selected circumstances; for idiopathic CSA, positive airway pressure may be considered, but bilevel is not prioritized, reinforcing that BiPAP's role in CSA is limited and typically reserved for scenarios where first-line strategies are ineffective or unsuitable after thorough titration and follow-up [^116mpZSg] [^111NoXZk] [^112SSJbU].

> I should confirm practical steps that come before switching to BiPAP in OSA, since many intolerance issues are modifiable. Education, behavioral support, mask/interface optimization, and humidification improve CPAP use and should be systematically addressed; contemporary guidelines also support initial APAP to facilitate usage in newly diagnosed OSA, and structured adherence interventions can increase nightly hours before escalating device complexity [^112uhZM3] [^113x7oZY] [^11342PPu].

> Putting this together, I will now synthesize a decision framework and sanity-check it against the evidence. For uncomplicated OSA, start with CPAP or APAP; if persistent pressure intolerance remains despite optimization and adherence support, consider BiPAP for comfort or where very high pressures are needed, acknowledging that randomized evidence for superior adherence is inconsistent and benefits appear concentrated in selected subgroups; for CSA, reserve BiPAP-ST for heart-failure–related CSA only after unsuccessful trials of CPAP, ASV where not contraindicated, and oxygen, with explicit avoidance of ASV in HFrEF with LVEF ≤ 45% and discontinuation of PAP modalities that fail to suppress central events on objective data [^113V56sM] [^116vcifY] [^111qG3vy] [^115bXti9] [^117TZw56].

> In conclusion, yes — BiPAP can be used to treat sleep apnea, but I need to emphasize that in OSA it is not first-line and is best reserved for CPAP/APAP intolerance or high-pressure needs after optimization, whereas in CSA its role is narrowly defined and generally last in sequence after guideline-preferred modalities have been tried or are contraindicated; careful titration, safety screening, and objective adherence monitoring should guide these transitions to ensure net clinical benefit [^116REiLS] [^114akdr4] [^111qG3vy].

Yes, BiPAP can be used for sleep apnea, but it is not first-line for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [^113V56sM]. CPAP or APAP is preferred [^116REiLS] for routine OSA care. BiPAP is appropriate when CPAP is intolerable due to high pressures [^1136Jcp8], in OSA with hypoventilation (e.g. obesity hypoventilation, COPD overlap) [^117KY1ZU], or for complex or mixed sleep apnea with central events. BiPAP may improve comfort and adherence [^116vcifY] in selected patients, but it requires careful titration and monitoring [^113HZ1Kr] to avoid complications such as aerophagia, mask leaks, or central apneas.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the **American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)** [^113V56sM] and the **American College of Physicians (ACP)** provide clear guidance on BiPAP use in sleep apnea:

- **First-line therapy**: CPAP or APAP [^113V56sM] is recommended as the initial treatment for OSA [^116REiLS].

- **BiPAP indications**: BiPAP is recommended [^1136Jcp8] for patients who cannot tolerate CPAP due to high pressure requirements, discomfort, or exhalation difficulties.

- **Complex sleep apnea**: BiPAP is indicated for patients with complex sleep apnea syndrome (CSAS), characterized by the emergence of central apneas during CPAP therapy.

- **Hypoventilation syndromes**: BiPAP is recommended for patients with OSA complicated by hypoventilation syndromes, such as obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome [^117KY1ZU].

---

## Clinical scenarios where BiPAP is preferred

BiPAP is particularly beneficial in the following **clinical scenarios**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for BiPAP** |
|-|-|
| CPAP intolerance | - High pressure requirements <br/> - Discomfort <br/> - Exhalation difficulties [^116vcifY] |
| Complex sleep apnea syndrome (CSAS) | Emergence of central apneas during CPAP therapy |
| Hypoventilation syndromes | - Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) <br/> - COPD overlap syndrome |
| Central sleep apnea (CSA) | - Idiopathic CSA <br/> - CSA related to congestive heart failure (CHF) |

## Effectiveness of BiPAP compared to CPAP

BiPAP is effective for managing sleep apnea, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate CPAP or who have specific clinical conditions [^117KY1ZU]. However, **CPAP remains the gold standard** [^116REiLS] for most patients with OSA due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and widespread availability. Patient comfort and adherence may improve with BiPAP compared with CPAP, especially in patients with **high pressure requirements** or **exhalation difficulties** [^116vcifY]. Clinical outcomes include **reductions in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)**, **improved oxygen saturation**, and **decreased daytime sleepiness** in patients with OSA and CSA.

---

## Potential risks and complications

While BiPAP is generally safe, potential risks and complications include:

- **Mask discomfort and leaks**: Improper mask fit can cause discomfort and air leaks, reducing therapy effectiveness [^113HZ1Kr].

- **Aerophagia**: Swallowing air can cause bloating and discomfort [^117KY1ZU].

- **Central apneas**: In some cases, BiPAP may induce central apneas, particularly in patients with underlying central sleep apnea [^113qDyMv].

- **Pressure-related complications**: High pressures may cause nasal congestion, dryness, or sinus discomfort [^115PNqZp].

---

## Patient adherence and comfort

Patient adherence and comfort are **critical** [^11342PPu] to the success of BiPAP therapy. BiPAP may improve adherence [^116vcifY] compared with CPAP in patients who experience discomfort or difficulty exhaling against continuous pressure. However, adherence remains a challenge, and patient education [^112uhZM3], mask fitting, and regular follow-up are essential to optimize outcomes [^116YkDgW].

---

## Conclusion

BiPAP is an effective therapy for sleep apnea [^117KY1ZU], especially for patients who cannot tolerate CPAP or who have conditions such as complex sleep apnea syndrome or hypoventilation syndromes. While **CPAP remains the first-line therapy** for most patients with OSA [^113V56sM], BiPAP is a valuable alternative for selected patients. Careful patient selection, titration, and monitoring are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize potential risks [^113HZ1Kr].

The pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy remains poorly understood, and studies examining the effect of treatment with positive airway pressure on pregnancy have been limited. This study aimed to perform a randomized controlled trial of positive airway pressure treatment for obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy.

- **Study design**: Participants with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² underwent polysomnography at 14 to 20 weeks' gestation (visit 1). Those with obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 5 but < 50) were enrolled. In phase 1, participants were randomized to autotitrating positive airway pressure vs. sham positive airway pressure. In phase 2, the sham arm was replaced with a sleep hygiene control. Participants returned at 28 to 31 weeks' gestation (visit 2). Measurements included mean arterial blood pressure, uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index, endoglin, soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1 levels, and placental growth factor levels. Fasting glucose and insulin were also measured to calculate insulin resistance using the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance. The primary outcome was a composite of the uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index, soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1 to placental growth factor ratio, and the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance. For secondary analyses, each outcome variable was analyzed independently, and adherence to treatment was examined.

- **Results**: A total of 241 participants completed visit 1, and 89 (37%) had an apnea-hypopnea index between 5 and 50. Of those, 51 participants were…

### Cardiovascular effects after five nights without continuous positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnea: A randomized controlled trial [^111Vsijf]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

This study investigates the cardiovascular effects of five nights without continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The research focuses on measuring changes in various cardiovascular parameters when CPAP is withdrawn.

- **Study design**: The study is a randomized controlled trial that includes patients diagnosed with OSA. Participants were monitored for cardiovascular changes over a five-night period without CPAP treatment. Key measurements taken include blood pressure, heart rate variability, and other relevant cardiovascular indicators.

- **Results**: The findings indicated a significant increase in blood pressure and alterations in heart rate variability during the CPAP withdrawal period. These changes suggest that short-term interruption of CPAP therapy can have immediate adverse effects on cardiovascular health in individuals with OSA.

- **Conclusion**: The study underscores the importance of continuous CPAP therapy for managing cardiovascular risks in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. It highlights the potential consequences of even brief interruptions in treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^113Hxugf]. CMAJ (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on obstructive sleep apnea:

- **Definition**: OSA is a condition characterized by recurring episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to cyclic reduction or cessation in airflow.

- **Pathophysiology**: OSA is caused by periods of dynamic airway collapse during sleep. Factors that increase the risk of collapse include obesity, male sex, postmenopausal state, enlarged tonsils/adenoids, maxillary insufficiency, retrognathia, polycystic ovarian disease, androgen supplementation, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of moderate to severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 15) in adults (30–70 years of age) is estimated at 13% in men and 6% in women.

- **Disease course**: Key clinical manifestations of OSA include reduced sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Long-term complications include arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiovascular events, stroke, impaired cognitive function, depression, and even premature death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Regular CPAP use is associated with an improvement in sleep apnea symptoms and health-related quality of life. Randomized studies have failed to demonstrate a benefit of CPAP for the prevention of adverse cardiovascular events.

### Expiratory positive airway pressure for sleep apnea after stroke: A randomized, crossover trial [^116iV4bu]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common after stroke and predicts poor outcomes. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treats OSA but is generally poorly tolerated by stroke patients. This study assessed whether nasal expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), an alternative to CPAP, may be an effective option after acute stroke.

- **Methods**: A randomized, controlled, two-period crossover study was conducted in which each acute ischemic stroke patient received one night of EPAP and one night without EPAP while OSA was monitored with a validated device, the Watch-PAT 200. Linear repeated-measures analyses were conducted. Sample size calculations indicated that 18 subjects would be required to detect a 10-point or larger average reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, the primary outcome), with the use of EPAP, with power ≥ 80% and α = 0.05.

- **Results**: Among the 19 subjects who completed the protocol, nasal EPAP treatment was associated with a nonsignificant absolute difference in AHI of -5.73 events/h in the primary analysis (p = 0.183, 95% confidence interval -14.4, 2.97) and a nonsignificant absolute difference in AHI of -5.43 events/h in the subgroup of patients who used nasal EPAP for ≥ 3 h (p = 0.314, 95% confidence interval -16.6, 5.76).

- **Conclusions**: This study suggests that EPAP is not an effective alternative to CPAP in acute stroke patients with OSA. Further work is needed to identify other more effective alternatives.

### The value of auto-adjustable CPAP devices in pressure titration and treatment of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^1119vfuS]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

In moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard therapy. In the last decade, new technologies such as auto-adjustable CPAP (APAP) have been promoted as having an added advantage over CPAP because of their ability to adapt the pressure level to the patient's needs at all times. This could logically result in the deliverance of lower pressures, which was hypothesized to improve patient acceptance and compliance for therapy.

Several clinical trials have been performed with APAP in different modalities, as a titration tool in attended or unattended conditions, or as a treatment device for chronic use. Comparison of these trials is challenging since APAP technology is evolving promptly and devices differ not only in how sleep-disordered breathing is detected but also in how the operational algorithm responds accordingly.

Although the question remains whether proof has yet been delivered of the superiority of this technology over CPAP, there is a tendency to accept it as common standard practice in OSAS titration and treatment. This review will bring available evidence on this subject into perspective.

### Cardiovascular effects after five nights without continuous positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnea: a randomized controlled trial [^114Cm5Nx]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) effectively prevents sleep apnea and reduces blood pressure, many patients do not use CPAP every night. This trial investigates cardiovascular effects after sleeping five nights without CPAP.

- **Methods**: We randomized 100 patients (67 men and 33 women with a mean age of 64 ± 9 years) using CPAP treatment for moderate-to-severe sleep apnea to either withdraw treatment for five nights (n = 50) or to continue with CPAP (n = 50). The primary outcomes were arterial stiffness and 24-hour blood pressure.

- **Results**: The 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased by a mean of 2.8 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2–5.4 mmHg] (P = 0.035) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased by a mean of 1.7 mmHg (95% CI 0.1–3.3 mmHg) (P = 0.032) in the group without CPAP compared to the CPAP group. There was a significant effect on blood pressure in women but not in men. In women, SBP increased by 5.1 mmHg (95% CI 1.0–9.5 mmHg) (P = 0.017) and DBP by 2.9 mmHg (95% CI 0.4–5.6 mmHg) (P = 0.029). Arterial stiffness remained unaffected. Secondary outcomes that worsened in patients without CPAP included apnea–hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index, hemoglobin levels, and daytime sleepiness.

Blood pressure is affected after five nights of CPAP interruption, along with a rapid return of sleep apneas, nocturnal hypoxic events, daytime sleepiness, and increased hemoglobin levels. However, arterial stiffness was not affected. Blood pressure was affected in women only, suggesting a sex-related CPAP effect on blood pressure.

### Postoperative CPAP and BiPAP use can be safely omitted after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^115bFZGM]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent in the morbidly obese population. The need for routine preoperative testing for OSA has been debated in bariatric surgery publications. Most investigators have advocated the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in the postoperative setting; however, others have reported pouch perforations or other gastrointestinal complications as a result of their use. From a review of our experience, we present an algorithm for the safe postoperative treatment of patients with OSA without the use of CPAP or BiPAP.

- **Methods**: From January 2003 to December 2007, 1,095 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses were performed at our institution. Preoperative testing for OSA was not routinely performed. A prospective database was maintained. The data included patient demographics, co-morbidities (including OSA and CPAP/BiPAP use), perioperative events, complications, and follow-up information. Patients with known OSA were not given CPAP/BiPAP after surgery. They were observed in a monitored setting during their inpatient stay, ensuring continuous oxygen saturation of > 92%. All patients used patient-controlled analgesia, were trained in the use of incentive spirometry, and ambulated within a few hours of surgery. The outcomes were compared between the OSA patients using preoperative CPAP/BiPAP versus those with OSA without preoperative CPAP/BiPAP versus patients with no history of OSA.

- **Results**: A total of 811 patients were included in the study group with no known history of OSA.

### The art and science of continuous positive airway pressure therapy in obstructive sleep apnea [^115PNqZp]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, no ideal therapy has emerged at the time of writing. Based on recent randomized trials, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the treatment of choice. Although CPAP can prevent pharyngeal collapse in virtually all patients who choose to wear it, poor patient adherence with treatment limits its effectiveness. Convincing data exist that treatment with CPAP can alleviate the neurocognitive sequelae of OSA; however, data on cardiovascular complications are more limited. Several recent reports support a lowering of nocturnal and daytime blood pressure with CPAP, but data on the prevention of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events are currently lacking.

- **Improving adherence**: Patient adherence with CPAP can be improved with optimization of mask comfort, heated humidification, and intensive support and education. For those who remain poorly compliant, alternative therapies such as autotitrating devices and oral positive airway pressure can be considered.

Further research into the basic mechanisms underlying OSA will be required for new therapeutic targets to develop.

### Optimal continuous positive airway pressure for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea [^1136Jcp8]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSA/H) is characterized by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. The consequences of OSA/H include excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced perceived health quality, and an increased risk of driving accidents. There is evidence that treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is effective in eliminating these consequences. In addition, OSA/H may also be associated with hypertension and an increased risk of vascular disease. Although there is no clear evidence in this regard, CPAP may be effective in alleviating these consequences as well. Nasal CPAP is considered the treatment of choice for clinically significant OSA/H.

The optimal CPAP prescription is that which is most effective in eliminating the adverse consequences of OSA/H. Patients should be initially treated with standard CPAP. For those in whom standard CPAP is unsuccessful or intolerable, bi-level or self-adjusting modes may be attempted. The nasal CPAP pressure level can be titrated to eliminate apnea, hypopnea, snoring, respiratory arousal, and inspiratory flow limitation as a means of predicting successful long-term therapy.

The reliability of these physiologic parameters in predicting the optimal long-term CPAP pressure is eroded by the tendency of CPAP pressure-level requirements to decrease with chronic CPAP use and by other factors that may increase the CPAP pressure requirement. The split-night polysomnogram and unattended auto-CPAP titration have been proposed as efficient means of determining the optimal CPAP pressure.

### Maximizing positive airway pressure adherence in adults: A common-sense approach [^114o9jEU]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is considered the most efficacious treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), especially moderate to severe cases, and remains the most commonly prescribed. However, suboptimal adherence presents a challenge for sleep-medicine clinicians. The purpose of the review is to highlight the efficacy of published interventions to improve PAP adherence and to suggest a patient-centered clinical approach to enhancing PAP usage.

### Understanding sleep apnea physiology: A potential path to improving positive airway pressure effectiveness [^112r7QzU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Future work will ultimately need to clarify the impact of trait identification and personalized management on patient-centered outcomes. As we innovate, we must also bear in mind the costs of complexity. The polysomnograms currently necessary for comprehensive trait identification are costly and often inaccessible, particularly for groups with existing barriers to adherence, such as historically disadvantaged populations and those who live in rural areas. Developing automated approaches to measure traits with home testing would be an important step in mitigating this obstacle. Even then, additional unanticipated burdens to the health system from added complexity in decision-making and care pathways are likely. Ultimately, to reduce the burden of untreated OSA, it will be incumbent on us to integrate personalized strategies in a way that promotes equitable access to high-quality OSA care.

### Positive pressure therapy: A perspective on evidence-based outcomes and methods of application [^115gPMx9]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

The sleep medicine community has increasingly recognized the necessity that clinical care be based on high-quality levels of evidence. Although research supports a favorable influence of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on risk for significant adverse outcomes in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea (OSAH), well-designed trials are still required to elucidate the effect of PAP on health, quality of life, and economic risks in patients with milder OSAH. Similarly, although there is strong evidence supporting various PAP titration strategies and PAP modalities in patients with severe OSAH without significant medical and psychiatric comorbidities, there is insufficient high-level evidence assessing and comparing the clinical efficacy and health care cost implications of various titration paradigms and PAP modalities in individuals with milder OSAH and those with comorbid conditions. For ethical and other reasons, it may not be possible to apply a randomized controlled design to address all questions. However, whichever design is employed, it must be rigorously developed with attention to all potential confounders with adequate power to provide compelling, high-quality evidence.

### Obstructive sleep apnea therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction-time for a rethink [^116LYmfm]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent and underdiagnosed medical condition, which is associated with various cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The mainstay of therapy is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); however, CPAP is known to be poorly accepted and tolerated by patients. In randomized controlled trials evaluating CPAP in cardiovascular outcomes, the average usage was less than 3.5 hours, which is below the 4 hours per night recommended to achieve a clinical benefit. This low adherence may have resulted in poor effectiveness and failure to show cardiovascular risk reduction.

The mandibular advancement device (MAD) is an intraoral device designed to advance the mandible during sleep. It functions primarily through alteration of the jaw and/or tongue position, which results in improved upper airway patency and reduced upper airway collapsibility. The MAD is an approved alternative therapy that has been consistently shown to be the preferred option by patients who are affected by OSA. Although the MAD is less efficacious than CPAP in abolishing apnea and hypopnea events in some patients, its greater usage results in comparable improvements in quality of life and cardiovascular measures, including blood pressure reduction. This review summarizes the impact of OSA on cardiovascular health, the limitations of CPAP, and the potential of OSA treatment using MADs in cardiovascular risk reduction.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^116YkDgW]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for obstructive sleep apnea, particularly concerning positive airway pressure therapy, the DoD/VA 2025 guidelines recommend considering the provision of in-person or telehealth educational, behavioral, and supportive interventions. These interventions are aimed at improving the usage of positive airway pressure in patients who have been prescribed this therapy for obstructive sleep apnea.

### Educational, supportive and behavioural interventions to improve usage of continuous positive airway pressure machines in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea [^11342PPu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Although highly effective in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is not universally accepted by users. Educational, supportive, and behavioural interventions may help people with OSA initiate and maintain regular and continued use of CPAP.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of educational, supportive, behavioural, or mixed (combination of two or more intervention types) strategies that aim to encourage adults who have been prescribed CPAP to use their devices.

- **Search methods**: Searches were conducted on the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials up to 29 April 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed intervention(s) designed to inform participants about CPAP/OSA, to support them in using CPAP, or to modify their behaviour to increase use of CPAP devices.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We assessed studies to determine their suitability for inclusion in the review. Data were extracted independently and were entered into RevMan for analysis. 'Risk of bias' assessments were performed, using the updated 'Risk of Bias 2' tool, for the primary outcome, CPAP usage. Study-level 'Risk of Bias' assessments were performed using the original 'Risk of Bias' tool. GRADE assessment was performed using GRADEpro.

- **Main results**: Forty-one studies (9005 participants) are included in this review; 16 of these studies are newly identified with updated searches. Baseline Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores indicate that most participants suffer from significant sleepiness issues related to OSA.

### Effect of CPAP on blood pressure in patients with minimally symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea: A meta-analysis using individual patient data from four randomised controlled trials [^1111VtP8]. Thorax (2014). High credibility.

In the meta-analysis, there was no evidence that the treatment effect of CPAP on blood pressure (BP) was dependent on the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), as defined by the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) or the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI). This finding is in contrast to the report by Haentjens et al. The mean AHI in the two Barbé studies was higher than the mean ODI in the other studies. This discrepancy is due both to the Spanish studies using a higher inclusion threshold on AHI and to the fact that AHI values are generally higher than the corresponding ODI values, especially when considering > 4% dips in SaO2.

A possible limitation of the meta-analysis is the variability in follow-up length and treatment for control arms across studies. The two largest studies implemented the standard of care, with a 6-month follow-up visit. In contrast, the two smaller studies used sham-CPAP and had a shorter follow-up period. However, since these two studies accounted for only about 7% of the total patient population, their influence on the overall meta-analysis results is likely minimal.

Despite focusing on patients with normal levels of daytime sleepiness and only minimal symptoms, an average reduction in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) of about one point was observed in patients using CPAP relative to control. This reduction showed considerable variability across baseline ESS levels. For instance, patients with a higher initial ESS experienced greater improvement, which aligns with expectations. The treatment's effectiveness also depended on initial OSA severity, with patients having more severe OSA benefitting less from the treatment. In clinical practice, this implies that it is not possible to…

### Servo-ventilation therapy for sleep-disordered breathing [^114sfcmc]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

As seen in this CME online activity (available at http://journal.cme.chestnet.org/sv-sleep-disorder), central sleep apnea (CSA) is associated with increased mortality in patients with heart failure (HF), and it has been thought that treatment of CSA may improve underlying HF. Positive airway pressure therapy, specifically auto-servo-ventilation (ASV), can not only suppress abnormal breathing patterns but has been reported to improve cardiac function in HF patients with CSA. In patients with HF and with CSA unsuppressed with CPAP, newer ASV use has been associated with significant CSA improvement; in addition, several studies have reported efficacy of ASV in the treatment of underlying cardiac dysfunction in HF patients with CSA.

However, results from the large randomized Treatment of Sleep-Disordered Breathing with Predominant Central Sleep Apnea by Adaptive Servo-Ventilation in Patients with Heart Failure (SERVE-HF) trial showed no significant effect on the primary endpoint in patients with stable HF with reduced ejection fraction and predominantly CSA, but all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were both increased in the ASV arm. These results are surprising and inconsistent with earlier smaller studies reporting positive surrogate outcomes, and they require additional study and resolution. However, until this is done, there is an urgent educational need for review of the approved labeling and validated clinical guidelines.

### Does continuous positive airway pressure therapy benefit patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114MgHBM]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Pooling data from eight studies, including five observational studies and three RCTs with 2467 participants, demonstrated significant associations of CPAP with MACE (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, [0.55, 0.96]) by random-effects models with a moderate degree of heterogeneity (I² = 51.5%, p = .04). This result was driven by the study of Cassar et al, which carried 30.01% of the weight.

- **Forest plot**: The association between CPAP and risk of MACE is illustrated in Figure 2. The area of the square represents the point of estimate proportional to the weight of each study. Each point on the figure represents a RR, while the diamond represents the pooled estimate of effect, as calculated according to the random effects model. An RR of 1 indicates a higher risk with CPAP. A 95% CI that does not include the number 1 indicates a statistical difference between the two groups. CI stands for confidence interval; CPAP for continuous positive airway pressure; MACE for major adverse cardiovascular event; and RR for risk ratio.

### Multidisciplinary alternatives to CPAP program for CPAP-intolerant patients [^116Mqg9S]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) intolerance remains a persistent problem for many obstructive sleep apnea patients. Clinicians and researchers continue to search for other effective treatment modalities given the well-documented sequelae associated with untreated obstructive sleep apnea. A multidisciplinary "Alternatives to CPAP program" (ALT) can facilitate systematic evaluation of non-CPAP therapies appropriate for an individual patient.

We review successful strategies and barriers encountered during implementation of an ALT at our institution. Creation of similar programs in private practice and academic settings can help medical, dental, and surgical sleep medicine specialists coordinate evaluation and treatment of CPAP-intolerant patients.

### Clinical guidelines for the manual titration of positive airway pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^113HZ1Kr]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) devices are used to treat patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBDs), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). After a patient is diagnosed with OSA, the standard practice involves performing attended polysomnography (PSG), during which positive airway pressure is adjusted throughout the recording period to determine the optimal pressure for maintaining upper airway patency. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) represent the two forms of PAP that are manually titrated during PSG to determine the single fixed pressure of CPAP or the fixed inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP and EPAP, respectively) of BPAP for subsequent nightly usage.

A PAP Titration Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine reviewed the available literature. Based on this review, the task force developed these recommendations for conducting CPAP and BPAP titrations. Major recommendations are as follows:

- **PAP education and preparation**: All potential PAP titration candidates should receive adequate PAP education, hands-on demonstration, careful mask fitting, and acclimatization prior to titration.

- **Treatment goals for CPAP and BPAP**: CPAP (IPAP and/or EPAP for patients on BPAP) should be increased until the following obstructive respiratory events are eliminated (no specific order) or the recommended maximum CPAP (IPAP for patients on BPAP) is reached: apneas, hypopneas, respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs), and snoring.

- **Minimum starting CPAP**: The recommended minimum starting CPAP should be 4 cm H2O for pediatric and adult patients.

### Cerebrovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea [^1159mWKU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

The major treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involves continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a therapy that holds the airway open by using pressures delivered by a mask. Variations that use positive pressure are currently being used, but all maintain positive pressure during inhalation. Although the use of CPAP appears to be beneficial in some studies, more randomized, prospective studies are needed to fully clarify the effectiveness of CPAP. Unfortunately, 30% of all patients with OSA do not tolerate CPAP or do not comply due to the discomfort of the CPAP mask, which is strapped over the nose or over both the nose and mouth by a headband. In asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients, lack of compliance is even greater. This non-compliance is compounded by the estimate that 93% of women and 82% of men with moderate to severe sleep apnea syndrome have not been clinically diagnosed. Other therapies, such as mandibular devices, weight reduction, and surgery, have limited effectiveness in milder forms of OSA but generally are not effective in more severe cases. Pharmacological therapies have been disappointing, even though several dozen drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of OSA.

### Treatment of central sleep apnea in adults: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine systematic review, meta-analysis, and GRADE assessment [^113Ta2sb]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review provides supporting evidence for the accompanying clinical practice guideline on the treatment of central sleep apnea (CSA) syndrome in adults.

- **Methods**: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that compared the use of positive airway pressure therapies (PAP), non-PAP therapies, and pharmacological treatment to no treatment to improve patient-important outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the clinical meaningfulness of using various interventions to treat CSA in adults. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence for making recommendations.

- **Results**: The literature search resulted in 6,701 articles, out of which 103 articles provided data suitable for statistical analyses. The task force provided a detailed summary of the evidence along with the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.

### Biphasic positive airway pressure or continuous positive airway pressure: A randomized trial [^111M4wEY]. Pediatrics (2016). High credibility.

There is currently no clear evidence that nasal-biphasic positive airway pressure (n-BiPAP) confers any advantage over nasal-continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP). Our hypothesis was that preterm infants born before 30 weeks' gestation and less than 2 weeks old when extubated onto n-BiPAP would have a lower risk of extubation failure than infants extubated onto n-CPAP at equivalent mean airway pressure.

- **Methods**: We conducted an unblinded multicenter randomized trial comparing n-CPAP with n-BiPAP in infants born before 30 weeks' gestation and less than 2 weeks old. The primary outcome variable was the rate of extubation failure within 48 hours after the first attempt at extubation. Block randomization stratified by center and gestation (< 28 weeks or ≥ 28 weeks) was performed.

- **Results**: A total of 540 infants (270 in each group) were eligible for the statistical analysis; 57 (21%) of the n-BiPAP group and 55 (20%) of the n-CPAP group failed extubation at 48 hours post-extubation (adjusted odds ratio 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.65–1.56; p = 0.97). Subgroup analysis of infants born before and after 28 weeks' gestation showed no significant differences between the two groups. There were no significant differences between arms in death, oxygen requirement at 28 days, oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' corrected gestation, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgery, or pneumothorax.

- **Conclusions**: This trial shows that there is no added benefit to using n-BiPAP over n-CPAP at equivalent mean airway pressure in preventing extubation failures in infants.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in cardiovascular disease: A review of the literature and proposed multidisciplinary clinical management strategy [^1117R2Tc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The SAVIOR-C (Study of the Effects of Adaptive Servo-Ventilation Therapy on Cardiac Function and Remodeling in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure) trial failed to show an improvement in ejection fraction or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level after 24 weeks of ASV therapy in patients with HF and CSA, but did reveal improvements in quality of life and clinical status. The SERVE-HF (Treatment of Sleep-Disordered Breathing with Predominant Central Sleep Apnea by Adaptive Servo Ventilation in Patients with Heart Failure) trial was designed to test the effect of ASV on mortality in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% and predominantly central sleep apnea. Despite effectively reducing the AHI, ASV failed to confer a survival benefit and actually was associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality (29.9% versus 24%).

Postulated mechanisms for this finding include reductions in cardiac output related to the higher levels of PAP delivered in ASV mode, as well as the hypothesis that CSA is actually a compensatory mechanism in patients with severe HF with beneficial properties that were attenuated by ASV treatment. Additionally, the proprietary algorithm used in SERVE-HF has been shown to induce episodes of significant hyperventilation in some patients, which some suspect may have been related to the increase in mortality. The question of whether SERVE-HF's findings represent a class effect of ASV versus that of one specific algorithm may be answered by the ongoing ADVENT-HF (Effect of Adaptive Servo Ventilation on Survival and Hospital Admissions).

### Cardiovascular benefit of continuous positive airway pressure according to high-risk obstructive sleep apnoea: a multi-trial analysis [^11168phM]. European Heart Journal (2025). High credibility.

Randomized trials of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in patients with cardiovascular disease have not detected a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). This study tested whether the cardiovascular benefit of CPAP occurs preferentially in high-risk OSA, characterized by greater OSA-related heart rate acceleration or hypoxaemia.

In a post hoc analysis of pooled randomized trials, including "Randomized Intervention with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in Coronary Artery Disease and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea", "Impact of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure on Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome and Nonsleepy Obstructive Sleep Apnoea", and "Sleep Apnoea Cardiovascular Endpoints Study", outcomes were stratified by high-risk OSA status. High-risk status was defined by a heart rate response following OSA respiratory events > 9.4 beats per minute (third tertile) or oxygen desaturation area under baseline (hypoxic burden) > 87.1% min/h (third tertile). Cox mixed models quantified the CPAP treatment effect on MACCE, including cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke within high-risk OSA, and compared it with low-risk status (primary test). Secondary analyses examined participants without excessive sleepiness (Epworth < 11 points) or without increased blood pressure (systolic/diastolic < 140/90 mmHg).

In 3549 participants, 16.6% and 16.3% reached the MACCE endpoint with CPAP (n = 1778) and usual care (n = 1771), respectively. The CPAP treatment effect was greater in participants…

### Association of extubation failure rates with high-flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure, and bilevel positive airway pressure vs conventional oxygen therapy in infants and young children: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113SZ8T2]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

- **Statistical analysis**: HFNC, CPAP, and BiPAP were the experimental nodes (interventions in a network plot), and COT was considered the reference node in the network meta-analysis. We performed the analysis using a Bayesian analytic framework. A Bayesian approach has been preferred for network meta-analyses since it is better able to handle studies with very few events and produce probability and ranking outputs that are intuitive to end users. A Bayesian random-effects model for network meta-analysis was adopted because it assumes and accounts for unexplained heterogeneity across studies (eMethods in Supplement 1).

	- Different interventions were ranked using the rank probabilities generated by the Bayesian approach. We also used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to describe the relative ranking of interventions. SUCRA is expressed as a fraction and provides the relative probability of an intervention being the best among all options. SUCRA of 1 for an intervention indicates that the intervention is certain to be the best among all the interventions tested, while a SUCRA of 0 indicates that the intervention is certain to be the worst among the treatments tested. It is recommended that the ranks be interpreted in the context of the certainty of evidence and the absolute risk reduction of the pairwise comparisons.

	- Using the Bayesian framework, we performed a meta-regression analysis to explore the association of age with the effectiveness of NRS on reducing EF (reintubation) and TF. In our model, we assumed a common study-level covariate effect vs the baseline.

### The impact of changing people with sleep apnea using CPAP less than 4 h per night to a bi-level device [^116vcifY]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pressure intolerance is a reason for poor acceptance and subsequent compliance in some patients starting treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In unselected populations initiating CPAP, different types of pressure generating devices have not been found to improve compliance. We hypothesized that using a bi-level PAP for patients who reported pressure-related discomfort as a cause for poor compliance with CPAP might increase their hours of treatment use. Patients using CPAP for less than 4 hours per night with symptoms suggesting pressure intolerance were randomized to receive either a bi-level PAP device or a new CPAP for 4 weeks.

Following a washout period of 2 weeks, they were crossed over to the other device for another 4 weeks. Twenty-eight volunteers completed the protocol. Compared to the baseline (mean 1.49 hours per night), improvement in compliance was noticed when changed to a new CPAP (2.23 hours, p = 0.006) or bi-level PAP (2.73 hours, p < 0.001). The trend suggesting superior compliance with a bi-level PAP device compared to new CPAP was not significant (p = 0.059), and there were no differences in subjective or objective measures of sleepiness.

The results of this study suggest that routine intervention with bi-level PAP in this group of sub-optimally compliant individuals was not very effective in improving PAP usage. However, there is a subgroup of patients who complain of difficulty with exhalation, where favorable trends towards improved compliance were observed on bi-level PAP.

### Updated adaptive servo-ventilation recommendations for the 2012 AASM guideline: "The treatment of central sleep apnea syndromes in adults: Practice parameters with an evidence-based literature review and meta-analyses" [^115MFKf5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

An update of the 2012 systematic review and meta-analyses was performed, and a modified-GRADE approach was used to update the recommendation for the use of adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) for the treatment of central sleep apnea syndrome (CSAS) related to congestive heart failure (CHF). Meta-analyses demonstrated an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a normalization of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in all patients. Analyses also demonstrated an increased risk of cardiac mortality in patients with an LVEF of ≤ 45% and moderate or severe CSA predominant sleep-disordered breathing.

These data support a standard level recommendation against the use of ASV to treat CHF-associated CSAS in patients with an LVEF of ≤ 45% and moderate or severe CSAS, and an option level recommendation for the use of ASV in the treatment of CHF-associated CSAS in patients with an LVEF > 45% or mild CHF-related CSAS. The application of these recommendations is limited to the target patient populations; the ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician.

### Interventions to improve compliance with continuous positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnoea [^112wjFe3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is currently considered the cornerstone of therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). However, compliance with this treatment is frequently poor, leading to ongoing symptoms of sleep disruption, daytime sleepiness, and poor waking cognitive function. Mechanical and psychological/educational interventions have been proposed to increase the hours of use of CPAP therapy.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of interventions designed to increase compliance with CPAP.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Sleep Apnoea Specialised Register (January 2004).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing interventions to improve compliance with CPAP usage were considered for inclusion in the review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers assessed articles for inclusion in the review and extracted data. Attempts were made to obtain additional unpublished data from the trialists.

- **Main results**: Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria with 1007 participants. Each mechanical intervention was compared with fixed CPAP alone.

	- **Auto-CPAP (13 studies)**: A small, significant difference was observed in compliance, but this effect disappeared when we took account of the variation between the studies. There may be a subgroup of patients who respond better than others. Most participants preferred auto-CPAP to fixed CPAP where this was measured.

	- **Bi-level PAP (3 studies)**: No significant differences were observed in compliance. One small study found no difference in preference.

### Treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116ezaSE]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines in the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

- **Methods**: The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of clinically significant benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements" that establish the basis for appropriate and effective treatment of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Good practice statements**: The following good practice statements are based on expert consensus, and their implementation is necessary for appropriate and effective management of patients with OSA treated with positive airway pressure: (1) Treatment of OSA with PAP therapy should be based on a diagnosis of OSA established using objective sleep apnea testing. (2) Adequate follow-up, including troubleshooting and monitoring of objective efficacy and usage data to ensure adequate treatment and adherence, should occur following PAP therapy initiation and during treatment.

### Pressure modification for improving usage of continuous positive airway pressure machines in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea [^114akdr4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). High credibility.

Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP) is considered the cornerstone of therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). However, compliance with this treatment is frequently poor, which may lead to ongoing symptoms of sleep disruption, daytime sleepiness, and poor waking cognitive function. Mechanical interventions involving changes in the way positive pressure is delivered, along with the addition of humidification, might improve compliance.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of pressure level modifications and additional humidification in increasing CPAP machine usage.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (September 2008).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing interventions to improve compliance with CPAP usage. Control groups received fixed pressure CPAP.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors assessed articles for inclusion in the review and extracted data. We made attempts to obtain additional unpublished data from the trialists.

- **Main results**: Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (1874 participants). Auto-CPAP (30 studies, 1136 participants) showed a statistically significant difference in machine usage of 0.21 hours/night (0.08 to 0.35) in favour of auto-CPAP from cross-over studies. This difference is of questionable clinical significance. Pooled effect estimates from parallel group trials detected a similar-sized difference for average nightly machine usage, but this was not statistically significant. Evidence from parallel group studies did not identify any substantial benefit.

### Clinical foundation for efficient treatment of obstructive sleep apnea [^111FLFUa]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). High credibility.

Only a few decades ago, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was unknown and untreated. Now, there is a rush to put literally millions of Americans on continuous positive airway pressure devices. Community practice standards are changing yearly under pressure from strong forces based on economic incentives for industry, government, and physicians, independent of the actual medical evidence supporting treatment and efficacy.

- **Changes in diagnostic criteria**: Medicare has lowered the diagnostic threshold for diagnosis and reimbursement. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Revision 2 (2005), allows OSA to be diagnosed exclusively by a laboratory test without the patient having clinical symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness.

- **Industry influence**: The industry is poised to encourage the public to purchase computer-assisted continuous positive airway pressure machines without the need for a physician's prescription.

Because of this paradigm shift away from physician-directed diagnosis and treatment, this article will critically evaluate the present state of medical evidence regarding the clinical foundation for the treatment of OSA.

### Does continuous positive airway pressure therapy benefit patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111MEag7]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

**Statistical analysis**: The numbers of dichotomous outcomes were summarized, and mean values with standard deviations were collated for continuous outcomes. For every included trial, we retrieved or calculated the relative risks (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the assessed outcomes. Fixed-effects models assume that there is a common underlying effect, and the variability observed is attributed to chance alone. In contrast, random-effects models acknowledge that true between-study heterogeneity exists and take into account the presence of heterogeneity in their calculations. In the absence of heterogeneity, fixed- and random-effects models yield the same results. We summarized RR or HR with a random-effects model first and changed to a fixed-effects model if no between-study heterogeneity was found for the random-effects model. The I² statistic was distinguished as low (I² ≤ 25%), moderate (I² > 25% and ≤ 75%), or high (I² ≥ 75%), as was a p-value of ≤ 0.05 for heterogeneity. Where there was substantial heterogeneity (I² > 50%), subgroup analysis and sensitivity analyses were conducted for heterogeneity assessment. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to mean age, mean body mass index (BMI), mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and OSA assessment, which might be potential mediators. In sensitivity analyses, we also excluded the following characteristics: observational studies, number of patients < 200, NOS score < 9, follow-up duration ≤ 36 months, and lost to follow-up rate > 5%.

### Patients' with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) preferences and demand for treatment: A discrete choice experiment [^117Th3Up]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Following the most recent guidelines, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is indicated as a first-line treatment for patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). However, initial acceptance and regular use of CPAP treatment are still an issue. Alternatively, oral appliances (OAs) are recommended in the case of initial refusal or failure of the CPAP option, and also as a first-line treatment in mild to moderate OSAS. Because of problems with compliance, patients and physicians are faced with difficult decisions regarding which OSAS treatment options to choose. Physicians are encouraged to take into account patients' preferences and possibly to involve them in the medical decision-making process. We used a preferences elicitation method, namely the discrete choice experiment (DCE), to determine patients' preferences for OSAS treatment-related attributes and to predict patients' demand for both CPAP and OAs.

### CPAP and bi-level PAP therapy: New and established roles [^117KY1ZU]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Over the past few decades, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea has evolved into increasingly sophisticated modes of therapy for various forms of sleep-disordered breathing. While the principles of splinting the airway and delivering assisted ventilation underpin this therapy, the introduction of newer technologies and miniaturization are revolutionizing the field. This review aims to improve our understanding of various forms of PAP therapy by providing the rationale for such modalities, gaining a basic working knowledge of device technology, and critically assessing the clinical research evidence, while also identifying barriers to implementation. Dissemination of this information is vital to prevent knowledge gaps in healthcare providers and systems.

### Comparison of three auto-adjusting positive pressure devices in patients with sleep apnoea [^113RYagN]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Auto-adjustable continuous positive airway pressure (APAP) devices are an emerging treatment alternative to fixed-pressure continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. These devices have been engineered to automatically adjust the pressure to the optimal level on a continuous basis. However, not all APAP technologies use the same algorithm.

Three different APAP devices (Autoset Spirit, Breas PV 10i, and RemStar Auto) were compared in a randomised crossover trial in patients already established on fixed-pressure CPAP therapy. The outcome measures were compliance, quality of life, and side-effects. Twenty-seven middle-aged patients (25 male), previously diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (median interquartile range apnoea/hypopnoea index 48, 29–76), established on CPAP therapy for over 3 years, were randomised to each APAP device for 4 weeks.

Mean pressure and patient compliance were significantly lower on the Breas PV 10i than on the other APAP devices. The devices were similar in terms of quality of life, daytime sleepiness, and upper airway side-effects. However, patients evaluated them significantly differently in terms of device features, sleep quality, and pressure comfort, with the Breas PV 10i being the least popular. Auto-adjustable positive airway pressure devices differ in pressure delivery and patient compliance in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome patients.

### A predictive model for optimal continuous positive airway pressure in the treatment of pure moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in China [^113kwtM7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing, characterized by cessation or significant attenuation of oronasal airflow during sleep, accompanied by daytime drowsiness and fatigue. Reports indicate that nearly one billion adults aged 30 to 69 years worldwide have OSA, with the highest number of affected individuals in China, followed by the United States, Brazil, and India. OSA has been associated with multi-system damage due to intermittent hypoxia.

Previous studies have demonstrated that automatic continuous positive airway pressure (auto-CPAP) therapy plays a beneficial role in the treatment of OSA patients. However, auto-CPAP titration followed by fixed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with the assistance of a web platform is not commonly used in China. This is due to economic factors, medical insurance policy, and the infancy of telemedicine services lacking relevant policies and regulations at the national level.

Currently, the main "gold standard" for diagnosing and treating OSA in China involves an initial laboratory diagnostic polysomnogram (PSG), followed by a second PSG to manually titrate the appropriate CPAP value if moderate to severe OSA is detected in the baseline PSG. This procedure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Furthermore, the titration duration may be insufficient to determine the appropriate pressure due to the patient's difficulty sleeping in an unfamiliar environment.

### European respiratory society guideline on non-CPAP therapies for obstructive sleep apnoea [^114mYWBp]. European Respiratory Review (2021). High credibility.

The European Respiratory Society (ERS) 2021 guidelines recommend considering either positional therapy using vibratory devices or CPAP for adult patients with mild or moderate position-dependent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This recommendation is based on the criterion that the supine apnea-hypopnea index is at least twice as high as the nonsupine apnea-hypopnea index, with no relevant nonsupine apnea-hypopnea index (defined as fewer than 15 events per hour).

### Surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea: Standard and emerging techniques [^112Pufyx]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as their physicians, seek alternative therapies to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) due to problems with CPAP adherence. A large variety of surgical options exist, and each intervention must be individually evaluated. The author performed a literature search concerning surgery for sleep apnea until May 2010; the studies were evaluated according to evidence-based medicine criteria.

Recent findings suggest that an increasing number of controlled and even randomized controlled trials are available. Minimally invasive surgery remains under debate due to its very limited efficacy versus very low morbidity. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty is still the standard procedure for many patients with moderate OSA, whereas maxillomandibular advancement is as effective as CPAP in severe OSA. Multilevel surgery is reserved for secondary treatment after CPAP failure. Tonsillectomy and maxillomandibular advancement may be offered as a first-line treatment in certain patients. There is increasing evidence that upper airway surgery has a positive impact on arterial hypertension, markers of cardiovascular disease, insomnia, daytime symptoms, quality of life, and CPAP adherence.

Patients who are nonadherent to CPAP must be thoroughly evaluated before choosing any of the available surgical options. Upper airway surgery may improve disease markers of OSA if appropriately chosen, properly indicated, and performed.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in cardiovascular disease: A review of the literature and proposed multidisciplinary clinical management strategy [^1171XUBD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Sleep apnea is characterized by repetitive episodes of apnea occurring during sleep. An apnea is defined as a cessation of inspiratory airflow lasting 10 seconds or more, while the term hypopnea refers to a reduction in inspiratory airflow (by at least 30%) lasting 10 seconds or more, with an associated drop in oxygen saturation or arousal from sleep. The steps required for a successful inspiratory cycle include activation of a signal from the regulatory brainstem center, transmission of the signal via peripheral nerves, activation of respiratory muscles to produce negative intrathoracic pressure, and maintaining a patent airway.

The mechanism for apneas or hypopneas can be either obstructive, in which airflow cessation results despite inspiratory effort because of blockage within the upper airways, or central, in which both airflow and inspiratory efforts are absent. The term sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) encompasses obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA), and mixed apnea, the latter of which shows absent respiratory effort initially and clear effort with obstruction at the end of mixed apnea.

Important risk factors for OSA include obesity, craniofacial or oropharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, male sex, and smoking. During sleep, there is a reduction in tone of the dilator muscles involved in maintaining airway patency. In particular, relaxation of the genioglossus muscle allows the tongue to fall posteriorly within the pharynx, facilitating obstruction in susceptible individuals. Anatomic factors, including obesity that results in relative narrowing of the airway, further contribute to this phenomenon.

### Titration studies overestimate continuous positive airway pressure requirements in uncomplicated obstructive sleep apnea [^115zQYYB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Attended manual continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration is the standard practice for determining optimal positive airway pressures for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment. However, an unattended single night auto-titrating positive airway pressure (APAP) titration is an alternative. The goal of this study was to determine whether therapeutic CPAP pressures determined during manual titrations are higher than APAP-generated surrogate pressures.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of 165 adults with uncomplicated OSA who had full/split-night manual CPAP titrations prior to commencing treatment with APAP. Demographic and clinical data, including 30-day APAP compliance data, were obtained. We compared the recommended CPAP pressure from manual titrations with the 90th/95th percentile pressure generated from APAP usage over 30 days.

- **Results**: The recommended CPAP pressures during the manual titrations were higher than the 90th/95th percentile pressures generated from APAP (11.4 ± 3.4 vs. 10.3 ± 2.4 cmH2O; p = 0.000). Almost half the group (41.9%) had their manually derived titration pressure at least 1.5 cm above the 90th/95th percentile pressure. In multivariate analyses, body mass index was the only variable that predicted higher manual titration pressures. Notably, the average residual apnea-hypopnea index on 30-day APAP data was less than the average residual apnea-hypopnea index observed at the recommended pressure during the manual titration (5.0 ± 4.3 vs. 7.2 ± 8.5; p = 0.006).

Manual CPAP titrations may overestimate prescribed pressures.

### Sleep.7: Positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome [^115KZ7e1]. Thorax (2005). Low credibility.

Use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in treating symptoms associated with obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is reviewed. Although it is an imperfect intervention, it continues to evolve and improve in such a way that patients who would not have been able to use this treatment even in the recent past can benefit from it today.

### Effect of continuous positive airway pressure treatment on ambulatory blood pressures in high-risk sleep apnea patients: A randomized controlled trial [^111JHKMS]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The long-term effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on 24-hour blood pressure (BP) in patients at high risk with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is uncertain. We aimed to determine the effect of CPAP treatment on ambulatory BP in individuals with moderate or severe OSA and cardiovascular disease, or multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors without severe sleepiness.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, controlled, parallel group study, 169 participants were randomly assigned to CPAP treatment or the control group. The primary outcome was the change in mean 24-hour systolic BP between groups from baseline to the average of 6- and 12-month measurements using mixed-effect linear regression models.

- **Results**: The 24-hour systolic BP did not significantly differ by group, although there was a trend of decrease in the CPAP group (treatment effect -2.7 mm Hg [95% confidence interval -5.9 to 0.6]; p = 0.105) compared with control. CPAP had the greatest effect on nighttime systolic BP (treatment effect -5.9 mm Hg [95% confidence interval -9.9 to -1.9]; p = 0.004). Similar improvements in other nocturnal BP indices were observed.

- **Conclusions**: In patients at high risk with moderate-severe OSA without severe sleepiness, CPAP resulted in modest BP improvements over 6 to 12 months of follow-up, with possibly larger effects for nocturnal BP. Use of office blood pressure may underestimate the effect of CPAP on BP profile in patients with OSA.

### Does continuous positive airway pressure therapy benefit patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jCbdx]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

The data extraction and quality assessment process involved two authors who reviewed potentially eligible scientific reports identified by the searches. Their task was to identify reports that warranted review in full text. Each full-text article was then assessed for eligibility. For each included study, the following data were recorded:

- **Study characteristics**: First author, year of publication, country, study phase, and study design.
- **Participants**: Sample size, age, sex, key inclusion criteria, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (ESSs).
- **Interventions and comparison**: CPAP equipment, type of interface, type of control, and duration of treatment.
- **Outcomes**: Follow-up duration, rate of loss to follow-up, and precision of measurements, including risk ratios (RRs) or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of each trial.

Discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third party. Authors were contacted to clarify ambiguities and to request data on outcomes missing in primary reports.

To evaluate the risk of bias, the individual criteria of the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS) were utilized (eMethod in Supplement). The assessment focused on three aspects:

- **Selection bias**: 0–4 points.
- **Comparability bias**: 0–2 points.
- **Outcome assessment bias**: 0–3 points.

These biases were each classified as low, unclear, or high. NOS scores of 6 were assigned to high-quality studies.

The primary endpoint was the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which were defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or repeat revascularization at the longest available follow-up.

### Interventions to improve compliance in sleep apnea patients previously non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure [^1169EDMc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite widespread agreement that continuous positive airway pressure is an effective therapy for obstructive sleep apnea, it is estimated that 50% of patients recommended for therapy are non-compliant one year later. Interventions to improve compliance in such patients have not been studied. We evaluated a two-phase intervention program to improve compliance in sleep apnea patients previously non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure.

- **Methods**: A total of 204 patients with previously diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea who were non-compliant with continuous positive airway pressure were enrolled. Phase one evaluated standard interventions to improve therapy compliance, including mask optimization, heated humidification, topical nasal therapy, and sleep apnea education. Persistently non-compliant patients proceeded to phase two, where compliance was compared in a double-blind randomized fashion between standard continuous positive airway pressure and flexible bilevel positive airway pressure.

- **Results**: Forty-nine (24%) of the 204 previously non-compliant patients became compliant (average nightly use ≥ 4 hours) after standard interventions. Then, 104 of the 155 persistently non-compliant patients agreed to continue and were randomized to either CPAP or flexible bilevel positive airway pressure retitration and treatment for an additional ninety days. At follow-up, 15 (28%) of the 53 randomized to CPAP and 25 (49%) of the 51 randomized to flexible bilevel positive airway pressure (p = 0.03) achieved compliance.
