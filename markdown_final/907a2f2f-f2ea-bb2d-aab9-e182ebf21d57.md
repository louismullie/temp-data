## Question

What is the drug used for cardiac stress test?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what drug is used for a cardiac stress test. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question refers to exercise-based testing or pharmacologic stress testing. Then, I should verify which pharmacologic agents are FDA-approved and for what indications. Next, I will compare the main drug classes and their mechanisms, and finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically grounded answer with the most appropriate agent highlighted and caveats noted.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating exercise stress testing with pharmacologic stress testing. Exercise stress testing uses physical exertion and is preferred when patients can achieve adequate workload, whereas pharmacologic stress testing is reserved for those who cannot exercise adequately or have contraindications to exercise, and it relies on drugs to simulate ischemia or increase myocardial oxygen demand [^1d4cfea6] [^f0253bf4].

> Now, I should verify which drugs are actually approved for pharmacologic stress testing. Regadenoson is FDA-approved specifically for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging in patients unable to undergo adequate exercise stress, and it is the most commonly used vasodilator in contemporary practice due to its fixed-dose, rapid bolus administration and favorable operational profile [^d6d6b723] [^c1e85025] [^2a1b49c4].

> Wait, let me verify the broader pharmacologic landscape so I don't overgeneralize. Vasodilators such as adenosine and dipyridamole are also FDA-approved for pharmacologic stress MPI and remain valid alternatives, though they require continuous infusion and longer monitoring, which can reduce throughput. Dobutamine is used when vasodilators are contraindicated or for viability assessment, but it is not a vasodilator and is typically reserved for specific scenarios like stress echocardiography or when A2A agonists are unsafe [^89b92cea] [^78b954ce] [^916e2016].

> Hold on, I should verify mechanism and why regadenoson is often preferred. Regadenoson is a selective A2A adenosine receptor agonist that produces coronary vasodilation and flow heterogeneity to reveal perfusion defects, with a simpler administration protocol and generally better tolerability than nonselective agents; this operational advantage is reflected in real-world surveys and efficiency studies showing shorter staff time and faster same-day conversion after inadequate exercise [^9f3e01df] [^2a1b49c4] [^a606b37f].

> I need to check safety and contraindications so I don't omit important cautions. Regadenoson and other vasodilators can precipitate ischemia via coronary steal in patients with significant flow-limiting disease, and they are contraindicated in second- or third-degree AV block or sinus node dysfunction without a pacemaker; aminophylline is the appropriate reversal agent if adverse effects occur, and nitroglycerin should be avoided as a reversal because it can worsen steal physiology [^89b92cea] [^dfc7c420].

> But wait, what if the user is thinking about exercise testing itself rather than a drug? I should double-check that nuance. Exercise stress testing does not involve a pharmacologic agent; it uses treadmill or bicycle exercise to achieve target heart rate and assess ischemia, symptoms, and functional capacity, and it remains the preferred initial modality when feasible, with pharmacologic stress reserved for those who cannot exercise adequately [^1d4cfea6] [^f0253bf4].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the most precise answer. The drug most commonly used for pharmacologic cardiac stress testing is regadenoson, with adenosine and dipyridamole as approved alternatives for vasodilator stress, and dobutamine as an option when vasodilators are contraindicated or for viability assessment; selection should be individualized based on patient factors, imaging modality, and local expertise [^d6d6b723] [^78b954ce] [^916e2016].

---

The drugs used for cardiac stress testing are **vasodilators** (adenosine, dipyridamole, regadenoson) and **dobutamine**. Vasodilators are preferred for myocardial perfusion imaging because they increase coronary flow and reveal ischemia; regadenoson is the most commonly used due to its fixed-dose, single-bolus administration and favorable tolerability [^d6d6b723] [^2a1b49c4]. Dobutamine is used when vasodilators are contraindicated or for viability assessment, as it increases heart rate and contractility to induce ischemia [^916e2016] [^78b954ce]. Exercise stress testing is preferred when feasible; pharmacologic stress is reserved for patients who cannot exercise adequately [^1d4cfea6] [^f0253bf4].

---

## Pharmacologic stress agents

Pharmacologic stress agents are used when patients cannot achieve adequate exercise due to physical limitations, comorbidities, or baseline ECG abnormalities [^1bc2b129]. The main classes are **vasodilators** and **inotropes**.

---

### Vasodilators

Vasodilators increase coronary blood flow by activating adenosine receptors, creating a flow differential that reveals ischemia in stenosed arteries [^27ece19f].

| **Agent** | **Mechanism of action** | **Administration** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Adenosine | Non-selective adenosine receptor agonist causing coronary vasodilation | Continuous IV infusion (140 µg/kg/min for 4–6 min) | - Short half-life (~10 s) <br/> - Rapid reversal with aminophylline <br/> - Contraindicated in severe bronchospastic disease and significant AV block [^9016193b] |
| Dipyridamole | Indirectly increases adenosine by inhibiting its reuptake | IV infusion (0.84 mg/kg over 10 min) | - Longer half-life (~30 min) <br/> - Reversal with aminophylline <br/> - Similar contraindications to adenosine [^9016193b] |
| Regadenoson | Selective A2A adenosine receptor agonist | Fixed-dose IV bolus (0.4 mg over 10 s) | - Single-dose administration <br/> - Weight-independent dosing <br/> - Lower incidence of bronchospasm <br/> - Preferred agent in many centers [^d6d6b723] [^2a1b49c4] |

---

### Inotropes

Inotropes increase myocardial oxygen demand by augmenting heart rate and contractility, thereby unmasking ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease [^78b954ce].

- **Dobutamine**: Beta-agonist increasing heart rate and contractility; used when vasodilators are contraindicated or for viability assessment. Infusion protocol: 5–40 µg/kg/min with atropine as needed to reach target heart rate [^643fd41f] [^916e2016].

- **Atropine**: Anticholinergic used with dobutamine to achieve target heart rate when chronotropic response is inadequate [^643fd41f].

---

## Clinical indications for pharmacologic stress testing

Pharmacologic stress testing is indicated when patients cannot perform adequate exercise due to:

- Physical limitations (e.g. orthopedic, neurological, peripheral vascular disease) [^1bc2b129].
- Baseline ECG abnormalities (e.g. left bundle branch block, ventricular pacing, pre-excitation) [^1bc2b129].
- Inability to achieve target heart rate or workload despite maximal effort [^1d4cfea6].
- Specific clinical scenarios (e.g. viability assessment, preoperative evaluation) [^916e2016] [^f0253bf4].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

Pharmacologic stress testing is generally safe, but clinicians must be aware of contraindications and potential adverse effects:

- **Contraindications**: Severe bronchospastic disease, significant AV block, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, severe aortic stenosis, and hypersensitivity to the agent [^89b92cea] [^9016193b].
- **Adverse effects**: Chest discomfort, dyspnea, flushing, headache, palpitations, hypotension, and rare serious events (myocardial infarction, arrhythmias) [^f4e01d58] [^0f26bf7f].
- **Monitoring**: Continuous ECG, blood pressure, and symptom assessment are essential during testing [^e734a880].

---

## Comparison with exercise stress testing

Exercise stress testing remains the preferred initial modality when feasible because it provides functional capacity, hemodynamic response, and prognostic information [^1d4cfea6] [^f0253bf4]. Pharmacologic stress testing is reserved for patients unable to exercise adequately or when exercise testing is contraindicated [^1bc2b129].

---

## Recent advancements and emerging agents

Recent developments include selective A2A agonists (e.g. regadenoson) that improve tolerability and simplify administration, and ongoing research into novel agents and protocols to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient comfort [^9f3e01df] [^ef7287c7].

---

The drugs used for cardiac stress testing are **vasodilators** (adenosine, dipyridamole, regadenoson) and **dobutamine**, with regadenoson preferred for its ease of use and tolerability. Exercise stress testing is preferred when feasible; pharmacologic stress is reserved for those who cannot exercise adequately.

### Update on pharmacological cardiac stress testing: efficacy, risk stratification and patient selection [^ddf630dd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite greater control of risk factors and improved treatments, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a significant cause of mortality with 1 in every 4 deaths in the United States due to this disorder.(1) Cardiac stress tests have long been one of the most often utilized testing modalities used to identify patients suspected of having CHD, specifically coronary artery disease (CAD). These tests allow for noninvasive assessment of the coronary circulation and its ability to augment flow in response to physiologic demand. As with any diagnostic testing however, potential health risks as well as the financial burden of cardiovascular stress testing, must be weighed against the benefits and utility of the data procured. Given the rapidly evolving field of cardiac stress testing with respect to new risk stratification guidelines, new agents, and new assessment methods, it is difficult for physicians to remain up to date on the latest research and the benefits and risks of different testing modalities. A recent survey of primary care physicians and cardiologists conducted by the Elsevier Office of Continuing Medical Education found that approximately one-quarter of the cardiologists and primary care physicians surveyed do not feel confident identifying the factors which should be considered before ordering a cardiac stress test as part of pre-operative screening for a patient. Additionally, this survey also reported that primary care physicians reported a high degree of confidence in ordering the appropriate cardiac screening tests for patients yet, cardiologists reported that they frequently/somewhat frequently felt the need to change the test ordered by the internist. This educational intervention focuses on patient selection, exercise vs. pharmacologic stress testing, pharmacologic agents, and the importance of patient and doctor communication in ensuring the right test is recommended for the right patient.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^643fd41f]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic stress testing (dobutamine) — In patients who cannot exercise, dobutamine and vasodilator stress are alternatives, and although vasodilators may have advantages for assessment of myocardial perfusion, dobutamine is preferred when the test is based on assessment of regional wall motion. A graded dobutamine infusion starting at 5 μg/kg/min and increasing at 3-minute intervals to 10, 20, 30, and 40 μg/kg/min is the standard for dobutamine stress testing, and inclusion of low-dose stages facilitates recognition of viability and ischemia in segments with abnormal function at rest, even if viability assessment is not the main objective of the test. End points are achievement of target heart rate (defined as 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate), new or worsening wall-motion abnormalities of moderate degree, significant arrhythmias, hypotension, severe hypertension, and intolerable symptoms. Atropine, in divided doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg to a total of 2.0 mg, should be used as needed to achieve target heart rate, increases the sensitivity of dobutamine echocardiography in patients receiving beta-blockers and in those with single-vessel disease, and the minimum cumulative dose needed should be used to avoid the rare complication of central nervous system toxicity. Patients given atropine at the 30-μg/kg/min stage reach target heart rate more quickly using lower doses of dobutamine and with fewer side effects; a beta-blocker may be administered to reverse the side effects of dobutamine, and administration of beta-blockers at peak stress or during recovery may increase test sensitivity. Both dobutamine and exercise echocardiography result in a marked increase of heart rate, but the increment in systolic blood pressure is much less with dobutamine compared with exercise.

### Functional capacity and cardiovascular assessment: submaximal exercise testing and hidden candidates for pharmacologic stress [^a731904f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Submaximal exercise testing is often used to estimate functional capacity in non-athletes, to assess cardiovascular disease in elderly or frail patients, to demonstrate exercise equipment, or to risk-stratify patients after myocardial infarction. However, submaximal exercise testing is not sufficiently sensitive, specific, or predictive to have widespread clinical utility, except in post-myocardial infarction protocols. Many patients for whom submaximal exercise testing is not useful are unable to exercise sufficiently for maximal testing and are referred for imaging with pharmacologic stress. Although some patients who are unable to exercise adequately are easily recognized, many are not. The identification of such patients before they fail a maximal exercise test attempt is beneficial to both the patient and the imaging laboratory.

### Evaluating the use of pharmacological stress agents during single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging tests after inadequate exercise stress test [^27ece19f]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) is a common non-invasive form of cardiac testing, with imaging performed at rest before and after exercise. Patients who are unable to exercise to an adequate workload are considered to have an inadequate exercise stress test (EST); a pharmacological stress test can be used to increase myocardial perfusion and induce flow heterogeneity in those with obstructive coronary artery disease. There are a variety of pharmacological stress agents (PSAs) available, including regadenoson, adenosine, dipyridamole, and dobutamine. Regadenoson, adenosine, and dipyridamole are cardiac vasodilators, which dilate coronary vessels to increase blood velocity and flow rate in normal vessels and cause less of a response in stenotic vessels; they are the preferred agents for MPI. In clinical practice, the choice of agent depends on patient characteristics, the stress imaging techniques being performed, and provider preference.

Regadenoson, administered intravenously via a pre-filled syringe, is one of the most widely used PSAs. The EXERRT (EXErcise to Regadenoson in Recovery Trial) phase 3 trial showed that administration of regadenoson could occur during recovery from the inadequate EST at the same visit, rather than in a follow-up visit. These clinical trial findings suggest that the availability of regadenoson in a nuclear imaging center may affect real-world center practices related to the transition of patients from an inadequate EST to a PSA.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate how PSAs are currently used for patients during SPECT-MPI assessments following an inadequate EST and, more specifically, to (1) describe the protocol/practice implemented in nuclear imaging centers to convert patients from an inadequate EST to a PSA, and (2) assess resource use and time associated with the use of regadenoson compared to other PSAs.

### Considerations for stress testing performed in conjunction with myocardial perfusion imaging [^1d4cfea6]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2020). Medium credibility.

For myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), the best test to evaluate hemodynamic changes during stress is an exercise treadmill test. It provides independent prognostic value, including evaluation of total exercise time, performance, and capacity; heart rate response during exercise, with ischemia, and in recovery; blood pressure response; myocardial oxygen demand; and assessment of symptoms. Combining these exercise data with perfusion imaging provides the best prognostic value and risk stratification for patients. Although exercise stress testing accompanied by MPI is preferential, it is not always possible since an increasing number of patients cannot exercise to a maximal (symptom-limited) level. Further, there is much evidence in the literature demonstrating a suboptimal, non-symptom-limited (not achieving at least 4–6 min or < 85% of maximum predicted heart rate) exercise test performed as part of an MPI study may result in a false-negative outcome. Therefore, pharmacologic stress agents provide an excellent alternative for those patients who cannot achieve an adequate heart rate response or adequately perform physical exercise. This article focuses on considerations for performing stress (exercise and pharmacologic) testing in conjunction with MPI. It is meant to provide a basic overview of the principles of exercise stress testing; discuss the indications, contraindications, patient preparation, and protocols for exercise stress testing; discuss the contraindications, administration protocols, and side effects for vasodilator (adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenoson) stress testing; and discuss the contraindications, administration protocols, and side effects for dobutamine stress testing.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^bafb846a]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography — reporting requirements and modality effects — the modality of stress and details of the stress test itself should be considered in interpretation, and the report must include baseline and stress systolic function and segmental wall motion, the protocol used, exercise time or dose of pharmacologic agent, maximum heart rate achieved, adequacy of stress, blood pressure response, reason for test termination, cardiac symptoms during the test, and electrocardiographic changes or significant arrhythmias. In similar extents of coronary artery disease (CAD), stress‑induced decrease in ejection fraction or increase in end‑systolic cavity size are more commonly seen with exercise than with dobutamine stress.

### American Society of Nuclear Cardiology and Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging joint position statement on the clinical indications for myocardial perfusion PET [^bf11d7d5]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical indications — preferred use: The recommendations "are general in intent and should not be interpreted as either inclusive or exclusive of specific clinical scenarios." Rest–stress myocardial perfusion PET "is a first line preferred test for patients with known or suspected CAD who meet appropriate criteria for a stress imaging test and are unable to complete a diagnostic level exercise stress imaging study," and "There are no clinical scenarios where PET should not be considered a preferred test for patients who meet appropriate criteria for a stress imaging test and who require pharmacologic stress."

### Arm exercise stress testing: diagnostic options in stable coronary artery disease [^93627ab3]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and prognostic testing in coronary artery disease (CAD) is a rapidly expanding field and now includes a range of functional tests, imaging modalities and combinations of the two (stress imaging). For patients suspected of having occlusive CAD, current European Society of Cardiology and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidancerecommends an approach where the probability of obstructive disease and the risk of future events are estimated to determine the next steps. Those at low-risk on the basis of history, examination and basic investigations do not need further assessment, while those at high-risk can proceed directly to treatment, including invasive angiography, if needed. However, for intermediate risk patients, there are a number of options.

Ideally, investigations for this population should be non-invasive, acceptable and applicable to a wide patient population and affordable for the health service. It should perform well enough to exclude the diagnosis while stratifying the risk of future events in those with occlusive CAD, so providing a guide to future medical or interventional management. None of the currently available options tick every box and a tailored approach is needed for each patient. CT coronary angiography performs well but exposes the patient to ionising radiation and nephrotoxic contrast agents. Stress imaging can be carried out using echocardiography, MRI, positron emission topography or single photon emission CT (SPECT), and can utilise either physiological exercise or pharmacological agents as the stressor. However, often, these tests are expensive, time-consuming, and require highly qualified staff to perform and interpret. Exercise ECG testing is widely available, non-invasive and relatively simple to perform, but can be difficult or impossible to read in those with resting ECG abnormalities. In addition, those who are unable to perform exercise on a bike or treadmill are currently excluded from this test.

### Current methods of pharmacologic stress testing and the potential advantages of new agents [^ef7287c7]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2009). Low credibility.

This article presents the exciting advances made and ongoing in the area of pharmacologic cardiac stress testing. In particular, new A(2A)-specific receptor agonists work like adenosine but promise the delivery of uncomplicated vasodilator stress testing or the diagnosis and prognosis of coronary disease. These agents, although not perfect, do likely present a level of protection against the complications of bronchospasm and heart block. Phase III studies have shown that these agents promise a reduced symptom intensity and greater patient tolerance. One of these agents, regadenoson, is now Food and Drug Administration approved and will be delivered as the same single-dose bolus in all patients, regardless of weight, greatly simplifying the method and increasing its acceptability. Most widely applied with myocardial perfusion SPECT, these agents will find application with PET myocardial perfusion studies and likely MRI studies. Because of their effect on coronary supply rather than demand, they will not be applied with stress echocardiography. Before considering these agents, we will consider the principles and methods of stress testing, and particularly pharmacologic stress testing. The learning objectives of this article are to familiarize the reader with the methods and choices in stress testing for coronary disease diagnosis and prognosis, to present the advantages and disadvantages of pharmacologic stress testing, to review current pharmacologic stress-testing methods and their specific combination with imaging methods, to present the chemistry and effects of the new A(2a)-specific receptor agonists and their advantages compared with existing nonspecific agents, and to help the reader better understand the clinical role of the A(2a)-specific receptor agonists and their application.

### Trials and tribulations of assessing new Imaging Protocols: combining vasodilator stress with exercise [^4f942d22]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Among all patients referred for stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), a substantial proportion in contemporary practice cannot exercise. Another group of patients are those who are thought to be able to achieve an adequate workload with treadmill (or bicycle) exercise but do not achieve at least 85% of maximum predicted heart rate without developing symptoms. There has been substantial interest and literature on the adjunctive use of vasodilator stress during the same visit to generate best-quality results for patients who do not exercise adequately. Current American Society of Nuclear Cardiology Guidelines recommend the possible use of vasodilator stress agents to supplement exercise in those patients who do not achieve target heart rate. However, optimal timing of administration is not clear. Herein, we summarize literature to date on the combination of vasodilator and exercise stress testing in light of the recently published Exercise to Regadenoson in Recovery Trial (EXERRT).

### Clinical and economic outcomes of pharmacological stress tests in patients with a history of COVID-19 [^b6223a57]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the last 2.5 years, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), or COVID‐19, infections affected several million individuals with a broad range of complications and outcomes, ranging from short‐lived effects with no or mild symptoms, to prolonged hospitalizations, severe complications, or death. In addition to their baseline risk, COVID‐19 survivors may have a heightened risk of cardiac complications and may be referred for pharmacologic myocardial perfusion imaging stress tests (pharmacologic MPI) for symptoms related, or not, to their prior COVID‐19 infection., Depending on the local setting, COVID‐19 incidence, and availability, the use of pharmacologic MPI may be recommended instead of an exercise stress test to reduce droplet exposure risk and thus avoid the potential spread of COVID‐19. Although lab closures in response to local and national recommendations early in the pandemic resulted in reduced cardiac diagnostic testing procedures, volumes of procedures in the United States and Canada in 2021 slightly surpassed prepandemic levels. However, it remains unknown whether a prior COVID‐19 infection impacts the safety of pharmacologic MPI.

Guidelines recommend regadenoson as the preferred coronary vasodilator agent for pharmacologic MPI during the pandemicdue to its shorter infusion time (10 seconds) compared with several minutes for adenosine and dipyridamole, which helps to minimize contact time between health professionals and patients. In the event of serious or intolerable adverse effects during pharmacologic MPI, reversal agents such as caffeine and the adenosine receptor antagonist (aminophylline) can be administered to reverse the effects of the vasodilator agent., In the regadenoson phase 3 trials of 2015 patients undergoing pharmacologic MPI (median [range] age: 66 [26–93] years; primarily White males), 3% of patients receiving regadenoson (n = 46/1337) and 2% of those receiving adenosine (n = 12/678) received reversal agents. Recently, Hasnie et al. reported that 1 out of 15 patients (6.7%) who recently recovered from COVID‐19 used aminophylline.

The aim of this study was to assess if a prior COVID‐19 infection was associated with a higher risk of complications during and following pharmacologic MPI testing. Specifically, the effect of a prior history of COVID‐19 infection on reversal agent use, subsequent healthcare visits, all‐cause costs, and cardiac events/procedures following pharmacologic MPI was examined.

### Advances in pharmacologic stress agents: focus on regadenoson [^9f3e01df]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2010). Low credibility.

Myocardial perfusion imaging using radionuclides is a well-established protocol for determining the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of coronary artery disease. Pharmacologic stress agents are used to induce cardiac hyperemia in patients unable to achieve the target workload by physical exercise alone. The vasodilators adenosine and dipyridamole are most commonly used, with dobutamine used only when these agents are contraindicated. However, because of frequent and intense side effects, as well as complex procedures both for patients and the nuclear medicine staff, there is room for improvement in these traditional stress agents. An ideal stress agent would be effective, safe, and well tolerated; have a simple protocol; be suitable for use in patients with reactive airway disease; and have few restrictions for the patient to adhere to before the procedure. Neither adenosine nor dipyridamole are receptor-specific, and act on A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) adenosine receptors. As it is the A(2A) receptor that mediates the desired coronary vasodilation, the A(1), A(2B), and A(3) adenosine receptors are deemed responsible for most side effects associated with adenosine and dipyridamole. A(2A)-selective pharmacologic stress agents should mediate the required hyperemic response while reducing the frequency of adverse events. The only selective A(2A) adenosine receptor agonist currently approved for clinical use as a pharmacologic stress agent for myocardial perfusion imaging is regadenoson. Regadenoson has demonstrated non-inferiority to adenosine for detecting reversible myocardial perfusion defects in phase 3 trials, and patients were more comfortable during the regadenoson stress procedure than during an adenosine infusion. As regadenoson dosing is not dependent on patient weight or renal impairment and can be administered by rapid injection, it has the potential to simplify the stress procedure, reduce costs, and streamline the working day for the staff of the nuclear medicine department. In this review, the need to improve on older pharmacologic stress agents will be considered, along with an assessment of how A(2A) receptor agonists fulfill that potential. Practical aspects of regadenoson are reviewed, and the impact that A(2A) receptor agonist use may have on the nuclear medicine department is evaluated.

### The role of pharmacological stress testing in women [^00d6554b]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pharmacological stress is an alternative method to dynamic exercise that combined with noninvasive imaging allows the detection of flow-limiting coronary artery disease (CAD). It represents the stress procedure of choice in patients who cannot exercise appropriately. In women, pharmacological stress combined with myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) has demonstrated to be highly accurate for the detection of obstructive CAD and a valuable tool that helps separate patients at low cardiac risk from those with an adverse prognosis. Pharmacological stress with positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging is increasingly used in the investigation of suspected obstructive CAD; available evidence shows that the diagnostic profile and prognostic value of stress PET imaging is similar to that of stress MPS in women.

### Evaluating the use of pharmacological stress agents during single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging tests after inadequate exercise stress test [^07ec2e60]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

New Knowledge Gained

This article provides new information on the efficiency of PSA use for patients converting from EST to PSA SPECT-MPI tests in real-world settings and confirms same-day conversion occurs for the majority of patients. Past research on the testing of conversion patients has been in clinical trial settings, focused on a subset of the available stress agents on the market, or been limited to perspectives from staff at single centers. This study compares real-world use of adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenoson across 50 imaging centers in the US, including a breakdown of staff time requirements at each step of the testing process.

### Evaluating the use of pharmacological stress agents during single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging tests after inadequate exercise stress test [^2a1b49c4]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Past clinical trial findings suggest that the availability of regadenoson in a nuclear imaging center may affect real-world center practices related to the transition of patients from an inadequate exercise stress test (EST) to a pharmacological stress agent (PSA).

Methods and Results

This was a cross-sectional study using one-on-one telephone interviews with nuclear imaging center staff to facilitate survey development, followed by an online survey to evaluate patterns and processes around use of PSAs during single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) in patients with inadequate ESTs. Of the 50 participants, 35 (70%) used only regadenoson, 3 (6%) only adenosine, 3 (6%) regadenoson and adenosine, 7 (14%) regadenoson and dipyridamole, and 2 (4%) all 3 agents for converting patients from an inadequate EST to a PSA. Nearly all centers (94%) used protocols to guide conversions. Of 12 centers using > 1 PSA, 11 reported regadenoson to be the most preferred PSA. Total staff time required from PSA transition to post-test monitoring was shortest for regadenoson.

Conclusions

Compared to adenosine and dipyridamole, regadenoson is preferred by nuclear imaging center staff and associated with operational efficiencies after inadequate EST in real-world practice SPECT-MPI.

Exercise stress testing — limitations and minimum duration state that exercise stress testing has a lower diagnostic value in patients who cannot achieve an adequate heart rate and blood pressure (BP) response due to a noncardiac physical limitation, and these patients should be considered for pharmacologic stress testing with myocardial perfusion imaging; also, for a meaningful test evaluation, exercise should last at least 4 to 6 minutes.

### Let's get physical: myocardial stress tests – A student's perspective [^8f1f7d77]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2020). Medium credibility.

Myocardial perfusion imaging is a routine study that helps determine whether blood flow to the heart muscle is normal or abnormal. There are 3 parts to myocardial imaging: a resting scan with a radioactive tracer, stressing of the myocardium, and a stress scan with a radioactive tracer. For the resting scan, a radioactive tracer is injected into the patient to obtain a set of images of the myocardium at rest. After the resting scan comes stressing of the myocardium. There are 2 different ways to stress the myocardium. The first is to have the patient exercise on a treadmill following a specific exercise protocol, and the second is to use a pharmacologic stressing agent if the patient cannot exercise. Pharmacologic stressing agents produce coronary artery vasodilation and increased myocardial blood flow. During exercise stress, the heart rate should preferably reach 85% of the maximum heart rate and the patient should be symptomatic or fatigued. The technologist injects the patient with the radioactive tracer at peak stress and then obtains a second set of images. Of the 2 different ways to stress the myocardium, physical stress is preferred to pharmacologic stress.

### Optimizing the assessment of patient clinical risk at the time of cardiac stress Testing [^0abdf42a]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Due to a marked temporal decline in inducible myocardial ischemia over recent decades, most diagnostic patients now referred for cardiac stress testing have nonischemic studies. Among nonischemic patients, however, long-term risk is heterogeneous and highly influenced by a variety of clinical parameters. Herein, we review 8 factors that can govern long-term clinical risk: coronary risk factor burden; patient symptoms; exercise capacity and exercise test responses; the need for pharmacologic stress testing; autonomic function; musculoskeletal status; subclinical atherosclerosis; and psychosocial risk. To capture the clinical benefit provided by both assessing myocardial ischemia and these additional parameters, the authors propose that a cardiac stress tests report have an additional component beyond statements as to the likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease and/or magnitude of ischemia. This added component could be a comment section designed to make referring physicians aware of aspects of long-term risk that may influence clinical management and potentially lead to changes in the intensity of risk factor management, frequency of follow-up, need for further testing, or other management decisions. In this manner, the increasingly frequent normal stress test result might more commonly influence treatment recommendations and even patient behavior, thus leading to improvement in patient outcomes even in the setting of normal stress test results.

### Exercise stress testing: indications and common questions [^4eb0d7af]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Exercise stress testing is a validated diagnostic test for coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients, and is used in the evaluation of patients with known cardiac disease. Testing of asymptomatic patients is generally not indicated. It may be performed in select deconditioned adults before starting a vigorous exercise program, but no studies have compared outcomes from preexercise testing vs. encouraging light exercise with gradual increases in exertion. Preoperative exercise stress testing is helpful for risk stratification in patients undergoing vascular surgery or who have active cardiac symptoms before undergoing nonemergent noncardiac surgery. Exercise stress testing without imaging is the preferred initial choice for risk stratification in most women. Sensitivity and specificity increase with the use of adjunctive imaging such as echocardiography or myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography. Exercise stress testing is rarely an appropriate option to evaluate persons with known coronary artery disease who have no new symptoms less than two years after percutaneous intervention or less than five years after coronary artery bypass grafting. The Duke treadmill score has excellent prognostic value for exercise stress testing. Imaging is not necessary if patients are able to achieve more than 10 metabolic equivalents on exercise stress testing. Exercise stress testing is not indicated before noncardiac surgeries in patients who can achieve 4 metabolic equivalents without symptoms.

### Update on exercise stress testing [^ac214118]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Exercise stress testing is an important diagnostic tool for the evaluation of suspected or known cardiac disease. In 2002, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) revised their guidelines for exercise testing. Ten categories from the ACC/ AHA 1997 guidelines were modified: ST heart rate adjustment, unstable angina, older patients, acute coronary syndromes, chest pain centers, acute myocardial infarction, asymptomatic patients, valvular heart disease, rhythm disturbances, and hypertension. Adjustment of the ST heart rate can identify myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic patients with elevated cardiac risk. Intermediate- and low-risk patients with unstable angina, acute coronary syndromes, or chest pain should undergo exercise stress testing when clinically stable. Provided they are stable, patients who have had acute myocardial infarction can undergo a submaximal exercise test before discharge or a symptom-limited exercise stress test any time after two to three weeks have elapsed. In asymptomatic patients with cardiac risk factors, the exercise stress test may provide valuable prognostic information. Aortic regurgitation is the only valvular heart disorder in which there is significant evidence that exercise stress testing is useful in management decisions. The stress test also can be used in older patients to identify the presence of coronary artery disease. However, because of other comorbidities, a pharmacologic stress test may be necessary. Exercise stress testing can help physicians successfully evaluate arrhythmia in patients with syncope. The exercise stress test also can help identify patients at risk of developing hypertension if they show an abnormal hypertensive response to exercise.

### 2024 AHA / ACC / ACS / ASNC / HRS / SCA / SCCT / SCMR / SVM guideline for perioperative cardiovascular management for noncardiac surgery: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^f0253bf4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Stress testing — functional capacity thresholds and modality selection: Functional capacity of < 4 METs (for example, patients unable to climb 1–2 flights of stairs or walk on a flat surface at ≥ 3 mph) is associated with increased risk for perioperative cardiac events; in patients with elevated risk for perioperative cardiovascular events and functional capacity < 4 METs or indeterminate functional capacity, a stress test may be considered when high-risk myocardial ischemia is suspected or when there is an indication for testing independent of planned surgery. In general, an exercise stress test is preferable to a pharmacological stress test if the patient is able to exercise, and in patients unable to exercise, selection of a pharmacological stress test modality should be based on patient factors and local availability and expertise; there is, however, limited evidence to support coronary revascularization before NCS in stable patients.

### Non-invasive assessment of low-and intermediate-risk patients with chest pain [^26813bb7]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a significant global public health burden despite advancements in prevention and therapeutic strategies. Common non-invasive imaging modalities, anatomic and functional, are available for the assessment of patients with stable chest pain. Exercise electrocardiography is a long-standing method for evaluation for CAD and remains the initial test for the majority of patients who can exercise adequately with a baseline interpretable electrocardiogram. The addition of cardiac imaging to exercise testing provides incremental benefit for accurate diagnosis for CAD and is particularly useful in patients who are unable to exercise adequately and/or have uninterpretable electrocardiograms. Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging and echocardiography with exercise or pharmacological stress provide high sensitivity and specificity in the detection and further risk stratification of patients with CAD. Recently, coronary computed tomography angiography has demonstrated its growing role to rule out significant CAD given its high negative predictive value. Although less available, stress cardiac magnetic resonance provides a comprehensive assessment of cardiac structure and function and provides a high diagnostic accuracy in the detection of CAD. The utilization of non-invasive testing is complex due to various advantages and limitations, particularly in the assessment of low- and intermediate-risk patients with chest pain, where no single study is suitable for all patients. This review will describe currently available non-invasive modalities, along with current evidence-based guidelines and appropriate use criteria in the assessment of low- and intermediate-risk patients with suspected, stable CAD.

### Guidance and best practices for reestablishment of non-emergent care in nuclear cardiology laboratories during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: an information statement from ASNC, IAEA, and SNMMI: endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^a746ad21]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Stress laboratory considerations during COVID-19 emphasize droplet exposure reduction and pharmacologic stress: The goals are to perform a safe test for the patient and minimize droplet exposure to healthcare professionals and patients. If possible, consider pharmacologic testing preferably using vasodilator stress agents to decrease droplet exposure risk, especially in patients who are not known to be COVID-19 negative; pharmacologic testing is not inferior to exercise testing in terms of diagnostic performance. Regadenoson may be the preferred stress agent (if available and not contraindicated), since it requires a single 10 second infusion, after which providers can maintain a safe distance from the patient, and for adenosine and dipyridamole stress testing, extra-long tubing can be used to keep distance between staff and patients.

### Evaluating the use of pharmacological stress agents during single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging tests after inadequate exercise stress test [^a863392b]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Nuclear Imaging Staff and Center Characteristics

Of the 105 respondents, 50 completed the survey and were included in the analysis. Among the 55 respondents who did not complete the survey, 46 initiated but terminated the survey before completion for unknown reasons, 6 indicated they did not work closely with patients undergoing SPECT-MPI, 2 indicated they worked at centers that only did de novo pharmacological stress tests, and 1 did not initiate completion of the survey.

Characteristics of the nuclear imaging staff and centers are summarized in Table 1. More than half of the respondents (56%) were nuclear technicians/technologists, and the most common types of centers were hospital-affiliated diagnostic imaging centers (48%) or academic or teaching hospitals (18%). Most centers (94%) used protocols to convert patients from an inadequate EST to a PSA.

### Comparison of the current reasons for undergoing pharmacologic stress during echocardiographic and radionuclide stress testing [^b476e207]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Symptom-limited exercise is the preferred method of cardiac stress testing, but pharmacologic testing has been increasing over time. The exact reasons for pharmacologic stress testing have not been rigorously categorized. Thus, we systematically explored the reasons for pharmacologic stress testing in patients referred for cardiac stress imaging.

Methods

We studied consecutive patients referred for stress imaging [stress echocardiography or radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)] at Mount Sinai St Luke's hospital between August 2013 and April 2014. Baseline information was obtained using a standardized questionnaire and a trained physician triaged the patient for symptom-limited exercise stress testing or pharmacologic stress testing.

Results

In total, 551(48%) of our entire stress cohort underwent cardiac imaging following initial exercise testing and 589 (52%) underwent imaging with initial pharmacologic stress testing. Deconditioning and inability to walk (primarily due to musculoskeletal conditions) constituted the top two reasons for performing pharmacologic stress, followed by frailty, left bundle branch block (for MPI), resting wall motion abnormality (for echocardiography), and failed exercise attempts. The reasons for performing pharmacologic stress testing were similar in the MPI and echocardiography patients, despite a much higher level of disease acuity in the MPI group.

Conclusions

We have applied a systematic approach for categorizing the reasons for pharmacologic stress. These reasons are heterogeneous, but similar across MPI and echo stress laboratories.

### Should simultaneous exercise become the standard for adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging? [^91432a25]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Concomitant low-level treadmill exercise with adenosine pharmacologic stress (AdenoEx) during radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging has become commonly used in recent years, particularly in large-volume laboratories. A number of studies have demonstrated a beneficial impact of AdenoEx protocols. These benefits include decreased side effects, improved safety and patient tolerance, improved target-to-background ratios because of less subdiaphragmatic activity, and improved sensitivity and defect reversibility. In light of these benefits, recent reviews and guidelines call for the addition of low-level exercise to adenosine stress whenever possible.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^5774b2e3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes — candidates and modalities for cardiac testing: Candidates for advanced noninvasive cardiac testing include those with symptoms or signs of cardiac or vascular disease and an abnormal resting electrocardiogram (ECG). Exercise ECG testing without or with echocardiography may be used as the initial test. In adults with diabetes ≥ 40 years of age, measurement of coronary artery calcium is also reasonable for cardiovascular risk assessment. Pharmacologic stress echocardiography or nuclear imaging should be considered when resting ECG abnormalities preclude exercise stress testing, and individuals unable to exercise should undergo pharmacologic stress echocardiography or nuclear imaging.

### CR-ACNM-NASCI-SNMMI-SPR-STR practice parameter for the performance of cardiac scintigraphy [^e734a880]. SNMMI (2024). High credibility.

Cardiac scintigraphy — physical exercise stress endpoints and medication considerations: For patients who are physically able to exercise, the desired endpoint is a heart rate of at least 85% of the age-predicted maximum predicted heart rate (MPHR) or a workload of at least 5 mets. The patient must be monitored frequently for abnormal change in blood pressure, marked ST changes on the electrocardiogram, development of serious arrhythmias, severe chest pain, or other signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia. Beta-blocking and calcium-channel-blocking medications often prevent the patient from achieving the desired heart rate and may reduce the sensitivity of the test; depending on the clinical necessity or the clinical question, these agents may need to be discontinued by the patient's physician prior to examination for a time sufficient to obviate their pharmacologic effect.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin after cardiac stress test: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^c5731637]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. This systematic review and meta‐analysis was performed following the guidelines of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis). 8

Search Strategy

We searched the published literature using strategies created by a medical librarian for published evidence on hs‐cTn and exercise or pharmacological stress testing with a publication cutoff date of June 30, 2016. To exclude animal studies, the librarian used the human filter for Medline recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 9 and modified it to create similar filters for the other databases searched. The librarian established search strategies using a combination of standardized terms and key words, and implemented it in Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessments, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database. We also conducted a search in clinicaltrials.gov. We searched for all studies in which high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs‐cTnT) or high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs‐cTnI) were evaluated before and after cardiac stress testing. Key words were "stress," "adenosine," "dobutamine," "troponin T," "troponin I," and "high‐sensitivity troponin." Two authors systematically screened titles and abstracts of studies identified in the search and excluded unrelated studies independently. Moreover, they verified the remaining full articles and reference lists.

Eligibility Criteria

The article or abstract was included in this meta‐analysis if it met the following criteria: (1) original article or abstract that evaluated the association between cardiac stress testing and hs‐cTn; and (2) hs‐cTn was measured before and after exposure cardiac stress testing. Since hs‐cTn assays have been introduced only during the past decade, we excluded all records before 2008. Articles or abstracts were excluded if the study population included patients who had active symptoms of myocardial ischemia or infarction, such as discomfort, pain, stress, or increased physical activity before the first hs‐cTn concentration was measured. Review articles, case reports, and studies without reference interval values for troponin were also excluded. If multiple publications overlapped or were duplicated, the most comprehensive study was used to extract the information needed.

### ACR-ACNM-SNMMI-SPR-STR practice parameter for the performance of cardiac positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET / CT) [^2dc1af8c]. SPR/ACNM/STR/SNMMI/ACR (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac PET/CT practice parameter — goals, CT role, and preferred use — The primary goals of cardiac positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) include evaluation of perfusion, function, viability, inflammation, anatomy, and risk stratification for cardiac-related events, and maximum diagnostic accuracy is achieved when images are interpreted with other relevant imaging, clinical information, and laboratory data. In cardiac PET/CT, CT is used for attenuation correction and anatomic coregistration of PET data and may be used for an assessment of coronary calcium most commonly through semi-quantitative analysis. Cardiac PET/CT is a preferred test for patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease who are appropriate for stress imaging and are unable to undergo exercise stress imaging, and it is the preferred test for all patients who are appropriate for pharmacological stress imaging.

Factors Related to the Conversion of Patients

Factors related to the conversion of patients from an inadequate EST to a PSA are summarized in Table 2. Same-day conversion occurred for the majority of patients across agents (92%, 89%, and 98% for regadenoson, adenosine, and dipyridamole, respectively). The mean number of patients converted in the past 30 days was highest for regadenoson (n = 30), followed by adenosine (n = 9) and dipyridamole (n = 2), with most centers having the PSA readily available (ranging from 67% for dipyridamole to 98% for regadenoson). After an inadequate EST, mean patient wait time to receive the PSA was shortest for regadenoson (4.9 minutes vs 12.4 and 17.4 minutes for adenosine and dipyridamole, respectively). Centers using regadenoson (59.6%) following an inadequate EST were more likely to administer the PSA within a mean of 3 minutes during recovery, while only 1 center using dipyridamole reported administering the PSA within 3 minutes; no centers using adenosine reported administering the PSA within in a mean of 3 minutes.

Table 2
Factors Related to the Procedure/Practice to Convert Patients From Inadequate EST to PSA

EST, exercise stress test; PSA, pharmacological stress agent; SD, standard deviation

a Adverse reactions that required some type of treatment or intervention

Centers were asked about the complexity of administering a PSA following an inadequate EST; how the levels of complexity were interpreted was left up to the discretion of the respondent. A large majority of centers rated regadenoson administration as "not at all complex" (98%), as opposed to 38% and 11% for adenosine and dipyridamole, respectively. Adenosine and dipyridamole administration were more commonly rated as "moderately complex" (63% and 78%, respectively). The proportions of patients experiencing adverse reactions were similar across the PSAs, at 20%, 16%, and 32% for regadenoson, adenosine, and dipyridamole, respectively (Table 2). Only adverse reactions requiring some type of treatment or intervention were reported. Of 12 centers that used > 1 PSA, 11 centers (92%) found regadenoson to be the most preferred PSA (overall) among staff.

### Evaluating the use of pharmacological stress agents during single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging tests after inadequate exercise stress test [^1ace9842]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using an online survey, this study sought to characterize the resources, best practices, and time involved in PSA use during SPECT-MPI for patients with an inadequate EST from the perspective of nuclear imaging center staff. The findings show that regadenoson was the most commonly used and most preferred PSA for conversion after an inadequate EST. Regadenoson was used by centers because of convenience and a reasonable adverse event profile. The majority of patients using regadenoson were converted on the same day with minimal impact to laboratory scheduling. Note that while most centers in this study preferred regadenoson, other real-world studies with regadenoson as a comparator have demonstrated that adenosine is less expensive and results in fewer adverse events due to its short half-life; similar results have been seen for dipyridamole.

### Comparison of long-term mortality risk following normal exercise vs adenosine myocardial perfusion SPECT [^22ebfde9]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stress testing using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for myocardial perfusion imaging is currently widely used to guide many common medical management decisions, such as the need for cardiac catheterization among diagnostic patients or the need for myocardial revascularization among patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD). A basis of such use is the understanding that a normal stress SPECT study reliably identifies low-risk patients who can be successfully managed without the need for aggressive interventions. With respect to exercise SPECT, repeated investigation has confirmed that normal SPECT studies define patients with < 1% annualized event rate for cardiac events. It is widely assumed that normal pharmacological SPECT studies also identify low-risk patients, yet meta-analysis of this issue indicates that normal pharmacological stress studies are associated with somewhat higher event rates compared to those reported for exercise SPECT. This difference has been attributed to the greater age and co-existing morbidities that are usually present among patients who require pharmacological stress testing in lieu of exercise. However, is it possible that pharmacological stress simply limited in its ability to identify patients who are at low risk for cardiac events? Given the now large percent of SPECT studies currently performed with pharmacological stress, such a finding could be of great management significance. To examine this issue, we applied propensity analysis to compare long-term mortality among age and risk profile-matched patients manifesting a normal scintigraphic study during exercise vs adenosine myocardial perfusion SPECT.

### Current advances in vasodilator pharmacological stress perfusion imaging [^94ead758]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

More than 7 million stress perfusion studies are performed in the United States annually, 44% with pharmacological vasodilator stress agents. Both adenosine and dipyridamole are nonselective coronary vasodilators that are commonly used for stress perfusion imaging. These agents are safe and provide an effective means to diagnose coronary artery disease. A newer agent, regadenoson, is an adenosine receptor agonist that is selective for coronary vasodilation. Regadenoson is noninferior to adenosine for the detection of ischemia and is better tolerated by patients. Recent trials such as INSPIRE (Adenosine Sestamibi Post-Infarction Evaluation) and the COURAGE (Results from Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Guideline-driven Drug Evaluation) Nuclear Imaging Substudy have established clearly that noninvasive risk stratification with vasodilator testing is an important and appropriate step in guiding medical therapy and invasive coronary intervention.

### Regadenoson in Europe: first-year experience of regadenoson stress combined with submaximal exercise in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^1caf2920]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although dynamic exercise is the preferred form of stress for myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), many patients are unable to exercise maximally and pharmacological stress is common. At our institution, pharmacological stress is the default form of stress because most patients have already been considered for or have undergone an exercise ECG. An efficient and effective way of stressing coronary function in this setting is with the use of vasodilators. Adenosine and dipyridamole are both potent primary coronary vasodilators with a nonselective action, which explains the side effects commonly associated with these agents. To avoid side effects and potential adverse events, a number of selective adenosine A 2A receptor agonists have been developed. Of these, regadenoson is the only one approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration. Approval was granted by the European Medicines Agency in 2010 and by the Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust New Drugs and Clinical Guidelines Committee in May 2011. Since July 2011, we have used regadenoson as the default form of stress, and we now have the largest experience outside North America. The main objective of this study was to assess the side effect profile, safety and tolerability of regadenoson in patients undergoing clinically indicated MPS. A secondary objective of the study was to compare this experience with other forms of cardiac stress.

Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Exercise or pharmacological stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is an integral part of the non-invasive evaluation of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients who are ambulatory and able to walk on a treadmill are often referred for exercise MPI. However, the diagnostic accuracy of exercise MPI studies is suboptimal in patients unable to achieve 85% of maximum predicted heart rate (MPHR) and 5 metabolic equivalents (METs). Ambulatory patients who are not expected to achieve adequate stress are often referred for pharmacologic stress testing combined with low-level or symptom-limited exercise.-This approach has been shown to be well tolerated, improve image quality, and diminish side effects.-Moreover, the addition of symptom-limited exercise has also been shown to generate incremental prognostic data complementary to MPI results. However, it is sometimes difficult to predict whether a patient will achieve adequate exercise stress. When exercise is inadequate, changing to pharmacological stress with agents such as adenosine or dipyridamole can involve delays associated with preparation for infusion. In turn, that can disrupt lab scheduling and potentially require rescheduling of the test to another day. The availability of the pharmacologic stress agent regadenoson, which is administered as a fixed-dose rapid injection, creates the opportunity for its use as an adjunctive stress agent in patients who undergo exercise testing and fail to achieve adequate exercise stress.-,-Single center studies using regadenoson in combination with exercise have been generally favorable;,-, however, adverse reactions have been reported. Nevertheless, the comparability of this approach with the administration of regadenoson without exercise has not previously been investigated in a large clinical trial.

In order to investigate the assessment of reversible perfusion defects (RPDs) and the safety when regadenoson is administered during recovery following inadequate exercise stress, we conducted the multicenter, multicountry, open-label, randomized parallel design clinical trial described herein. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate that the strength of agreement between single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging with regadenoson administered during recovery following inadequate exercise stress testing and regadenoson SPECT imaging without exercise was not inferior to the strength of agreement between two sequential regadenoson SPECT images without exercise and to assess safety.

### Cardiac stress imaging for the prediction of very long-term outcomes: dobutamine stress echocardiography or dobutamineTc-sestamibi SPECT? [^0f52bce8]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis reported higher annualized cardiac events for patients with normal pharmacological SPECT (1.78%) compared to patients with normal exercise SPECT (0.65%). Several reasons have been attributed for these difference; patients who underwent pharmacological stress SPECT are older, have more co-morbidities and has an increased number of risk factors for CAD. In the current study, we found an annualized hard cardiac event rate of 1.3% for normal dobutamine stress MPI. From a clinical perspective, patients unable to perform exercise tests who have a normal MPI have a good prognosis and could be spared invasive evaluation of the coronary arteries. Based on the current findings, both a normal DSE and a normal stress MPI identified low- and high-risk patient groups. As a consequence, both stress modalities could be used interchangeably in identifying low-risk patient group.

Both DSE and MPI have developed rapidly over the past years and have emerged as a valuable tool for diagnosis and prognosis of CAD. These imaging methods have inherent differences: SPECT probes myocardial hypoperfusion, whereas DSE probes systolic dysfunction. According to the ischemic cascade, a series of biochemical reactions that occurs after inadequate myocardial blood supply, perfusion abnormalities precede systolic dysfunction. This may influence the sensitivity and specificity of MPI and DSE for the evaluation of myocardial ischemia. DSE is less sensitive in detecting CAD for mild disease, but more specific for the overall patient group. Stress SPECT has a higher diagnostic accuracy in patients with multivessel CAD. A recent multicenter studycompared commonly used imaging techniques and found that both MPI and stress echocardiography had good diagnostic accuracy for CAD (area under the curve 0.74 and 0.70, respectively). Our findings show that there are comparable implications in risk-stratifying patients, using either modality. Which of these modalities is most suitable still depends on the patients clinical status, availability, and local expertise and costs.

This study has some limitations. First, the prognostic value of gated SPECT was not examined, due to the fact that at the time of data collection gated SPECT was not routinely performed in our center. As a result left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was not available. Also, LVEF was not routinely examined during DSE. Information about LVEF could have improved the current analysis. Second, attenuation or scatter correction during stress SPECT was not routinely performed. Previous studies have shown that attenuation correction contribute to optimize further risk stratification. Third, the patient population was relatively small. This could have influenced the results.

### A pretest prognostic score to assess patients undergoing exercise or pharmacological stress testing [^a4d705cd]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

A previously developed pretest score was validated to stratify patients presenting for exercise testing with suspected coronary disease according to the presence of angiographic coronary disease. Our goal was to determine how well this pretest score risk stratified patients undergoing pharmacological and exercise stress tests concerning prognostic endpoints.

Design

Retrospective cohort analysis.

Setting

University hospital stress laboratory.

Patients

7452 unselected ambulatory patients with symptoms of suspected coronary disease undergoing stress testing between 1995 and 2004.

Main Outcomes Measures

All-cause death, cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction.

Results

The rate of all-cause death was 5.5% (CI 5.0 to 6.1) with 4.3 (SD 2.4) years of follow-up (Exercise 2.8% (CI 2.3 to 3.2) v Pharmacological group 11.9% (CI 10.5 to 13.3); p < 0.001). The rate of cardiac death/myocardial infarction was 2.6% (CI 2.2 to 3.0) (Exercise 1.4% (CI 1.1 to 1.8) v Pharmacological group 5.3% (CI 4.3 to 6.2); p < 0.001). In both groups, stratification by pretest score was significant for all-cause death and the combined endpoint. However, stratification was more effective in the pharmacological group using the combined endpoint rather than all-cause death. Pharmacological stress patients in intermediate and high risk groups were at higher risk than their respective exercise test cohorts. Referral for pharmacological stress testing was found to be an independent predictor of time to death (2.7 (CI 2.0 to 3.6); p < 0.001).

Conclusion

A pretest score previously validated to stratify according to angiographic outcomes, effectively risk stratified pharmacological and exercise stress patients according to the combined endpoint of cardiac death/myocardial infarction.

Conclusions

Results from this meta‐analysis suggest that hs‐cTn rising patterns after exercise and pharmacological stress testing appear inconsistent and comparably small and do not appear to be correlated with inducible myocardial ischemia. These results cast doubt on the idea that rising patterns of hs‐cTn may be used to stratify patients after cardiac stress testing.

Stress imaging for silent ischemia in ventricular arrhythmias — recommendations state that exercise testing with an imaging modality (echocardiography or nuclear perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) is recommended to detect silent ischemia in patients with ventricular arrhythmias who have an intermediate probability of having coronary heart disease (CHD) and in whom ECG assessment is less reliable because of factors including digoxin use, LVH, and greater than 1-mm ST-segment depression at rest, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, or left bundle-branch block (LBBB) (Level of Evidence: B); pharmacological stress testing with an imaging modality (echocardiography or myocardial perfusion SPECT) is recommended in similar patients who are physically unable to perform a symptom-limited exercise test (Level of Evidence: B).

### Initial diagnostic evaluation of stable coronary artery disease: the Need for a patient-centered strategy [^5ea3dafd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The authors do quote existing guidelines but do not stress that these guidelines offer specific scenarios for some of the recommendations; they also seem to overstate the impact of their findings. It is clear that not all patients with suspected CAD are the same and risk factors, pre‐existing diagnoses, ability to exercise, the interpretability of an ECG, and the purpose of the evaluation should be considered in the selection of noninvasive testing. The European Society of Cardiology Guidelines clearly base noninvasive test selection for the initial diagnosis of CAD on the pretest likelihood of CAD and actually make a Class I recommendation for GXT in patients with an intermediate likelihood of CAD who have an interpretable ECG and can exercise. 3 A virtually identical recommendation is made by the 2012 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, as supported by the appropriate use criteria. 4, 5 Thus, it appears that no guidelines recommend cardiac imaging procedures as the initial test in this population, although the European Society of Cardiology document does indicate that stress imaging is an initial testing option depending on local expertise. Both guidelines suggest stress imaging when the pretest likelihood is higher than intermediate or when the resting ECG is uninterpretable. It also is obvious that GXT cannot be considered the initial testing option when patients are unable to exercise and pharmacologic stress imaging or CCTA would clearly be rational and appropriate. 3, 4 Thus, while GXT may well serve as the first‐line test in some patients, all guidelines indicate that cardiac imaging (stress echocardiography, stress cardiac magnetic resonance, stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging, and CCTA) may be selected and in fact preferable in many patients.

Cardiac scintigraphy — patients and preparation states that patients should be evaluated for appropriateness of the test and their ability to undergo physical or pharmacologic stress safely, and that patients who are unable to exercise may be stressed pharmacologically, although pharmacologic stress may also be contraindicated if physical stress is not tolerated for cardiac reasons. All patients undergoing stress should have intravenous access, wear comfortable clothing and shoes, and external attenuating objects should be removed, if possible. Patients should fast for at least 4 hours before stress; they may have sugar‑free beverages before the redistribution phase of a thallium examination but otherwise should remain fasting and not exercise more than is absolutely necessary. Because xanthines interfere with dipyridamole and adenosine, they must be discontinued for 24–48 hours before the examination if these agents are to be used.

### FDA approves imaging drug for evaluation of myocardial ischemia… [^f4e01d58]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Flyrcado in adult patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease to evaluate for myocardial ischemia and infarction. Flyrcado is a cyclotron-produced radioactive diagnostic drug for positron emission tomography myocardial perfusion imaging under rest or stress. Flyrcado is administered by intravenous injection. Effectiveness The efficacy and safety of Flyrcado were evaluated in two prospective, multicenter, open-label clinical studies in adults with either suspected CAD or known or suspected CAD.

Study 1 evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of Flyrcado for the detection of significant CAD in subjects with suspected CAD who were scheduled for invasive coronary angiography. Study 2 evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of Flyrcado for the detection of significant CAD in subjects with known or suspected CAD who had ICA without intervention within 60 days prior to imaging or were scheduled for ICA. Across three Flyrcado imaging readers, estimates of sensitivity ranged from 63% to 77% and estimates of specificity ranged from 66% to 86% for CAD defined as at least 50% narrowing of an artery.

Safety Information The most common adverse reactions were dyspnea, headache, angina pectoris, chest pain, fatigue, ST segment changes, flushing, nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, and arrhythmia. Exercise or pharmacologic stress itself is associated with risk of serious adverse reactions, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction, stroke, and seizure. Healthcare professionals should perform stress testing in the setting where cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff are readily available. When pharmacologic stress is selected as an alternative to exercise, healthcare professionals should perform the procedure in accordance with the pharmacologic stress agent's prescribing information.

Indications for pharmacologic and vasodilator stress perfusion imaging — The indications for pharmacologic stress testing are similar to those for exercise stress testing except that exercise cannot be adequately performed, and the indications for vasodilator stress perfusion imaging are the same for exercise myocardial perfusion imaging in the presence of the following: (1) inability to perform adequate exercise due to noncardiac physical limitations or due to lack of motivation; (2) baseline electrocardiographic abnormalities including LBBB, ventricular pre-excitation (WPW syndrome), and permanent ventricular pacing; (3) risk stratification of clinically stable patients into low- and high-risk groups after acute myocardial infarction; and (4) diagnosis or risk stratification after emergency department presentation with presumptive acute coronary syndrome excluded by serial clinical evaluation, ECGs, and serum markers. As with exercise testing, anti-ischemic cardiac medications (including β-blockers, nitrates, and calcium antagonists) have been reported to decrease the diagnostic accuracy of vasodilator stress testing.

Stress echocardiography report — The report "should include the study date, type of stress test performed (i.e., exercise treadmill, supine bike, pharmacologic), and indication for the test." "The test indication should describe the clinical question being addressed." It specifies that "the imaging protocol should be stated, as well as the exercise time, pharmacologic peak dose, maximum heart rate, systolic blood pressure (BP) response to stress, and if the appropriate level of stress was achieved," and "the adequacy of the workload, such as rate pressure product (RPP), based on age and sex should be included in the report." Additionally, "If cardiac symptoms, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or arrhythmias are present and/or if the test needs to be terminated early, the report should note these events," and "At each protocol stage [exercise baseline, post-exercise and pharmacologic (baseline and low, intermediate, and peak dose)], relevant changes in structure, function, and physiology should be reported." The summary statement "should include the presence or absence of myocardial ischemia, ECG evidence of ischemia or dysrhythmia, patient's symptoms during stress, and pertinent baseline echocardiographic findings."

### Evaluating the use of pharmacological stress agents during single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging tests after inadequate exercise stress test [^9a9d8109]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Regadenoson administration was considered "not at all complex" by a majority of nuclear imaging center staff, who further benefited with respect to reductions in total staff time for each step of the conversion process relative to adenosine and dipyridamole. Compared to adenosine and dipyridamole, use of regadenoson required less nuclear imaging center staff time, which may be due to its convenient administration and rapid onset of action. As a time saving agent, regadenoson is associated with operational efficiency for nuclear imaging staff. This may also impact the overall costs to the center, and the experience of the patient during SPECT-MPI testing.

Observed benefits of regadenoson are consistent with and supplement findings from previous studies that have collectively demonstrated its potential to create more efficient/effective diagnosis for several reasons, including accurate stress testing, better use of patient time, and use of a more streamlined stress protocol.–Friedman et al fielded an online survey to nuclear medicine technologists (n = 141) from cardiovascular imaging centers in the US to characterize regadenoson's laboratory efficiency relative to adenosine and dipyridamole. Regadenoson was associated with the shortest total time for MPI testing, as well as time from PSA administration to the start of imaging and to adverse event management, thereby offering the most operational efficiency. Another study described higher satisfaction with regadenoson vs dipyridamole from both clinician/technologist and patient standpoints when using validated questionnaires. Most recently, the aforementioned EXERRT trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of administering regadenoson at 3 minutes of recovery after an inadequate EST, provided that patients do not present with electrocardiographic changes or other signs or symptoms of ischemia. Of note, the survey found that a majority of centers using regadenoson administered regadenoson within 3 minutes on average for patients experiencing an inadequate EST.

### Comparison of risk stratification with pharmacologic and exercise stress myocardial perfusion imaging: a meta-analysis [^da7b04e3]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and exercise stress MPI have comparable diagnostic accuracy, their comparative value for risk stratification of patients with known or suspected coronary disease is not known.

Methods and Results

The data of 14,918 patients were combined from 24 studies evaluating prognosis in patients undergoing either pharmacologic stress or exercise stress MPI. Studies were included if a 2 x 2 table for hard cardiac events (cardiac death and myocardial infarction [MI]) could be constructed from the data available. Excluded were studies performed for post-MI, post-revascularization, or preoperative risk stratification. A weighted t test was used to compare the cardiac events, and a random effects model was used to calculate summary odds ratios. Summary odds ratios for hard cardiac events were similar for pharmacologic stress and exercise stress MPI. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves also showed no difference in discriminatory power between the stressors. The cardiac event rates were significantly higher with normal and abnormal test results with pharmacologic stress MPI than with exercise stress MPI (1.78% vs 0.65% [P < .001] for normal results and 9.98% vs 4.3% [P < .001] for abnormal results). Subgroup analysis revealed that both cardiac death and nonfatal MI were significantly higher with pharmacologic stress MPI. Patients undergoing pharmacologic stress MPI had a significantly higher prevalence of poor prognostic factors, and meta-regression revealed that exercise capacity was the single most important predictor of cardiac events.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis shows that exercise stress MPI and pharmacologic stress MPI are comparable in their ability to risk-stratify patients. However, patients undergoing pharmacologic stress studies are at a higher risk for subsequent cardiac events. This is true even for those with normal perfusion imaging results.

ACR–ACNM–SNMMI–SPR–STR cardiac PET/CT — goals and preferred use — The primary goals of cardiac positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET/CT) include evaluation of perfusion, function, viability, inflammation, anatomy, and risk stratification for cardiac-related events such as myocardial infarction and death. Maximum diagnostic accuracy is achieved when images are interpreted in conjunction with other relevant imaging, clinical information, and laboratory data. Cardiac PET/CT is a preferred test for patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD) who are appropriate for stress imaging and are unable to undergo exercise stress imaging, and it is the preferred test for all patients who are appropriate for pharmacological stress imaging.

### EANM procedural guidelines for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT and SPECT / CT: 2015 revision [^4eb66d0a]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Indications

The indications are the same as for exercise MPI, but refer to patients who are not able to or who are expected to be unable to achieve ≥ 85% of maximal age-predicted heart rate during exercise. Vasodilators (without exercise) should be preferred to exercise in cases of left bundle branch block or ventricular paced rhythms (Fig. 1). Considering diagnostic performance of MPI, there is no significant difference among the stress agents and modalities.

Fig. 1
Selection of stress test modality. Except for patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) or ventricular paced rhythm, consider combining pharmacological vasodilatory stress with low-level exercise according to the ability of the patient to exercise. In case of pharmacological stress with dobutamine but without adequate heart rate response, consider to add atropine

Combination with low-level exercise

Low-level exercise can be performed routinely in conjunction with vasodilator tests. Low-level exercise significantly reduces vasodilator-induced side effects (flushing, dizziness, nausea, headache, hypotension) and improves image quality due to lower bowel activity and higher target-background ratio. Accordingly, if possible, low-level exercise is recommended in combination with vasodilator stress testing.

Regadenoson dose

Regadenoson is given as a slow bolus over 10 s followed by a 10 s flush of 5–10 mL NaCl 0.9%, and 10–20 s later the radiopharmaceutical is injected (Fig. 2). Regadenoson is administered independent of patient weight in a dose of 0.4 mg in 5 ml.

Vasodilator stress testing — Stress testing with vasodilators (dipyridamole or adenosine) may be performed for assessment of ischemia, myocardial perfusion, and myocardial viability, but these agents are contraindicated in patients with reactive airway obstruction or severe hypotension. Dipyridamole is safely given up to 0.84 mg/kg over 6 to 10 minutes, and atropine administration or handgrip exercise at peak infusion increases test sensitivity.

### Adenosine to facilitate the clipping of cerebral aneurysms: literature review [^a34080cf]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Contraindications

Overall, adenosine via bolus or by infusion is safe to use because of very limited side effects that are rapidly reversible with termination of administration, and it can be easily titrated to a desired effect. Nevertheless, some contraindications exist (table 1).

Adenosine can cause myocardial ischaemia in patients with coronary artery disease; it vasodilates healthy coronary arteries but not diseased ones, because they are already maximally dilated. This can cause a coronary steal phenomenon shunting blood away from diseased, underperfused areas to non-ischaemic areas. This principle underlies adenosine usage in cardiac stress testing. Multiple authors caution its use in patients with a preoperative history of myocardial infarction (MI) and recommend avoiding it in patients with severe left main coronary artery stenosis (80%) or severe multivessel coronary artery disease (three vessels or grafts with 80% stenosis).

Adenosine-induced AV block is due to a direct adenosine effect rather than a manifestation of ischaemia, and this fact underlies its clinical use in stopping supraventricular tachycardia. The Adenoscan Multicenter Trial Registry was a prospective phase III trial using fixed dose, continuous infusion adenosine in patients referred for clinically indicated cardiac perfusion imaging who were unable to perform exercise stress testing. A dosage of 0.14 mg/kg/min of adenosine was infused for 6 min but terminated early if the patient developed significant side effects. In 9256 patients, 12 had bronchospasm (0.13%), 1 had an MI (0.01%) and 1 developed pulmonary oedema (0.01%). Only 4.7% of the total adverse events were classified as severe by the investigators. While 7.6% of patients (706 out of 9256) developed transient atrioventricular conduction block, the authors note that there was no difference in occurrence of ischaemia between those with versus without AV block.

### A prognostic scoring system for arm exercise stress testing [^dfdb1a3d]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

For the ≥ 50% of patients unable to perform treadmill or other leg exercise, we have developed a scoring system for prediction of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality over 5 and 12 years and cardiovascular mortality or MI over 5 years using easily obtainable information from arm exercise ECG stress testing. No other scoring system and few prognostic data are currently available for arm exercise testing. However, we have recently observed that arm exercise is an equivalent or superior alternative to pharmacological MPI for many patients who are unable to perform lower extremity exercise. As illustrated in figure 3, this is further emphasised by the higher area under the curve of C-statistic plots for prediction of mortality with arm exercise ECG stress test scores than for pharmacological MPI results. Arm exercise also provides important functional and physiological information on exercise capacity, heart rate recovery and clinical symptoms relevant to patient management decisions such as referral for cardiac catheterisation. This information is not available with pharmacological MPI or echocardiographic evaluations. Although arm and leg exercise ECG stress tests are less sensitive for detection of cardiac ischaemia than MPI, we have demonstrated a close relationship between an abnormal arm exercise ECG result and the size and reversibility of perfusion defects. Arm exercise ECG testing does not require exposure to ionising radiation and is several times less expensive and time consuming for patients and staff than pharmacological imaging. Institutional resource and space requirements are also much less for arm exercise ECG testing than for treadmill or pharmacological imaging evaluations.

### Evaluating the use of pharmacological stress agents during single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging tests after inadequate exercise stress test [^9a7b153d]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge the limitations of this study. First, obtaining data via an online survey may limit the generalizability of the findings. For example, the nuclear imaging center staff who agreed to participate may have provided responses that are not representative of all US nuclear imaging centers that perform SPECT-MPI using PSAs after inadequate ESTs. Roles varied among survey respondents, and some groups were more represented (e.g. nuclear technicians) than others (e.g. physicians). As a result, the findings may not be broadly generalizable to the less represented roles. Surveying nuclear lab directors only may have produced more generalizable results considering the purpose of this study was to assess resource use in the nuclear lab setting. Regadenoson use was highly represented among survey respondents, while a smaller number of centers that reported using adenosine or dipyridamole responded to the survey. For example, one would expect that adenosine's post-monitoring period would be comparatively short due to the short half-life of the agent. However, the small sample size (only 3 sites collected data for adenosine monitoring time) prevented us from drawing conclusions regarding this counter-intuitive observation. Given this, results associated with adenosine and dipyridamole use should be interpreted carefully, as trends could differ with a larger sample. Additionally, there may be other factors related to the efficiency of PSAs during SPECT-MPI that were not specified in the survey.

In conclusion, regadenoson is preferred by nuclear imaging center staff and associated with operational efficiency for converting patients from inadequate EST to PSA in real-world practice.

### Arm exercise stress testing: diagnostic options in stable coronary artery disease [^a514e3b7]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Xie et al recognised that a large proportion of patients referred for stress testing were unable to perform the required exercise for the test due to common comorbidities such as peripheral vascular disease and arthritis. In a previous paperthey demonstrated that, in this population, measures derived from arm exercise ECG stress testing (figure 1) were a feasible alternative to physiological and pharmacological stress imaging with SPECT. In the current paper, published in Open Heart, they used the same retrospective cohort to produce a risk stratification score analogous to that commonly used for treadmill stress testing. The equations produced, incorporating arm exercise capacity, 1 min heart rate recovery and ST segment depression ≥ 1 mm, perform well in predicting future cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality and total mortality, especially once adjusted to account for common adverse clinical characteristics.

Figure 1
A patient performing arm exercise stress testing.

Some limitations of the study should be acknowledged. The cohort examined had a markedly high mortality rate (27.1% at 5 years and 57.8% at 12 years) reflecting a very high-risk for adverse events. Current approaches tend to use stress ECG tests in patients with lower pretest probability of occlusive CAD, meaning that the performance of the test may not be as good in the population it is to be applied in. Against this, the higher mortality likely reflects the additional burden of comorbidity in this patient group and this would still be the case in clinical practice.

Another consideration is where to place arm exercise stress testing among the plethora of diagnostic options available, especially as existing guidance favours a stress-imaging approach even in low-intermediate probability patients. Despite this, there are some situations where the stress ECG option proves useful. Cardiologists are considering treatment options for an increasing number of patients with multiple comorbidities, including those that limit mobility. Stress ECG testing is a viable option to confirm diagnosis in such patients who would not be suitable for or would not want invasive management of CAD, so reducing the need for functional imaging. Those who have diagnosis confirmed derive substantial symptomatic and prognostic benefit from medical therapy while those who have occlusive CAD excluded are spared the side effects and risks of polypharmacy. It is also important to remember that, even if management stays the same, diagnostic and prognostic information can still be useful for patients and their relatives.

Finally, the current study is retrospective and the scores created need refinement and validation using randomised, prospective data. Ideally, this work should also incorporate measures to consider patient acceptability of the test and health economic evaluation.

New Knowledge Gained

Dobutamine stress echocardiography and dobutamine stress 99m Tc-sestamibi SPECT are comparable in predicting long-term (> 14 years) cardiac mortality and hard cardiac events in high-risk patients (patients unable to perform exercise testing). From a clinical view, both techniques can be used interchangeably to classify patients as low or high risk of cardiac events.

### Use of downstream stress imaging tests for risk stratification of patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain and low HEART score [^34c8336e]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Study design and population

We conducted a prospective single-centre interventional study in Ontario province, Canada. Between March 2019 and March 2021, an assessment was conducted to determine the eligibility for study enrolment of all patients who presented to the ED with suspected cardiac chest pain. ED physicians used the HEART score for risk stratification and ACS probability assessment. The initial evaluation included five key components: the presenting history of the patient, ECG, age, cardiovascular risk factors and troponin levels. Patients with LRHSs (defined as scores of ≤ 3) were discharged from the ED in < 6 hours without further intervention and were included in our analysis. All included patients provided a written informed consent to participate in the study and agreed to undergo the NISI test. They were followed up after < 30 days by a cardiologist in a dedicated chest pain clinic designed for the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with obvious non-cardiac chest pain, such as musculoskeletal or traumatic cases; see figure 1.

Figure 1
Patients inclusion. ED, emergency department; LRHSs, low-risk heart scores; NISI, non-invasive stress imaging.

Non-invasive stress imaging

All the included patients underwent SE or SPECT, as these are the most commonly available NISI in real-world clinical practice. The treadmill was the recommended exercise method for physically active patients, while pharmacological stress agents (dobutamine for SE and dipyridamole for SPECT) were used for physically inactive individuals. The choice of imaging modalities (SE vs SPECT) was primarily determined through patient–physician conversations (radiation risk and anthropometric implications on test diagnostic accuracy), test booking capacity and patient preferences.

SE results were assessed according to the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. The studies were defined as normal (normally augmented myocardial segments), abnormal (new regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of stress-inducible myocardial ischemia) or inconclusive (uninterpretable images). SPECT scan was performed using Technetium-99m with a 2-day stress/rest protocol. The reporting of the SPECT studies adhered to the guidelines of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology. Results were categorised as normal (no reversible perfusion defects), abnormal (presence of > 5% reversible perfusion defects or transient left ventricular dilatation without perfusion defects) or inconclusive (uninterpretable images).

All patients undergoing stress should have intravenous access and should wear comfortable clothing and shoes, and external attenuating objects should be removed, if possible. Patients should fast for at least 4 hours prior to exercise or pharmacologic stress; they may have sugar-free beverages prior to the redistribution phase of a thallium study but otherwise should remain NPO and not exercise more than is absolutely necessary.

Stress testing modalities (Table 2) — exercise (bicycle/treadmill), dobutamine, and dipyridamole/adenosine — are contrasted by physiology, test selection, hemodynamics, and contraindications. Exercise preserves integrity of the electro-mechanical response and is the preferred stress for patients who can attain an adequate level of exercise for known or suspected CAD, with systolic blood pressure ↑↑ by 50%. Dobutamine stimulates beta-1 adrenoceptors with the effect of increased heart rate and/or contractility; contraindications include hemodynamically significant LV outflow tract obstruction and severe systemic hypertension (resting systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg). Vasodilators increase coronary blood flow through effects on adenosine A2A receptors, and myocardial blood flow may be ↑ 3 to 5 times that of resting blood flow; they are the preferred test for myocardial perfusion, with contraindications including pronounced active bronchospastic airway disease.

Resource use and time

Total staff time (aggregating time for multiple staff members who may have worked concurrently at each step) required from PSA transition to post-test monitoring (Figure 1) was shortest for regadenoson (Table 3). The mean time needed in minutes for the transition to PSA was 10.5 minutes for regadenoson, 26.7 minutes for adenosine, and 36.9 minutes for dipyridamole. For administration, the mean time was 49.7 minutes for regadenoson, 83.5 minutes for adenosine, and 73.2 minutes for dipyridamole. Administration refers to the process from the start of PSA administration to the start of the SPECT-MPI procedure post-stress. This included, but was not limited to, PSA infusion time. For the remaining steps, the mean time was 41.5 minutes for regadenoson, 60.9 minutes for adenosine, and 53.0 minutes for dipyridamole for the SPECT-MPI following PSA and 8.8 minutes for regadenoson, 29.6 minutes for adenosine, and 15.9 minutes for dipyridamole for post-test monitoring. While the safety profile was comparable across agents, the total staff time involved with managing adverse reactions was shorter for regadenoson compared to adenosine or dipyridamole. Centers using regadenoson (34%) were less likely to conduct post-test monitoring, which included evaluating patient performance and managing adverse reactions, compared to 63% of centers using adenosine, and 44% of centers using dipyridamole. Staff numbers and time required for SPECT-MPI procedure with use of regadenoson compared to adenosine and dipyridamole, with a breakdown by staff role, are presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

### Preoperative stress testing: new guidelines [^a9a0b345]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

To date, there are no well controlled trials in the literature that demonstrate an outcome benefit using stress testing as a screening procedure before noncardiac surgery. Perioperative beta-blockade significantly decreases morbidity and mortality, and thus reduces any potential benefit stress testing may have in identifying patients who may advance to more invasive treatment. Preoperative percutaneous coronary intervention has unproven perioperative benefit, and coronary artery bypass graft carries risks that often offset the risk of noncardiac surgery. Unless an outcome benefit from cardiac testing and procedures can be demonstrated in a properly designed trial, their use should generally be restricted to situations in which symptoms or other cardiac findings warrant cardiac evaluation and treatment, regardless of upcoming surgery.

### Liraglutide to improve corONary haemodynamics during exercise streSS (LIONESS): a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled crossover trial [^89a7284f]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The duration of liraglutide therapy may be a limiting factor. A more sustained period of active agent may have stimulated greater improvements in exercise haemodynamics. Adequate compliance with study agents was strongly encouraged and the number of empty syringes were recorded at every trial visit. Significant differences in HBGM, weight, lipid profile and gastrointestinal side effects would suggest participants were compliant with their study agents and biologically meaningful GLP-1R activation was achieved. Moreover extending the trial beyond 6 weeks would have been logistically difficult, may have allowed a training effect to emerge, and could have resulted in more recruits withdrawing from the trial prematurely to proceed to elective coronary revascularisation.

The diagnostic value of exercise tolerance testing as a modality to detect reversible myocardial ischaemia in the context of current guideline-mandated algorithms, might also be questioned. We accept exercise stress testing has relatively poor sensitivity (mean 67%) and specificity (mean 72%) depending on which published report you read. In the context of the LIONESS trial, however, this was acceptable given that all patients were required to have established CAD confirmed by coronary angiography. The determination of the functional significance of every coronary stenosis deemed obstructive angiographically was not a prerequisite for trial inclusion, but this potential flaw was countered by the need for evidence of inducible ischaemia from a baseline ETT for every trial participant.

Pharmacological agents used to replicate exercise stress are more likely to achieve ≥ 85% of THR during stress echocardiography, stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear myocardial perfusion scanning. These imaging modalities study left ventricular function and regional wall motion (so can therefore better localise the distribution of ischaemia) but not the exercise haemodynamics via specific electrophysiological parameters we were investigating. Moreover exercise is preferred over pharmacological testing because exercise can induce higher physiological stress and better correlation between symptoms and physical work capacity than that achieved by pharmacological testing. Moreover, recruits achieved on average > 81% of their THR during the trial which validates the ability of serial exercise testing to induce reproducible myocardial ischaemia.

### Multimodality imaging guidelines of patients with transposition of the great arteries: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in Collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^1b79c90b]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Exercise and stress echocardiography — overview and practical considerations: The exercise or pharmacologic stress test can be a useful adjunct to the postoperative assessment of a patient with TGA, and stress testing necessitates administering a stressor and evaluating the effects with a sensor such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, SPECT, or CMR. The value of stress echocardiography is assessment of myocardial perfusion, contractile reserve, and general hemodynamics in a nonresting state, but obtaining adequate images during exercise can be challenging; strategies include having the patient hold an exhalation or obtaining images during the immediate recovery phase, and for patients without residual shunts, contrast agents can be given to enhance cardiac opacification. Finally, pharmacologic stress can be used as a surrogate for exercise and will avoid motion and respiratory artifact associated with exercise testing.

### FDA warns of rare but serious risk of heart attack and death with… [^0f26bf7f]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is warning health care professionals of the rare but serious risk of heart attack and death with use of the cardiac nuclear stress test agents Lexiscan and Adenoscan. We have approved changes to the drug labels to reflect these serious events and updated our recommendations for use of these agents. Health care professionals should avoid using these drugs in patients with signs or symptoms of unstable angina or cardiovascular instability, as these patients may be at greater risk for serious cardiovascular adverse reactions. Lexiscan and Adenoscan are FDA approved for use during cardiac nuclear stress tests in patients who cannot exercise adequately. Lexiscan and Adenoscan help identify coronary artery disease. They do this by dilating the arteries of the heart and increasing blood flow to help identify blocks or obstructions in the heart's arteries.

Lexiscan and Adenoscan cause blood to flow preferentially to the healthier, unblocked or unobstructed arteries, which can reduce blood flow in the obstructed artery. In some cases, this reduced blood flow can lead to a heart attack, which can be fatal. We recommend that health care professionals and their patients discuss any questions or concerns. Facts about Lexiscan and Adenoscan
- Lexiscan or Adenoscan are administered by intravenous injection during a cardiac nuclear stress test to patients who cannot adequately exercise. These drugs dilate the coronary arteries and increase blood flow so that coronary artery obstructions can be identified.
- Screen all nuclear stress test candidates for their suitability to receive Lexiscan or Adenoscan.
- Avoid using these drugs in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia such as unstable angina or cardiovascular instability; these patients may be at greater risk of serious cardiovascular reactions to Lexiscan or Adenoscan.
- intravenous dipyridamole
- dobutamine
- Review the updated Lexiscan and Adenoscan labels for the latest recommendations.
- Report adverse events involving Lexiscan or Adenoscan to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the "Contact FDA" box at the bottom of this page.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^5679d7b6]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Table 12 — Recommendations for stress echocardiography in patients with symptoms or suspected stable coronary artery disease — non-invasive testing for ischemic heart disease (IHD) states that in suspected stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with intermediate pretest probability and preserved ejection fraction, stress imaging, such as stress echocardiography, is preferred as the initial test option; in patients without typical angina, an imaging stress test is recommended as the initial test for diagnosing stable CAD if the pretest probability is high or if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reduced; with resting electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities that prevent accurate interpretation of ECG changes during stress, an imaging stress test is recommended; with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and symptoms consistent with IHD, stress echocardiography (either exercise stress echocardiography [ESE] or dobutamine stress echocardiography [DSE]) is preferred over SPECT imaging because of greater specificity and versatility for detecting other cardiac conditions associated with LBBB; for women with an indication for a noninvasive imaging test for known or suspected CAD, stress echocardiography is the preferred test because of safety and greater specificity; for children with suspected IHD, ESE is the preferred imaging stress test because of the absence of radiation, the absence of need for an intravenous line, and the assessment of exercise capacity; a pharmacologic stress test such as DSE is recommended when patients who meet these indications are unable to exercise; in exertional dyspnea of uncertain etiology, stress echocardiography is the preferred test and tricuspid regurgitation velocity and diastolic function should be assessed at rest and with stress; an imaging stress test should be considered in patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and new cardiac symptoms; and an imaging stress test should be considered to assess the functional severity of intermediate lesions on coronary arteriography.

### Clinical and economic outcomes of pharmacological stress tests in patients with a history of COVID-19 [^794bbb6a]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Our study shows that patients with a history of COVID‐19 infection undergoing pharmacologic MPI had a slightly higher reversal agent use than those without prior COVID‐19 history (8.8% vs. 7.7%, respectively). Among patients who underwent pharmacologic MPI, subsequent resource use and costs were minimally impacted by COVID‐19 history (difference USD $128; 95% CI $73–$181). History of COVID‐19 infection did not appear to impact cardiac events or procedures such as angiography/catheterization, revascularization, or AMI.

In a much smaller single‐center study of 15 patients undergoing SPECT MPI (4 exercises, 11 pharmacologic [all regadenoson]) after recovery from COVID‐19‐related hospitalization, none experienced any serious adverse events during or after stress testing, with only one patient requiring a reversal agent (aminophylline). In our study, reversal agent use was slightly lower in patients who had experienced severe versus nonsevere COVID‐19 (8.4% vs. 9.0%) and in patients who had recovered from COVID‐19 versus those with active COVID‐19 infection (8.7% vs. 11.0%). However, the nonadjusted rates may still be confounded and these differences are likely not clinically significant.

### Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography expert consensus document on myocardial computed tomography perfusion imaging [^ab4b1bc4]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2019). High credibility.

Use of pharmacologic stress agents and nitroglycerin in CTP — Only vasodilator stress agents are used; their application in CTP is off‑label, and agent‑specific logistics and tolerability differ, while sublingual nitroglycerin is generally avoided close to stress. Myocardial CTP stress testing uses only vasodilator stress agents at present. Exercise and dobutamine are not practical options for CTP due to the elevated heart rates that would preclude diagnostic imaging with most currently available CT platforms. While there are no agents approved for myocardial CTP, adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenoson are FDA approved for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging. Therefore, their use in CTP imaging is off‑label. Specific considerations for vasodilator stress CTP include the need for two IV's for both continuous infusion of adenosine and contrast injection, while regadenoson and dipyridamole require only one IV for alternating injections. A potential disadvantage of regadenoson is the higher heart rate compared with other vasodilators, which may lead to more motion artifacts during CTP acquisition. However, regadenoson tends to be better tolerated and has been tested in single center CTP studies and a randomized diagnostic accuracy study that compared CTP and SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging. Overall, regadenoson was similarly tolerated in regards to adverse events between CTP and SPECT imaging. Nitroglycerin is commonly used prior to coronary CTA to dilate the coronary arteries and improve image quality and detection of plaque. As it is also a vasodilator, simultaneous administration of nitroglycerin and a vasodilator stress agent can lead to hypotension. A 10–20 min separation between nitroglycerin and vasodilator stress agent administration is recommended to avoid this. As CTP aims to induce a vasodilatory stress physiology in the myocardium, sublingual nitroglycerin is most often avoided prior to stress CTP.

### The clinical use of stress echocardiography in non-ischaemic heart disease: recommendations from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^3fea4a84]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Dobutamine stress haemodynamics — systemic, LV, and contractile effects: Dobutamine increases determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption with heart rate "two‑ to three‑fold," end‑diastolic volume "1.2‑fold," and systolic arterial pressure "1.5‑ to 2.0‑fold." Myocardial contractility "increases over four‑fold in normal subjects and much less (so less than two‑fold) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy." β‑2 receptor activation contributes to "the mild decrease in blood pressure common at higher dobutamine dose." During infusion, left ventricle (LV) end‑systolic volume decreases more than LV end‑diastolic volume while cardiac output rises, and "LV volumes and wall stress increase less with dobutamine" than with exercise.

### Choices in noninvasive cardiac stress testing… [^36ea8895]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Exercise electrocardiography is the most widely available method of cardiac stress testing and the least expensive option, and has been the most extensively researched. Certain subgroups of patients are not appropriate candidates for treadmill testing. Use of beta blockers or other anti-ischemic medications by patients undergoing treadmill testing can lead to erroneous results related to blunting of normal exercise-induced blood pressure and pulse changes, or masking of underlying cardiac ischemia. Ideally, these medications should be stopped several days before testing, although this step may not always be prudent or possible. |Angina and a history of revascularization| Radionuclide imaging is the next most commonly employed modality to screen for cardiac ischemia.

While the sensitivity and specificity of this mode is only modestly better than that of treadmill testing, this technique has the added capability of defining ischemic versus already infarcted myocardial tissue. When patients cannot exercise adequately to produce cardiac stress, pharmacologic agents, including adenosine, dipyridamole, and dobutamine may be used to provoke ischemia. Stress echocardiography is a recent addition to the diagnostic-testing arena. Like nuclear medicine techniques, it can provide information about ischemic versus infarcted tissue and can also evaluate left ventricular function and valvular pathology. No large trials have compared the various stress testing techniques in a randomized fashion. Moreover, the availability of and expertise levels for the various modalities vary widely in different regions.

Cost-effectiveness analyses are available but have had conflicting results because of differing estimates of sensitivity and specificity for the different testing techniques. Published guidelines have consistently advocated treadmill testing as the initial diagnostic test for men and women with suspected stable angina. The authors conclude by presenting their own summary recommendations. In patients who do not have any of the clinical factors mentioned in the accompanying table, they recommend proceeding with treadmill testing. If the patient can vigorously exercise and no abnormality is detected, they suggest no further testing in this low-risk category. In high-risk patients, they recommend proceeding directly to cardiac catheterization in most cases. Intermediate risk patients, such as those with atypical chest pain or moderate exercise capacity, are candidates for radionuclide imaging techniques.

### Prognostic usefulness of cardiac stress test modalities in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (from the basel asymptomatic high-risk diabetics' outcome trial) [^dfca3e11]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Our study aimed to assess predictors of the stress test technique used and to evaluate the impact of exercise level achieved on risk stratification in patients with asymptomatic type 2 diabetes without a previous coronary artery disease. Little is known whether co-morbidities of these patients predict the stress technique and whether physical performance provides risk stratification: 400 patients underwent clinical evaluation and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) using physical or pharmacological stress. Physical patients were divided into 2 groups: achieving < 6 and ≥ 6 METs, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 2 years. Major cardiac events (MACEs) included myocardial infarction and/or cardiac death. Independent predictors of pharmacological stress were a body mass index of > 30kg/m 2 (hazard ratio 1.076, 95% confidence interval 1.027 to 1.127, p = 0.002) and a peripheral arterial disease (hazard ratio 2.888, 95% confidence interval 1.446 to 5.769, p = 0.003). Pharmacological patients had more MACE than physical patients (3.2% vs 1.0%, p = 0.03). Patients achieving < 6 METs had a similar MACE rate as pharmacological patients (3.0% vs 3.2%, p = not significant) and more MACE than patients achieving ≥ 6 METs (3.0% vs 0.4%, p = 0.01). In patients achieving < 6 METs and in pharmacological patients, MPS added an incremental prognostic value to pretest information (p values for global chi-square 0.012 and 0.04, respectively). In high-risk asymptomatic diabetic patients, co-morbidities were predictive of the stress technique used. Pharmacological patients had more MACE, similar to those unable to achieve 6 METs. MPS provided an incremental prognostic value in pharmacological patients and in patients with < 6METs. In contrast, patients who were able to achieve ≥ 6 METs were at low risk and do not need further risk stratification.

### Noninvasive cardiac testing [^2268fa76]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients with chest discomfort, noninvasive cardiac testing can be used for the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome and for the evaluation of the risk of future cardiovascular events and disease severity in patients with known coronary artery disease. Clinical prediction rules can guide risk assessment for patients with acute or stable chest discomfort. For acute chest discomfort, patients with low risk do not need urgent testing, and those at high risk should have invasive coronary angiography. For acute chest discomfort in patients at intermediate risk, exercise stress testing can provide useful prognostic information on the likelihood of future mortality and survival despite modest sensitivity and specificity for coronary artery disease. Exercise or pharmacologic stress testing with imaging allows dynamic assessment of ventricular function and perfusion. For stable chest discomfort in patients with low risk, coronary artery calcium scoring can be used to exclude calcified plaque or exercise stress testing can be used for the evaluation of future cardiac risk and prognosis. For stable chest discomfort in patients with intermediate or high risk, exercise stress testing or stress testing with imaging (ie, echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) may be used for the evaluation for myocardial ischemia.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^916e2016]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Assessment of contractile reserve for viability — information on viability provided by the resting echocardiogram is often insufficient for clinical decision making, so stress echocardiographic methods that utilize agents to stimulate contraction in dysfunctional but viable myocardium provide more accurate information on the potential for functional recovery. The most widely used method assesses functional responses to dobutamine stimulation, and at low doses the potent inotropic effect of dobutamine can stimulate contraction without a substantial increase in heart rate and oxygen consumption. Dobutamine is the preferred agent for viability assessment, although other agents can be utilized depending on the clinical setting, and excessive increases in myocardial oxygen demand or significant declines in aortic diastolic pressure and coronary driving pressure should be avoided.

Pharmacological Stress Tests

Adenosine and regadenoson have not been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), and as such adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is used as an alternative pharmacologic stress agent. However, dipyridamole and dobutamine are approved by CFDA for pharmacological stress testing. The evidence base for ATP stress testing is not as robust as that for adenosine and regadenoson, and thus further research is needed regarding ATP stress testing.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin after cardiac stress test: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^cbed8e5a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The recent introduction of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs‐cTn) assays has allowed clinicians to measure hs‐cTn before and after cardiac stress testing, but the hs‐cTn release pattern and potential utility in identifying inducible myocardial ischemia are unclear. We thus conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to improve our understanding of hs‐cTn release associated with exercise and pharmacological stress testing.

Methods and Results

Studies published between January 2008 and July 2016 that reported hs‐cTn change values (high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T [hs‐cTnT] or high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin I [hs‐cTnI]) in relation to cardiac stress testing were searched and reviewed by 2 independent screeners. Primary outcomes were pooled estimates of absolute and relative hs‐cTn changes after cardiac stress test, stratified by the presence of inducible myocardial ischemia. This meta‐analysis included 11 studies (n = 2432 patients). After exercise stress testing, hs‐cTnT increased by 0.5 ng/L or 11% (6 studies, n = 406) and hs‐cTnI by 2.4 ng/L or 41% (4 studies, n = 365) in patients with inducible myocardial ischemia versus hs‐cTnT by 1.1 ng/L or 18% (8 studies, n = 629; P = 0.29) and hs‐cTnI by 1.8 ng/L or 72% (4 studies, n = 831; P = 0.61) in patients who did not develop inducible myocardial ischemia. After pharmacological stress test, hs‐cTnT changed by −0.1 ng/L or −0.4% (6 studies, n = 251) and hs‐cTnI by 2.4 ng/L or 32% (2 studies, n = 108) in patients with inducible myocardial ischemia versus hs‐cTnT by 0.7 ng/L or 11% (5 studies, n = 443, P = 0.44) and hs‐cTnI by 1.7 ng/L or 38% (2 studies, n = 116; P = 0.62) in patients who did not develop inducible myocardial ischemia.

Conclusions

hs‐cTn rising patterns after exercise and pharmacological stress testing appear inconsistent and comparably small, and do not appear to be correlated with inducible myocardial ischemia.

### Factors that impact a patient's experience when undergoing single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) in the US: a survey of patients, imaging center staff, and physicians [^7e6e0c48]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Design of survey questionnaire

An online survey questionnaire was developed based on the finalized list of 32 factors from the phone interviews. Screening questions were included at the beginning of the questionnaire in order to verify the participant's eligibility and collect data on participant characteristics (including demographics and experience with SPECT-MPI testing), and all surveys concluded with quality control questions. The majority of questions asked participants to rate the importance of each of the 32 patient experience factors using an 11-point scale (0–10; where 0 signified "not at all important" and 10 signified "extremely important"). Using an 11-point rating scale in the online survey promoted validity and reliability of measurement. Many studies in literature support the notion that validity and reliability is higher for scales with a moderate number of points, with some studies indicating reliability continued to increase up to lengths of 11 points. Therefore, by providing questions with 11-point scales, we were able to capture opinions with granularity without sacrificing reliability. Nine questions related to the care process were also included to further explore patients' experience with nuclear imaging. For example, patients who received pharmacologic-induced (instead of exercise-induced) stress while undergoing SPECT-MPI were asked to select which pharmacologic agent they received; physicians were asked which pharmacologic stress agent they preferred, and center staff were asked which stress agent was most commonly used at their center. Responses available for each question included dobutamine (Dobutrex®), adenosine (Adenoscan®), regadenoson (Lexiscan®), dipyridamole (Persantine®), other/please specify, and do not know/unsure.

The order of rating questions within each category and the order of the five categories (those determined during the targeted literature review) were randomized over respondents to avoid potential effects due to respondent fatigue or other changes in attention throughout the course of the survey.

### Ischemic heart disease: noninvasive imaging techniques and findings [^b202f5ad]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Although originally used in research settings, PET MPI usage in clinical practice has increased over the years, secondary to increased radiotracer availability, new camera technologies, and data demonstrating its advantages over other MPI techniques. Unfortunately, despite its increased availability, PET still remains limited and is an expensive examination.

SPECT Myocardial Perfusion Imaging

SPECT MPI is an older technique that relies on the detection of γ rays emitted from radionuclide agents. In comparison with other imaging methods, SPECT MPI remains the most commonly used noninvasive imaging study in clinical practice for several reasons: its widespread availability, its well-established standardized protocols, familiarity with the modality among providers, and the years of established data for diagnostic accuracy, allowing accurate risk stratification of patients.

As with other stress perfusion methods, SPECT MPI involves obtaining ECG-gated images at stress and rest. There are different protocols detailed in the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology guidelines, and either stress or rest can be performed first, although rest is typically performed first. If performed as a 2-day protocol (preferable for larger patients), the maximum dose of radionuclide is administered for both rest and stress portions of the examination. If done in 1 day, a smaller dose is administered for the rest images and a higher dose for the stress images. Some centers perform stress imaging first in lower-risk patients, with a rest study performed the following day only if stress perfusion defects are present. Stress imaging only is also performed in some centers. SPECT examinations can be performed by using exercise or a pharmacologic stress agent. The radionuclide agent is injected during peak exercise or at the time of peak vasodilation (adenosine, regadenoson, or dipyridamole protocols, as described previously). During exercise SPECT MPI, the examination continues until the patient becomes fatigued or develops symptoms warranting early termination of the test (severe chest pain or dyspnea, dizziness, arrhythmias, or hypotension). Rest images are obtained when the heart is at baseline and involve a second injection of the radionuclide agent. Low-radiation-dose CT can also be performed at SPECT MPI on hybrid SPECT/CT machines for attenuation correction purposes, which significantly improves soft-tissue artifacts. SPECT MPI radionuclide agents include thallium 201 (201 Tl), technetium 99m (99m Tc)–sestamibi, 99m Tc-tetrofosmin, and 99m Tc-teboroxime. Technetium agents are preferred over 201 Tl owing to its shorter half-life (less radiation dose to the patient).

### Guidelines for the management of patients with chronic stable angina: diagnosis and risk stratification [^ac961124]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with suspected chronic stable angina can be evaluated in three stages. In stage one, the clinician uses information from the history, physical examination, laboratory tests for diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and resting electrocardiography to estimate the patient's probability of coronary artery disease (CAD). In stage two, additional testing for patients with a low probability of CAD focuses on diagnosing noncoronary causes of chest pain. Patients with a high probability of CAD have stress tests to assess their risk from CAD, and patients with an intermediate probability of CAD have stress tests to estimate the probability of CAD and assess their risk from CAD. Most patients with new-onset angina can start stress testing with exercise electrocardiography. The initial stress test should be a stress imaging procedure for patients with rest ST-segment depression greater than 1 mm, complete left bundle-branch block, ventricular paced rhythm, preexcitation syndrome, or previous revascularization with percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients who cannot exercise can have an imaging procedure with stress induced by pharmacologic agents. In stage three, patients with a predicted average annual cardiac mortality rate between 1% and 3% should have a stress imaging study or coronary angiography with left ventriculography. Those with a known left ventricular dysfunction should have cardiac catheterization. Patients with CAD who have an estimated annual mortality rate greater than 3% should have cardiac catheterization to determine whether their anatomy is suitable for revascularization. Patients with an estimated annual mortality rate less than 1% can begin to receive medical therapy.

### Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^20b0f2c0]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) assessment before liver transplantation (LT) specifies that "noninvasive testing with echocardiography is indicated for all adult LT candidates." Because "patients with advanced liver disease may be unable to achieve the target heart rate during a standard exercise test," "these patients should undergo pharmacological stress with adenosine, dipyridamole, or dobutamine," with catheterization "if CAD cannot be confidently excluded," and "Dobutamine stress echocardiography is frequently used as the initial screening test." Risks are noted: "Cardiac catheterization in a patient with cirrhosis is more likely to result in vascular complications such as bleeding compared to controls without liver disease," and many decompensated patients have "tenuous renal function, increasing the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy." If "significant coronary artery stenosis (> 70% stenosis) is detected, revascularization may be attempted prior to LT, although rigorous proof of benefit in asymptomatic recipients is lacking," and "Cardiac surgery carries an increased risk in patients with cirrhosis, especially with more decompensated disease."

### Comparison of long-term mortality risk following normal exercise vs adenosine myocardial perfusion SPECT [^05694bc6]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical Significance

For years, normal stress myocardial perfusion imaging has been promulgated as providing a "warranty" for low cardiac risk. Subsequently, various subgroups have been identified as having increased risk despite non-ischemic SPECT responses, including patients with diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and dyspnea. However, even though some studies have also reported relatively increased events in patients undergoing pharmacological stress, by and large, patients with normal pharmacological stress tests are considered as having low cardiac risk, and in our Institution, these patients have manifested the same low referral rate to cardiac catheterization as do patients with normal exercise SPECT. Our findings of a significantly increased mortality risk in propensity-matched adenosine patients, even among younger propensity-matched subjects, raise an important potential caution to the easy assignment of normal pharmacological stress patients to a "low-risk" categorization. Rather, our findings suggest that patients with normal pharmacological stress tests are deserving of closer scrutiny over time compared to patients with normal exercise SPECT studies.

Our findings also indicate the need for further prospective study to identify the underlying reasons for the increased mortality among non-ischemic patients studied by pharmacological means. Such study would assess the role of various inflammatory diseases, occult subclinical atherosclerosis, poor physical fitness and sedentary lifestyle, and other factors in mediating the differences in outcome among exercise and adenosine patients. Future outcome studies should collect prospective information as to the reason(s) for performing pharmacological stress at the time of testing so that component factors that contribute to higher mortality among such patients can be better identified and studied.

### Is the dyspnea during adenosine cardiac stress test caused by bronchospasm? [^3cf18815]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Adenosine cardiac stress is widely used as an alternative to exercise testing during myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). Dyspnea often accompanies the adenosine stress test. Although known asthmatic patients are excluded from this test because of the danger of bronchospasm, there is incomplete information regarding the role of factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and tobacco smoking in adenosine-induced dyspnea.

Patients and Methods

A total of 122 consecutive patients (75 male, 47 female; mean age 59 years, SD 10 years) undergoing pharmacologic stress testing with an intravenous infusion of adenosine also had volume-flow spirometry (Vitalograph Compact, Vitalograph Ltd) before, during, and after the test. The indices assessed were forced expiratory volume in one second, its ratio to the forced vital capacity, and peak expiratory flow rate.

Results

Mild to severe symptoms were experienced by 81% of patients during adenosine infusion. More than half the patients had dyspnea, but there was no associated bronchospasm. Although the patients with COPD showed parameters indicative of bronchial resistance compared with those without this problem, there was no further deterioration after adenosine infusion. Similarly, patients with a history of tobacco abuse, despite showing a tendency toward increasing airways resistance, had no bronchospasm during the administration of adenosine.

Conclusions

(1) Although dyspnea is a common problem during adenosine stress MPI, it is not associated with any appreciable bronchospasm. (2) COPD and tobacco abuse do not appear to be contraindications to adenosine stress MPI studies. However, it is probably safe to exclude patients with severe COPD from adenosine stress MPI until after further evaluation with larger numbers of patients.

Finally, 11 studies were included in the meta‐analysis, 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 46 were excluded because of incomplete or overlapping data. The Figure shows details of the selection process for studies. The collective methodological quality of included studies was good, using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) quality assessment tool for before–after (pre–post) studies with no control group.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

The authors extracted data from included articles independently and the results were cross‐checked. Authors, years, sample size, age, exercise or pharmacological stress test, duration of exercise, detection assay, and mean values of hs‐cTnT and hs‐cTnI levels measured before and after stress test were extracted in each individual article (Table 1). Authors were contacted by email if the required data were unavailable.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of the Studies Included in the Meta‐Analysis

We applied the NHLBI quality assessment tool for before–after (pre–post) studies with no control group 18 to assess the quality of eligible studies. Methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed independently. Any disagreements were resolved by discussions or by consensus including the senior author. All studies were separated into groups according to type of cardiac stress test (exercise or pharmacological stress test) and troponin type (hs‐cTnT or hs‐cTnI). Furthermore, patients who developed myocardial ischemia ("positive stress test") and those who did not were analyzed separately. The only exception was for the studies by LeGoff et al 11 and Kurz et al 10 which did not distinguish between hs‐cTn values of exercise and pharmacological stress tests (we thus added the data to both exercise and pharmacological stress test analyses).

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin after cardiac stress test: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^6b3f204f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background The recent introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays has allowed clinicians to measure hs-cTn before and after cardiac stress testing, but the hs-cTn release pattern and potential utility in identifying inducible myocardial ischemia are unclear. We thus conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to improve our understanding of hs-cTn release associated with exercise and pharmacological stress testing. Methods and Results Studies published between January 2008 and July 2016 that reported hs-cTn change values (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T [hs-cTnT] or high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I [hs-cTnI]) in relation to cardiac stress testing were searched and reviewed by 2 independent screeners. Primary outcomes were pooled estimates of absolute and relative hs-cTn changes after cardiac stress test, stratified by the presence of inducible myocardial ischemia. This meta-analysis included 11 studies (n = 2432 patients). After exercise stress testing, hs-cTnT increased by 0.5 ng/L or 11% (6 studies, n = 406) and hs-cTnI by 2.4 ng/L or 41% (4 studies, n = 365) in patients with inducible myocardial ischemia versus hs-cTnT by 1.1 ng/L or 18% (8 studies, n = 629; P = 0.29) and hs-cTnI by 1.8 ng/L or 72% (4 studies, n = 831; P = 0.61) in patients who did not develop inducible myocardial ischemia. After pharmacological stress test, hs-cTnT changed by -0.1 ng/L or -0.4% (6 studies, n = 251) and hs-cTnI by 2.4 ng/L or 32% (2 studies, n = 108) in patients with inducible myocardial ischemia versus hs-cTnT by 0.7 ng/L or 11% (5 studies, n = 443, P = 0.44) and hs-cTnI by 1.7 ng/L or 38% (2 studies, n = 116; P = 0.62) in patients who did not develop inducible myocardial ischemia. Conclusions hs-cTn rising patterns after exercise and pharmacological stress testing appear inconsistent and comparably small, and do not appear to be correlated with inducible myocardial ischemia.

### Cardiac positron emission tomography and the role of adenosine pharmacologic stress [^96f33bb4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Although single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides excellent diagnostic and prognostic value in the evaluation of coronary artery disease, its progress has slowed relative to emerging modalities, such as cardiac positron emission tomography (PET). PET imaging provides certain advantages versus SPECT, including higher spatial resolution, improved attenuation correction, and the capability to perform quantitative measurements at the peak of stress. Cardiac PET scanning is a well-validated, reimbursable means to noninvasively assess myocardial perfusion, left ventricular function, and viability by dynamically imaging positron-labeled radiopharmaceuticals in vivo. For the stress portion of rubidium-82 (Rb-82) PET protocols, pharmacologic agents are commonly used because of the short half-life of Rb-82. In light of recent advances in cardiac PET equipment, the expansion of PET/computed tomography scanners, and the resulting potential for streamlined protocols, adenosine may become widely used in electrocardiographic-gated rest-stress acquisition protocols with Rb-82 cardiac PET. With the resolution of technical issues, cardiac PET has an opportunity to become the standard for evaluation of myocardial perfusion in the coming years.

### Detrimental effects of nitroglycerin use during regadenoson vasodilator stress testing: a cautionary tale [^dfc7c420]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Vasodilator agents such as adenosine and regadenoson are commonly used pharmacologic stressors to assess for ischemia in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion studies. The recommended reversal agent for this mode of stress is aminophylline, although nitroglycerin is commonly administered as an attempt to reverse the symptoms or electrocardiographic (EKG) changes during the stress test. We demonstrate through two cases that incorrect administration of nitroglycerin can induce hypotension and worsen coronary steal, whereas appropriate administration of aminophylline can reverse the effects of pharmacologic vasodilators. While nitroglycerin is often used in patients with organic angina, it has the potential to worsen ischemia in the setting of pharmacologic vasodilator administration. These cases underscore the importance of administering the correct reversal agent for pharmacologic stress tests.

### The clinical use of stress echocardiography in non-ischaemic heart disease: recommendations from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^c33c0a07]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Vasodilator stress agents — administration options are detailed: dipyridamole 0.84 mg/kg over 6 min or the same dose over 10 min, or an initial dose of 0.56 mg/kg over 4 min sometimes followed by 4 min of no dose and additional 0.28 mg/kg over 2 min; adenosine 140 μg/kg/min over 4–6 min to a maximum of 60 mg; or regadenoson 0.4 mg over 10 s; these are performed without the administration of atropine.

### Moving toward the optimal test for the assessment of myocardial ischemia [^b1b32597]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Second, the authors stressed the importance of exercise stress testing to allow reproduction of symptoms and their correlation with ECG and imaging findings, comparison of functional capacity to the extent of ischemia, and use of the Duke treadmill score for prognostication. Unfortunately, they did not provide data on the additional (if any) information obtained by either of the 2 imaging tests on top of the pure exercise information or the contribution of the exercise information (if any) to the results of the imaging tests. In a previous study with incremental testing using an exercise tolerance test and CMR perfusion imaging, 13 the imaging test provided independent value in patients with high pretest likelihood and incremental value in patients with low pretest likelihood and positive exercise tolerance test (ST segments or symptoms) as well as in patients with intermediate pretest likelihood and a negative exercise tolerance test or only positive by symptoms or ST segments. Patients with low pretest likelihood and normal exercise tolerance test or intermediate likelihood and symptomatic and ST‐segment–positive exercise tolerance test did not require additional imaging testing. Performing such an algorithm in the combined setting might be an effective approach. In general, the question of whether pharmacological or physical stress is the better approach remains scientifically unanswered.

Third, an important question remains the costs of the presented approach. This will be answered in a later study but is important; the use of an ergometer adjacent to the MR scanner may be required for achieving adequate heart rate during the CMR scan but also prolongs the time that the MR scanner cannot be used for imaging. A stress protocol of 8.5 minutes with a recovery time of 6 to 8 minutes, as observed in the EXACT trial, may be similar to a dobutamine stress scan but is significantly longer than an adenosine stress test, which can be done in ≈5 to 7 minutes.

In summary, the current study adds multicenter feasibility and reasonable accuracy of treadmill exercise perfusion CMR to our armamentarium of tests for the assessment of stable CAD. Although this provides us with more options, it also generates additional questions. The quest for the optimal test continues.

### Comparison of long-term mortality risk following normal exercise vs adenosine myocardial perfusion SPECT [^c5c1e4ec]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A higher frequency of clinical events has been observed in patients undergoing pharmacological vs exercise myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). While this difference is attributed to greater age and co-morbidities, it is not known whether these tests also differ in prognostic ability among patients with similar clinical profiles.

Methods and Results

We assessed all-cause mortality rates in 6,069 patients, followed for 10.2 ± 1.7 years after undergoing exercise or adenosine SPECT. We employed propensity analysis to match exercise and adenosine subgroups by age, gender, symptoms, and coronary risk factors. Within our propensity-matched cohorts, adenosine patients had an annualized mortality rate event rates that was more than twice that of exercise patients (3.9% vs 1.6%, P < .0001). Differences in mortality persisted among age groups, including those < 55 years old. In the exercise cohort, mortality was inversely related to exercise duration, with comparable mortality noted for patients exercising < 3 min and those undergoing adenosine testing.

Conclusions

Among patients with normal stress SPECT tests, those undergoing adenosine testing manifest a mortality rate that is substantially higher than that observed among adequately exercising patients, but comparable to that observed among very poorly exercising patients. This elevated risk underscores an important challenge for managing patients undergoing pharmacological stress testing.
