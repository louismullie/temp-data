## Question

Which gene is examined In gene xpert examination of TB

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which gene is examined in the GeneXpert MTB/RIF tuberculosis test. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core purpose and mechanism of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Then, I should verify the specific gene target used for rifampicin resistance. Next, I will check whether additional genes are interrogated in the same cartridge or only in extended assays. Finally, I will reconcile any potential confusion between the MTB/RIF and MTB/XDR assays and confirm the answer with guideline and manufacturer sources.

> Let me first confirm the assay's purpose and mechanism. The Xpert MTB/RIF is a cartridge-based, real-time PCR nucleic acid amplification test that simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance, delivering results in about 2 hours, which is why it is recommended as an initial diagnostic test in many settings [^115mG3qM] [^116c2Ja2].

> Now, I need to verify the gene target for rifampicin resistance. Multiple authoritative sources consistently state that rifampicin resistance is determined by interrogating the rpoB gene, specifically a short 81-base-pair rifampicin resistance–determining region (RRDR) within rpoB, using molecular beacon probes to detect mutations that confer resistance; this is the canonical target for rifampicin resistance in Xpert MTB/RIF [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify whether any other genes are examined in the same MTB/RIF cartridge. I should confirm that Xpert MTB/RIF does not routinely test for isoniazid or other drug-resistance genes in the same run; indeed, the MTB/RIF cartridge focuses on rpoB for rifampicin resistance and relies on multicopy insertion sequences (IS6110/IS1081) to improve detection sensitivity for M. tuberculosis complex, not for additional drug-resistance loci [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there is an extended assay that does test more genes. I need to check the Xpert MTB/XDR cartridge, which is a separate reflex test that expands resistance testing to isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, and second-line injectables by targeting katG, inhA, gyrA, and rrs, respectively; this is distinct from the standard MTB/RIF cartridge and should not be conflated with it [^115nRKRu] [^1129ZaMU] [^112UZkZi].

> Let me reconsider the original question to ensure precision. The user is asking which gene is examined in the GeneXpert examination of TB; if by "GeneXpert examination" they mean the standard Xpert MTB/RIF assay, the answer is the rpoB gene for rifampicin resistance detection, with M. tuberculosis complex detection enhanced by multicopy insertion sequences rather than additional drug-resistance genes in that cartridge [^115nRKRu] [^11762eVp].

> I should double-check that this aligns with WHO guidance and real-world implementation. WHO-endorsed algorithms position Xpert MTB/RIF or Ultra as the initial test for TB and rifampicin resistance, with additional molecular testing (e.g., line probe assays or Xpert MTB/XDR) considered when rifampicin resistance is detected or when broader resistance profiling is needed, reinforcing that rpoB is the key gene in the initial Xpert assay [^115mG3qM] [^113TaV49] [^112UZkZi].

> Final answer: The GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay examines the rpoB gene to detect rifampicin resistance, using probes targeting the rpoB RRDR; it does not, in the same cartridge, test for isoniazid or other drug-resistance genes, which are addressed by separate assays such as Xpert MTB/XDR [^115nRKRu] [^11762eVp] [^1129ZaMU].

The GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay examines the **rpoB gene** [^115nRKRu] to detect rifampicin resistance, using molecular beacons to identify mutations in the 81-bp rifampicin resistance–determining region (RRDR) [^11762eVp]. Xpert Ultra enhances sensitivity with multicopy IS6110/IS1081 targets and refined rpoB probes [^114GeApn] [^113WJJNm]. Xpert MTB/XDR additionally tests **katG, inhA, gyrA, and rrs** for broader drug resistance [^1129ZaMU] [^112UZkZi].

## Gene targets in Gene Xpert examination of TB

### Xpert MTB/RIF assay

- **rpoB gene**: The primary target for rifampicin resistance detection [^115nRKRu]; mutations in the 81-bp RRDR are interrogated by five molecular beacons [^11762eVp].
- **Multicopy insertion sequences**: Xpert Ultra adds IS6110 and IS1081 to improve sensitivity for low-bacillary-load samples [^114GeApn] [^113WJJNm].

---

### Xpert MTB/XDR assay

- **katG and inhA**: Detect isoniazid resistance; katG S315T is the most common mutation, and inhA promoter mutations cause low-level resistance [^112aXbrS].
- **gyrA**: Detects fluoroquinolone resistance via quinolone resistance–determining region (QRDR) mutations [^112aXbrS].
- **Rrs**: Detects resistance to second-line injectables (amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin) via 16S rRNA mutations [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of gene targets

| **Gene target** | **Drug resistance detected** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| rpoB | Rifampicin | - Strong proxy for MDR-TB <br/> - Guides initial regimen selection [^116c2Ja2] |
| katG | Isoniazid | - Common first-line resistance <br/> - Informs regimen adjustments [^112aXbrS] |
| inhA | Isoniazid | - Low-level INH resistance <br/> - May allow dose-escalation strategies [^112aXbrS] |
| gyrA | Fluoroquinolones | - Critical for MDR/XDR regimens <br/> - Impacts regimen choice [^112aXbrS] |
| rrs | Second-line injectables | - Essential for XDR classification <br/> - Guides injectable use [^notfound] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **False positives/negatives**: Rare rpoB mutations or heteroresistance can cause discordant results; confirmatory testing is recommended [^113yjUNA] [^116cbGsC].
- **Coverage gaps**: Xpert MTB/XDR does not detect all resistance mechanisms (e.g. bedaquiline, linezolid) [^111JBStn] [^114Z2Jh4].
- **Clinical correlation**: Results must be interpreted with clinical and epidemiological context [^115QCYoE].

---

GeneXpert assays target **rpoB** for rifampicin resistance in MTB/RIF, with Ultra adding multicopy targets for sensitivity; Xpert MTB/XDR expands to katG, inhA, gyrA, and rrs for broader resistance detection, enabling rapid, near-patient DST to inform timely regimen selection [^1129ZaMU] [^1113SQwH].

### Can the geneXpert MTB / XDR deliver on the promise of expanded, near-patient tuberculosis drug-susceptibility testing? [^1113SQwH]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Early diagnosis, including universal drug-susceptibility testing for all patients with tuberculosis, remains a key priority for tuberculosis elimination by 2035. The drug-resistant tuberculosis care cascade remains persistently challenged by substantial gaps in timely diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Current diagnostics for drug-resistant tuberculosis are limited with respect to accuracy, time to results, affordability, suitability for resource-poor endemic settings, and accessibility for use at the point of care. WHO endorsement of the novel Xpert MTB/XDR assay holds notable promise for expanding access to testing and rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis drug resistance. The Xpert MTB/XDR assay detects resistance to isoniazid, ethionamide, fluoroquinolones, and second-line injectables, and is indicated for testing in patients with confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. However, this iteration of the Xpert MTB/XDR cartridge might have less of an effect than expected, as WHO has since downgraded the role of second-line injectable agents in treating drug-resistant tuberculosis, and has revised case definitions of drug-resistant tuberculosis to incorporate resistance to new drugs. This Personal View explores the strengths and limitations of the Xpert MTB/XDR assay in the detection of drug resistance, the assay's ability to inform appropriate drug-resistant tuberculosis drug selection, and the optimal placement of the Xpert XDR assay in the laboratory diagnostic workflow.

### Xpert® MTB / RIF assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^115nRKRu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The Xpert MTB/RIF limit of detection, "the lowest number of colony forming units per sample that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with 95% confidence", is five genome copies of purified DNA per reaction or 131 colony forming units per mL in M. tuberculosis spiked sputum. In comparison, identification of TB bacilli by microscopic examination requires at least 10,000 bacilli per mL of sputum. Xpert MTB/RIF detects both live and dead bacteria.

Xpert MTB/RIF uses molecular beacon technology to detect rifampicin resistance. Molecular beacons are nucleic acid probes that recognize and report the presence or absence of the normal, rifampicin‐susceptible, 'wild type' sequence of the rpoB gene of TB. Five different coloured beacons are used, each covering a separate nucleic acid sequence within the amplified rpoB gene. When a beacon binds to the matching sequence, it fluoresces or 'lights up', which indicates the presence of one of the gene sequences that is characteristic of rifampicin‐susceptible TB. Failure of the beacon to bind or delayed binding to the matching sequence indicates potential rifampicin resistance. The number and timing of detection (when the fluorescent signal rises above a pre‐determined baseline cycle threshold) of positive beacons as well as results of sample processing controls allows the test to distinguish among the following results: 'No TB'; 'TB detected, rifampicin resistance detected'; 'TB detected, no rifampicin resistance detected'; and an 'invalid result' (Figure 1). A single Xpert MTB/RIF run will provide both detection of TB and detection of rifampicin resistance. One cannot deselect testing for rifampicin resistance and only run the assay for TB detection, although it is possible for the laboratory to omit results for rifampicin resistance when reporting to the healthcare provider.

Since Xpert MTB/RIF was released, there have been four generations (G1, G2, G3, and G4) of the test involving different software and cartridge combinations. G4 is the only Xpert MTB/RIF software and cartridge combination in current use. G4 contains modifications that improved determination of rifampicin resistance detection as previous Xpert MTB/RIF versions had found that some rifampicin susceptibility results were falsely resistant. Studies using all Xpert MTB/RIF generations are included in this updated Cochrane Review.

Target condition being diagnosed

Extrapulmonary TB

The various forms of extrapulmonary TB cause signs and symptoms related to the structures affected. Table 6 describes the forms of extrapulmonary TB included in this Cochrane Review, as well as the different specimens that may be collected for diagnosis.

Table 1
Forms of extrapulmonary TB

Rifampicin resistance

Rifampicin inhibits bacterial DNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by the RNA polymerase gene (rpoB). Resistance to this drug has been associated mainly with mutations in a limited region of the rpoB gene. Rifampicin resistance may occur alone or in association with resistance to isoniazid and other drugs. In settings with a high burden of MDR‐TB, the presence of rifampicin resistance alone may serve as a proxy for MDR‐TB.

Index test(s)

Xpert is an automated diagnostic test for the detection of M. tuberculosis complex DNA and, when M. tuberculosis complex (hereafter expressed to as M. tuberculosis) is detected, rifampin‐resistance associated mutations of the rpoB gene. Test results are available for M. tuberculosis and resistance to rifampicin within two hours after the test is begun, with minimal hands‐on technical time. Unlike conventional nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests, Xpert integrates sample processing and PCR amplification and detection into a single self‐enclosed test unit, the GeneXpert cartridge. Following sample loading, all steps in the assay are completely automated and self‐contained. In addition, the assay's sample reagent, used to liquefy sputum, has potent tuberculocidal (the ability to kill TB bacteria) properties and so largely eliminates biosafety concerns during the test procedure. Xpert detects both live and dead bacteria.

### Evaluation of gene xpert for routine diagnosis of HIV-associated tuberculosis in Nigeria: a prospective cohort study [^113UUe7Z]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Xpert MTB/Rif (Xpert) is described as a game changer in tuberculosis (TB) control. We evaluated the impact of Xpert on diagnosis, time to treatment, and treatment outcome among patients with HIV associated TB in Nigeria.

Methods

Adults with HIV being evaluated for pulmonary TB (PTB) were consecutively enrolled into the study cohort. At baseline, expectorated sputa were examined using Xpert and smear microscopy for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and acid fast bacilli, respectively. Patients diagnosed with TB were followed-up until 6 months post TB diagnosis. TB was defined as sputum positive by smear microscopy, Xpert detection of MTB (bacteriologically confirmed case), or clinician diagnosed TB with initiation of full TB treatment (clinical diagnosis). Time to treatment was time from first clinic presentation for TB evaluation to initiation of TB treatment. We examined the proportion PTB patients with a positive Xpert result and compared time to TB treatment and outcome of TB treatment in patients based on sputum test results.

Results

A total of 310 adults with HIV were enrolled. The median CD4 cell count was 242 (interquartile range (IQR) 120–425) cells/mm 3 and 88.1% were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). PTB was diagnosed in 76 (24.5%) patients, with 71 (93.4%) being bacteriologically confirmed. Among patients with PTB, 56 (73.7%) were Xpert positive. Median time to treatment was 5 (IQR 2–8) days and 12 (IQR 5–35) days in patient with and without Xpert positive results, respectively; p = 0.005. Overall 73.1% had symptom free survival at 6 months post PTB treatment initiation with no significant differences observed based on TB test method. 10 (14.9%) died within 6 months of TB treatment initiation. In analysis adjusted for age, sex, and mode of diagnosis (Xpert positive or negative), only ART use independently predicted mortality (AOR 0.10; 95% CI 0.01–0.93).

Conclusion

The use of Xpert for routine care reduced time to PTB treatment, but did not improve survival in patients with HIV treated for susceptible PTB.

### XpertMTB / RIF assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance [^114vu2Kv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Xpert ® MTB/RIF (Xpert) is an automated diagnostic test for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (M. tuberculosis). It is a DNA‐based test that detects th e M. tuberculosis rpoB gene. Xpert also detects mutations in rpoB that may cause rifampicin resistance. Results are available after two hours with minimal hands‐on technical time. A Cochrane Review found that Xpert accurately detects M. tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance when used on sputum specimens. The WHO published updated guidance on use of Xpert in 2013. This updated policy statement expanded recommendations for use of Xpert for pulmonary TB in adults and provided additional guidance on use of the test for childhood TB and extrapulmonary TB.

Drawing on a systematic review, and using the GRADE approach, the WHO has issued the following recommendations related to extrapulmonary TB.

Xpert should be used in preference to conventional microscopy and culture as the initial diagnostic test for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from patients presumed to have TB meningitis (strong recommendation given the urgency for rapid diagnosis; very low‐certainty evidence).
Xpert may be used as a replacement test for usual practice (including conventional microscopy, culture, or histopathology) for testing specific non‐respiratory specimens (lymph nodes and other tissues) from patients presumed to have extrapulmonary TB (conditional recommendation; very low‐certainty evidence).

The use of Xpert has also been incorporated into the International Standards for TB Care 2014. Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB in adults and children for clinicians in high‐resource countries with low TB incidence have recently been published.

Currently, the manufacturer, Cepheid Incorporated (Sunnyvale, CA, USA), has made no claim for the use of Xpert in non‐sputum specimens; accordingly, Xpert is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in raw sputum specimens and concentrated sputum sediment only.

### XpertMTB / RIF assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance [^1122B2qi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Xpert uses molecular beacon technology to detect rifampicin resistance. Molecular beacons are nucleic acid probes that recognize and report the presence or absence of the normal, rifampicin‐susceptible, 'wild‐type' sequence of the rpoB gene of TB. Beacons of five different colours are used, each covering a separate nucleic acid sequence within the amplified rpoB gene.

Xpert provides testing simultaneously for M. tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. Thus, it is really only one test. A rifampicin resistance result is provided whether or not a patient is at risk of resistance. One cannot deselect testing for rifampicin resistance and run only the assay for TB detection. Xpert may be used at all levels of the healthcare system. However, for use of the current device, a stable and uninterrupted electrical supply is required. The WHO has published extensive guidance and practical information on implementing the test.

### Evaluation of gene xpert for routine diagnosis of HIV-associated tuberculosis in Nigeria: a prospective cohort study [^114oD7AG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The capacity of Xpert to diagnose TB within two hours suggests that patients with symptoms of TB could get a diagnosis and commence treatment during one clinic visit. With smear microscopy, patients have to make at least one more clinic trip to get test results and commence treatment. Some patients never return for the visit to complete sputum collection or commence treatment. We observed significant differences in time to treatment, ranging from a median of 5 days in Xpert positive/smear positive patients to 27 days in Xpert negative/smear negative patients. While Xpert positive cases had shorter time to treatment, only 3 patients (4.2%) commenced treatment during a single clinic visit, which is the presumed norm if Xpert is used. Cumulatively 47.2% commenced treatment within 5 days of baseline visit. Delay in initiating TB treatment despite implementation of Xpert is not unique to our population, and we need to better understand factors contributing to this delay. We observed that the four-cartridge Xpert machine at the study site not only served the clinic but the whole state with a population of 3.2 million with an estimated 40,000 cases of TB/HIV co-infection in 2012. At full capacity, only 12–16 specimens can be processed in a day using a four-module Xpert machine, meaning processing of additional specimen will spill into a second day. While deployment of more Xpert machines may be a viable solution, delay in initiation of treatment has also been observed after making test results available to patients during their first visit. Patient contribution to delays in TB treatment remains a challenge which Xpert may not completely eliminate. In a study of the Zambian TB program, patient factors were found to be the major contributor to TB treatment delay.

Next-generation Xpert testing.

In 2010, WHO endorsed Xpert MTB/RIF use with the GeneXpert platform (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA, and an updated policy was released in 2013. In 2017, WHO recommended Xpert Ultra (Cepheid) (Ultra), the next generation of Xpert MTB/RIF, as the initial TB diagnostic test for adults and children, regardless of HIV status, over smear microscopy and culture. As in previous generations, Ultra detects RIF resistance by employing four probes with targets in the rpoB gene and melting temperature analysis (Table 1). Compared with previous generations, Ultra test cartridges have a larger chamber for DNA amplification than Xpert MTB/RIF and two multicopy amplification targets for TB, namely, IS6110 and IS1081, for a lower limit of detection of 16 CFU/ml. These modifications have increased Ultra's overall sensitivity from 85% (95% confidence interval, 82% to 88%) to 88% (95% CI, 85% to 91%); however, compared with the previous generation, Ultra's specificity is lower at 96% (95% CI, 90% to 98%) versus 98% (95% CI, 97% to 98%), seemingly because it detects nonviable bacteria, particularly in people with recent TB. This lower specificity is proving to be an important issue in certain settings, such as areas with high numbers of HIV-TB coinfections or recurrent TB cases, like South Africa. In a recent study by Mishra and colleagues, it was shown that the Xpert Ultra assay had significantly lower specificity and positive predictive value than the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and high numbers of Ultra positive/culture negative people with previous treatment. The clinical consequences of treating such patients are unclear, and ongoing studies are attempting to shed light on this information.

### Xpert® MTB / RIF assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^114gkUMr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Accurate and rapid detection of TB, including smear‐negative TB and drug resistant‐TB, is critical for improving patient outcomes (increased cure and decreased mortality, additional drug resistance, treatment failure, and relapse) and decreasing TB transmission. Mycobacterial culture is generally considered the best available reference standard for TB diagnosis and is the first step in detecting drug resistance. However, culture is a relatively complex and slow procedure. Solid culture typically takes between four to eight weeks for results and liquid culture, though more rapid than solid culture, requires days and is more prone to contamination. In addition, culture requires specialized laboratories and highly skilled staff. In early 2011, WHO endorsed a novel, rapid, automated, cartridge‐based nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) (hereafter referred to as Xpert MTB/RIF), that can simultaneously detect TB and rifampicin resistance.

Target condition being diagnosed

Tuberculosis

TB is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is spread from person to person through the air. TB most commonly affects the lungs (pulmonary TB), but may affect any organ or tissue, such as the brain or bones, outside of the lungs (extrapulmonary TB). Signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB include cough for at least two weeks, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, haemoptysis (coughing up blood), and fatigue. Signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary TB depend on the site of disease. TB treatment regimens must contain multiple drugs to which the organisms are sensitive to be effective. The treatment of MDR‐TB is complex, usually requiring two years or more of therapy and drugs that are less potent and more toxic than the drugs used to treat drug‐susceptible TB. The WHO issues international guidelines for TB treatment which are regularly updated.

Rifampicin resistance

Rifampicin inhibits bacterial DNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by the RNA polymerase gene (rpoB). Resistance to this drug has mainly been associated with mutations in a limited region of the rpoB gene. Rifampicin resistance may occur alone or in association with resistance to isoniazid and other drugs. In high MDR‐TB settings, the presence of rifampicin resistance alone may serve as a proxy for MDR‐TB. Patients with drug‐resistant TB can transmit the infection to others.

### Xpert MTB / RIF ultra assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and adolescents [^114S1TfB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2014, the World Health Assembly unanimously approved the WHO End TB Strategy, a 20‐year strategy devised to end the global tuberculosis epidemic. Early diagnosis of tuberculosis, including universal drug susceptibility testing and systematic screening of contacts and high‐risk groups, is a key part of the strategy. To achieve this goal, the WHO recommends that in adults with signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, Xpert Ultra should be used as an initial diagnostic test for tuberculosis and for rifampicin‐resistance detection in sputum, rather than smear microscopy/culture and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing.

Pulmonary tuberculosis

Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M tuberculosis) and is spread from person to person through the air. Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs (pulmonary tuberculosis), but may affect any organ or tissue outside the lungs (extrapulmonary tuberculosis). Signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis include cough, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, haemoptysis, and fatigue. Signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis depend on the site of disease. Tuberculosis treatment regimens must contain multiple drugs to which the organisms are susceptible to cure tuberculosis and avoid selection for drug resistance.

Rifampicin resistance

Rifampicin inhibits bacterial DNA‐dependent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase, encoded by the RNA polymerase gene (rpoB). Resistance to this drug has mainly been associated with mutations in a limited region of the rpoB gene. Rifampicin resistance may occur alone or in association with resistance to isoniazid and other drugs. In high multiple‐drug‐resistant tuberculosis settings, the presence of rifampicin resistance alone may serve as a proxy for multiple‐drug‐resistant tuberculosis. People with drug‐resistant tuberculosis can transmit the infection to others. Historically, the drugs used to treat multiple‐drug‐resistant tuberculosis have been less potent and more toxic than the drugs used to treat drug‐susceptible tuberculosis, requiring two years or more of therapy. However, new drug regimens to treat multiple‐drug‐resistant tuberculosis can often shorten this course to six months, are better tolerated, and have improved treatment outcomes.

The drugs used to treat MDR‐TB are less potent and more toxic than the drugs used to treat drug‐susceptible tuberculosis, historically requiring two years or more of therapy. The WHO has issued recommendations that all individuals with MDR‐TB or rifampicin‐resistant tuberculosis, including those who are also resistant to fluoroquinolones, may benefit from effective all‐oral treatment regimens (WHO Consolidated Guidelines (Module 4) 2020).

### Cough due to TB and other chronic infections: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115pTAzg]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to indications for testing, ACCP 2018 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining Xpert MTB/RIF testing, where available, instead of sputum microscopy in patients with cough and suspected pulmonary tuberculosis at high risk of drug-resistant tuberculosis (such as with a prior history of treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, contacts of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases, and/or living in countries with a high drug-resistant tuberculosis prevalence). Obtain sputum mycobacterial cultures, drug susceptibility testing, and a CXR when feasible and where resources allow.

### Impact of geneXpert MTB / RIF on patients and tuberculosis programs in a low-burden setting. a hypothetical trial [^116KjffT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale

Guidelines recommend routine nucleic-acid amplification testing in patients with presumed tuberculosis (TB), but these tests have not been widely adopted. GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), a novel, semiautomated TB nucleic-acid amplification test, has renewed interest in this technology, but data from low-burden countries are limited.

Objectives

We sought to estimate Xpert's potential clinical and public health impact on empiric treatment, contact investigation, and housing in patients undergoing TB evaluation.

Methods

We performed a prospective, cross-sectional study with 2-month follow-up comparing Xpert with standard strategies for evaluating outpatients for active pulmonary TB at the San Francisco Department of Public Health TB Clinic between May 2010 and June 2011. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of standard algorithms for initial empiric TB treatment, contact investigation, and housing in reference to three Mycobacterium tuberculosis sputum cultures, as compared with that of a single sputum Xpert test. We estimated the incremental diagnostic value of Xpert, and the hypothetical reductions in unnecessary treatment, contact investigation, and housing if Xpert were adopted to guide management decisions.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 156 patients underwent Xpert testing. Fifty-nine (38%) received empiric TB treatment. Thirteen (8%) had culture-positive TB. Xpert-guided management would have hypothetically decreased overtreatment by 94%, eliminating a median of 44 overtreatment days (interquartile range, 43–47) per patient and 2,169 total overtreatment days (95% confidence interval, 1,938–2,400) annually, without reducing early detection of TB patients. We projected similar benefits for contact investigation and housing.

Conclusions

Xpert could greatly reduce the frequency and impact of unnecessary empiric treatment, contact investigation, and housing, providing substantial patient and programmatic benefits if used in management decisions.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

Xpert XDR.

Another PCR-based cartridge has been designed to run on the GeneXpert and Omni platforms for the simultaneous detection of mutations associated with resistance to multiple first- and second-line TB drugs or extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Against phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing, a prototype version of the Xpert XDR cartridge displayed sensitivities (95% CI) of 83.3% (77.1% to 88.5%) for isoniazid, 88.4% (80.2% to 94.1%) for ofloxacin, 96.2% (87.0% to 99.5%) for moxifloxacin at a critical concentration of 2.0 μg per milliliter, 71.4% (56.7% to 83.4%) for kanamycin, and 70.7% (54.5% to 83.9%) for amikacin. In July 2020, the Xpert MTB XDR-TB cartridge was launched, but further validation and WHO review are pending. As WHO updates treatment guidelines for MDR-TB and XDR-TB, it will be critical that molecular tools for DST can be updated to quickly reflect new recommendations. Already, this iteration of Xpert XDR may have less impact than it otherwise would have, as WHO has de-emphasized second-line injectable agents for treating drug resistant forms of TB. Future developments will need to focus on drugs that are now critical for MDR and XDR-TB management, including bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid, but developing highly accurate molecular diagnostics to detect resistance to these drugs is currently impossible due to the lack of knowledge on resistance mechanisms.

### Prospective exploratory evaluation of cepheid xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis host response cartridge: a focus on adolescents and young adults [^111jvAAs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Rapid and accurate detection of tuberculosis disease (TB) is critical for reducing ongoing transmission and improving treatment outcomes. Yet, despite recent advances in novel diagnostic technologies, in 2022 only 63% of all new cases of TB were bacteriologically confirmed. This gap in diagnosis, which is driven in part by the variable detection capabilities of currently available diagnostics, has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to call for the development of novel non-sputum-based triage tests with a minimum sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 70%. In response, Cepheid developed a prototype blood-based cartridge, the Xpert-MTB-HR, which was designed to detect host response to TB by quantifying messenger RNA (mRNA) from 3 genes associated with TB in large population studies. While most TB diagnostics are designed to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of disease, or its by-products in sputum or urine, the Xpert-MTB-HR was designed to identify a host mRNA signature associated with active TB disease.

### Xpert® MTB / RIF assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^112gy38X]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Xpert uses molecular beacon technology to detect rifampicin resistance. Molecular beacons are nucleic acid probes that recognize and report the presence or absence of the normal, rifampicin-susceptible, 'wild type' sequence of the rpoB gene of TB. Five different coloured beacons are used, each covering a separate nucleic acid sequence within the amplified rpoB gene. When a beacon binds to the matching sequence, it fluoresces or 'lights up', which indicates the presence of one of the gene sequences that is characteristic of rifampicin-susceptible TB. Failure of the beacon to bind or delayed binding to the matching sequence indicates potential rifampicin resistance. The number and timing of detection (when the fluorescent signal rises above a pre-determined baseline cycle threshold) of positive beacons as well as results of sample processing controls allows the test to distinguish among the following results: 'No TB; 'TB detected, rifampicin resistance detected'; 'TB detected, no rifampicin resistance detected'; and an 'invalid result' (Figure 1). As mentioned, a single Xpert run will provide both detection of TB and detection of rifampicin resistance. One cannot deselect testing for rifampicin resistance and only run the assay for TB detection, although it is possible for the laboratory to omit results for rifampicin resistance when reporting to the healthcare provider.

Since Xpert was released, there have been four generations of the test involving different software and cartridge combinations. Studies using the first three generations (G1, G2, and G3 cartridges) are included in this systematic review. A newer cartridge, G4, to be used with software version 4.0 or higher, has been released and is now included in all Xpert kits (personal communication; Ellen Jo Baron, Cepheid, 26 June 2012). Studies using G4 and newer versions of the assay will be included in updates of this review.

### Performance of the xpert HIV-1 viral load assay: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113zptxB]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Despite the recommendations put forward by the World Health Organization (WHO), viral load (VL) monitoring of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not routinely performed in many low-resource countries, and treatment failure is diagnosed on the basis of clinical or immunological criteria. Currently used VL assays demand sophisticated facilities, expensive equipment, and skilled technicians, making them unaffordable and largely impractical for scale-up in resource-limited settings. To expand the use of targeted and routine VL monitoring, inexpensive, low-complexity assays are needed, preferably for point-of-care use.

The Xpert HIV-1 VL assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), performed on the GeneXpert instrument system, is an in vitro diagnostic test designed for the rapid quantification of HIV-1 in human plasma from individuals with an active HIV infection. It uses real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR technology and targets HIV-1 group M subtypes A, B, C, D, AE, F, G, H, AB, AG, J, and K and groups N and O. It has a limit of quantitation of 40 copies/ml and can detect HIV-1 RNA over a linear range of 40 to 10,000,000 copies/ml. The GeneXpert platform allows on-demand molecular testing in one fully integrated closed cartridge and provides results in 90 min. The Xpert HIV-1 VL assay runs on the same GeneXpert platform as the WHO-endorsed Xpert MTB/RIF cartridge, used for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB).

The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a major advance in tuberculosis diagnostics, and more than 23 million cartridges have been used around the world. Given the high coprevalence of TB and HIV in many settings and the need for greater integration of TB-HIV services, leveraging the existing GeneXpert network for HIV may substantially increase access to VL testing. Similar to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, the Xpert HIV-1 VL assay demands minimal training and modest infrastructure requirements while providing rapid results. If proven to be as accurate as current, established reference standard VL tests, this monitoring tool has the potential for rapid scale-up in countries already using the GeneXpert platform for TB. Scaling up routine HIV-1 VL testing is essential to meet the UNAIDS 90–90–90 targets.

Target condition being diagnosed

Tuberculosis

TB is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is spread from person to person through the air. TB most commonly affects the lungs (pulmonary TB), but may affect any organ or tissue, such as the brain or bones, outside of the lungs (extrapulmonary TB). Signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB include cough for at least two weeks, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, haemoptysis (coughing up blood), and fatigue. Signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary TB depend on the site of disease. TB treatment regimens must contain multiple drugs to which the organisms are sensitive to be effective. The treatment of MDR-TB is complex, usually requiring two years or more of therapy and drugs that are less potent and more toxic than the drugs used to treat drug-susceptible TB. International guidelines for TB treatment are issued by WHO and regularly updated. Current WHO guidelines on TB treatment are based on evidence assessed according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach for developing health care recommendations (Guyatt; WHO; WHO).

Rifampicin resistance

Rifampicin acts by inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by the RNA polymerase gene (rpoB) (Hartmann). Rifampicin resistance has mainly been associated with mutations in a limited region of the rpoB gene (Telenti). Rifampicin resistance may occur alone or in association with resistance to isoniazid and other drugs. In high MDR-TB settings, the presence of rifampicin resistance alone may serve as a proxy for MDR-TB (WHO). Patients with drug-resistant TB can transmit the infection to others.

### The three-gene xpert host response signature for pediatric tuberculosis screening: a prospective diagnostic accuracy study [^114xjbQ1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Blood-based gene signatures offer potential as a near point-of-care tuberculosis (TB) screening tool. We examined the accuracy of the GeneXpert MTB Host Response (Xpert-HR) cartridge to screen for TB in children.

Methods

We enrolled children under 15 years from The Gambia and Uganda being evaluated for pulmonary TB. Each child provided a blood sample for Xpert-HR and underwent standard TB assessments, including chest x-ray (CXR) and sputum Xpert Ultra testing, followed by NIH case classification of Confirmed, Unconfirmed or Unlikely TB. We measured cycle threshold (Ct) values for GBP5, DUSP3, and TBP, calculated an HR TB score, and generated ROC curves. Specificity was assessed at 90% sensitivity according to strict (SRS, Confirmed versus Unlikely TB), microbiological (MRS, Confirmed versus Unlikely or Unconfirmed TB), and composite (CRS, Confirmed or Unconfirmed TB versus Unlikely TB) reference standards compared to other TB evaluations.

Results

Among 181 children (median age 4 years; 53% female; 16% with HIV; 14.4% confirmed TB), the HR TB score cut-point of -0.65 showed 88.5% sensitivity with specificity at 33.3% (SRS) and 30.3% (MRS). Sensitivity was lower for the CRS at 75.7%, with similar specificity (33.3%). Sensitivity was higher in children aged 5–9 and 10–14 years compared to those under 5, but specificity remained low (22.7–28.6%). Combining Xpert-HR with CXR, Xpert Ultra, or TB treatment decision algorithms did not significantly enhance accuracy.

Conclusion

Xpert-HR showed high sensitivity for detecting confirmed TB but had low specificity, risking overdiagnosis. Improved pediatric-specific gene signatures are necessary for better accuracy in children.

### Xpert MTB / RIF and xpert MTB / RIF ultra for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^1158ugG8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Accurate and rapid detection of tuberculosis, including smear‐negative tuberculosis and drug resistant‐tuberculosis, is critical for improving patient outcomes (increased cure and decreased mortality, and prevention of additional drug resistance, treatment failure, and relapse), and decreasing tuberculosis transmission. Mycobacterial culture is generally considered the best available reference standard for tuberculosis diagnosis and is a key step in detecting drug resistance. However, culture is a relatively complex and slow procedure. Solid culture typically takes between four to eight weeks for results and liquid culture, although more sensitive and rapid than solid culture, requires weeks and is more prone to contamination. In addition, culture requires specialized laboratories and highly skilled staff. In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the use of a novel, rapid, automated, cartridge‐based, nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test, Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) (hereafter referred to as Xpert MTB/RIF), that can simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance.

Target condition being diagnosed

Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M tuberculosis) and is spread from person to person through the air. Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs (pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB)), but may affect any organ or tissue outside of the lungs (extrapulmonary tuberculosis). Signs and symptoms of PTB include cough, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, haemoptysis (coughing up blood), and fatigue. Signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis depend on the site of disease. Tuberculosis treatment regimens must contain multiple drugs to which the organisms are sensitive to cure tuberculosis and avoid selection for drug resistance. The treatment of MDR‐TB is complex, historically requiring two years or more of therapy, although the WHO conditionally recommended a nine‐ to 12‐month regimen in 2016. The drugs used to treat MDR‐TB are less potent and more toxic than the drugs used to treat drug‐susceptible tuberculosis.

Rifampicin resistance

Rifampicin inhibits bacterial DNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by the RNA polymerase gene (rpoB). Resistance to this drug has mainly been associated with mutations in a limited region of the rpoB gene. Rifampicin resistance may occur alone or in association with resistance to isoniazid and other drugs. In high MDR‐TB settings, the presence of rifampicin resistance alone may serve as a proxy for MDR‐TB. People with drug‐resistant tuberculosis can transmit the infection to others.

Index test(s)

Xpert MTB/RIF is an automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (molecular test) using the GeneXpert platform (Cepheid 2019). Xpert MTB/RIF is a single test that can detect both M tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance within two hours after starting the test, with minimal hands‐on technical time. Unlike conventional nucleic acid amplification tests, (NAATs), Xpert MTB/RIF integrates sample processing and PCR amplification and detection into a single cartridge. Following sample loading, all steps in the assay are completely automated and self‐contained. In addition, the assay's sample reagent, used to liquefy sputum, has potent tuberculocidal (the ability to kill tuberculosis bacteria) properties and so largely eliminates biosafety concerns during the test procedure (Banada 2010). Xpert MTB/RIF requires an uninterrupted and stable electrical power supply, temperature control, and yearly calibration of the cartridge modules (Global Laboratory Initiative 2019).

### Systematic review of pooling sputum as an efficient method for xpert MTB / RIF tuberculosis testing during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112jN96i]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is severely disrupting health systems and is threatening progress made by national TB control programs. The new Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test is run on the same GeneXpert instruments as those for Xpert MTB/RIF and Ultra testing; it is being expedited for large-scale production and deployment. Consequently, TB-testing capacity, already limited by the availability of necessary staff, testing modules, and Xpert MTB/RIF and Ultra cartridges, may be further reduced by the increased demand for GeneXpert for COVID-19 testing. There is an urgent need to develop laboratory testing approaches to expand TB diagnostic and case-finding services in preparation for crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

GeneXpert-based testing for TB requires 1 cartridge per sputum sample. However, screening for other infectious diseases has used sample pooling methods, in which samples from several patients are pooled together for a single test to optimize processing. If a pooled-sample test is negative, all samples in the pool are considered negative; if the pooled-sample test is positive, all samples in the pool are retested individually to identify the samples that are positive. This method is routinely used in situations where the prevalence of disease is low (e.g. blood banks screening donated blood for hepatitis and syphilis). The method can substantially reduce workload and cost and, for TB, could more efficiently process samples for diagnosis. We reviewed the literature to determine the accuracy of pooling for Xpert MTB/RIF and Ultra detection of pulmonary TB, with the aim of supporting TB programs as they continue to test for TB in the context of increased resource constraints during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### A prospective evaluation of a three-gene host response signature to classify tuberculosis severity in children [^1136ixq5]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Children with non-severe TB may benefit from short-course treatment, but point-of-care tools are needed to stratify disease severity. We prospectively evaluated the Cepheid Xpert MTB-Host Response (HR) prototype cartridge for distinguishing TB severity in children with pulmonary TB (PTB) in The Gambia and Uganda.

Methods

We included children < 15 with microbiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed unconfirmed PTB. Severity was defined using the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for a four-month, drug-susceptible regimen. Capillary or venous blood was tested with the HR cartridge for PCR-based detection of 3 mRNA genes and calculation of a TB score from cycle thresholds. We generated receiver operating characteristic curves with the TB score to classify severe TB and assessed if Xpert-HR could achieve the WHO target accuracy for treatment optimization (≥ 90% sensitivity, ≥ 70% specificity).

Results

Among 106 children, the median age was 4 years (IQR 1–7), 56.6% were female, and 13.2% were living with HIV. In all children with PTB, Xpert-HR achieved an AUC of 0.67 (95% CI 0.55–0.78), with 89.3% sensitivity (95% CI 71.8–97.7) and 29.5% specificity (95% CI 19.7–40.9, cutoff ≤ -0.60). By confirmation status, Xpert-HR approached the target accuracy in children with Confirmed TB, with 62.5% specificity (95% CI 24.5–91.5) at 91.7% sensitivity (95% CI 61.5–99.8, cut-off ≤ -1.349). Among children with Unconfirmed TB, specificity was lower (24.3%, 95% CI 14.8–36.0) at 93.8% sensitivity (95% CI 69.8–99.8, cutoff ≤ -0.450). Target accuracy was almost achieved in children 5–9 regardless of confirmation status (100% sensitivity [95% CI 71.5–100], 66.7% specificity [95% CI 43.0–85.4], cutoff ≤ -1.35), but specificity (28.2%, 95% CI 18.6–39.5) was lower for children < 5 (92.9% sensitivity, 95% CI 76.5–99.1, cutoff ≤ -0.550).

Conclusions

Xpert-HR approached the target accuracy to stratify PTB severity in older children and those with Confirmed TB but had lower specificity in children with Unconfirmed TB. Child-specific signatures may be needed to improve performance in younger children with paucibacillary disease.

### Drug-resistant tuberculosis: advances in diagnosis and management [^113B4k7J]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

WHO has recommended the use of rapid molecular tests to diagnose MDR-TB since 2015. State- of-the-art molecular platforms screen for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (Mtbc) DNA and resistance to rifampicin in a single assay. Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) got a WHO endorsement in 2014. The assay revolutionized the time-to-result screening and confirmation of rifampicin-resistant TB. The following steps in the evolution of the molecular tests involved lowering the detection limit (Xpert MTB/ RIF Ultra) and evaluating additional resistance-associated genes, also improving TB diagnostics in children. Line probe assays to detect TB drug resistance are currently being replaced by gene arrays, respectively, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods such as Deeplex Myc-TB (Genoscreen, Lille, France). Further, there is a broader offer of automated rapid real-time PCR assays for the direct detection of TB and drug resistance. Nevertheless, drug resistance to new and repurposed drugs threatens recent advances in DR- TB treatment and appropriate resistance testing to those drugs is widely unavailable. WHO and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics developed a set of target product profiles to guide the development of new TB diagnostic tools. The patient-focused approach should prompt for fast clinical evaluation and early laboratory diagnostic testing. All patients with TB should be risk- assessed for drug resistance based on epidemiological data and history. The diagnostic workup involves point-of-care molecular testing to screen for TB and rifampicin resistance. If rifampicin-resistant Mtbc is detected, add-on modular testing for first-line and second-line drugs are recommended. The new Xpert MTB/XDR screens for mutations leading to resistance to isoniazid, fluorquinolones, ethionamide and aminoglycosides and can offer a first, reliable assessment of the susceptibility profile of the infectious agent. On a global scale, confirmatory testing using mycobacterial liquid culture, bacterial identification and phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing (pDST) can be provided in national and supranational reference laboratories mainly. State-of-the-art pDST uses the WHO critical concentration drug proportion method, which can be performed in semiautomated instruments such as MGIT 960 (BD, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA). Alternative testing methods using broth microdilution are being implemented in various supranational laboratories, which generate quantitative susceptibility profiles, especially for antibiotics that entered the therapeutic armamentarium only recently such as bedaquiline, delamanid and pretomanid.

### Availability of an assay for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including rifampin-resistant strains, and considerations for its use-United States, 2013 [^115QCYoE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

In August 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permitted marketing of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California) to detect DNA of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and genetic mutations associated with resistance to rifampin (RMP) in unprocessed sputum and concentrated sputum sediments. Along with clinical, radiographic, and other laboratory findings, results of the assay aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The assay is a nucleic acid amplification-based (NAA)* test using a disposable cartridge in conjunction with the GeneXpert Instrument System. Sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for detection of MTBC appear to be comparable with other FDA-approved NAA assays for this use, although direct comparison studies have not been performed. Sensitivity of detection of RMP resistance was 95% and specificity 99% in a multicenter study using archived and prospective specimens from subjects aged ≥ 18 years suspected of having TB who had 0–3 days of antituberculous treatment. CDC continues to recommend following published U.S. guidelines for TB diagnosis and infection control practice, including the use and interpretation of NAA test results. Providers and laboratories need to ensure that specimens are available for other recommended mycobacteriological testing. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay aids in the prompt diagnosis of TB and RMP-resistant disease. RMP resistance most often coexists with isoniazid (INH) resistance; TB that is resistant to both drugs is multidrug-resistant (MDR)† TB. Because the prevalence of RMP resistance is low in the United States (about 1.8% of TB cases), a positive result indicating a mutation in the rpoB gene of MTBC should be confirmed by rapid DNA sequencing for prompt reassessment of the treatment regimen and followed by growth-based drug susceptibility testing (DST). CDC offers these services free of charge.§

### A transcriptional blood signature distinguishes early tuberculosis disease from latent tuberculosis infection and uninfected individuals in a Vietnamese cohort [^1159YvZG]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Global tuberculosis (TB) control is restricted by the failure to detect an estimated 3.3 million TB cases annually. In the majority of TB endemic settings, sputum smear microscopy is used to diagnose TB, but this test is insensitive for TB in its early stages. The objective of this study is to establish a concise gene signature that discriminates between individuals with early TB disease, latent TB infection (LTBI) and those without infection.

Methods

This is a case control study nested within a cluster-randomised trial of population screening for active TB using Xpert MTB/RIF. Whole blood samples from 303 participants with active TB (97), LTBI (92) and uninfected individuals (114) were subject to transcriptomic analysis of selected target genes based on a systematic review of previous studies.

Results

Analysis of 82 genes identified a pattern of differentially expressed genes in TB disease. A seven gene signature was identified that distinguished between TB disease and no TB disease with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80–0.91), and between TB disease from LTBI with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82–0.93).

Conclusion

This gene signature accurately distinguishes early TB disease from those without TB disease or infection, in the context of community-wide TB screening. It could be used as a non-sputum based screening tool or triage test to detect prevalent cases of TB in the community.

### The elusive allure of a rapid host blood signature for tuberculosis disease [^116jyGao]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, the expression of the three genes, as well as a composite TB score, was significantly different between the TB disease and healthy control groups. Two of the three genes and the TB score were significantly different when comparing TB disease and other respiratory disease groups. When comparing participants with TB disease to the healthy controls, the Xpert-MTB-HR had good discriminatory value (AUC = 0.912). However, when comparing adults with TB disease to people with other respiratory infections, which is a more informative comparison group for the purposes of evaluating a triage test, the Xpert-MTB-HR had only modest discriminatory value (AUC = 0.798). In both comparisons, the discriminatory values were higher among persons with a higher Mtb bacillary load, as determined by the cycle threshold values of the Ultra result.

In addition, the team assessed changes in the TB score at 2, 5, and 6 months after the start of therapy to assess its value as an indicator of treatment response. While the average TB score was higher after 2 months of treatment, one-quarter of the patients had TB scores that declined during treatment, despite symptomatic improvement. Since the TB score was expected to increase with treatment, additional evaluations or testing was not completed to explain this paradoxical response.

The study provides a strong contribution for determining the value of the Cepheid Xpert-MTB-HR assay for diagnostic accuracy and treatment response. While there are some important results, they should be interpreted with caution. First, the recruitment of the healthy control group occurred outside the triage setting, and therefore, results of test performance in this group do not provide a comparison that is interpretable in real-world diagnostic settings. The performance characteristics determined from comparing results among individuals with TB-related symptoms or abnormal chest radiographs are more accurate, since comparing the TB disease group to a healthy control group will overstate the accuracy or discriminatory value of the Xpert-MTB-HR assay. Second, the study reported a very large range and distribution of the composite TB score for the TB disease cohort at baseline and during follow-up visits. The distribution of the TB score may reflect the imprecise nature of measuring mRNA. Further data on reliability of the assay, such as a triplicate testing among a subset of participants, could have helped define the within-person variability.

### Evaluation of gene xpert for routine diagnosis of HIV-associated tuberculosis in Nigeria: a prospective cohort study [^113rdKp6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Outcomes of TB treatment

Of the 67 patients who initiated PTB treatment, 49 patients (73.1%) achieved TB treatment success (28 cured, 21 completed treatment). Eight patients (11.9%) defaulted and 10 (14.9%) died within 6 months of initiating TB treatment. There was no association between Xpert result and successful TB treatment (Xpert MTB detected, 37/49 (75.5%) versus MTB not detected or indeterminate, 12/49 (25.5%) χ² 1.34; p = 0.25). Treatment success was recorded in 5/5 (100%), 32/43 (74.4%), 3/6 (50%) and 9/13 (69.2%) of patients diagnosed with Xpert+/SM -, Xpert+/SM+, Xpert-/SM+, and Xpert-/SM- PTB respectively (Chi square 3.61, p = 0.31).

A total of 10 deaths were documented within 6 months of initiation of TB therapy (analysis excluded 8 patients who defaulted). Deaths recorded based on diagnostic group were 0/5 (0%) Xpert+/SM-, 5/37 (13.5%) Xpert+/SM+, 1/4 (25%) Xpert-/SM+, and 4/13 (30.8%) Xpert-/SM- (Chi square 3.3, p = 0.35). By analysis in which the summation of death and default were considered as a composite poor treatment outcome, 0/5 (0%) Xpert+/SM-, 11/43 (25.6%) Xpert+/SM+, 3/6 (50%) Xpert-/SM+, and 4/13 (30.8%) Xpert-/SM- had poor treatment outcomes (Chi square 3.6, p = 0.31). In univariate logistic regression analysis of age, sex, mode of diagnosis (Xpert positive versus negative or indeterminate) and use of ART (Yes/No), only ART reduced poor treatment outcome (OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.03–1.0; p = 0.48).

### Xpert® MTB / RIF assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^116cbGsC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Accuracy of the reference standards used

Culture is regarded as the best available reference standard for active TB disease and was the reference standard for TB in this review. Phenotypic culture‐based DST methods using WHO‐recommended critical concentrations were the reference standards for rifampicin resistance. Concerning the latter, several studies have raised concerns about rapid DST methods, in particular automated MGIT 960, for rifampicin using the recommended critical concentrations.reported that BACTEC 460 and MGIT 960 missed certain strains associated with low‐level rifampicin resistance. Furthermore, using Xpert MTB/RIF and gene sequencing, identified four patients (three with clinical information available) whose TB isolates contained mutations to the rpoB gene but appeared to be rifampicin susceptible using MGIT 960 (36). In this study, 2/49 (4.1%) patients whose isolates did not have apparent rpoB gene mutations, experienced treatment failure compared with 3/3 (100%) patients whose isolates did have rpoB gene mutations and were deemed rifampicin susceptible with phenotypic methods. Recently, in a study involving retreatment patients, Van Deun and colleagues found that disputed rpoB mutations conferring low‐grade resistance were often missed by rapid phenotypic DST, particularly with the MGIT 960 system, but to a minor extent also by conventional slow DST. The authors suggested this may be the reason for the perceived insufficient specificity of molecular DST for rifampicin. In light of these findings, it is unclear whether and to what extent Xpert MTB/RIF might out‐perform phenotypic DST methods for rifampicin resistance. Specifically, the determination of the specificity of a molecular DST method based on phenotypic DST alone may underestimate the specificity of a molecular DST.

Quality and quality of reporting of the included studies

The majority of studies used consecutive selection of participants and interpreted the reference standard results without knowledge of Xpert MTB/RIF results. Xpert MTB/RIF results are generated automatically, without requiring subjective interpretation. In general, studies were fairly well reported, though we corresponded with almost all authors for additional data and missing information. We encourage authors of future studies to follow the recommendations in the STARD statement to improve the quality of reporting.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to nucleic acid amplification testing (repeated testing), WHO 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining repeated testing with Xpert MTB/RIF for a total of two tests in sputum,
gastric fluid, nasopharyngeal aspirate, or stool specimens in pediatric patients with signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in settings with pretest probability ≥ 5% and an Xpert MTB/RIF negative result on the initial test.

### Xpert MTB / RIF and xpert MTB / RIF ultra for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^1127zLc6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Applicability of findings to the review question

For detection of PTB, most studies evaluated sputum specimens submitted by participants with presumptive tuberculosis, and ran the test in primary care facilities and local hospitals. Hence, for most studies, the participant characteristics and settings matched our review question. For detection of rifampicin resistance, we had low concern in 46% of studies and high concern in only 7% of studies. However, in nearly half of the studies (47%) the clinical setting was not reported or there was insufficient information to make a decision.

### Blood-based host biomarker diagnostics in active case finding for pulmonary tuberculosis: a diagnostic case-control study [^1118D1Y5]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Active case finding through systematic screening can be an effective means for early detection of TB in high-risk populations, preventing onward transmission. However, performing active case finding effectively and efficiently poses challenges, as diagnostics may not perform well in individuals who have less advanced disease, fewer symptoms, and may be unable to provide adequate sputum samples. To address this need, a target product profile was developed for a non-sputum-based triage test that could achieve high sensitivity (> 90%) to identify individuals for further diagnostic evaluation. We tested two candidate triage diagnostics — point-of-care CRP and a new gene expression based rapid molecular test — from blood samples collected during systematic mass screening for TB conducted in two high TB-burden prisons, where we recently reported active TB prevalence of 3 900 per 100 000. We found that both tests had moderate accuracy in distinguishing microbiologically confirmed cases from controls, with Xpert-MTB-HR achieving higher overall accuracy than CRP. At 90% sensitivity, specificity of Xpert-MTB-HR was 53%, the latter falling below the target of 70%. However, both tests had greater sensitivity among individuals with higher MTB burden as measured by Xpert MTB/RIF semi-quantitative load in sputum, suggesting that they may identify individuals with greatest potential for transmission.

### Tuberculous pleuritis: clinical presentations and diagnostic challenges [^115mW4Yi]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Nucleic acid amplification tests

PCR for TB, initially developed to detect TB in sputum, has been studied extensively in the pleural fluid of TBP. Its performance is limited by the presence of inhibitors and the low bacilli burden in the pleural fluid. The commercially available Xpert MTB/RIF and its newest version, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra), had a pooled sensitivity of diagnosing TBP of 52 and 68% using culture-based reference standards, respectively. These figures were lowered to 21 and 47% if using composite reference standards. With a high positive predictive value of more than 90%, a positive TB PCR offers a fast and accurate test that facilitates early diagnosis and initiation of treatment. PCR can be applied on pleural biopsy tissue and has a higher yield than that on pleural fluid. When combining PCR with histopathological examination, the diagnostic yield can be further improved. Although Xpert MTB/RIF is now recommended as the initial diagnostic test for TBP by the World Health Organization, it must be noted that negative TB PCR of the pleural fluid does not exclude TBP.

Although Xpert Ultra outperforms Xpert MTB/RIF, it remains limited by an intrinsic detection limit on TB DNA. Third-generation PCR or sequencing-based technology may further advance this. Newer technology, such as droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) or next-generation sequencing (NGS), has been used but the sensitivity remains only around 62.5–79.5%. These contemporary sequencing techniques can directly confirm the presence of TB bacilli in the pleural space by identifying their specific gene fragments. Again, the lack of a gold standard means that the performances of these technologies are lower if a composite endpoint, instead of positive culture results, was taken as the final verdict. There is thus no consensus on how these techniques are best applied clinically.

### Evaluation of xpert MTB / RIF for detection of tuberculosis from blood samples of HIV-infected adults confirms Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteremia as an indicator of poor prognosis [^112a3Pex]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death among HIV-infected adults, in part because of delayed diagnosis and therefore delayed initiation of treatment. Recently, the Gene-Xpert platform, a rapid, PCR-based diagnostic platform, has been validated for the diagnosis of TB with sputum. We have evaluated the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis ofbacteremia and investigated its impact on clinical outcomes. Consecutive HIV-infected adults with fever and cough presenting to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, were recruited and followed up for 2 months. At presentation, three sputum samples were examined by smear, culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the presence ofand blood was drawn for PCR with Xpert, for mycobacterial culture (Myco/F Lytic), and for aerobic culture. One hundred four patients were recruited, and 44 (43%) were sputum culture positive for. Ten were Xpert blood positive, for a sensitivity of 21% and a specificity of 100%. The 2-week mortality rate was significantly higher among patients who were Xpert blood positive than among those who were negative (40% versus 3%; multivariate odds ratio [OR] for death if positive, 44; 95% confidence interval, 3 to 662). This effect persisted on assessment of the mortality rate at 2 months (40% versus 11%; OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 24.6). When screening uncomplicated patients presenting with a productive cough for pulmonary TB, Xpert blood offers no diagnostic advantage over sputum testing. Despite this, Xpert blood positivity is highly predictive of early death and this test rapidly identifies a group of patients in urgent need of initiation of treatment.

### A prospective evaluation of a three-gene host response signature to classify tuberculosis severity in children [^112phVhJ]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Simple and objective tools are needed to stratify disease severity for childhood TB and support the implementation of shorter treatment regimens. We performed the first known assessment of the Xpert-HR three-gene signature for classifying severe TB in children. Overall, we found that Xpert-HR had high sensitivity but low specificity in detecting TB severity in children with confirmed and unconfirmed TB. However, it approached the target accuracy for TB treatment optimization among children with confirmed TB and children aged 5–9 years. However, the low specificity in young children < 5 and those with unconfirmed TB could lead to overtreatment in these groups.

Similar to previous studies in adults, we found significant differences in HR TB score by severity status. Despite differences in the median score, we found low specificity at 90% sensitivity when applied to all children independent of TB confirmation status. However, when stratified by TB confirmation status, the accuracy in classifying severe TB disease was higher in children with confirmed than unconfirmed TB, and the confirmed TB group achieved 92% sensitivity and 63% specificity. In children with confirmed TB, the HR TB score was lower in those with severe TB compared to those with non-severe TB, although this difference was not statistically significant given the limited sample size. Although the sample size was small, this is consistent with Olbrich et al, who found that the accuracy of Xpert-HR to diagnose TB was higher in children with both culture-positive TB and severe disease per WHO criteria. This also may be expected as the data used to identify the three-gene signature did not include individuals with clinically diagnosed TB. Moreover, children classified as Unconfirmed TB are heterogenous, and given the lack of microbiological confirmation may have included children without true TB disease. From an implementation perspective, as the GeneXpert platform accommodates both Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and Xpert-HR cartridges, there may be value in using Xpert-HR if a child is Xpert Ultra positive to guide treatment duration. While the Xpert Ultra semiquantitative level could be used, we found that it was only medium or high in 44% of children who were Xpert positive and had severe TB. For children who are Xpert Ultra negative or it is not feasible to collect a respiratory or stool sample for Mtb testing, they may need to rely on CXR or other risk factors including inpatient or nutritional status. As most children diagnosed with TB have unconfirmed disease, identifying novel biomarkers for this group is critical.

### Comparison of two diagnostic intervention packages for community-based active case finding for tuberculosis: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^112qWwx6]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Two in every five patients with active tuberculosis (TB) remain undiagnosed or unreported. Therefore community-based, active case-finding strategies require urgent implementation. However, whether point-of-care (POC), portable battery-operated, molecular diagnostic tools deployed at a community level, compared with conventionally used POC smear microscopy, can shorten time-to-treatment initiation, thus potentially curtailing transmission, remains unclear. To clarify this issue, we performed an open-label, randomized controlled trial in periurban informal settlements of Cape Town, South Africa, where we TB symptom screened 5,274 individuals using a community-based scalable mobile clinic. Some 584 individuals with HIV infection or symptoms of TB underwent targeted diagnostic screening and were randomized (1:1) to same-day smear microscopy (n = 296) or on-site DNA-based molecular diagnosis (n = 288; GeneXpert). The primary aim was to compare time to TB treatment initiation between the arms. Secondary aims included feasibility and detection of probably infectious people. Of participants who underwent targeted screening, 9.9% (58 of 584) had culture-confirmed TB. Time-to-treatment initiation occurred significantly earlier in the Xpert versus the smear-microscopy arm (8 versus 41d, P = 0.002). However, overall, Xpert detected only 52% of individuals with culture-positive TB. Notably, Xpert detected almost all of the probably infectious patients compared with smear microscopy (94.1% versus 23.5%, P = < 0.001). Xpert was associated with a shorter median time to treatment of probably infectious patients (7 versus 24d, P = 0.02) and a greater proportion of infectious patients were on treatment at 60d compared with the probably noninfectious patients (76.5% versus 38.2%, P < 0.01). Overall, a greater proportion of POC Xpert-positive participants were on treatment at 60d compared with all culture-positive participants (100% versus 46.5%, P < 0.01). These findings challenge the traditional paradigm of a passive case-finding, public health strategy and argues for the implementation of portable DNA-based diagnosis with linkage to care as a community-oriented, transmission-interruption strategy. The study was registered with the South African National Clinical Trials Registry (application ID 4367; DOH-27–0317–5367) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03168945).

### Prospective exploratory evaluation of cepheid xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis host response cartridge: a focus on adolescents and young adults [^112h39eD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

An accurate, rapid, non-sputum-based triage test for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) is needed.

Methods

A prospective evaluation of the Cepheid GeneXpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Response cartridge (Xpert-MTB-HR), a prototype blood-based host response mRNA signature assay, among individuals presenting with TB-like symptoms was performed in Pakistan and results were compared to 3 reference standards: Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, bacteriological confirmation (Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and/or culture positivity), and composite clinical diagnosis (clinician diagnosis, treatment initiation, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, and/or culture positivity). Analyses were conducted both for the entire study cohort and separately in the adolescent and young adult cohort (aged 10–24 years).

Results

A total of 497 participants, aged 6–83 years, returned valid Xpert-MTB-HR results. When a diagnostic threshold was set for a sensitivity of > 90%, specificity was 32% (95% confidence interval, 28%-37%) compared to Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, 29% (95% CI, 25%-34%) compared to a bacteriological confirmation, and 22% (95% CI, 18%-26%) compared to a composite clinical diagnosis. However, when evaluating only the adolescent and young adult cohort with a diagnostic threshold set for sensitivity of > 90%, specificity was 82% (95% CI, 74%-89%) compared to Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, 84% (95% CI, 75%-90%) compared to a bacteriological confirmation, and 54% (95% CI, 44%-64%) compared to a composite clinical diagnosis.

Conclusions

While the Xpert-MTB-HR does not meet World Health Organization minimum criteria in the general population, in our study it does meet the minimum sensitivity and specificity requirements for a non-sputum-based triage test among adolescents and young adults when compared to Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra or bacteriological confirmation.

### Xpert MTB / RIF and xpert ultra assays for screening for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults, irrespective of signs or symptoms [^11334Zem]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach (Balshem 2011; Schünemann 2008; Schünemann 2016), and GRADEpro GDT 2020 software. In the context of a systematic review, ratings of the certainty of the evidence reflect the extent of our confidence that the estimates of effect (including test accuracy and associations) are correct. As recommended, we rated the certainty of the evidence as either high (not downgraded), moderate (downgraded by one level), low (downgraded by two levels), or very low (downgraded by more than two levels) for five domains: risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, and publication bias.

### XpertMTB / RIF assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance [^111Fmia7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pathway

It is recommended that clinicians who evaluate patients for extrapulmonary TB adhere to Standard 4 of the International Standards for TB Care, which states: "For all patients, including children, presumed to have extrapulmonary TB, appropriate specimens from the presumed sites of involvement should be obtained for microbiological and histological examination. An Xpert test is recommended as the preferred initial microbiological test for presumptive TB meningitis because of the need for a rapid diagnosis".

Figure 1 shows the clinical pathway and presents the context in which Xpert might be used. The target condition is extrapulmonary TB, of which several forms are known (e.g. pleural TB, TB meningitis).

Figure 1
The clinical pathway describes how patients might present and the point in the pathway at which they would be considered for testing with Xpert. Before a specimen was tested with Xpert, patients presumed of having extrapulmonary TB would have undergone a health examination (history and physical examination) and possibly a chest radiograph. Presentation of extrapulmonary TB varies depending on the body site affected; this condition may imitate other diseases such as cancer and bacterial and fungal infections. Signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary TB are often non‐specific and may include fever, night sweats, fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss (as seen in pulmonary TB) or specific complaints related to the involved site (e.g. headache for TB meningitis, back pain for TB of the spine). The clinical presentation of extrapulmonary disease may be acute but is more often subacute (falling between acute and chronic) or chronic, meaning that patients may have symptoms for days to months before they seek care. Signs and symptoms for the forms of extrapulmonary TB included in this review are described in Table 6. Standard practice includes obtaining specimens for microscopy, culture, and histological examination. We adapted this algorithm for Xpert from the Global Laboratory Initiative.

### Evaluation of gene xpert for routine diagnosis of HIV-associated tuberculosis in Nigeria: a prospective cohort study [^114YyDXc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

TB diagnosis and treatment

In line with the WHO TB treatment guideline adopted by Nigeria, all HIV positive individuals were screened for TB symptoms at all clinic encounters. Patients with symptoms suggestive of PTB (presumptive PTB cases) were referred to the in-house TB Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) center, where sputa were collected for SM and Xpert testing at the JUTH TB Laboratory. Two expectorated same-day sputa samples were obtained from each patient for testing. SM was carried out on un-concentrated sputum samples as previously described. One Xpert test was carried out using combined samples from each patient and was reported as: (1) MTB detected rifampicin resistance detected, (2) MTB detected rifampicin resistance not detected, (3) MTB not detected, or (4) Indeterminate. Patients with indeterminate results had the test repeated using fresh samples, and results of the repeat Xpert test were documented as the final Xpert result. External quality control for SM was carried out by the National TB Control program, while quality control for Xpert was carried out using the manufacturer's manual.

The JUTH TB laboratory was the only facility with Xpert capability in the state at the time of the study and received samples from other hospitals. In addition to the Xpert, the GenoType MTBDRplus assay, another molecular diagnostic tool, was available but mostly used for research purposes. JUTH also housed a free-standing regional TB laboratory that carried out TB culture using solid media, which was routinely done for patients with rifampicin resistance following Xpert as per protocol. Chest X-ray facilities were also available and were requested at the discretion of the treating physician.

Based on the WHO case definition, a patient was classified as having PTB if sputum sample was positive by SM or Xpert (bacteriologically confirmed case) or if SM and Xpert were negative but the treating physician made a diagnosis of PTB and initiated full TB treatment (clinical diagnosis). TB cases, without rifampicin resistance on Xpert were treated with quadruple anti-tubercular therapy for six months consisting of rifampicin (or rifabutin, if on a protease inhibitor), isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for the first two months, then rifampicin and isoniazid for the remaining four months. Patients with rifampicin resistant PTB were referred to designated DR-TB treatment facilities for specialized care.

### Xpert MTB / XDR for detection of pulmonary tuberculosis and resistance to isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, and amikacin [^1129ZaMU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) End TB Strategy stresses universal access to drug susceptibility testing (DST). DST determines whether Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria are susceptible or resistant to drugs. Xpert MTB/XDR is a rapid nucleic acid amplification test for detection of tuberculosis and drug resistance in one test suitable for use in peripheral and intermediate level laboratories. In specimens where tuberculosis is detected by Xpert MTB/XDR, Xpert MTB/XDR can also detect resistance to isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, and amikacin.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/XDR for pulmonary tuberculosis in people with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis (having signs and symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, including cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats). To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/XDR for resistance to isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, and amikacin in people with tuberculosis detected by Xpert MTB/XDR, irrespective of rifampicin resistance (whether or not rifampicin resistance status was known) and with known rifampicin resistance.

Search Methods

We searched multiple databases to 23 September 2021. We limited searches to 2015 onwards as Xpert MTB/XDR was launched in 2020.

Selection Criteria

Diagnostic accuracy studies using sputum in adults with presumptive or confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Reference standards were culture (pulmonary tuberculosis detection); phenotypic DST (pDST), genotypic DST (gDST), composite (pDST and gDST) (drug resistance detection).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed reports for eligibility and extracted data using a standardized form. For multicentre studies, we anticipated variability in the type and frequency of mutations associated with resistance to a given drug at the different centres and considered each centre as an independent study cohort for quality assessment and analysis. We assessed methodological quality with QUADAS-2, judging risk of bias separately for each target condition and reference standard. For pulmonary tuberculosis detection, owing to heterogeneity in participant characteristics and observed specificity estimates, we reported a range of sensitivity and specificity estimates and did not perform a meta-analysis. For drug resistance detection, we performed meta-analyses by reference standard using bivariate random-effects models. Using GRADE, we assessed certainty of evidence of Xpert MTB/XDR accuracy for detection of resistance to isoniazid and fluoroquinolones in people irrespective of rifampicin resistance and to ethionamide and amikacin in people with known rifampicin resistance, reflecting real-world situations. We used pDST, except for ethionamide resistance where we considered gDST a better reference standard.

Main Results

We included two multicentre studies from high multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis burden countries, reporting on six independent study cohorts, involving 1228 participants for pulmonary tuberculosis detection and 1141 participants for drug resistance detection. The proportion of participants with rifampicin resistance in the two studies was 47.9% and 80.9%. For tuberculosis detection, we judged high risk of bias for patient selection owing to selective recruitment. For ethionamide resistance detection, we judged high risk of bias for the reference standard, both pDST and gDST, though we considered gDST a better reference standard. Pulmonary tuberculosis detection - Xpert MTB/XDR sensitivity range, 98.3% (96.1 to 99.5) to 98.9% (96.2 to 99.9) and specificity range, 22.5% (14.3 to 32.6) to 100.0% (86.3 to 100.0); median prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis 91.3%, (interquartile range, 89.3% to 91.8%), (2 studies; 1 study reported on 2 cohorts, 1228 participants; very low-certainty evidence, sensitivity and specificity). Drug resistance detection People irrespective of rifampicin resistance - Isoniazid resistance: Xpert MTB/XDR summary sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval (CI)) were 94.2% (87.5 to 97.4) and 98.5% (92.6 to 99.7) against pDST, (6 cohorts, 1083 participants, moderate-certainty evidence, sensitivity and specificity). - Fluoroquinolone resistance: Xpert MTB/XDR summary sensitivity and specificity were 93.2% (88.1 to 96.2) and 98.0% (90.8 to 99.6) against pDST, (6 cohorts, 1021 participants; high-certainty evidence, sensitivity; moderate-certainty evidence, specificity). People with known rifampicin resistance - Ethionamide resistance: Xpert MTB/XDR summary sensitivity and specificity were 98.0% (74.2 to 99.9) and 99.7% (83.5 to 100.0) against gDST, (4 cohorts, 434 participants; very low-certainty evidence, sensitivity and specificity). - Amikacin resistance: Xpert MTB/XDR summary sensitivity and specificity were 86.1% (75.0 to 92.7) and 98.9% (93.0 to 99.8) against pDST, (4 cohorts, 490 participants; low-certainty evidence, sensitivity; high-certainty evidence, specificity). Of 1000 people with pulmonary tuberculosis, detected as tuberculosis by Xpert MTB/XDR: - where 50 have isoniazid resistance, 61 would have an Xpert MTB/XDR result indicating isoniazid resistance: of these, 14/61 (23%) would not have isoniazid resistance (FP); 939 (of 1000 people) would have a result indicating the absence of isoniazid resistance: of these, 3/939 (0%) would have isoniazid resistance (FN). - where 50 have fluoroquinolone resistance, 66 would have an Xpert MTB/XDR result indicating fluoroquinolone resistance: of these, 19/66 (29%) would not have fluoroquinolone resistance (FP); 934 would have a result indicating the absence of fluoroquinolone resistance: of these, 3/934 (0%) would have fluoroquinolone resistance (FN). - where 300 have ethionamide resistance, 296 would have an Xpert MTB/XDR result indicating ethionamide resistance: of these, 2/296 (1%) would not have ethionamide resistance (FP); 704 would have a result indicating the absence of ethionamide resistance: of these, 6/704 (1%) would have ethionamide resistance (FN). - where 135 have amikacin resistance, 126 would have an Xpert MTB/XDR result indicating amikacin resistance: of these, 10/126 (8%) would not have amikacin resistance (FP); 874 would have a result indicating the absence of amikacin resistance: of these, 19/874 (2%) would have amikacin resistance (FN).

Authors' Conclusions

Review findings suggest that, in people determined by Xpert MTB/XDR to be tuberculosis-positive, Xpert MTB/XDR provides accurate results for detection of isoniazid and fluoroquinolone resistance and can assist with selection of an optimised treatment regimen. Given that Xpert MTB/XDR targets a limited number of resistance variants in specific genes, the test may perform differently in different settings. Findings in this review should be interpreted with caution. Sensitivity for detection of ethionamide resistance was based only on Xpert MTB/XDR detection of mutations in the inhA promoter region, a known limitation. High risk of bias limits our confidence in Xpert MTB/XDR accuracy for pulmonary tuberculosis. Xpert MTB/XDR's impact will depend on its ability to detect tuberculosis (required for DST), prevalence of resistance to a given drug, health care infrastructure, and access to other tests.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1153jrgH]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Xpert MTB/RIF (pre-Ultra) assay — rifampin resistance detection in tuberculosis (TB) among people with HIV includes defined performance and confirmatory steps. In a 2014 meta-analysis, the sensitivity for rifampin resistance detection was 95% (95% CI, 90% to 97%) and the specificity was 98% (95% CI, 97% to 99%), but false-positive results can occur and sequence-based testing should be done to confirm results. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) is not an absolute gold standard, and some isolates with rifampin resistance by Xpert MTB/RIF have rpoB mutations but are susceptible in phenotypic assays, with treatment failure more common when isolates show phenotypic susceptibility yet harbor rpoB resistance-determining region mutations than with wild type rpoB sequences. In low multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) prevalence settings such as the United States, the positive predictive value of rifampin-resistance tests is limited; therefore, isolates with an initial rifampin-resistance read by Xpert MTB/RIF should undergo confirmatory testing (rpoB gene sequencing or phenotypic drug susceptibility testing), additional specimens should be obtained, and consultation with an expert in MDR TB is recommended. Clinicians who suspect drug-resistant TB in a patient with HIV should make every effort to expedite a diagnosis and consult with their state TB program and CDC as needed.

Drug‐resistant tuberculosis categories

Five categories are used to classify cases of drug‐resistant tuberculosis (WHO Consolidated Guidelines (Module 4) 2020; WHO Extensively Drug‐Resistant Tuberculosis 2021).

Rifampicin‐resistant tuberculosis is caused by M tuberculosis strains resistant to rifampicin (resistance caused by mutations in a small region of the rpoB gene). These strains may be susceptible or resistant to isoniazid (i.e. MDR‐TB), or to other drugs.
MDR‐TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, two core tuberculosis drugs. A subset of people with rifampicin‐resistant tuberculosis will have MDR‐TB.
Isoniazid‐resistant tuberculosis is caused by M tuberculosis strains resistant to isoniazid and susceptible to rifampicin.
Pre‐XDR‐TB is caused by M tuberculosis that fulfils the definition of MDR‐TB or rifampicin‐resistant tuberculosis, and which are also resistant to a fluoroquinolone. Fluoroquinolones include levofloxacin and moxifloxacin.
XDR‐TB is caused by M tuberculosis that fulfils the definition of rifampicin‐resistant or MDR‐TB and which are also resistant to a fluoroquinolone and at least one other additional Group A drug (bedaquiline, linezolid). The present version of Xpert MTB/XDR is not capable of detecting WHO‐defined XDR‐TB owing to an update in the definition to take into consideration new and repurposed drugs for tuberculosis treatment.

MDR/rifampicin‐resistant tuberculosis

Rifampicin resistance is already detected by rapid molecular WHO‐recommended diagnostic tests (such as Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, and Truenat assays) that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. These conditions are combined together in a single test because rifampicin resistance is the most frequent form of tuberculosis resistance. Globally in 2020, 69% of bacteriologically confirmed new tuberculosis cases were tested for rifampicin resistance, though testing coverage varied, for example, 58% in Indonesia and 98% in India (WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2021). And among people with rifampicin resistance, 77,626/157,842 (49.2%) were tested for resistance to any fluoroquinolone (WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2021).

### Prospective exploratory evaluation of cepheid xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis host response cartridge: a focus on adolescents and young adults [^113yP9AH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

An accurate, rapid, non-sputum-based triage test for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) is needed.

Methods

A prospective evaluation of the Cepheid GeneXpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Response cartridge (Xpert-MTB-HR), a prototype blood-based host response mRNA signature assay, among individuals presenting with TB-like symptoms was performed in Pakistan and results were compared to 3 reference standards: Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, bacteriological confirmation (Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and/or culture positivity), and composite clinical diagnosis (clinician diagnosis, treatment initiation, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, and/or culture positivity). Analyses were conducted both for the entire study cohort and separately in the adolescent and young adult cohort (aged 10–24 years).

Results

A total of 497 participants, aged 6–83 years, returned valid Xpert-MTB-HR results. When a diagnostic threshold was set for a sensitivity of > 90%, specificity was 32% (95% confidence interval, 28%–37%) compared to Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, 29% (95% CI, 25%–34%) compared to a bacteriological confirmation, and 22% (95% CI, 18%–26%) compared to a composite clinical diagnosis. However, when evaluating only the adolescent and young adult cohort with a diagnostic threshold set for sensitivity of > 90%, specificity was 82% (95% CI, 74%–89%) compared to Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, 84% (95% CI, 75%–90%) compared to a bacteriological confirmation, and 54% (95% CI, 44%–64%) compared to a composite clinical diagnosis.

Conclusions

While the Xpert-MTB-HR does not meet World Health Organization minimum criteria in the general population, in our study it does meet the minimum sensitivity and specificity requirements for a non-sputum-based triage test among adolescents and young adults when compared to Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra or bacteriological confirmation.

Assessment of certainty of the evidence

Four review authors assessed the certainty of the evidence (also called quality of the evidence) using the GRADE approach, and GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GDT) software. In the context of a systematic review, ratings of the certainty of the evidence reflect the extent of our confidence that the estimates of effect (including test accuracy and associations) are correct. As recommended, we rated the certainty of the evidence as either high (not downgraded), moderate (downgraded by one level), low (downgraded by two levels), or very low (downgraded by more than two levels) for five domains: risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, and publication bias.

For each outcome, we considered the certainty of the evidence to begin as high when high‐quality observational studies (cross‐sectional or cohort studies) enrolled participants with diagnostic uncertainty. If we had a reason for downgrading, we used our judgement to classify the reason as serious (downgraded by one level) or very serious (downgraded by two levels). We summarized this information in the 'Summary of findings' tables (Table 1; Table 2).

### The elusive allure of a rapid host blood signature for tuberculosis disease [^113be9xe]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the inflammatory nature of TB disease, a host mRNA transcriptional signature was identified to distinguish TB disease from other infections. Since then, several clinical validation studies and a randomized controlled trial have been completed, each one causing both disappointment and optimism. Meanwhile, Cepheid has developed a novel molecular cartridge to quantify the presence of three host genes — guanylate-binding protein 5 (GBP5), dual-specificity phosphatase 3 (DUSP3), and Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) — based on prior research. If successful, the three-gene signature cartridge could represent another major step forward for TB diagnosis and treatment monitoring.

In a recent article, Li and colleagues conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the Cepheid 3-gene host response assay (Xpert-MTB-HR) within a diagnostic case-control study in China. The team enrolled adults (≥ 15 years) who had TB-related symptoms or abnormal chest radiography, as well as healthy controls. The Xpert-MTB-HR test was performed on 100 microliters of venous whole blood that was collected at the same time as the three-sputa sample. A "TB score" was calculated for the Xpert-MTB-HR result by subtracting the cycle threshold of KLF2, which is downregulated in TB, from 1/2 the added cycle threshold values for GBP5 and DUSP3, which are both upregulated in TB. After combining three sputa specimens, from those with signs or symptoms of TB, and performing some pre-analytical concentration (which is atypical for an Xpert assay), the resuspended specimen was tested by Xpert Ultra and liquid culture. The final cohort included 149 symptomatic adults with microbiologically confirmed TB disease, 248 symptomatic adults negative by Ultra and liquid culture (presumed other respiratory diseases), and 193 adults without signs or symptoms of TB as healthy controls.

### Evaluation of the cepheid 3-gene host response blood test for tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment response monitoring in a primary-level clinic in rural China [^112U9Pjx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

A rapid, accurate, non-sputum-based triage test for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) is a high-priority need. Cepheid developed a novel prototype blood test, Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis Host Response (Xpert-MTB-HR), which generates a TB score based on the mRNA expression of three genes. We conducted a case-control study with prospective recruitment to evaluate its accuracy in the clinic of the Wusheng County Centers for Disease Prevention and Control in China. We enrolled 149 TB patients, 248 other respiratory diseases (ORD) patients, and 193 healthy controls. In addition, whole-blood samples taken from TB patients after 2, 5, and 6 months of treatment were tested with Xpert-MTB-HR to evaluate its ability to monitor treatment response. Xpert-MTB-HR discriminated between TB and healthy controls with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.912 (95% CI, 0.878–0.945). With the specificity of 70% envisioned for a triage test, its sensitivity was 90.1% (84.9%-94.6%). Xpert-MTB-HR discriminated between TB and ORD with an AUC of 0.798 (0.750–0.847), and at specificity of 70%, the sensitivity was only 75.8% (68.5%-82.8%). In patients determined by Ultra to have medium or high sputum bacillary loads, with specificity of 70%, the sensitivity for discriminating patients with TB from healthy controls was 100.0% (100.0–100.0) and from patients with ORD, 95.1% (89.8–100.0). The TB scores generally increased by 2 months of treatment and then remained stable. Xpert-MTB-HR met the criteria for a triage test to discriminate between TB and healthy controls, but not between TB and ORD, except when limited to patients with high sputum bacillary loads. Xpert-MTB-HR showed promise for monitoring response to treatment but needs to be further evaluated in larger prospective studies.

### Xpert MTB / RIF ultra and xpert MTB / RIF assays for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^117AZdW4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rifampicin resistance

Rifampicin inhibits bacterial DNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by the RNA polymerase gene (rpoB) (Hartmann 1967). Resistance to this drug has been associated mainly with mutations in a limited region of the rpoB gene (Telenti 1993). Rifampicin resistance may occur alone or in association with resistance to isoniazid and other drugs. In settings with a high burden of MDR‐TB, the presence of rifampicin resistance alone may serve as a proxy for MDR‐TB (WHO 2011). People with drug‐resistant tuberculosis can transmit the infection to others.

Index test(s)

The index tests, Xpert MTB/RIF and Ultra Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert Ultra, the newest version) (Cepheid Inc, Sunnyvale, USA), are nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) (i.e. molecular tests) used for diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin‐resistant tuberculosis. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra cartridges are used with the GeneXpert system (Cepheid 2018; Cepheid 2019). Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are able to detect both M tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance within two hours after starting the test, with minimal hands‐on technical time. Unlike conventional NAATs, with Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra, sample processing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and detection are integrated into a single, self‐enclosed test unit, the GeneXpert cartridge. Following sample loading, all steps in the assay are completely automated and self‐contained. In addition, the assays' sample reagent, used to liquefy sputum, has potent tuberculocidal (the ability to kill tuberculosis bacteria) properties and so largely eliminates biosafety concerns during the test procedure (Banada 2010). Except as described below for Ultra trace call results, a single Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra run will provide both detection of tuberculosis and detection of rifampicin resistance. One cannot deselect testing for rifampicin resistance and only run the assay for tuberculosis detection.

### Xpert MTB / RIF and xpert MTB / RIF ultra for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^111JvjjK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

We applied GRADE in the following ways.

Risk of bias: we used QUADAS‐2 to assess risk of bias.
Indirectness: we used QUADAS‐2 for concerns of applicability and looked for important differences between the populations studied (for example, the spectrum of disease), the setting, index test, and outcomes, and asked whether differences were sufficient to lower certainty in results.
Inconsistency: GRADE recommends downgrading for unexplained inconsistency in sensitivity and specificity estimates. We carried out prespecified analyses to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity and did not downgrade when we believed we could explain inconsistency in the accuracy estimates.
Imprecision: we considered a precise estimate to be one that would allow a clinically meaningful decision. We considered the width of the CrI and asked ourselves, 'Would we make a different decision if the lower or upper boundary of the CrI represented the truth?'. In addition, we worked out projected ranges for TP, FN, TN, and FP for a given prevalence of tuberculosis and made judgements on imprecision from these calculations. We also considered whether the number of participants included in the analysis was less than the number generated by a conventional sample size calculation for a single adequately‐powered study.
Publication bias: we rated publication bias as undetected (not serious) because of the comprehensiveness of the literature search and following extensive outreach to tuberculosis researchers to identify studies. As we included a large number of studies, we thought that had we missed several small studies, the results would probably not be different.

### Diagnostic accuracy study of a novel blood-based assay for identification of tuberculosis in people living with HIV [^116eDPPz]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although these data hold promise for the performance of Xpert-MTB-HR-Prototype, widespread access and use will depend on costs and programs that enable access to the cartridge. Widespread use is unlikely to occur if costs are much higher than those of currently available Xpert MTB/RIF tests. Current pricing systems for other Xpert products in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis are likely to be employed when this product is available to the market.

The study has several limitations. First, all samples used in the study were from HIV-positive subjects. In active screening, a large proportion of subjects are expected to be HIV negative, where the 3-gene TB signature has been shown to have a higher accuracy. Second, while this was a nested case-control study, the degree of bias is probably very limited, as controls were selected from the same population as the cases, and the characteristics of the population in terms of TB prevalence and smear status are similar to those of the total cohort. Third, as the study was used as a derivation cohort to select an optimal cut point and use case, the performance needs to be further evaluated in a validation cohort with a set cut point. Fourth, the study assessed samples from South Africa and Peru only, and the sample size from Peru was too small to perform subgroup analysis by country of origin. While South Africa contributes a significant share of the global TB/HIV epidemic, it will be critical to validate the host-marker-based signature in other countries where there are more coinfections likely (e.g. in equatorial Africa), other strains circulating, and other host genetic backgrounds. However, as we note above, the 3-gene TB signature itself has been extensively validated across different countries, thus substantially reducing the likelihood of effects of other circulating strains and host genetics on its performance. Additionally, we may have disadvantaged the prototype cartridge by excluding extrapulmonary TB since this may result in a host response similar to that in pulmonary TB. Thus, the prototype cartridge could have detected cases that otherwise would have been missed or required invasive sampling. However, further investigation is needed to confirm this claim. Finally, another limitation is that testing of the samples was performed nonblinded to the results of the reference standard by the test manufacturer. However, given that this was the first accuracy study of the cartridge, and no preset cut point was available, blinding was not possible as a cut point needed to be defined. Given that no subjective interpretation is necessary for the test, this is not likely to introduce bias. And importantly, all data were made available to FIND for analysis independently.

### Consensus statement on research definitions for drug-resistant tuberculosis in children [^114T7p4E]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2013). Low credibility.

Definitions of Drug Resistance and Testing Methodology

Although drug resistance is generally divided into the discrete categories of mono-, poly-, MDR-TB or extensively DR-TB (see Table 1), it is more useful to view drug resistance as a continuum. For research into pediatric DR-TB, it is important to describe the precise drug-susceptibility test (DST) pattern. It is also important to record the DST pattern of the likely source case(s), rather than their DST category, when the child has been diagnosed presumptively.

Due to the wide variety of testing methodologies available to determine drug resistance, at a minimum, researchers should clearly state the laboratory techniques used in determining drug resistance. It should be documented to which drugs DST was performed and which techniques were used for each of the drugs. If DST is determined by phenotypic testing, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute standards should be used. It is anticipated that more DST will be carried out using genotypic methods in the future. More than 10 genotypic tests exist using nucleic acid amplification to determine drug resistance. Some assays only determine whether the organism belongs to the M tuberculosis complex and whether mutations in the rpoB gene are present (associated with rifampin resistance in > 95% cases). The Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) is one such test, which is currently being rolled out widely. If this test is used and the rpoB mutation result is positive, the sample should be recorded as having resistance to rifampin, because this test cannot confirm or rule out resistance to isoniazid. The frequency of rifampin-monoresistant strains is increasing in some settings, and samples found to be rifampin-resistant should therefore not be assumed to also be resistant to isoniazid. Conversely, isoniazid-monoresistant TB is common in many regions; if a sample is found not to have an rpoB gene mutation, it should not be assumed to be fully DS. Consequently, it is important to follow up results from nucleic acid amplification tests that only detect rifampin resistance with additional testing for isoniazid resistance.

It is the only FDA-approved assay and it integrates diagnosis of TB and detection of rifampin resistance, and if this test is used for the diagnosis of TB, a rifampin resistance result is automatically provided regardless of patient risk.

### Xpert MTB / RIF ultra and xpert MTB / RIF assays for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^11122Sod]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Notably, concerns have been raised about rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST) methods, in particular automated mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) 960 for tuberculosis drug resistance using the recommended critical concentrations. As a priority, the WHO is planning to re‐evaluate the critical concentrations for rifampicin (WHO 2018).

For Xpert Ultra, we found a high rate (36.1%) of indeterminate rifampicin resistance results, all owing to trace call results. This finding was expected since, for trace call results, rifampicin resistance cannot be determined. Xpert Ultra incorporates two new multi‐copy amplification targets (IS 6110 and IS 1081). Trace call indicates that only the multi‐copy targets were detected, and not the tuberculosis‐specific regions in the rpoB gene. Resistance to rifampicin has mainly been associated mainly with mutations in a limited region of the rpoB gene (Telenti 1993).

### Real-life clinical practice of using the xpert MTB / RIF assay in Thailand [^114Ajgtz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Delayed diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and drug-resistant TB are major challenges of TB control in Thailand. This study assessed the practicality of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay in a real-life setting with high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).

Methods

This prospective study was conducted at 3 large tertiary care hospitals. Patients who had suspected PTB were enrolled into the study. Expectorated sputum samples were sent for staining, mycobacterial culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF.

Results

Four hundred ninety-four patients were enrolled. From 355 cases with final diagnosis of PTB, 263 (71.8%) had definite diagnosis and 92 cases had probable diagnosis. Among TB culture-positive cases, Xpert MTB/RIF had 100% and 81% sensitivity in sputum smear-positive and smear-negative groups, respectively. The specificity was 95.7%. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of Xpert MTB/RIF in culture-negative but clinically diagnosed PTB was 37.8% and 83.8%, respectively. Centrifugation was required in 59% cases with scanty sputum. Five cases were false-positive by Xpert MTB/RIF in patients with nontuberculous mycobacteria, old PTB scar, and immune reconstitution syndrome. Discordant rifampicin susceptibility results of Xpert MTB/RIF and mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) were confirmed by using rpoB gene sequencing, which raised the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF in detecting rifampicin resistance to 93.8%.

Conclusions

Xpert MTB/RIF is an effective tool in diagnosing PTB but will be more cost-effective for sputum-negative patients and in settings with high prevalence of rifampicin resistance. Early diagnosis of TB results in early treatment and implementation of strategies to limit spreading of TB. Sputum centrifugation may increase the yield of Xpert MTB/RIF.

### Clinical use of whole genome sequencing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis [^112aXbrS]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The aforementioned molecular diagnostic tests are targeted methods for predicting the phenotype of the organism from the detected genotype. These examine a limited number of sites known to be associated with varying levels of resistance to the specific drugs mentioned. False negatives can arise, for example, when any rifampicin-resistant (RIF R) mutations that lie outside the rpoB RIF resistance-determining region (RRDR), such as the I491F mutation in RpoB, are not detected by the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay leading to the isolate being incorrectly called susceptible. Similarly, false positives can arise when a polymorphism in the RRDR region of rpoB is detected and RIF R predicted when they are either completely rifampicin-sensitive (RIF S) or have a low level of resistance that could be overcome by an appropriately increased dosage (see below). Furthermore, it is important to understand that resistance is not a binary phenomenon, and the variable impact of individual mutations on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) raises the possibility of designing personalized treatment regimes, for example:
i) It has been established that INH resistance, predominantly mediated through loss of catalase-peroxidase activity via mutations in katG, produce high-level resistant strains (MIC: 2–8 μg/ml INH) and that the KatG S315T substitution occurs in 50–95% of INH-resistant isolates. However, mutations in the inhA gene or promotor region produce low-level resistant strains (MIC: 0.2–0.5 μg/ml) occurring in 8–43% of INH-resistant isolates. Therefore, if a katG high-level resistance mutation is detected, isoniazid therapy should not be included and could be substituted with prothionamide. Prothionamide has the same drug target as INH, namely InhA, but it is activated from the pro-drug form to the active drug by a different enzyme, EthA, and mutations in the ethA gene might contraindicate the use of prothionamide. If, however, an inhA promotor mutation is present suggesting low-level resistance, then INH could remain in the regimen but at a higher dosage as INH has a high therapeutic margin.
ii) Moxifloxacin is a second-line drug included in standard MDR-TB regimens, and specific mutations in the gyrA gene confer resistance often suggesting the presence of an XDR-TB isolate. However, different mutations in gyrA impact MIC values differently according to the quinolone type. For example, an MIC value for moxifloxacin of 1 μg/mL has been shown in isolates with the A90V substitution in GyrA. This would be called resistant by conventional phenotyping using the standard breakpoint of > 0.5 μg/ml, but Feasey et al. showed successful treatment by increasing the dose of moxifloxacin from 400 to 600 mg in order to achieve in vivo drug levels above the MIC. Subsequent identification of this A90V mutation in other clinical isolates could be used as evidence to indicate similar dosage alterations for effective treatment in the face of a resistant DST result.
iii) Mutations in the 89 base pair RRDR of rpoB confer a range of resistance phenotypes with large variations in MICs. Knowing the exact mutation and subsequent amino acid change is therefore crucial. A case of possible MDR-TB could be indicated by a positive Xpert® MTB/RIF assay and called RIF R because of a SNP in the RRDR that is different from wild-type, identified by one of the five probes used in that test. This SNP could be a simple phylogenetic polymorphism independent of resistance, or a SNP associated with low-level RIF R. Such a false positive result would wrongly indicate MDR-TB and exclusion of RIF in the initial regimen prior to phenotypic susceptibility testing. For example, MIC data for a range of non-synonymous SNPs at codon 526 has been reported ranging from 1–256 μg/ml. Thus, RpoB H526N, an allele we recently found in a M. tuberculosis patient isolate, has an MIC of 0.25 μg/ml, so rifampicin can still be included in the regimen despite the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay returning a resistant result at initial diagnosis. Furthermore, different alleles have different levels of cross-resistance to rifabutin (RFB), a semi-synthetic derivative of RIF. For example, mutation H526L is associated with a RIF R /RFB S pattern and might inform the substitution of RFB into a therapy regimen. Sequence data might thus direct the use of either RIF or RFB depending on the exact allele identified.

### Paucibacillary tuberculosis drives the low positive predictive value of xpert MTB / RIF ultra for rifampicin resistance detection in low-prevalence settings [^1174c54z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Advancements in molecular diagnostics have significantly transformed tuberculosis (TB) healthcare by enhancing early detection, drug resistance identification, and case management. Rifampicin (RIF), the cornerstone of first-line anti-TB therapy, is crucial for achieving relapse-free cures. Rifampicin-resistant (RR)-TB is an indicator of multidrug resistance (MDR-TB), requiring the use of second-line anti-TB treatment. Accurate tests for RR are essential for appropriate patient management. The roll-out of Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, USA) has been pivotal, offering rapid and robust TB diagnosis with simultaneous RR detection. However, the assay's tendency to report false RR in paucibacillary samples had raised concerns. Its successor, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra), demonstrates an increased sensitivity for TB detection at a modest specificity cost, although the use of sloppy molecular beacon probes with melting temperature (Tm) analysis is expected to mitigate the issue of false-RR detection. Prior to its global deployment in 2017, the early validation of Ultra in enriched clinicals sputum samples suggested an excellent 99.0% specificity in detecting RR, with no false RR reported in low bacterial load samples. A multicenter diagnostic accuracy study across 8 countries demonstrated that Ultra had comparable sensitivity (95%) and specificity (98%) to Xpert for detecting RR. These data and subsequent performance reports led to the recommendation of Ultra and its global adoption by national TB control programs (NTPs) to enhance TB detection while offering more reliable RR results. However, few post-implementation studies have validated Ultra's RR performance in programmatic settings, particularly in low RR-TB prevalence or systematic screening contexts, where a low positive predicted value (PPV) is expected.

Rwanda's NTP has gradually replaced Xpert MTB/RIF with Ultra in all 82 testing centers. We conducted a prospective analysis to assess the performance of Ultra in detecting RR by repeating Ultra on a second specimen for all detected RR-TB patients, and resolving discrepancies between initial and subsequent Ultra results by a composite reference standard comprising of rpoB gene sequencing and phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing (pDST). We further explored factors contributing to false-RR results and the low PPV.

### Truenat MTB assays for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and adolescents [^11762eVp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Xpert assays detect the presence of MTB and rifampicin resistance in a single step. Sample processing and the amplification process are combined in a closed system. Xpert MTB/RIF is based on detecting five overlapping 81‐bp regions in the rpoB gene (i.e. rifampicin resistance‐determining region (RRDR)) and uses molecular beacon technology (Cepheid 2022a; Rajendran 2022). The Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra test is based on two multicopy targets, IS 6110 and IS 1081, for MTB detection and rifampicin resistance, respectively, with improved cartridge design and assay design (Cepheid 2022b; Chakravorty 2017). The test procedure involves mixing the sample reagent with the sputum provided by the manufacturer at a ratio of 2:1 for a direct specimen and 3:1 for processed pellets (Blakemore 2010). After an incubation period of 15 minutes, the mixture is loaded into the cartridge. The steps following sample loading are fully automated.

The total run time for the Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assays are two hours and one to 1.5 hours, respectively (Chakravorty 2017; Theron 2014). According to one systematic review, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra showed a higher sensitivity (90.9%, 95% credible interval (CrI) 86.2 to 94.7) compared to Xpert MTB/RIF (84.7%, 95% CrI 78.6 to 89.9), but exhibited lower specificity (95.6%, 95% CrI 93.0 to 97.4 for Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra; 98.4%, 95% CrI 97.0 to 99.3 for Xpert MTB/RIF) (Zifodya 2021). The current WHO recommendation, based on high‐certainty evidence, is to use Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra for the initial detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance (WHO 2024).

### Xpert ultra versus xpert MTB / RIF for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis [^1172NcCi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

In a systematic review of economic evaluations (28 studies), Zwerling and colleagues summarized costs, cost‐effectiveness, and affordability of molecular tests for tuberculosis, including Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra, and Truenat (Molbio Diagnostics, Goa, India). Most studies evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF; no studies evaluated Xpert Ultra; and one study evaluated Truenat (WHO Consolidated Guidelines (Module 3) 2020). Variations in costing, effectiveness, and epidemiological parameters were present in the included studies, making direct comparisons across studies challenging. The review found that the cost‐effectiveness of Xpert MTB/RIF improved among populations with higher tuberculosis and HIV prevalence and in settings where rates of empirical tuberculosis treatment were low. Cost‐effectiveness of Xpert MTB/RIF is dependent on a number of factors, including placement of GeneXpert machines (in centralized or decentralized facilities), testing volume, tuberculosis prevalence, level of empirical tuberculosis treatment, and pretreatment loss to follow‐up (WHO Consolidated Guidelines (Module 3) 2020).

After the WHO recommended the use of Xpert MTB/RIF, country‐level uptake was rapid. A 2018 survey of market penetration of Xpert MTB/RIF in high tuberculosis burden countries found greater use of Xpert MTB/RIF compared to smear microscopy for tuberculosis diagnosis (Cazabon 2018). There are currently no publications regarding market penetration of Xpert Ultra, which only requires new cartridges and a software update to existing GeneXpert machines. However, by the end of 2019, over 80 countries had procured Xpert Ultra tests. In more than 20 of these countries, Xpert Ultra conversion from MTB/RIF was greater than 90%. Examples of countries fully converted to Xpert Ultra are Eswatini (high TB/HIV burden country); Lesotho (high tuberculosis burden and high TB/HIV burden country); Morocco; South Africa (high tuberculosis burden, high TB/HIV burden, high MDR‐TB burden country); Uganda (high TB/HIV burden country); Ukraine (high MDR‐TB burden country); and Zimbabwe (high tuberculosis burden, high TB/HIV burden, high MDR‐TB burden country) (Denamps 2020 [pers comm]).

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^112r5sCi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Rapid molecular DST — alternative assays, validation, and confirmation of rifampin resistance: Other assays using alternative molecular techniques (eg, automated real-time polymerase chain reaction [PCR] with sequencing, loop-mediated isothermal amplification [LAMP]) are being developed, and these assays are promising, but are not yet commercially available; data on in-house tests show substantial heterogeneity, and if in-house tests are to be used, they should be validated and shown to have performance accuracy at least comparable to that of commercial tests. Because the prevalence of rifampin resistance is low in the United States, the PPV of Xpert MTB/RIF or other assays will be lower than in settings where Xpert MTB/RIF has been predominantly studied; therefore, confirmation of a positive test result for rifampin resistance has been recommended, and to confirm a positive result, genetic loci associated with rifampin resistance (to include rpoB), as well as isoniazid resistance (to include inhA and katG), should be sequenced to assess for MDR-TB. It is possible that these techniques will be sufficiently sensitive to be used for AFB smear–negative specimens, and laboratories in the United States should only use tests approved by the FDA or tests that have been produced and validated in accord with applicable FDA and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments regulations.

### Comparison of same day diagnostic tools including gene xpert and unstimulated IFN-γ for the evaluation of pleural tuberculosis: a prospective cohort study [^113DX2A5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Given the limitations of a single pleural fluid TB culture for confirming a diagnosis, patients were categorised as follows: Definite -TB: patients with at least one positive M. tuberculosis culture by liquid culture (in either pleural fluid, biopsy or sputum) and/or caseating granulomatous inflammation suggestive of TB on histological examination of pleural biopsy tissue, and with improvement on anti-TB treatment (all patients in this category received anti-TB treatment); Probable -TB: patients not meeting the criteria for definite-TB but with a clinical-radiological picture suggestive of TB and who were treated for TB with clinical response (all patients in this category received anti-TB treatment); Non -TB: patients for whom no microbiological or histological evidence of M. tuberculosis could be found, and/or for whom an alternative diagnosis was available. These patients at presentation and on follow-up did not receive anti-TB treatment.

All the laboratory staff performing the requested tests, including Xpert MTB/RIF and IFN-γ measurement, were blinded to all microbiological and clinical information.

IFN-γ measurement

Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) concentrations were measured in pleural fluid supernatant in duplicate using the InterGam Ultrasensitive Rapid Immuno-suspension Assay (IRISA; Antrum Biotech, Cape Town, South Africa; limit of detection = 5 to 10 pg/ml). Pleural fluid supernatant was prepared by centrifuging pleural fluid at 3000×g for 15 min to remove any unwanted debris.

### Added value of xpert MTB / RIF ultra for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in a low-prevalence setting [^112u1s7u]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The molecular point-of-care test (POCT) Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) assay that detectsand resistance to rifampin (RIF-R) has dramatically improved the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). Xpert displays reduced turnaround time and shortened patient isolation and time to initiate anti-TB drugs and is more sensitive and specific than smear microscopy for acid-fast bacillus (AFB) detection. This test is now recommended to initiate the microbial diagnosis of tuberculosis, as well as to address patient's transmission potential based on the semiquantitative result. Despite a very low limit of detection (LOD; ∼131 CFU/ml), Xpert remains less sensitive than liquid culture (LOD ∼1 to 50 CFU/ml). In addition, using Xpert, false-positive RIF-R have been reported, especially in the context of paucibacillary specimens or in case of silent mutation in rpoB. False-negative RIF-R can also be due to mixed population of susceptible and resistant isolates.

The Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra; Cepheid) is a new version of the molecular POCT designed to improve the sensitivity forDNA detection. In comparison to Xpert, Ultra displays a decreased LOD for(∼15.6 CFU/ml); this improvement is achieved by targeting multicopy sequences, namely IS 6110 (∼16 copies/cells) and the IS 1810 (∼5 copies/cells) in Ultra, while Xpert targets the single-copy gene rpoB. Diagnostic performance established especially in intermediate and high-TB-burden regions reported increased sensitivity of Ultra compared to Xpert. In contrast, the specificity of Ultra appeared to be lower than that of Xpert; this was explained by the increased detection ofDNA from dead bacilli in patients with a history of treated TB. Indeed, no cross-reactivity with DNA from nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) or other bacteria has been reported. Rifampicin resistance detection has also been improved in Ultra by relying on the interpretation of the melting curves in the active site of rpoB. With no decrease in sensitivity compared to Xpert, Ultra can identify with an increased specificity rifampin resistance-associated mutations.

In this study, we provide data on the performance and accuracy of Ultra in a region where the prevalence of tuberculosis is low.

### Should neighbours of tuberculosis (TB) cases be prioritised for active case finding in high TB-burden settings? A prospective molecular epidemiological study [^11484YVe]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Baseline data collection and screening algorithm

ICs were interviewed to collect demographic information, medical history and anthropometric examination. Xpert MTB/RIF test results were obtained from the health facility where the test was undertaken. Sputum samples were sent to the research laboratory for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) examination and M. tb culture.

All consenting contacts were interviewed to collect sociodemographic information, TB and medical history, and screened for TB symptoms using a standardised questionnaire. They were referred for chest X-ray (CXR), which was read by a radiologist independent of the study and classified as (1) normal, (2) suggestive active TB, (3) suggestive inactive TB or (4) abnormal not TB. From anyone with a cough or CXR suggestive of active TB (online supplemental figure S2), two sputum samples were tested at the CHC using Xpert MTB/RIF, while two other samples were sent to our research laboratory for AFB and M. tb culture.

All test results were reviewed alongside screening results by the study doctor, and participants were classified into five TB case categories: (1) 'all TB': M. tb culture or Xpert MTB/RIF positive or on anti-TB medication; (2) bacteriologically confirmed TB: M. tb culture or Xpert MTB/RIF positive; (3) probable TB: TB symptoms or CXR suggestive of TB and AFB smear positive but culture negative/not done; (4) possible TB: TB symptoms or CXR suggestive of TB and AFB smear negative and culture negative/not done; or (5) no TB: no evidence of TB on investigation (online supplemental table S1). All participants with likely TB were referred to the local CHC for further evaluation and commencement of treatment.

### Xpert MTB / RIF and xpert MTB / RIF ultra for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^112UuWQD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert MTB/RIF) and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra), the newest version, are the only World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in persons with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, at lower health system levels. A previous Cochrane Review found Xpert MTB/RIF sensitive and specific for tuberculosis (Steingart 2014). Since the previous review, new studies have been published. We performed a review update for an upcoming WHO policy review.

Objectives

To determine diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for tuberculosis in adults with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and for rifampicin resistance in adults with presumptive rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, and ProQuest, to 11 October 2018, without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials, cross-sectional, and cohort studies using respiratory specimens that evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra, or both against the reference standard, culture for tuberculosis and culture-based drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus for rifampicin resistance.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form. When possible, we also extracted data by smear and HIV status. We assessed study quality using QUADAS-2 and performed meta-analyses to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity separately for tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. We investigated potential sources of heterogeneity. Most analyses used a bivariate random-effects model. For tuberculosis detection, we first estimated accuracy using all included studies and then only the subset of studies where participants were unselected, i.e. not selected based on prior microscopy testing.

Main Results

We identified in total 95 studies (77 new studies since the previous review): 86 studies (42,091 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for tuberculosis and 57 studies (8287 participants) for rifampicin resistance. One study compared Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra on the same participant specimen. Tuberculosis detectionOf the total 86 studies, 45 took place in high tuberculosis burden and 50 in high TB/HIV burden countries. Most studies had low risk of bias. Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% credible Interval (CrI)) were 85% (82% to 88%) and 98% (97% to 98%), (70 studies, 37,237 unselected participants; high-certainty evidence). We found similar accuracy when we included all studies. For a population of 1000 people where 100 have tuberculosis on culture, 103 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-positive and 18 (17%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); 897 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-negative and 15 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives). Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI)) was 88% (85% to 91%) versus Xpert MTB/RIF 83% (79% to 86%); Xpert Ultra specificity was 96% (94% to 97%) versus Xpert MTB/RIF 98% (97% to 99%), (1 study, 1439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity was 98% (97% to 98%) in smear-positive and 67% (62% to 72%) in smear-negative, culture-positive participants, (45 studies). Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity was 88% (83% to 92%) in HIV-negative and 81% (75% to 86%) in HIV-positive participants; specificities were similar 98% (97% to 99%), (14 studies). Rifampicin resistance detectionXpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% Crl) were 96% (94% to 97%) and 98% (98% to 99%), (48 studies, 8020 participants; high-certainty evidence). For a population of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, 114 would be positive for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and 18 (16%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false-positives); 886 would be would be negative for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and four (0.4%) would have rifampicin resistance (false-negatives). Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95% CI) was 95% (90% to 98%) versus Xpert MTB/RIF 95% (91% to 98%); Xpert Ultra specificity was 98% (97% to 99%) versus Xpert MTB/RIF 98% (96% to 99%), (1 study, 551 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found Xpert MTB/RIF to be sensitive and specific for diagnosing PTB and rifampicin resistance, consistent with findings reported previously. Xpert MTB/RIF was more sensitive for tuberculosis in smear-positive than smear-negative participants and HIV-negative than HIV-positive participants. Compared with Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra had higher sensitivity and lower specificity for tuberculosis and similar sensitivity and specificity for rifampicin resistance (1 study). Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra provide accurate results and can allow rapid initiation of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

### Tuberculous meningitis: pathogenesis, immune responses, diagnostic challenges, and the potential of biomarker-based approaches [^112DkQaY]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) was developed to overcome some of the shortcomings of the initial Xpert test, including the inadequate sensitivity. In a recent prospective cohort study, Xpert Ultra demonstrated a sensitivity of 70% for probable or definite TBM (diagnosed based on uniform case definition) compared with 43% obtained by either Xpert or culture. Compared with either Xpert or culture, Xpert Ultra diagnosed TBM in HIV-infected adults with a sensitivity of 95% (21/22 cases). Although Ultra demonstrated improved performance, it does not appear to be adequate to rule out TBM due to concerns over low negative predictive value (NPV).

Another promising NAAT which will potentially be suitable for use in resource-limited settings, as it does not require expensive instruments or expertise and yields results in 60 minutes, is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test. When investigated as a diagnostic test for TBM, LAMP showed potential with sensitivity between 88% and 96% and specificity of 80% to 100%. Another NAAT that is commercially available (the Amplicor TB PCR test) has a sensitivity of ∼40% and specificity of ∼90% to 100% in the diagnosis of TBM, as reported in a recent review. The requirements of trained laboratory staff and high costs limit the wide use of the test. The Gen-probe amplifieddirect test (MTD), another NAAT, was initially intended for the detection ofin respiratory specimens. When CSF samples were used in the test, it showed potential in the diagnosis of TBM, with pooled sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 99%. Another commercial NAAT, the Genotype MTBDRplus is a molecular line probe assay that targets specific genes forcomplex detection, as well as rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) susceptibility. When evaluated in a few TBM cases, the sensitivity of the test was 33%, with specificity of 98% against a clinical reference standard. While most NAATs have shown potential as diagnostic tests for TBM, more data on the performance of the tests are still required. Overall, commercial NAATs have demonstrated high specificity but, generally, suboptimal sensitivity for TBM, whereas Xpert Ultra, although promising, can still miss up to 30% of TBM patients. Despite improved diagnostic performance, both the GeneXpert and Xpert Ultra tests cannot rule out TBM due to their low negative predictive value. Although NAATs are a major diagnostic advance, they are still inadequate to replace culture methods. The CRISPR-and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technologies (reviewed in reference), may improve the detection ofin CSF samples with low bacillary load. However, further investigations are required to ascertain the performance of these methods.

### Real-world clinical utility of xpert MTB / RIF ultra in the assessment of tuberculosis in a low-TB-incidence, high-resource setting [^112mkUE2]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Effective tuberculosis (TB) control is underpinned by early diagnosis and provision of effective treatment. Culture-based methods remain the diagnostic gold standard, providing evidence of a viable mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection and informing drug susceptibility. The TB action plan for England aims to achieve 80% culture confirmation for pulmonary TB (PTB) by 2025. However, the culture confirmation rate in England has not appreciably improved over the past decade for either PTB or extrapulmonary TB (EPTB). Compared with 2013, culture-positivity rates in 2022 increased from 73.1% to 75.6% for PTB and declined from 47.4% to 46.9% for EPTB. Furthermore, delayed diagnosis has remained a significant problem with one-thirds of PTB cases diagnosed more than 4 months after onset of symptomsincreasing the risk of onward transmission of MTB infection in the community. Although reasons for delayed diagnosis are multifactorial, improvements are possible with access to reliable rapid diagnostics. Historically, smear microscopy has complemented culture to support earlier diagnosis, but is limited by operator variability, poor sensitivity at lower bacillary burdenand poor specificity in settings where non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections contribute significantly to the burden of mycobacterial disease.

With significant advances in molecular technology, several rapid molecular diagnostic tests for TB have been developed that are endorsed for clinical use by the WHO. Of these, Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) and next-generation Xpert MTB/Ultra (Xpert-Ultra, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA) are automated nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) recommended as first-line diagnostic tests in children and adults with suspected PTB and EPTB. The majority of evidence supporting this recommendation comes from studies conducted in TB endemic settings, where large-scale adoption of the technology has occurred. In contrast, studies in low-TB-incidence settings are more equivocal. While an early study suggested higher cost with no additional utility using Xpert, other studies have reported benefits using Xpert to accelerate diagnosis and treatment initiation in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease and to differentiate TB from disease caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).

### Xpert MTB / XDR: a 10-color reflex assay suitable for point-of-care settings to detect isoniazid, fluoroquinolone, and second-line-injectable-drug resistance directly from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-positive sputum [^112UZkZi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

We describe the design, development, analytical performance, and a limited clinical evaluation of the 10-color Xpert MTB/XDR assay (CE-IVD only, not for sale in the United States). This assay is intended as a reflex test to detect resistance to isoniazid (INH), fluoroquinolones (FLQ), ethionamide (ETH), and second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs) in unprocessed sputum samples and concentrated sputum sediments which are positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis The Xpert MTB/XDR assay simultaneously amplifies eight genes and promoter regions in M. tuberculosis and analyzes melting temperatures (Tm s) using sloppy molecular beacon (SMB) probes to identify mutations associated with INH, FLQ, ETH, and SLID resistance. Results can be obtained in under 90 min using 10-color GeneXpert modules. The assay can differentiate low- versus high-level resistance to INH and FLQ as well as cross-resistance versus individual resistance to SLIDs by identifying mutation-specific Tm s or Tm patterns generated by the SMB probes. The assay has a limit of detection comparable to that of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and successfully detected 16 clinically significant mutations in a challenge set of clinical isolate DNA. In a clinical study performed at two sites with 100 sputum and 214 clinical isolates, the assay showed a sensitivity of 94% to 100% and a specificity of 100% for all drugs except for ETH compared to that of sequencing. The sensitivity and specificity were in the same ranges as those of phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing. Used in combination with a primary tuberculosis diagnostic test, this assay should expand the capacity for detection of drug-resistant tuberculosis near the point of care.

### Accuracy of xpert ultra in diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis among children in Uganda: a substudy from the SHINE trial [^113WJJNm]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

More than 96% of tuberculosis (TB)-related pediatric deaths are estimated to occur in children not receiving antituberculosis treatment, highlighting the importance of early and accurate diagnosis. Mycobacteriological diagnostics used for adults are less sensitive for samples from children, due to the paucibacillary nature of childhood TB disease and the difficulties of obtaining adequate specimens for bacteriological confirmation, as young children are frequently unable to voluntarily expectorate sputum. The development of rapid and accurate diagnostic TB tests is recognized as a vital part of the WHO End TB Strategy, as well as being important to allow appropriate early diagnosis and initiation of TB treatment in children.

In March 2017, Cepheid (Sunnyvale, CA, USA), with endorsement from the World Health Organization (WHO), launched the next-generation Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay (referred to here as Ultra), with the aim of further increasing diagnostic sensitivity. Two significant changes were made along with other technical optimizations. First, each cartridge includes a larger chamber for DNA amplification (50 μl compared to 25 μl), thus accommodating twice the volume of sample for the PCR. Second, two additional multicopy molecular targets for, IS1081 and IS6110, were introduced, alongside 4 rpoB gene probes, resulting in a decrease in the limit of detection (LOD) in vitro from ∼113 bacilli per mL of sputum for Xpert to ∼16 for Ultra, with a trace category added for lowest bacillary load. Ultra runs on the same GeneXpert platform as Xpert MTB/RIF (using software version 4.7b or later) as well as on the GeneXpert Omni platform.

### Diagnostic accuracy study of a novel blood-based assay for identification of tuberculosis in people living with HIV [^114tU2NX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

A nonsputum triage test to rule out tuberculosis (TB) disease is a WHO high-priority diagnostic, and a combinatory score based on a 3-gene host signature has shown promise in discriminating TB from other illnesses. We evaluated the accuracy of an early-prototype cartridge assay ("Xpert MTB Host Response" or Xpert-MTB-HR-Prototype) of this 3-gene signature on biobanked blood samples from people living with HIV (PLHIV) against a comprehensive microbiological reference standard (CMRS) and against Xpert MTB/RIF on the first sputum sample alone.

### XpertMTB / RIF assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance [^114inNGZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's leading infectious cause of death. Extrapulmonary TB accounts for 15% of TB cases, but the proportion is increasing, and over half a million people were newly diagnosed with rifampicin‐resistant TB in 2016. Xpert ® MTB/RIF (Xpert) is a World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended, rapid, automated, nucleic acid amplification assay that is used widely for simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance in sputum specimens. This Cochrane Review assessed the accuracy of Xpert in extrapulmonary specimens.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert a) for extrapulmonary TB by site of disease in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB; and b) for rifampicin resistance in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Registry, and ProQuest up to 7 August 2017 without language restriction.

Selection criteria

We included diagnostic accuracy studies of Xpert in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB. We included TB meningitis and pleural, lymph node, bone or joint, genitourinary, peritoneal, pericardial, and disseminated TB. We used culture as the reference standard. For pleural TB, we also included a composite reference standard, which defined a positive result as the presence of granulomatous inflammation or a positive culture result. For rifampicin resistance, we used culture‐based drug susceptibility testing or MTBDR plus as the reference standard.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS‐2 tool. We determined pooled predicted sensitivity and specificity for TB, grouped by type of extrapulmonary specimen, and for rifampicin resistance. For TB detection, we used a bivariate random‐effects model. Recognizing that use of culture may lead to misclassification of cases of extrapulmonary TB as 'not TB' owing to the paucibacillary nature of the disease, we adjusted accuracy estimates by applying a latent class meta‐analysis model. For rifampicin resistance detection, we performed univariate meta‐analyses for sensitivity and specificity separately to include studies in which no rifampicin resistance was detected. We used theoretical populations with an assumed prevalence to provide illustrative numbers of patients with false positive and false negative results.

Main results

We included 66 unique studies that evaluated 16,213 specimens for detection of extrapulmonary TB and rifampicin resistance. We identified only one study that evaluated the newest test version, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra), for TB meningitis. Fifty studies (76%) took place in low‐ or middle‐income countries. Risk of bias was low for patient selection, index test, and flow and timing domains and was high or unclear for the reference standard domain (most of these studies decontaminated sterile specimens before culture inoculation). Regarding applicability, in the patient selection domain, we scored high or unclear concern for most studies because either patients were evaluated exclusively as inpatients at tertiary care centres, or we were not sure about the clinical settings.

Pooled Xpert sensitivity (defined by culture) varied across different types of specimens (31% in pleural tissue to 97% in bone or joint fluid); Xpert sensitivity was > 80% in urine and bone or joint fluid and tissue. Pooled Xpert specificity (defined by culture) varied less than sensitivity (82% in bone or joint tissue to 99% in pleural fluid and urine). Xpert specificity was ≥ 98% in cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, urine, and peritoneal fluid.

Xpert testing in cerebrospinal fluid

Xpert pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% credible interval (CrI)) against culture were 71.1% (60.9% to 80.4%) and 98.0% (97.0% to 98.8%), respectively (29 studies, 3774 specimens; moderate‐certainty evidence).

For a population of 1000 people where 100 have TB meningitis on culture, 89 would be Xpert‐positive: of these, 18 (20%) would not have TB (false‐positives); and 911 would be Xpert‐negative: of these, 29 (3%) would have TB (false‐negatives).

For TB meningitis, ultra sensitivity and specificity against culture (95% confidence interval (CI)) were 90% (55% to 100%) and 90% (83% to 95%), respectively (one study, 129 participants).

Xpert testing in pleural fluid

Xpert pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) against culture were 50.9% (39.7% to 62.8%) and 99.2% (98.2% to 99.7%), respectively (27 studies, 4006 specimens; low‐certainty evidence).

For a population of 1000 people where 150 have pleural TB on culture, 83 would be Xpert‐positive: of these, seven (8%) would not have TB (false‐positives); and 917 would be Xpert‐negative: of these, 74 (8%) would have TB (false‐negatives).

Xpert testing in urine

Xpert pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) against culture were 82.7% (69.6% to 91.1%) and 98.7% (94.8% to 99.7%), respectively (13 studies, 1199 specimens; moderate‐certainty evidence).

For a population of 1000 people where 70 have genitourinary TB on culture, 70 would be Xpert‐positive: of these, 12 (17%) would not have TB (false‐positives); and 930 would be Xpert‐negative: of these, 12 (1%) would have TB (false‐negatives).

Xpert testing for rifampicin resistance

Xpert pooled sensitivity (20 studies, 148 specimens) and specificity (39 studies, 1088 specimens) were 95.0% (89.7% to 97.9%) and 98.7% (97.8% to 99.4%), respectively (high‐certainty evidence).

For a population of 1000 people where 120 have rifampicin‐resistant TB, 125 would be positive for rifampicin‐resistant TB: of these, 11 (9%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false‐positives); and 875 would be negative for rifampicin‐resistant TB: of these, 6 (1%) would have rifampicin resistance (false‐negatives).

For lymph node TB, the accuracy of culture, the reference standard used, presented a greater concern for bias than in other forms of extrapulmonary TB.

Authors' conclusions

In people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB, Xpert may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Xpert sensitivity varies across different extrapulmonary specimens, while for most specimens, specificity is high, the test rarely yielding a positive result for people without TB (defined by culture). Xpert is accurate for detection of rifampicin resistance. For people with presumed TB meningitis, treatment should be based on clinical judgement, and not withheld solely on an Xpert result, as is common practice when culture results are negative.

### Xpert® MTB / RIF assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^111nbCyE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are molecular systems that can detect small quantities of genetic material (DNA or RNA) from microorganisms, such as M. tuberculosis. A variety of molecular amplification methods are available, of which PCR is the most common. NAATs are available as commercial kits and in‐house tests (based on a protocol developed in a non‐commercial laboratory) and are used routinely in high‐income countries for TB detection. In‐house PCR is widely used in developing countries because these tests are less expensive than commercial kits. However, in‐house PCR is known to produce highly inconsistent results. The use of NAATs has recently been recommended as standard practice in the United States. The main advantage of NAATs is that they can provide results several weeks earlier than culture. Drawbacks are that these tests are often too expensive and complex for routine use by TB programmes in resource‐limited settings. In addition, although the specificity of NAATs is high, some NAATs have shown variable and low sensitivity, especially in sputum smear‐negative patients.

Alternative molecular methods for DST include the commercial line probe assays, INNO‐LiPA Rif.TB (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) and GenoType® MTBDRplus assay (Hain LifeScience GmbH, Nehren, Germany). The INNO‐LiPA Rif.TB assay targets common mutations in the rpoB gene associated with rifampicin resistance, while the GenoType® MTBDRplus assay also targets the common mutations in katG and inhA genes associated with isoniazid resistance in addition to the mutations in the rpoB gene. Advantages of line probe assays are that they can provide a result for detection of TB and drug resistance in one to two days. Also, they have both high sensitivity (greater than 97%) and high specificity (greater than 99%) for the detection of rifampicin resistance alone, or in combination with isoniazid (sensitivity greater than 90%; specificity greater than 99%), on TB isolates and smear‐positive sputum specimens. Drawbacks are that line probe assays are expensive and must be used in reference laboratories. These tests have been endorsed by WHO.

### XpertMTB / RIF assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance [^112vRCKi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) bacteria. TB causes tremendous suffering worldwide and has surpassed HIV/AIDS as the world's leading infectious cause of death. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally in 2016, 1.3 million HIV‐negative people and 374,000 HIV‐positive people died from TB and 10.4 million people became ill with TB. Drug‐resistant TB is an enormous threat. In 2016, an estimated 600,000 people were newly diagnosed with rifampicin‐resistant TB, 490,000 of whom had multidrug‐resistant TB (MDR‐TB). MDR‐TB is caused by infection with M. tuberculosis bacteria that are resistant to at least rifampicin and isoniazid. Rifampicin is the most effective first‐line anti‐TB drug. When people receive proper treatment, TB is treatable and curable.

TB predominantly affects the lungs (pulmonary TB). Extrapulmonary TB, which refers to TB in parts of the body other than the lungs, is known to affect virtually every part of the body; lymph nodes and the pleura are the most common sites. Although active pulmonary TB is transmissible by droplets spread by coughing, extrapulmonary TB is thought to result from hematogenous spread from an initial lung infection and is not infectious. Extrapulmonary TB can occur alone or together with pulmonary TB. Of the 6.3 million new cases of TB notified to WHO in 2016, 15% were cases of extrapulmonary TB (range, 8% in the WHO Western Pacific Region to 24% in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region). Among countries in the European Union, extrapulmonary TB was responsible for 19% of all notified cases (range, 6% to 44%). However, the number of people affected by extrapulmonary TB is likely to be higher, given that, according to WHO, extrapulmonary TB is notified as pulmonary TB when the two forms exist together, and diagnosing extrapulmonary TB is challenging, as described below. Additionally, extrapulmonary TB accounts for an increasing proportion of new TB cases in some countries, in part because of host and genetic considerations, and the association of extrapulmonary TB and HIV. Based on surveillance and epidemiological data, extrapulmonary TB affects a greater proportion of children than adults.

### Xpert® MTB / RIF assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults [^111UfkzC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Alternative molecular methods for drug susceptibility testing include the commercial line probe assays, INNO-LiPA Rif.TB (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) and GenoType® MTBDRplus assay (Hain LifeScience GmbH, Nehren, Germany). The INNO-LiPA Rif.TB assay targets common mutations in the rpoB gene associated with rifampicin resistance while the GenoType® MTBDRplus assay also targets the common mutations in katG and inhA genes associated with isoniazid resistance in addition to the mutations in the rpoB gene (UNITAID). Advantages of lIne probe assays are that they can provide a result for detection of TB and drug resistance in 1 to 2 days. Line probe assays have both high sensitivity (greater than 97%) and high specificity (greater than 99%) for the detection of rifampicin resistance alone, or in combination with isoniazid (sensitivity greater than 90%; specificity greater than 99%), on TB isolates and smear-positive sputum specimens (Ling). Drawbacks are that line probe assays are expensive and must be used in reference laboratories (Nahid). These tests have been endorsed by WHO (WHO).

### XpertMTB / RIF assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance [^117T1fUw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's leading infectious cause of death. Extrapulmonary TB accounts for 15% of TB cases, but the proportion is increasing, and over half a million people were newly diagnosed with rifampicin-resistant TB in 2016. Xpert ® MTB/RIF (Xpert) is a World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended, rapid, automated, nucleic acid amplification assay that is used widely for simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance in sputum specimens. This Cochrane Review assessed the accuracy of Xpert in extrapulmonary specimens.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert a) for extrapulmonary TB by site of disease in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB; and b) for rifampicin resistance in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Registry, and ProQuest up to 7 August 2017 without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We included diagnostic accuracy studies of Xpert in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB. We included TB meningitis and pleural, lymph node, bone or joint, genitourinary, peritoneal, pericardial, and disseminated TB. We used culture as the reference standard. For pleural TB, we also included a composite reference standard, which defined a positive result as the presence of granulomatous inflammation or a positive culture result. For rifampicin resistance, we used culture-based drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus as the reference standard.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We determined pooled predicted sensitivity and specificity for TB, grouped by type of extrapulmonary specimen, and for rifampicin resistance. For TB detection, we used a bivariate random-effects model. Recognizing that use of culture may lead to misclassification of cases of extrapulmonary TB as 'not TB' owing to the paucibacillary nature of the disease, we adjusted accuracy estimates by applying a latent class meta-analysis model. For rifampicin resistance detection, we performed univariate meta-analyses for sensitivity and specificity separately to include studies in which no rifampicin resistance was detected. We used theoretical populations with an assumed prevalence to provide illustrative numbers of patients with false positive and false negative results.

Main Results

We included 66 unique studies that evaluated 16,213 specimens for detection of extrapulmonary TB and rifampicin resistance. We identified only one study that evaluated the newest test version, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra), for TB meningitis. Fifty studies (76%) took place in low- or middle-income countries. Risk of bias was low for patient selection, index test, and flow and timing domains and was high or unclear for the reference standard domain (most of these studies decontaminated sterile specimens before culture inoculation). Regarding applicability, in the patient selection domain, we scored high or unclear concern for most studies because either patients were evaluated exclusively as inpatients at tertiary care centres, or we were not sure about the clinical settings. Pooled Xpert sensitivity (defined by culture) varied across different types of specimens (31% in pleural tissue to 97% in bone or joint fluid); Xpert sensitivity was > 80% in urine and bone or joint fluid and tissue. Pooled Xpert specificity (defined by culture) varied less than sensitivity (82% in bone or joint tissue to 99% in pleural fluid and urine). Xpert specificity was ≥ 98% in cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, urine, and peritoneal fluid. Xpert testing in cerebrospinal fluidXpert pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% credible interval (CrI)) against culture were 71.1% (60.9% to 80.4%) and 98.0% (97.0% to 98.8%), respectively (29 studies, 3774 specimens; moderate-certainty evidence). For a population of 1000 people where 100 have TB meningitis on culture, 89 would be Xpert-positive: of these, 18 (20%) would not have TB (false-positives); and 911 would be Xpert-negative: of these, 29 (3%) would have TB (false-negatives). For TB meningitis, ultra sensitivity and specificity against culture (95% confidence interval (CI)) were 90% (55% to 100%) and 90% (83% to 95%), respectively (one study, 129 participants). Xpert testing in pleural fluidXpert pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) against culture were 50.9% (39.7% to 62.8%) and 99.2% (98.2% to 99.7%), respectively (27 studies, 4006 specimens; low-certainty evidence). For a population of 1000 people where 150 have pleural TB on culture, 83 would be Xpert-positive: of these, seven (8%) would not have TB (false-positives); and 917 would be Xpert-negative: of these, 74 (8%) would have TB (false-negatives). Xpert testing in urineXpert pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) against culture were 82.7% (69.6% to 91.1%) and 98.7% (94.8% to 99.7%), respectively (13 studies, 1199 specimens; moderate-certainty evidence). For a population of 1000 people where 70 have genitourinary TB on culture, 70 would be Xpert-positive: of these, 12 (17%) would not have TB (false-positives); and 930 would be Xpert-negative: of these, 12 (1%) would have TB (false-negatives). Xpert testing for rifampicin resistanceXpert pooled sensitivity (20 studies, 148 specimens) and specificity (39 studies, 1088 specimens) were 95.0% (89.7% to 97.9%) and 98.7% (97.8% to 99.4%), respectively (high-certainty evidence). For a population of 1000 people where 120 have rifampicin-resistant TB, 125 would be positive for rifampicin-resistant TB: of these, 11 (9%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false-positives); and 875 would be negative for rifampicin-resistant TB: of these, 6 (1%) would have rifampicin resistance (false-negatives). For lymph node TB, the accuracy of culture, the reference standard used, presented a greater concern for bias than in other forms of extrapulmonary TB.

Authors' Conclusions

In people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB, Xpert may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Xpert sensitivity varies across different extrapulmonary specimens, while for most specimens, specificity is high, the test rarely yielding a positive result for people without TB (defined by culture). Xpert is accurate for detection of rifampicin resistance. For people with presumed TB meningitis, treatment should be based on clinical judgement, and not withheld solely on an Xpert result, as is common practice when culture results are negative.

### Xpert MTB / RIF ultra assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and adolescents [^112AzygX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) is a molecular World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid diagnostic test that simultaneously detects tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. This review updates a comparative accuracy Cochrane review of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as Xpert Ultra has replaced Xpert MTB/RIF.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) for detecting pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and adolescents with presumptive tuberculosis based on signs or symptoms or with an abnormal chest x-ray suggestive of tuberculosis.

Search Methods

We searched seven databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, plus two trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP) to 16 October 2023 without language restrictions. A WHO Public Call for ongoing and unpublished studies was made between 30 November 2023 and 15 February 2024.

Selection Criteria

We included cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials that provided data on the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra using respiratory specimens in adolescents (aged 10 to 14 years) and adults (aged 15 years and older) with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis. For pulmonary tuberculosis detection, the reference standards were culture and a composite reference standard. For rifampicin resistance, the reference standards were culture-based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing with or without whole genome sequencing.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardised form. We assessed risk of bias using QUADAS-2. We performed meta-analyses using a bivariate model to produce summary sensitivities and specificities, separately for pulmonary tuberculosis detection and rifampicin resistance detection. We performed subgroup analyses by smear status, HIV status, and history of tuberculosis. We summarised Xpert Ultra trace-positive results.

Main Results

Pulmonary tuberculosis detection For detection of pulmonary tuberculosis, Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity against culture were 90.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 88.2 to 92.7) and 94.8% (95% CI 92.8 to 96.3) (32 studies, 12,529 participants; high-certainty evidence). Most studies had low risk of bias in all QUADAS-2 domains. If the point estimates for Xpert Ultra are applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people, where 100 of those presenting with symptoms have pulmonary tuberculosis, Xpert Ultra will miss nine cases. The number of people wrongly diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis would be 47. In people living with HIV, Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity were 87.7% (82.0 to 91.7) and 95.3% (92.2 to 97.2) (11 studies, 1164 participants). Amongst people with smear-negative, culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity were 80.7% (75.4 to 85.0) and 94.0% (91.3 to 95.9) (16 studies, 6460 participants). In people with a history of tuberculosis, Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity were 84.8% (78.2 to 89.7) and 86.2% (78.9 to 91.3) (9 studies, 809 participants). The proportion of Ultra trace-positive results that were true positives compared to the microbiological reference standard was 38.8%. Reclassifying trace-positive results as Xpert Ultra-negative led to a reduction in sensitivity and modest increase in specificity. Rifampicin resistance detection For detection of rifampicin resistance, Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity were 95.8% (93.2 to 97.4) and 98.3% (97.0 to 99.0) (10 studies, 1644 participants; high-certainty evidence). Most studies had low risk of bias in all QUADAS-2 domains. If the point estimates for Xpert Ultra are applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people, where 100 of those presenting with symptoms have rifampicin resistance, Xpert Ultra will miss four cases. The number of people wrongly diagnosed with rifampicin resistance would be 16 out of the 900 who do not have rifampicin resistance. Xpert Ultra performed similarly, for rifampicin resistance, in people with smear-positive and smear-negative tuberculosis.

Authors' Conclusions

Xpert Ultra has high sensitivity and specificity for detection of pulmonary tuberculosis rifampicin resistance. Xpert Ultra for the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis has lower sensitivity in people with smear-negative/culture-positive tuberculosis and lower sensitivity and specificity in people with a history of tuberculosis. Xpert Ultra trace-positive results were common. Strengths of this review include the approach to identifying relevant studies, the number of studies and participants included in this systematic review, and that most studies were at low risk of bias. The small number of studies (six) and participants who were adolescents is a limitation to our accuracy estimates in this age group. Xpert Ultra testing provides accurate results and can allow rapid initiation of treatment for rifampicin-resistant and multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis.

### Cough due to TB and other chronic infections: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115X3DdG]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Xpert MTB/RIF diagnostic performance — compared with smear microscopy, a systematic review estimated that Xpert MTB/RIF increases pulmonary TB detection among culture-confirmed cases by 23% (95% credible interval, 15%-32%); as an initial diagnostic test replacing sputum microscopy, the estimated pooled sensitivity was 89% (95% credible interval, 85%-92%) and pooled specificity was 99% (95% credible interval, 98%-99%), with sensitivity among people living with HIV (PLWHIV) of 79% (95% credible interval, 70%-86%); the test also has a robust diagnostic performance to detect rifampin-resistant TB as a surrogate marker of MDR-TB, and while submitting sputum for culture and/or Xpert MTB/RIF assay will increase the cost of screening, it also will increase the number of cases diagnosed.

### How well Do routine molecular diagnostics detect rifampin heteroresistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis? [^113yjUNA]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical importance of heteroresistance is likely substantial, akin to fixed, i.e. 100%, resistance. The proportion method for phenotypic DST, which has been around for over half a century, by design, tests for ≥ 1% resistant subpopulations, with a strong predictive value for poor treatment outcome, at least for the core drugs, e.g. fluoroquinolones and RIF. Moreover, samples with ≥ 5% minority gyrA -resistant variants were found to have the same MIC level as that of samples with 100% fluoroquinolone resistance, while for rpoB, the mycobacterium growth indicator tube phenotypic DST results were similar for samples with ≥ 5% minority resistant variants and 100% RIF resistance. Taken together, this implicates that in samples with resistant subpopulations of at least 5%, classification of heteroresistance as RR, even when less sensitive than the proportion method, is probably key, notwithstanding the lack of direct evidence on clinical impact. Our findings can, thus, inform and guide TB reference laboratory staff, health care providers, and researchers that the threshold for reporting resistance in the case of RIF heteroresistance is the highest for classic Xpert and Ultra to resolve phenotypic and genotypic discordant RR-TB results. Prospective large-scale clinical studies using NGS approaches are necessary to establish the proportion of mutants that predicts a poor outcome of treatment with the specific drug.

Practical Considerations for Use of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay for Detection of Mutations Associated with RMP Resistance

CDC presents these interim practical considerations for incorporation of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay into diagnostic algorithms. For any test, even with high sensitivity and specificity (including NAA testing, DNA sequencing, and growth-based DST), the positive predictive value is low for a rare condition; accordingly, health-care providers should consult with their public health laboratory for confirmation by rapid molecular detection of mutations associated with drug resistance. To confirm a positive result, genetic loci associated with RMP resistance (to include rpoB), as well as INH resistance (to include inhA and katG) should be sequenced to assess for MDR TB. If mutations associated with RMP resistance are confirmed, rapid molecular testing for other known mutations associated with drug resistance (to first-line and second-line drugs) is needed for health-care providers to select an optimally effective treatment regimen. All molecular testing should prompt growth-based DST. Laboratories should report an Xpert MTB/RIF assay positive for RMP resistance pending confirmatory results (Table 1). Note that although an Xpert MTB/RIF assay result positive for MTBC and negative for RMP resistance has high negative predictive value †† for ruling out RMP resistance, growth-based DST to first-line TB drugs is still necessary. Consultation with a TB expert is recommended if the clinician is not experienced in the interpretation of NAA and other molecular test results or the diagnosis and treatment of TB. This is especially important in cases of suspected drug resistance.

Cough due to tuberculosis (TB) guideline — For patients with cough and at risk of pulmonary TB but at low risk of drug-resistant TB living in high TB prevalence countries, we suggest that XpertMTB/ RIF testing, when available, replace sputum microscopy for initial diagnostic testing, and chest x-rays should also be done on pulmonary TB suspects when feasible and where resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Xpert MTB / RIF assay | Tuberculosis (TB) [^116c2Ja2]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

About the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a test that helps to rapidly diagnose TB disease and identify drug resistance. The test simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and resistance to rifampin in less than 2 hours. In comparison, standard cultures can take 2 to 6 weeks for MTBC to grow, and conventional drug resistance tests can add 3 more weeks. The information provided by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay aids in selecting treatment regimens and reaching infection control decisions quickly. How the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay Works The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a nucleic acid amplification test that uses a disposable cartridge with the GeneXpert Instrument System. A sputum sample is collected from the patient with suspected TB. The sputum is mixed with the reagent that is provided with the assay, and a cartridge containing this mixture is placed in the GeneXpert machine. All processing from this point on is fully automated.

The Xpert MTB/RIF assay can quickly identify possible multidrug-resistant TB. MDR TB is TB that is resistant to both isoniazid and RIF, two of the most effective TB drugs. RIF resistance is a predictor of MDR TB because resistance to RIF, in most instances, co-exists with resistance to INH. Rapid diagnosis of RIF resistance potentially allows TB patients to start on effective treatment much sooner than waiting for results from other types of drug susceptibility testing. Results from the Xpert MTB/RIF assay indicate whether or not MTBC was detected in the sample. In some instances, the result is "invalid, " whereby the test should be repeated. If MTBC was detected, the results will also state whether resistance to RIF was
- Detected,
- Not detected, or
- Indeterminate. RIF resistance not detected Results that are positive for MTBC, but negative for RIF resistance mean that the bacteria are probably susceptible to RIF.

However, all tests that are positive for MTBC should have growth-based susceptibility testing to first-line TB drugs. RIF resistance indeterminate Results that are positive for MTBC and indeterminate for RIF resistance mean that the test could not accurately determine if the bacteria are resistant to RIF. Growth-based susceptibility testing to first-line TB drugs should be performed.

Providers and laboratories need to ensure that patient specimens are available for recommended mycobacterial testing. Results from the Xpert MTB/RIF assay indicate whether or not MTBC was detected in the sample. In some instances, the result is "invalid, " whereby the test should be repeated. If MTBC was detected, the results will also state whether resistance to RIF was.

RIF Resistance Detected. RIF Resistance Not Detected Results that are positive for MTBC, but negative for RIF resistance mean that the bacteria are probably susceptible to RIF.

However, all tests that are positive for MTBC should have growth-based susceptibility testing to first-line TB drugs. RIF Resistance Indeterminate Results that are positive for MTBC and indeterminate for RIF resistance mean that the test could not accurately determine if the bacteria are resistant to RIF. Growth-based susceptibility testing to first-line TB drugs should be performed.
