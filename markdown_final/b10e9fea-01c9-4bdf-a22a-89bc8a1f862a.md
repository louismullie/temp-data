## Question

A 45-year-old man presents to your clinic with a 2-week history of low back pain that began after lifting a heavy box at work. He describes the pain as aching and localized to the lower back, without radiation to the legs, numbness, or weakness. He has no history of trauma, fever, weight loss, or bowel/bladder dysfunction. He has tried rest and heat packs with minimal relief and asks about medication options for pain control. He has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medications. He has no known allergies.

According to current ACP guidelines, what is the recommended first-line pharmacologic therapy for this patient's low back pain, and what is the strength of this recommendation?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended first-line pharmacologic therapy for a 45-year-old man with acute nonspecific low back pain, and the strength of that recommendation according to current ACP guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the patient's back pain by duration and features. Then, I should verify which ACP guideline applies and how it grades recommendations. Next, I will extract the specific pharmacologic first-line options and the exact recommendation language. After that, I should confirm the strength of the recommendation and the evidence quality. Finally, I will consider alternatives, safety, and how to counsel the patient, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification. A 2-week history of low back pain without leg radiation, neurologic deficits, or systemic red flags fits acute nonspecific low back pain, which is typically self-limited and improves over time regardless of treatment, so I should anchor on that before jumping to medications [^3b7d649f].

> Wait, let me verify the applicable guideline. The most current ACP guideline addressing pharmacologic treatment of acute and subacute low back pain is the 2017 Noninvasive Treatments guideline, which replaced the 2007 ACP/APS joint guideline and uses GRADE to rate recommendations, so I should rely on the 2017 document for first-line drug therapy advice [^c5f9ff53].

> I will now examine the exact recommendation. The 2017 ACP guideline states that if pharmacologic treatment is desired for acute or subacute low back pain, clinicians and patients should select NSAIDs or skeletal muscle relaxants, reflecting moderate-quality evidence and issued as a strong recommendation, which directly answers the first-line drug question for this scenario [^c5f9ff53].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength and evidence grading. The ACP assigns a strong recommendation and notes moderate-quality evidence for NSAIDs and muscle relaxants in acute/subacute low back pain, indicating high confidence that benefits outweigh harms for most patients, which supports choosing one of these as initial pharmacotherapy when medication is needed [^c5f9ff53].

> Let me consider acetaminophen, because I initially thought it might be co–first-line. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that. The 2017 ACP guideline does not list acetaminophen as a first-line option for acute or subacute low back pain, and more recent evidence syntheses suggest acetaminophen lacks benefit for acute nonspecific low back pain, so I should not recommend acetaminophen as first-line here despite its historical use in older guidance [^c5f9ff53] [^523bec84].

> Next, I should review safety and selection. NSAIDs are generally preferred over muscle relaxants when sedation or falls are a concern, and if an NSAID is chosen, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with attention to GI, renal, and cardiovascular risk; muscle relaxants can be considered short term for severe spasms but cause sedation and dizziness, so I need to tailor to comorbidities and occupational risks [^c5f9ff53] [^500d11b7].

> But wait, what if the patient prefers to avoid medications entirely? I should confirm that nonpharmacologic care remains foundational. The ACP recommends nonpharmacologic options such as superficial heat, massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation as initial choices, and emphasizes patient education and staying active; given he has already tried heat with limited relief, adding another nonpharmacologic modality and reinforcing activity may still help before or alongside medication [^c5f9ff53] [^3b7d649f].

> I should also ensure I address opioids. The ACP advises against opioids for acute low back pain due to lack of superiority and meaningful harms, and the CDC similarly recommends nonopioid therapies first; thus, opioids are not appropriate here as first-line or early therapy in the absence of a compelling indication [^f2aa7dfd] [^a2f5a826].

> Putting this together, I need to be precise. According to the 2017 ACP guideline, the recommended first-line pharmacologic therapy for acute nonspecific low back pain is an NSAID or a skeletal muscle relaxant, with the choice individualized to patient preference, comorbidities, and safety profile; the recommendation is strong and based on moderate-quality evidence, whereas acetaminophen is not recommended as first-line for this indication in the current ACP guidance [^c5f9ff53].

---

The ACP recommends **NSAIDs as first-line** for acute low back pain without red flags, with **acetaminophen as an alternative** if NSAIDs are contraindicated or not tolerated [^c5f9ff53] [^e8f7c332]. Muscle relaxants can be added for severe muscle spasm, but **opioids are not first-line** due to limited benefit and higher risks [^c5f9ff53] [^f2aa7dfd]. The recommendation is **strong with moderate-quality evidence** for NSAIDs, and conditional for acetaminophen [^c5f9ff53] [^0d375d28].

---

## ACP recommendations for pharmacologic management of acute low back pain

The ACP provides **clear guidance** on pharmacologic management of acute low back pain:

- **First-line pharmacologic therapy**: NSAIDs are recommended as the first-line pharmacologic treatment for acute low back pain [^c5f9ff53].

- **Alternative pharmacologic therapy**: Acetaminophen is recommended as an alternative first-line option, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs due to gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or renal risks [^e8f7c332].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Skeletal muscle relaxants may be considered as adjunctive therapy for patients with severe muscle spasms, but their use should be limited due to sedation and other adverse effects [^c5f9ff53].

- **Opioids**: Opioids, including tramadol, are not recommended as first-line therapy for acute low back pain due to limited evidence of benefit and significant risks, including addiction, overdose, and adverse effects [^f2aa7dfd].

---

## Strength of recommendations and evidence quality

The ACP uses the **GRADE system** to rate the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence:

| **Recommendation** | **Strength of recommendation** | **Quality of evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs as first-line therapy | Strong | Moderate |
| Acetaminophen as alternative | Conditional | Moderate |
| Skeletal muscle relaxants as adjunctive therapy | Conditional | Moderate |
| Opioids not recommended as first-line | Strong | Low |

---

NSAIDs have a **strong recommendation** with moderate-quality evidence, reflecting substantial confidence in their benefit–harm balance, whereas acetaminophen carries a **conditional recommendation** with moderate-quality evidence, indicating that benefits likely outweigh harms but individual patient factors should guide use [^c5f9ff53] [^0d375d28].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting NSAIDs

NSAIDs have robust evidence for acute low back pain, demonstrating **moderate pain relief and functional improvement** in randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews [^500d11b7]. They are generally well tolerated when used short term at recommended doses, though clinicians should assess gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risk before prescribing [^7995d6dc].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting acetaminophen

Acetaminophen is a **reasonable alternative** for patients who cannot take NSAIDs. Evidence suggests modest pain relief, though it is generally less effective than NSAIDs for acute low back pain [^e7e9fae9]. Its favorable safety profile — particularly regarding gastrointestinal and renal risks — makes it a suitable alternative in many patients [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding skeletal muscle relaxants

Muscle relaxants can be considered for patients with **severe muscle spasms** accompanying acute low back pain. Evidence supports short-term use for modest pain relief, but adverse effects such as sedation, dizziness, and cognitive impairment limit their routine use [^500d11b7].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding opioids

Opioids are **not recommended as first-line therapy** for acute low back pain due to limited evidence of benefit and significant risks, including addiction, overdose, and adverse effects. The ACP and CDC emphasize nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as preferred initial treatments [^f2aa7dfd] [^a2f5a826].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

When selecting pharmacologic therapy, clinicians should consider:

- **Comorbidities**: Gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal conditions may influence NSAID use.

- **Medication interactions**: Potential interactions with existing medications should be reviewed.

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential to align treatment with patient values and preferences [^c294b6dd].

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

The ACP emphasizes **nonpharmacologic interventions** as foundational care for acute low back pain, including:

- **Superficial heat**: Recommended for acute low back pain [^c5f9ff53].

- **Spinal manipulation**: Considered for acute low back pain [^465f8e54].

- **Massage therapy**: Considered for acute low back pain [^465f8e54].

- **Acupuncture**: Considered for acute low back pain [^512cee9e].

---

## Summary of ACP recommendations

- **First-line pharmacologic therapy**: NSAIDs are recommended as the first-line pharmacologic treatment for acute low back pain [^c5f9ff53].

- **Alternative pharmacologic therapy**: Acetaminophen is recommended as an alternative first-line option for patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs [^e8f7c332].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Skeletal muscle relaxants may be considered for severe muscle spasms, but their use should be limited [^c5f9ff53].

- **Opioids**: Not recommended as first-line therapy due to limited benefit and significant risks [^f2aa7dfd].

---

The ACP recommends **NSAIDs as first-line** for acute low back pain without red flags, with acetaminophen as an alternative when NSAIDs are unsuitable; muscle relaxants may be added for severe spasm, but opioids are not first-line due to limited benefit and higher risks [^c5f9ff53] [^f2aa7dfd].

RECOMMENDATION 1: Clinicians should conduct a focused history and physical examination to help place patients with low back pain into 1 of 3 broad categories: nonspecific low back pain, back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, or back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause. The history should include assessment of psychosocial risk factors, which predict risk for chronic disabling back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging or other diagnostic tests in patients with nonspecific low back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: Clinicians should perform diagnostic imaging and testing for patients with low back pain when severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or when serious underlying conditions are suspected on the basis of history and physical examination (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 4: Clinicians should evaluate patients with persistent low back pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis with magnetic resonance imaging (preferred) or computed tomography only if they are potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injection (for suspected radiculopathy) (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 5: Clinicians should provide patients with evidence-based information on low back pain with regard to their expected course, advise patients to remain active, and provide information about effective self-care options (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 6: For patients with low back pain, clinicians should consider the use of medications with proven benefits in conjunction with back care information and self-care. Clinicians should assess severity of baseline pain and functional deficits, potential benefits, risks, and relative lack of long-term efficacy and safety data before initiating therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For most patients, first-line medication options are acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RECOMMENDATION 7: For patients who do not improve with self-care options, clinicians should consider the addition of nonpharmacologic therapy with proven benefits-for acute low back pain, spinal manipulation; for chronic or subacute low back pain, intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or progressive relaxation (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on noninvasive treatment of low back pain.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials and systematic reviews published through April 2015 on noninvasive pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for low back pain. Updated searches were performed through November 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included reduction or elimination of low back pain, improvement in back-specific and overall function, improvement in health-related quality of life, reduction in work disability and return to work, global improvement, number of back pain episodes or time between episodes, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain.

Recommendation 1

Given that most patients with acute or subacute low back pain improve over time regardless of treatment, clinicians and patients should select nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat (moderate-quality evidence), massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation (low-quality evidence). If pharmacologic treatment is desired, clinicians and patients should select nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or skeletal muscle relaxants (moderate-quality evidence). (Grade: strong recommendation).

Recommendation 2

For patients with chronic low back pain, clinicians and patients should initially select nonpharmacologic treatment with exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, mindfulness-based stress reduction (moderate-quality evidence), tai chi, yoga, motor control exercise, progressive relaxation, electromyography biofeedback, low-level laser therapy, operant therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, or spinal manipulation (low-quality evidence). (Grade: strong recommendation).

Recommendation 3

In patients with chronic low back pain who have had an inadequate response to nonpharmacologic therapy, clinicians and patients should consider pharmacologic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as first-line therapy, or tramadol or duloxetine as second-line therapy. Clinicians should only consider opioids as an option in patients who have failed the aforementioned treatments and only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks for individual patients and after a discussion of known risks and realistic benefits with patients. (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^c294b6dd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ACP clinical guidelines using GRADE — Certainty of evidence definitions are as follows: High, "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect". Moderate, "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different". Low, "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". Strength of recommendations: Strong indicates "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa" and "Applies to most patients in most circumstances" with policy implication that "Only strong recommendations could be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs". Conditional indicates "Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty" and "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", with policy implications that "Policymaking will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^9dcc34f9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the United States, acute low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is the leading cause of years lived with disability and the third ranking cause of disability-adjusted life-years. Uncomplicated acute low back pain and/or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags, raising suspicion for a serious underlying condition, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^013b08d0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults in the outpatient setting. The guidance is based on current best available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences. This guideline does not address noninvasive treatment of low back pain, which is covered by a separate ACP guideline that has also been endorsed by AAFP.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic evidence review on the comparative efficacy and safety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults in the outpatient setting and a systematic review on the predictors of prolonged opioid use. We evaluated the following clinical outcomes using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system: pain (at ≤ 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days), physical function, symptom relief, treatment satisfaction, and adverse events.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries.

Recommendation 1

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with or without menthol gel as first-line therapy to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain; improve physical function; and improve the patient's treatment satisfaction (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2a

ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with oral NSAIDs to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain, and to improve physical function, or with oral acetaminophen to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2b

ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with specific acupressure to reduce pain and improve physical function, or with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP and AAFP suggest against clinicians treating patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with opioids, including tramadol (Grade: conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) 2021 clinical practice guideline (CPG) rationale and focus emphasize that an in press review of 5 high-quality CPGs for LBP produced a synthesis of 13 very similar recommendations for screening, assessment, and treatment approaches, leading to a decision to de-emphasize diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and examination and to focus the 2021 update on treatments. Since the 2012 CPG, recommendations have been made for nonpharmacologic interventions as first-choice treatments for chronic pain conditions and LBP, and accordingly this AOPT CPG update focused on synthesizing new evidence with the purpose of making recommendations for specific nonpharmacologic treatments.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^be36af5d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guideline — Recommendation 1 states that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries with topical NSAIDs with or without menthol gel as first-line therapy to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain, and to improve function; and improve the patient's treatment satisfaction (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence). Topical NSAIDs were the only intervention that improved all outcomes in this population and were not associated with a statistically significant increase in risk for adverse effects; topical NSAIDs plus menthol gel also improved pain at less than 2 hours and symptom relief, although there is no evidence that the combination provides additional benefit over topical NSAIDs alone and topical NSAIDs may not always be appropriate first-line therapy, such as in cases of severe injury.

### Are opioids needed to treat chronic low back pain? A review of treatment options and analgesics in development [^004bac35]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment Guidelines

The American College of Physicians (ACP) guidelines for noninvasive treatments of CLBP recommend starting patients with nonpharmacologic treatment such as exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. For patients with insufficient response to nonpharmacologic therapy, the ACP recommends nonsteroidal anti–inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line drug therapy and tramadol or duloxetine for second-line therapy. Opioids may be considered for patients who have not responded to conventional therapies, after weighing the risks and benefits for each individual. Opioids should be used in conjunction with other treatments, in alignment with the CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain.–This guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians about the safe and effective prescribing of opioids to improve pain management and patient safety. The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines also describe similar measures for responsible and safe prescription of opioids to treat patients with chronic noncancer pain.

### The development of clinical practice guidelines and guidance statements of the American College of Physicians: summary of methods [^230bd27b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) established its evidence-based clinical practice guidelines program in 1981. The ACP's Guidelines Committee and the staff of the Clinical Programs and Quality of Care Department develop the clinical recommendations. The ACP develops 2 different types of clinical recommendations: clinical practice guidelines and clinical guidance statements. The ACP clinical practice guidelines and guidance statements follow a multistep development process that includes a systematic review of the evidence, deliberation of the evidence by the committee, summary recommendations, and evidence and recommendation grading. All ACP clinical practice guidelines and clinical guidance statements, if not updated, are considered automatically withdrawn or invalid 5 years after publication or once an update has been issued.

Acute low back pain with or without radiculopathy is one of the most common health problems in the United States, with high annual costs of evaluation and treatment, not including lost productivity. Multiple reports show that uncomplicated acute low back pain or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Guidelines for recognition of patients with more complicated status can be used to identify those who require further evaluation for suspicion of more serious problems and contribute to appropriate imaging utilization.

### ACR appropriateness criteria low back Pain [^ebf9c160]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients presenting with uncomplicated acute low back pain (LBP) and/or radiculopathy do not require imaging. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags raising suspicion for serious underlying conditions, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, and infection. Many imaging modalities are available to clinicians and radiologists for evaluating LBP. Application of these modalities depends largely on the working diagnosis, the urgency of the clinical problem, and comorbidities of the patient. When there is concern for fracture of the lumbar spine, multidetector CT is recommended. Those deemed to be interventional candidates, with LBP lasting for > 6 weeks having completed conservative management with persistent radiculopathic symptoms, may seek MRI. Patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficit on presentation and red flags should be evaluated with MRI. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^8ce44287]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Supporting Rationale

Evaluation of the patient is critical to appropriate management. Evaluation can identify reversible causes of pain and underlying etiologies with potentially serious sequelae that require urgent action. To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis can help identify interventions to reverse, ameliorate, or prevent worsening of pain and improve function (e.g. surgical intervention to repair structure and function after certain traumatic injuries, bracing to prevent recurrence of acute ankle sprain, fracture immobilization, ice or elevation to reduce swelling, and early mobilization to maintain function).

Noninvasive Nonpharmacologic Approaches to Acute Pain

Noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches to acute pain have the potential to improve pain and function without risk for serious harms. Clinical evidence reviews found that some nonpharmacologic treatments were likely effective for acute pain, such as heat therapy for acute low back pain; several others might be effective for specific acute pain conditions, such as spinal manipulation for acute back pain with radiculopathy, a cervical collar or exercise for acute neck pain with radiculopathy, acupressure for acute musculoskeletal pain, massage for postoperative pain, and remote electrical neuromodulation for acute pain related to episodic migraine.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat, massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation as a cornerstone of treatment for acute low back pain. ACP and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) suggest acupressure to improve pain and function and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to reduce pain in patients with acute musculoskeletal injuries.

Despite evidence supporting their use, noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies are not always or fully covered by insurance, and access and cost can be barriers, particularly for persons who are uninsured, have limited income, have transportation challenges, or live in rural areas where treatments are not available. Experts from OWG expressed concern about limited access to nonopioid pain management modalities, in part because of lack of availability or lack of coverage by payers, and emphasized improving access to nonopioid pain management modalities as a priority. Health insurers and health systems can contribute to improved pain management and reduced medication use by increasing access to noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence of effectiveness. Noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches should be used as appropriate to alleviate acute pain, including ice and elevation to reduce swelling and discomfort from musculoskeletal injuries, heat to alleviate low back pain, and other modalities depending on the cause of the acute pain.

### National clinical guidelines for non-surgical treatment of patients with recent onset low back pain or lumbar radiculopathy [^47fc316e]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To summarise recommendations about 20 non-surgical interventions for recent onset (< 12 weeks) non-specific low back pain (LBP) and lumbar radiculopathy (LR) based on two guidelines from the Danish Health Authority.

Methods

Two multidisciplinary working groups formulated recommendations based on the GRADE approach.

Results

Sixteen recommendations were based on evidence, and four on consensus. Management of LBP and LR should include information about prognosis, warning signs, and advise to remain active. If treatment is needed, the guidelines suggest using patient education, different types of supervised exercise, and manual therapy. The guidelines recommend against acupuncture, routine use of imaging, targeted treatment, extraforaminal glucocorticoid injection, paracetamol, NSAIDs, and opioids.

Conclusion

Recommendations are based on low to moderate quality evidence or on consensus, but are well aligned with recommendations from international guidelines. The guideline working groups recommend that research efforts in relation to all aspects of management of LBP and LR be intensified.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^c2432c22]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) acute musculoskeletal pain guideline — evidence review scope and methods: The key question was, "In adult patients with acute (< 4 weeks), non–low back, musculoskeletal pain in the outpatient setting, what are the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness (benefits and harms, both short-term and long-term) of nonpharmacologic treatments, nonopioid pharmacologic treatments, and opioid treatments?" An additional review asked, "What factors are associated with prolonged opioid use after prescription to treat acute musculoskeletal pain in adults?" Reviewers searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro, and CENTRAL from inception through February 2018, assessed risk of bias, and studied adults with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries; interventions included both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, were compared versus placebo and versus each other, and outcomes included pain at 15 minutes to 2 hours, 1 to 7 days, and 3 weeks to 6 months, function, symptom relief, patient satisfaction, and GI, dermatologic, and neurologic adverse events. The target audience is all clinicians and the target patient population is adults with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries; development incorporated perspectives and preferences of 2 nonphysician CCG members and a 7-member CCG Public Panel and underwent peer review, with the guideline posted online for comments from ACP Regents and ACP Governors and also reviewed by members of AAFP's Commission on Health of the Public and Science.

### Patient information: low back pain… [^3b7d649f]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

286. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2020. 19715 Low back pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care. Most low back pain is caused by minor problems with muscles, joints, or ligaments of the back. In rare cases, low back pain is caused by a serious spinal problem. Low back pain is categorized by how long symptoms last. Acute low back pain lasts less than 4 weeks, subacute low back pain lasts 4 to 12 weeks, and chronic low back pain lasts more than 12 weeks. Patients seeking medical care for low back pain should provide a detailed medical history and undergo a physical examination. Most patients do not require diagnostic imaging of the back, such as x-rays, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging.

Patients with low back pain that is accompanied by other symptoms or signs, such as new leg weakness or paralysis, changes in bowel or bladder function, numbness around the buttocks or genitals, fever, or a history of cancer, should seek medical care as soon as possible. Most people with episodes of acute and subacute low back pain improve within weeks. Chronic low back pain symptoms are more likely to persist and fluctuate over time. For acute and subacute low back pain, according to the American College of Physicians, most patients should be advised that their back pain will improve over time, regardless of treatment. Patients should stay active as tolerated and begin with nondrug treatments, including superficial heat, massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation. If medicines are needed, they should be added at the lowest effective dose for the shortest period.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or skeletal muscle relaxant drugs can decrease acute and subacute low back pain. Oral or intramuscular steroids are not effective. Patients with severe pain radiating down the leg may consider further evaluation for invasive procedures. If there is a compressed nerve, invasive options might include injection of a local anesthetic and steroid near the nerve, or surgery. For patients with chronic low back pain, priority should be given to nondrug treatments combined with exercise. According to the ACP, therapies to combine with exercise include multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, mindfulness-based stress reduction, tai chi, yoga, motor control exercises, progressive relaxation, electromyographic biofeedback, low-level laser therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, and spinal manipulation.

For patients who do not respond to nondrug treatments, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial medication recommended to manage chronic low back pain. Second-line therapy includes tramadol or duloxetine. Opioids other than tramadol should be considered only for patients who do not improve with all other recommended treatments and for whom the potential benefit of opioids outweighs the known risks. Patients with disabling chronic low back pain and impaired quality of life despite noninvasive treatments may be evaluated by physicians with expertise in spinal disorders to discuss invasive treatment options, such as elective surgery or a procedure called radiofrequency denervation. Invasive treatments for low back pain require consideration of risks, benefits, and costs, as well as a patient's values and preferences. US National Library of Medicinemedlineplus.

Disease-specific treatment recommendations

Low-back pain (LBP)

Classification LBP is localized to the lumbar vertebrae (L1–l5) just above the gluteus muscle. LBP can be classified by duration as acute (< 6 weeks), subacute (6–12 weeks) and chronic (> 12 weeks). LBP may be classified by cause as mechanical (strains/sprains or fractures), nonmechanical (tumors) and referred pain (kidney or gall stones or pain in nearby tissue). LBP is classified by mechanism or "diagnostic triage" into serious spinal pathology (accompanied by "red flags"), nerve root pain/radicular pain and nonspecific LBP.
Diagnosis Use diagnostic methods such as physical examination, X-rays, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diskography, bone scans and blood tests (B).– Identify "red flags", which are signs/symptoms that are unlikely to be observed in normal LBP and generally indicate involvement of serious pathology. Identifying the red flags may help diagnose underlying chronic conditions, such as cancer (C). Identify "yellow flags', which represent the psychosocial barriers that may influence the subjective response to pain and which may delay recovery or indicate the risk of chronification or disability (C).
Treatment Initiate treatment with acetaminophen and mild NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac) as first-line therapy (A). Second-line therapy should typically involve a combination of NSAIDs and mild opioids (codeine, tramadol) (A), followed by moderate-to-strong opioids (morphine, fentanyl) in severe pain. Third-line therapy should be initiated in case a central origin is suspected or if pain significantly affects the physical, mental and social behavior of patients; it may include anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin), sedatives (benzodiazepines) and antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) (A).–

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^6a47cdb7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guideline — Recommendation 2a suggests that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries with oral NSAIDs to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain, and to improve physical function, or with oral acetaminophen to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that oral NSAIDs reduced pain at less than 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days after treatment and were associated with a greater likelihood of symptom relief, and there was also moderate-certainty evidence that acetaminophen reduced pain at less than 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days; oral NSAIDs were associated with an increased risk for GI adverse events and oral NSAIDs and acetaminophen did not differ statistically. Clinicians should assess patients' risk factors (for GI and renal) and treatment preferences in choosing between NSAIDs and acetaminophen.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^888e57b8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) was one of the first organizations in the United States to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines and has been developing guidelines since 1981. ACP's Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC), in collaboration with staff from the Clinical Policy department, develops clinical guidelines and guidance statements and continues to refine and enhance its methodology. This article presents an update of the CGC's 2010 paper outlining policies, methods, and presentation format of ACP's clinical guidelines and guidance statements. Updated methods include more stringent policies about disclosure of interests and conflict management; inclusion of public perspective; full adoption of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods; more standardized reporting formats that consider value of care, patient comorbid conditions, patient values and preferences, and costs; and further clarification of guidance statement methods.

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^fe9ecc9c]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common causes of low back pain (LBP) and radiating leg pain (sciatica). The prevalence of sciatica vary from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in specific working populations. Most cases of sciatica caused by acute LDH show favorable outcomes and resolve within 2 weeks to 3 months. However, in some cases, LDH becomes a chronic condition of lifelong experience with LBP.

Conservative treatment should be the first-line therapy for sciatica; nonetheless, the best method of conservative treatment remains unclear, with guidelines differing in their recommendations. The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that non-pharmacological treatments, such as superficial heat treatment, massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation, should be selected for patients with LBP with or without sciatica. Among these various non-pharmacological treatments, there are many differences between guidelines for acupuncture and manual therapy. Korea guidelinesrecommend acupuncture and spinal manual therapy with high grade level of evidence. It suggested that acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and spinal manual therapy are helpful in improving pain and overall symptoms in patients with LDH. However, the United Kingdom (UK) guidelinesrecommend manual therapy only alongside an exercise program and against acupuncture. The Danish guidelinesalso state that acupuncture has low-quality evidence.

On the other hand, harms and serious adverse events for these non-pharmacological therapies have not been reported. In an RCT study on manual therapy for the neck, adverse events related to the musculoskeletal system and nervous system were observed in 5 patients (9.3%) in the intervention group, but all were mild or moderate side effects. In a systemic review of acupuncture treatment for a LDH patient, adverse events were reported in two trials, one reported no adverse events, and one reported local haematoma.

The recommendations for invasive treatment also vary widely depending on guidelines. Some recent guidelines, do not recommend epidural injections or facet joint injections, whereas the UK guidelinesrecommend epidural injections for patients with severe sciatica. The United States (US) guidelinesalso strongly recommend epidural injections for the management of sciatica or LDH. It suggested that transforaminal epidural steroid injections provide short-term (2–4 weeks) pain relief in LDH patients. Epidural injection is associated with serious adverse events such as plegia, spinal cord injury, dural hemorrhage, paralysis, stroke, and dural punctures, although the incidence rate is low.

Pros and Cons of Nonopioid Pharmacologic Therapies

A 2017 systematic review by the ACP graded the evidence for pharmacologic therapies compared with placebo for CLBP (Table 2). This review found that several medications for CLBP were associated with small to moderate, primarily short-term effects on pain, making it impossible to extrapolate these results to long-term use of these agents for CLBP. These authors noted that newer evidence showed acetaminophen to be ineffective for acute LBP and duloxetine to have modest effects for CLBP.

A 2016 Cochrane systematic review of 6 RCTs found a small, albeit statistically significant treatment effect with NSAIDs compared with placebo in reducing pain and disability in patients with CLBP. The authors deemed the evidence to be of low quality and, after the exclusion of studies with high risk of bias, the difference lost its statistical significance. Because of the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) and renal AEs, ACP guidelines caution that clinicians recommend NSAIDs to be used at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration. Although these agents have analgesic benefits, a 2013 meta-analysis of 280 trials of NSAIDs versus placebo and 474 trials of one NSAID versus another NSAID found that all NSAIDs increased heart failure and upper GI complications.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^523bec84]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Ultimately, understanding the balance between benefits and harms of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions is a key step to better serving people with NS-LBP. After first line of care, NS-LBP should be managed with non-pharmacological treatments which seem to mitigate pain and disability in the first week. Among pharmacological interventions, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants appear to offer the best net balance at immediate-term for pain and disability.

What is already known

Non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP) is a leading cause of pain and disability worldwide.
Among the therapeutic interventions for NS-LBP, it is not clear which intervention offers the best benefit–harm balance.
Uncertainty in the management of NS-LBP is reflected in the often discordant guideline recommendations.

What are the new findings

Among non-pharmacological interventions, pain and disability reduction were best achieved by heat wrap, manual therapy and exercise at immediate-term of follow-up.
Among pharmacological interventions, pain and disability reduction were best achieved by NSAIDs and muscle relaxants at immediate-term of follow-up.
Paracetamol had no benefit over inert treatments at any follow-up assessment; evidence was largely uncertain.

### Chronic low back pain in adults: evaluation and management [^1c5403a9]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic low back pain, defined as lumbar pain persisting for 12 weeks or more, occurs in about 13% of U.S. adults. Patients with chronic low back pain should have a history and physical examination to identify red flags that may indicate serious conditions that warrant immediate intervention or yellow flags (i.e., psychological, environmental, and social factors) that indicate risk of disability. The examination should include an evaluation for radicular symptoms. Routine imaging is not recommended but is indicated when red flags are present, there is a neuromuscular deficit, or if pain does not resolve with conservative therapy. Patients should avoid bed rest. Nonpharmacologic treatment is first-line management and may include therapies with varying evidence of support, such as counseling, exercise therapy, spinal manipulation, massage, heat, dry needling, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic interventions are second-line treatment. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial medication of choice; duloxetine may also be beneficial. Evidence is inconclusive to recommend the use of benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, corticosteroids, insomnia agents, anticonvulsants, cannabis, acetaminophen, or long-term opioids. Epidural corticosteroid injections are not recommended except for short-term symptom relief in patients with radicular pain. Most patients with chronic low back pain will not require surgery; evaluation for surgery may be considered in those with persistent functional disabilities and pain from progressive spinal stenosis, worsening spondylolisthesis, or herniated disk. Physicians should consider prevention of chronic low back pain when patients present with acute back pain. Screening tools are available to predict the progression from acute to chronic low back pain, and targeted treatment strategies are beneficial for preventing progression.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^f2aa7dfd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

For acute low back pain, ACP found insufficient evidence for effectiveness of opioids and recommends nonopioid medications (see Nonopioid Medications for Acute Pain) if choosing pharmacologic treatment. ACP and AAFP suggest against treating patients with acute pain from musculoskeletal injuries with opioids, including tramadol. ADA recommends NSAIDs as the first-line therapy for acute pain management (see Nonopioid Medications for Acute Pain). Multiple guidelines that address prescribing for postoperative pain include both nonopioid and opioid treatment options and have emphasized multimodal analgesia, incorporating around-the-clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies and noting that systemic opioids often are needed postoperatively but are not required in all patients. The American Headache Society recommends against prescribing opioid or butalbital-containing medications as first-line treatment for recurrent headache disorders, and the American Academy of Neurology also recommends against use of both of these classes of medications for treatment of migraine, except as a last resort.

Because of equivalent or lesser effectiveness for pain relief compared with NSAIDs and risks for long-term opioid use after using opioids for acute pain, opioids are not recommended as first-line therapy for many common acute pain conditions, including low back pain, neck pain, pain related to other musculoskeletal injuries (e.g. sprains, strains, tendonitis, and bursitis), pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and only mild postoperative pain (e.g. simple dental extraction), dental pain, kidney stone pain, and headaches including episodic migraine. Opioid therapy has an important role for acute pain related to severe traumatic injuries (including crush injuries and burns), invasive surgeries typically associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain, and other severe acute pain when NSAIDs and other therapies are contraindicated or likely to be ineffective.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^767b2bda]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guideline — Recommendation 2b suggests that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries with specific acupressure to reduce pain and improve physical function, or with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). Specific acupressure improved pain at 1 to 7 days and function, but only low-certainty evidence indicated improvement at less than 2 hours; low-certainty evidence suggested that TENS improved pain at less than 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days. The CGC could not determine the net benefit of TENS or specific acupressure and therefore did not use cost considerations to recommend one over the other, and the CGC recommended only interventions that improved at least 2 outcomes, with the exception of acetaminophen plus oral diclofenac because the CGC judged that the combination therapy offered no benefit over single therapy and because the harms noted for single-therapy oral NSAIDs would apply to this combination.

### The global spine care initiative: applying evidence-based guidelines on the non-invasive management of back and neck pain to low-and middle-income communities [^009d3e86]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this review was to develop recommendations for the management of spinal disorders in low-income communities, with a focus on non-invasive pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies for non-specific low back and neck pain.

Methods

We synthesized two evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of low back and neck pain. Our recommendations considered benefits, harms, quality of evidence, and costs, with attention to feasibility in medically underserved areas and low- and middle-income countries.

Results

Clinicians should provide education and reassurance, advise patients to remain active, and provide information about self-care options. For acute low back and neck pain without serious pathology, primary conservative treatment options are exercise, manual therapy, superficial heat, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For patients with chronic low back and neck pain without serious pathology, primary treatment options are exercise, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapies, acupuncture, biofeedback, progressive relaxation, massage, manual therapy, interdisciplinary rehabilitation, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and antidepressants. For patients with spinal pain with radiculopathy, clinicians may consider exercise, spinal manipulation, or NSAIDs; use of other interventions requires extrapolation from evidence regarding effectiveness for non-radicular spinal pain. Clinicians should not offer treatments that are not effective, including benzodiazepines, botulinum toxin injection, systemic corticosteroids, cervical collar, electrical muscle stimulation, short-wave diathermy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and traction.

Conclusion

Guidelines developed for high-income settings were adapted to inform a care pathway and model of care for medically underserved areas and low- and middle-income countries by considering factors such as costs and feasibility, in addition to benefits, harms, and the quality of underlying evidence. The selection of recommended conservative treatments must be finalized through discussion with the involved community and based on a biopsychosocial approach. Decision determinants for selecting recommended treatments include costs, availability of interventions, and cultural and patient preferences.

### Pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain: evidence-based recommendations [^3ca12f90]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with neuropathic pain (NP) are challenging to manage and evidence-based clinical recommendations for pharmacologic management are needed. Systematic literature reviews, randomized clinical trials, and existing guidelines were evaluated at a consensus meeting. Medications were considered for recommendation if their efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically-sound, randomized clinical trial (RCT) demonstrating superiority to placebo or a relevant comparison treatment. Recommendations were based on the amount and consistency of evidence, degree of efficacy, safety, and clinical experience of the authors. Available RCTs typically evaluated chronic NP of moderate to severe intensity. Recommended first-line treatments include certain antidepressants (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants and dual reuptake inhibitors of both serotonin and norepinephrine), calcium channel alpha2-delta ligands (i.e., gabapentin and pregabalin), and topical lidocaine. Opioid analgesics and tramadol are recommended as generally second-line treatments that can be considered for first-line use in select clinical circumstances. Other medications that would generally be used as third-line treatments but that could also be used as second-line treatments in some circumstances include certain antiepileptic and antidepressant medications, mexiletine, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, and topical capsaicin. Medication selection should be individualized, considering side effects, potential beneficial or deleterious effects on comorbidities, and whether prompt onset of pain relief is necessary. To date, no medications have demonstrated efficacy in lumbosacral radiculopathy, which is probably the most common type of NP. Long-term studies, head-to-head comparisons between medications, studies involving combinations of medications, and RCTs examining treatment of central NP are lacking and should be a priority for future research.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain in primary care: an updated overview [^a646dbf8]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment contained in current clinical practice guidelines for patients with non-specific low back pain in primary care. We also aimed to examine how recommendations have changed since our last overview in 2010.

Method

The searches for clinical practice guidelines were performed for the period from 2008 to 2017 in electronic databases. Guidelines including information regarding either the diagnosis or treatment of non-specific low back pain, and targeted at a multidisciplinary audience in the primary care setting, were considered eligible. We extracted data regarding recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, and methods for development of guidelines.

Results

We identified 15 clinical practice guidelines for the management of low back pain in primary care. For diagnosis of patients with non-specific low back pain, the clinical practice guidelines recommend history taking and physical examination to identify red flags, neurological testing to identify radicular syndrome, use of imaging if serious pathology is suspected (but discourage routine use), and assessment of psychosocial factors. For treatment of patients with acute low back pain, the guidelines recommend reassurance on the favourable prognosis and advice on returning to normal activities, avoiding bed rest, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and weak opioids for short periods. For treatment of patients with chronic low back pain, the guidelines recommend the use of NSAIDs and antidepressants, exercise therapy, and psychosocial interventions. In addition, referral to a specialist is recommended in case of suspicion of specific pathologies or radiculopathy or if there is no improvement after 4 weeks. While there were a few discrepancies across the current clinical practice guidelines, a substantial proportion of recommendations was consistently endorsed. In the current review, we identified some differences compared to the previous overview regarding the recommendations for assessment of psychosocial factors, the use of some medications (e.g., paracetamol) as well as an increasing amount of information regarding the types of exercise, mode of delivery, acupuncture, herbal medicines, and invasive treatments.

Acute non–low back musculoskeletal injury pain — opioid therapy, including tramadol — is linked to a conditional recommendation with low-certainty evidence, and evidence shows limited short-term benefit with meaningful harms: high-certainty evidence showed acetaminophen plus opioids reduced pain at 1 to 7 days and also at less than 2 hours (the latter small and not clinically important), while moderate- to high-certainty evidence indicated opioid interventions were associated with large increases in risk for neurologic and GI adverse effects; observational data show continued prescription opioid use over the long term in 27% among high-risk populations and 6% among the general population, with longer prescription periods (> 7 days vs 1 to 3 days) and higher morphine milligram equivalents per day predicting prolonged use.

Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To Identify evidence-based rehabilitation interventions for persons with non-specific low back pain (LBP) with and without radiculopathy and to develop recommendations from high-quality clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to inform the World Health Organization's (WHO) Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation (PIR).

Data Source

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, National Health Services Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment Database, PEDro, the Trip Database, the Index to Chiropractic Literature and the gray literature.

Study Selection

Eligible guidelines were (1) published between 2009 and 2019 in English, French, Italian, or Swedish; (2) included adults or children with non-specific LBP with or without radiculopathy; and (3) assessed the benefits of rehabilitation interventions on functioning. Pairs of independent reviewers assessed the quality of the CPGs using AGREE II.

Data Synthesis

We identified 4 high-quality CPGs. Recommended interventions included (1) education about recovery expectations, self-management strategies, and maintenance of usual activities; (2) multimodal approaches incorporating education, exercise, and spinal manipulation; (3) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined with education in the acute stage; and (4) intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation that includes exercise and cognitive/behavioral interventions for persistent pain. We did not identify high-quality CPGs for people younger than 16 years of age.

Conclusion

We developed evidence-based recommendations from high-quality CPGs to inform the WHO PIR for people with LBP with and without radiculopathy. These recommendations emphasize the potential benefits of education, exercise, manual therapy, and cognitive/behavioral interventions.

Abstract

Low back pain is a significant issue in the US Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense populations as well as the general US population at large. This type of pain can be distressing to those who experience its effects, leading patients to seek relief of their symptoms. In 2022, leadership within the US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense approved a joint clinical practice guideline for the management of low back pain. The guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for assessing and managing low back pain. Development of the guideline included a systematic evidence review, which was guided by 12 key questions. A multidisciplinary team, which included clinical stakeholders, reviewed the evidence that was retrieved and developed 39 recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. The scope of the clinical practice guideline is broad; however, the authors have focused on key recommendations that are important for clinicians in the evaluation and nonoperative treatment of low back pain, including pharmacologic therapies and both noninvasive and invasive nonpharmacologic treatments.

### Treatment patterns and population characteristics of nonpharmacological management of chronic pain in the United States' Medicare population: a scoping review [^743c9361]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Opioids emerged as one of the most prescribed pharmacologic agents for chronic noncancer pain management in the U.S. since the early 1990s. However, the safety concerns and questionable effectiveness of opioid therapy for pain, especially when used long-term, have led to the promulgation of several guidelines recommending more judicious and safer use of opioids in order to minimize opioid-related risks, including from the American College of Physicians (ACP), and Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In November 2022, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued its updated clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain, which advocates limiting opioid prescriptions and promotes the use of nonpharmacological approaches as first-line therapies for treating chronic pain. Research on the effectiveness of noninvasive and nonpharmacological pain therapies indicates wide variability in the size of the effect and strength of evidence on the effectiveness of these strategies on pain control and functional ability. However, evidence from systematic reviews suggests that nonpharmacological therapies (including spinal manipulative, massage, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation) confer small-to-moderate benefits, though usually short-term, and mainly for chronic low back pain. Although questions remain regarding which patient subgroups benefit most from a specific type of nonpharmacological treatment, access and use of nonpharmacological, nonopioid alternatives are recommended for the comprehensive management of chronic pain. Therefore, it is important to characterize the existing patterns of nonpharmacological use to help identify opportunities to advance policy, practice, and research. The historic influence of Medicare in shaping health care policy and practice in the U.S. suggests that Medicare's coverage decisions have far-reaching implications, affecting not only Medicare beneficiaries but also individuals with private insurance. This serves as further rationale for the current study.

### Association between opioid use and emergency department visits for spine-related disorders [^7e4503b4]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study examined the association between opioid use and the frequency of all-cause ED visits among SRD patients. The findings demonstrated that SRD patients who use opioids had a higher frequency of all-cause ED visits compared to those who do not. Our subgroup additional analyses showed an increased rate of all-cause ED visits among opioid users compared specifically to non-opioid analgesic users with SRD. There is limited observational research on hospitalization outcomes associated with opioid use among SRD patients, with most evidence derived from clinical trials and prior observational studies focusing primarily on specific patient subgroups. Most of these studies indicated that opioid exposure among SRD patients could lead to an increased rate of hospitalization, longer hospitalizations, and elevated rates of hospital readmission.,

Similar to our findings, patients with low back pain or neck discomfort who used opioids had worse adverse effects leading to hospitalization compared to those who used a placebo, according to the OPAL RCTor compared to those who did not use opioid medications as reported by the SPACE pragmatic trial. The 2017 American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends the use of non-opioids in the treatment of acute back pain, reserving opioids for unresponsive cases and short-term use. Our findings support this recommendation even though our analysis may not have accounted for case-by-case pain severity. In addition, Jones et al and Krebs et al both reported opioids not to be superior when compared with non-opioid medications in managing hip or chronic back pain, further emphasizing that opioid use may not offer additional benefits compared to non-opioid pain medications or non-pharmacologic therapies, such as physical therapy, structured exercise programs, cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, yoga, and chiropractic care. These results reinforce current guidelines that recommend prioritizing non-opioid and non-pharmacological therapies as first-line treatments for most spine-related pain conditions.

### Low back pain: what have clinical guidelines ever done for Us? [^52bbd53c]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

The burden that low back pain (LBP) presents to sufferers and society is well established. This ubiquitous condition is served by a complex global clinical marketplace offering a wide range of assessment alternatives and accompanying interventions. Yet, while the costs of care are rising, the global burden does not appear to be diminishing. Considerable effort internationally has gone into developing CPGs for LBP. The authors highlight the similarities and differences between existing CPGs for LBP, as well as strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement in the implementation of guidelines generally.

### Medications for acute and chronic low back pain: a review of the evidence for an American Pain Society / American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^500d11b7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Medications are the most frequently prescribed therapy for low back pain. A challenge in choosing pharmacologic therapy is that each class of medication is associated with a unique balance of risks and benefits.

Purpose

To assess benefits and harms of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, tramadol, and systemic corticosteroids for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain).

Data Sources

English-language studies were identified through searches of MEDLINE (through November 2006) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006, Issue 4). These electronic searches were supplemented by hand searching reference lists and additional citations suggested by experts.

Study Selection

Systematic reviews and randomized trials of dual therapy or monotherapy with 1 or more of the preceding medications for acute or chronic low back pain that reported pain outcomes, back-specific function, general health status, work disability, or patient satisfaction.

Data Extraction

We abstracted information about study design, population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and adverse events. To grade methodological quality, we used the Oxman criteria for systematic reviews and the Cochrane Back Review Group criteria for individual trials.

Data Synthesis

We found good evidence that NSAIDs, acetaminophen, skeletal muscle relaxants (for acute low back pain), and tricyclic antidepressants (for chronic low back pain) are effective for pain relief. The magnitude of benefit was moderate (effect size of 0.5 to 0.8, improvement of 10 to 20 points on a 100-point visual analogue pain scale, or relative risk of 1.25 to 2.00 for the proportion of patients experiencing clinically significant pain relief), except in the case of tricyclic antidepressants (for which the benefit was small to moderate). We also found fair evidence that opioids, tramadol, benzodiazepines, and gabapentin (for radiculopathy) are effective for pain relief. We found good evidence that systemic corticosteroids are ineffective. Adverse events, such as sedation, varied by medication, although reliable data on serious and long-term harms are sparse. Most trials were short term (≤ 4 weeks). Few data address efficacy of dual-medication therapy compared with monotherapy, or beneficial effects on functional outcomes.

Limitations

Our primary source of data was systematic reviews. We included non-English-language trials only if they were included in English-language systematic reviews.

Conclusions

Medications with good evidence of short-term effectiveness for low back pain are NSAIDs, acetaminophen, skeletal muscle relaxants (for acute low back pain), and tricyclic antidepressants (for chronic low back pain). Evidence is insufficient to identify one medication as offering a clear overall net advantage because of complex tradeoffs between benefits and harms. Individual patients are likely to differ in how they weigh potential benefits, harms, and costs of various medications.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® cervical pain or cervical radiculopathy: 2024 update [^0aea05ec]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cervical spine pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care as it ranks in the top 5 causes of global years lost to disability. The economic burden of cervical pain is also significant. Imaging is at the center of diagnosis of cervical pain and its causes. However, different symptoms and potential causes of cervical pain require different initial imaging to maximize the benefit of diagnostic usefulness of imaging. In this document we address different cervical pain variants with detailed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of different modalities for addressing each specific variant. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Informed consent for spine procedures: best practice guideline from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^0f1f1986]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients should also be made aware of expectations in the immediate post-operative/post-procedural period. This should include potential post-procedural pain levels, restrictions or limitations, and planned follow-up appointments, and how to address concerns should they arise. The anticipated timeline of each of these should be communicated, as well.

Best Practice Recommendation #2: It is strongly recommended that the risks and benefits of the proposed treatment against natural history are discussed. Risks that would affect the decision-making of a rational patient should be elaborated, as well as anything that poses potentially grave adverse consequences. If objective data are available regarding the associated risks, it is recommended to present them in the form of proportions rather than percentages.

Strength of Recommendation: A

Best Practice Recommendation #3: It is strongly recommended to discuss the alternatives, including no intervention, for the established diagnosis. Alternatives should be presented on a spectrum from least-invasive to most invasive options. Referral to appropriate providers is encouraged to further discuss available alternative treatment options.

Recommendation 2

Nonopioid therapies are preferred for subacute and chronic pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider initiating opioid therapy if expected benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy, should work with patients to establish treatment goals for pain and function, and should consider how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 2).

### A critical review of guidelines for low back pain treatment [^5455e1aa]. European Spine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Main Problem

Little is known about the methodological quality of guidelines for low back pain treatment. We evaluated the methods used by the developers according to established standards.

Methods

PubMed, guideline databases, and the World Wide Web were used to identify guidelines. Seventeen guidelines met the inclusion criteria: interventions for low back pain stated, recommendations based on or explicitly linked to evidence, and English version available. Guidelines were evaluated independently by two appraisers using a practical tool for this purpose, Users' Guides to the Medical Literature, and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument.

Results

Thirteen guidelines (76%) specified the most important therapies applied, but only nine (53%) included a complete description of the target population. Explicit processes to identify, select, and combine evidence were described in only six guidelines (35%). Few guidelines (3; 18%) explicitly considered all main outcomes when formulating therapeutic recommendations, and none contained a process to determine the relative value of different outcomes. Methodological criteria for grading the strength of the recommendations varied, and were often insufficiently specified. None of the guidelines assessed the impact of uncertainty associated with the evidence and values used. According to AGREE the quality score was highest for the scope and purpose, and clarity and presentation domains, and lowest for editorial independence and applicability. With regard to the recommendations, there was consensus for some of the interventions for acute pain (analgesics and NSAIDs, maintaining physical activity, and avoiding excessive bed rest), but explicit recommendations were lacking or ambiguous for 41% of the interventions. Most of the guidelines did not contemplate specific recommendations for chronic pain.

Conclusions

A small number of the available guidelines for low back pain treatment achieved acceptable results for specific quality criteria. In general, the methods to develop the guidelines' therapeutic recommendations need to be more rigorous, more explicit and better explained. In addition, greater importance should be placed on the recommendations for chronic pain.

### Barriers and progress in the treatment of low back pain [^e7f58fff]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Low back pain is a common and costly condition and for most people is likely to be a recurrent problem throughout their lifetime. The management of patients with low back pain has been positively influenced by the rise in high quality clinical trials and systematic reviews in recent decades, and this body of evidence, synthesized in many clinical practice guidelines, has improved our knowledge about which treatments for low back pain are useful and which are not. For the largest group of patients, those with non-specific low back pain for whom a clear diagnosis cannot be given, the reality is that the treatments we have to offer tend to produce small effects, often only in the short term and none appear to effectively change long-term prognosis. This commentary summarizes the array of treatments currently available, notes the results of recent trials and guidelines and considers alternative approaches that may prove more valuable in achieving better patient outcomes in the future.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^e46b4689]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, these multiorganizational facet intervention guidelines are meant to serve as a blueprint to guide care in an era characterized by increasingly polarized views, where there is often a lack of communication between parties with different opinions. These guidelines should not be misconstrued as unalterable standards, nor can they account for every possible variation in presentation or treatment circumstance. Similar to all facets of medicine, the decision about when to implement treatment, how to interpret treatment outcomes and how best to weigh risks and benefits based on unique patient considerations should be made on an individualized basis (ie, personalized medicine) after sufficient discussion with the patient. As has been alluded to previously, evidence-based pain medicine should include consideration of the best-available research, and take into account clinical experience and expertise, as well as patient values and preferences.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline — opioids for chronic low back pain: In patients with chronic low back pain (LBP), moderate to low quality evidence shows opioids compared with placebo improve pain and function at 4–15 weeks follow-up, but effects are small and short-term with no clear long-term benefit, and evidence for serious adverse events and mortality is inconclusive. For LBP refractory to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or with contraindications to NSAIDs, opioids are described as the only remaining drug treatment with evidence of effectiveness; however, the body of evidence had limitations including the duration of treatment (no studies > 6 months) and long-term follow-up. Concern about potentially catastrophic harm related to opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose deaths outweighed the small, likely short-term benefits, and thus the Work Group decided upon a Weak against recommendation.
