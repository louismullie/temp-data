## Question

how to write written prescriptions:Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to write a prescription for doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core prescription elements and standard format. Then, I should verify the indication-specific dosing and whether a loading dose is needed. Next, I will check administration instructions, including food, fluids, and esophagitis precautions. After that, I need to review safety warnings, contraindications, and special populations. Finally, I will consider adherence strategies, documentation requirements, and provide a clean final prescription example with appropriate counseling points and references.

> Let me first confirm the core prescription elements and format. A complete outpatient prescription should include the medication name with strength, route, dose, frequency, duration, quantity to dispense, refills, and clear patient instructions, along with the prescriber's information and date; for doxycycline 100 mg, the standard adult regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily is supported across multiple FDA labels and guidelines, and I should explicitly write "by mouth" or "orally" to avoid ambiguity.

> Wait, let me verify whether a loading dose is required here. The classic FDA labeling for many infections recommends 200 mg on day 1, then 100 mg daily, but that applies to certain indications and not universally; importantly, several high-credibility guidelines endorse 100 mg twice daily for 14 days without a loading dose for specific conditions such as Q fever, early syphilis in penicillin-allergic patients, and pelvic inflammatory disease, so I should align the loading strategy with the intended indication rather than assume a loading dose is always needed.

> I need to ensure administration instructions are precise. Doxycycline should be taken with a full glass of water to reduce esophageal irritation and ulceration risk, and patients should remain upright for at least 30 minutes after dosing; if gastric upset occurs, it can be taken with food or milk, which does not markedly impair absorption, and I should explicitly state these points on the prescription label and during counseling.

> Hold on, I should verify key safety warnings and contraindications. Doxycycline is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any tetracycline, and it should be avoided in pregnancy and in children under 8 years due to risks of enamel hypoplasia and tooth discoloration; I should also warn about photosensitivity, rare but serious skin reactions, and the possibility of C. difficile–associated diarrhea, and I should screen for drug interactions such as with rifampin or rifabutin that can reduce doxycycline exposure and efficacy [^ce8f8553] [^38ed5ab3] [^7ffd80cc].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. For patients with renal impairment, accumulation is not typically a concern at usual doses, though I should still monitor clinically; for patients with intracranial hypertension risk, I should use caution and counsel on headache and visual symptoms; and for those on long-term therapy, I should monitor for adverse effects and reassess ongoing need periodically, consistent with FDA precautions and clinical practice norms [^38ed5ab3].

> Next, I should review adherence and dispensing strategies. Nonadherence to multiday doxycycline is a recognized barrier, particularly after ED discharge; providing the full 14-day supply at the visit, using discharge kits, or ensuring same-day pickup can mitigate failures, and I should document counseling and follow-up plans to support completion and minimize recurrence or resistance [^b027b46f] [^b14c9186] [^e052c419].

> I will now examine documentation and follow-up requirements. I need to record the indication, rationale for regimen choice, allergies, pregnancy status, and pediatric age verification; for STI-related indications, partner management and abstinence counseling should be documented, and for PID or other complex infections, I should confirm anaerobic coverage when indicated and plan reassessment if no improvement within 72 hours [^72d151fa].

> But wait, what if the intended use is not one of the 14-day indications? I should double-check the condition-specific duration: erythema migrans is typically 10 days of doxycycline, chlamydia is 7 days, and some rickettsial infections require at least 5–7 days with extension based on clinical response; using 14 days for the wrong indication could be inappropriate, so I must match duration to the diagnosis and guideline-supported regimen [^77a49b9a] [^865c5e43] [^158e6c4d].

> Let me synthesize a clean, final prescription example, assuming a 14-day indication such as Q fever or early syphilis in a penicillin-allergic patient, and I will include the essentials without overcomplicating. Prescription: Doxycycline 100 mg, take 1 capsule by mouth twice daily for 14 days, dispense 28 capsules, no refills; label: Take with a full glass of water and remain upright for 30 minutes; take with food if stomach upset occurs; avoid excessive sun exposure and use sunscreen; finish all medication even if feeling better; contact us for rash, severe diarrhea, headache with vision changes, or difficulty swallowing; avoid use if pregnant or under 8 years old, and report tetracycline allergies before starting [^38ed5ab3] [^ad00b4fb].

> Hold on, I should verify that I've addressed the user's exact request. The original query was how to write "doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days", and I've provided a standardized, guideline-concordant prescription framework, clarified when a loading dose is and isn't indicated, incorporated administration and safety counseling, and emphasized indication-specific durations and adherence supports, which directly answers the clinical writing task while preserving safety and evidence alignment [^3ebc9688].

## Important counseling points

When prescribing doxycycline, **counsel patients on the following**:

- **Administration**: Take with a full glass of water and remain upright for at least 30 minutes to prevent esophageal irritation [^3ebc9688].

- **Food interactions**: Avoid dairy products, calcium supplements, and antacids within 2 hours of dosing, as they can impair absorption.

- **Photosensitivity**: Use sunscreen and avoid prolonged sun exposure due to increased risk of sunburn [^ad00b4fb].

- **Side effects**: Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and photosensitivity. Severe side effects (e.g. allergic reactions, severe headache, vision changes) should be reported immediately [^38ed5ab3].

- **Completion of therapy**: Emphasize the importance of completing the full 14-day course, even if symptoms improve earlier.

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: For children aged ≥ 8 years, the recommended dosage is 2.2 mg/kg per dose twice daily for 14 days, with a maximum of 100 mg per dose [^211b2bdd].

- **Pregnancy**: Doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential fetal harm. Alternative antibiotics should be considered [^ad00b4fb].

- **Drug interactions**: Doxycycline may interact with anticoagulants, antacids, and other medications. Review patient's current medications before prescribing [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

A written prescription for doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days should be **clear and concise**, including patient information, medication details, dosage instructions, quantity, and prescriber information. Counseling on administration, side effects, and adherence is essential to ensure effective treatment and minimize adverse effects.

### Doxycycline (doxy 100) [^8d7f904a]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

NOTE: Rapid administration is to be avoided. Parenteral therapy is indicated only when oral therapy is not indicated. Oral therapy should be instituted as soon as possible. If intravenous therapy is given over prolonged periods of time, thrombophlebitis may result.

The usual dosage and frequency of administration of Doxycycline for Injection (100 to 200 mg/day) differs from that of the other tetracyclines (1 to 2 g/day). Exceeding the recommended dosage may result in an increased incidence of side effects.

Studies to date have indicated that doxycycline hyclate at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of the antibiotic in patients with renal impairment.

Adults

The usual dosage of doxycycline for injection is 200 mg on the first day of treatment administered in one or two infusions. Subsequent daily dosage is 100 to 200 mg depending upon the severity of infection, with 200 mg administered in one or two infusions.

In the treatment of primary and secondary syphilis, the recommended dosage is 300 mg daily for at least 10 days.

In the treatment of inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) the recommended dose is 100 mg of doxycycline, twice a day. Parenteral therapy is only indicated when oral therapy is not indicated and should not be continued over a prolonged period of time. Oral therapy should be instituted as soon as possible. Therapy must continue for a total of 60 days.

### CDC clinical guidelines on the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infection prevention, United States, 2024 [^8dadacf2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Administration and Dosage

If doxy PEP is prescribed, the provider should write the prescription for self-administration of the recommended dose of 200 mg of doxycycline (any formulation) to be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex with a maximum dose of 200 mg every 24 hours. The prescription should account for enough doses on the basis of the person's anticipated sexual activity until their next visit. Ongoing need for doxy PEP should be assessed every 3–6 months.

Ancillary Clinical Services with Doxy PEP

Doxy PEP, when offered, should be implemented in the context of a comprehensive sexual health approach (Box 2), including risk reduction counseling, STI screening and treatment, recommended vaccination and linkage to HIV PrEP, HIV care, or other services as appropriate (6). Persons who are prescribed doxy PEP should undergo bacterial STI testing at anatomic sites of exposure at baseline and every 3–6 months thereafter. HIV screening should be performed for HIV-negative MSM and TGW according to current recommendations (6).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF DOXYCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS.

Adults: The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours or 50 mg every 6 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours. In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.

For pediatric patients above eight years of age: The recommended dosage schedule for pediatric patients weighing 100 pounds or less is 2 mg/lb of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by 1 mg/lb of body weight given as a single daily dose or divided into two doses, on subsequent days. For more severe infections up to 2 mg/lb of body weight may be used. For pediatric patients over 100 pounds the usual adult dose should be used.

Uncomplicated gonococcal infections in adults (except anorectal infections in men): 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for 7 days. As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^c75a2db0]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Recommended Uses and Dosing of Doxycycline

Doxycycline can be used by travelers to all malaria-endemic areas for malaria prophylaxis. When used in conjunction with other medications, doxycycline can also be used to treat malaria.

Prophylaxis.

Doxycycline can be used for the prevention of malaria in travelers to malaria-endemic areas and is a good option for areas with chloroquine or multidrug-resistant P. falciparum. For prophylaxis, doxycycline is taken once daily beginning 1–2 days before travel, while in malarious areas, and for 4 weeks after leaving. Daily dosage for children ≥ 8 years of age is 2.2 mg/kg (not to exceed the adult dose of 100 mg) and for adults 100 mg.

Treatment.

Doxycycline should always be used in conjunction with another drug for treatment of malaria. Quinine with doxycycline can be used for uncomplicated malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum or P. vivax. When used for severe malaria doxycycline should be used with intravenous quinidine. The treatment dose of doxcycyline in adults is 100 mg twice a day and for children 2.2 mg/kg twice a day up to a maximum of 100 mg twice daily. For those unable to tolerate oral medications, doxycycline is available in a parenteral form and can be made in concentrations between 0.1 and 10 mg/mL. If pain occurs while receiving doxycycline intravenously, it is recommended to use more dilute concentrations (no lower than 0.1 mg/mL) infused at rates no higher than 1 mg/min; switch to an oral formulation once the patient is able to tolerate medications by mouth. If treating P. vivax or P. ovale, in addition to the aforementioned drugs, primaquine must also be given to prevent relapses (see Pharmacodynamics section).

Lyme disease chemoprophylaxis — preferred regimen after a high-risk tick bite — For high-risk Ixodes spp. bites in all age groups, we recommend the administration of a single dose of oral doxycycline within 72 hours of tick removal over observation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: Doxycycline is given as a single oral dose, 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^ee79448c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the pharynx:

Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a single dose for persons weighing < 150 kg (300 lb)

For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg (300 lb), 1 g of IM ceftriaxone should be administered.
If chlamydia coinfection is identified when pharyngeal gonorrhea testing is performed, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. During pregnancy, azithromycin 1 g as a single dose is recommended to treat chlamydia.
No reliable alternative treatments are available for pharyngeal gonorrhea. For persons with a history of a beta-lactam allergy, a thorough assessment of the reaction is recommended. *
For persons with an anaphylactic or other severe reaction (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome) to ceftriaxone, consult an infectious disease specialist for an alternative treatment recommendation.

Abbreviation: IM = intramuscular.

* CDC. Sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines. MMWR Recomm Rep 2015;64(No. RR-3).

In cases where gonococcal expedited partner therapy (provision of prescriptions or medications for the patient to take to a sex partner without the health care provider first examining the partner) is permissible by state law and the partner is unable or unlikely to seek timely treatment, the partner may be treated with a single 800 mg oral dose of cefixime, provided that concurrent chlamydial infection in the patient has been excluded. Otherwise, the partner may be treated with a single oral 800 mg cefixime dose plus oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days.

In cases of suspected cephalosporin treatment failure, clinicians should obtain relevant clinical specimens for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, consult an infectious disease specialist or STD clinical expert for guidance in clinical management, and report the case to CDC through state and local public health authorities within 24 hours. Health departments should prioritize notification and culture evaluation for the patient's sex partner(s) from the preceding 60 days for those with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure or persons whose gonococcal isolates demonstrate reduced susceptibility to cephalosporins.

Summary

Indications.

The only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indication for the use of doxycycline for malaria is for prophylaxis of Plasmodium falciparum in short-term travelers (< 4 months) to areas with chloroquine and/or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine-resistant strains. Although not FDA approved, doxycycline is recommended for prophylaxis of other species of malariaand may be used long term. When used in conjunction with other medications, doxycycline can be used for the treatment of malaria in non-pregnant adults and children ≥ 8 years of age: with quinine sulfate for uncomplicated, chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; with both quinine sulfate and primaquine for uncomplicated chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax; and with parenteral quinidine for severe malaria.

Dosing.

Available in multiple dosage forms and strengths, doxycycline tablets or capsules of 100 mg are most often used for malaria prophylaxis or treatment. Tablets or capsules should be swallowed with an adequate amount of fluid and should be taken with food. Intravenous (IV) formulation is available for patients unable to take oral medications for treatment. For IV, avoid rapid administration.

Adults.

Prophylaxis: 100 mg base once daily starting 1–2 days before travel, then daily during travel, and daily for 4 weeks after leaving the malarious area.

Treatment: 100 mg twice a day for 7 days; must be used in conjunction with a fast acting schizontocide. Primaquine is also required if treating P. vivax or Plasmodium ovale.

Children.

For children ≥ 8 years of age.

Prophylaxis: 2.2 mg/kg (up to adult dose of 100 mg) daily starting 1–2 days before travel, daily during travel, and daily for 4 weeks after leaving the malarious area.

Treatment: 2.2 mg/kg (up to adult dose of 100 mg) twice a day for 7 days; must be used in conjunction with a fast acting schizontocide. Primaquine is also required if treating P. vivax or P. ovale.

Efficacy.

Prophylaxis: Protective efficacy of doxycycline has been shown in three randomized placebo-controlled trials to be between 92% and 96% for P. falciparum and 98% for primary P. vivax infection.

Treatment: When used in combination with a fast acting schizontocide, treatment efficacy of doxycycline has been shown to be 96–100% in three open-label trials.

Parenteral Treatment

Randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of parenteral regimens. Clinical experience should guide decisions regarding transition to oral therapy, which usually can be initiated within 24–48 hours of clinical improvement. For women with tubo-ovarian abscesses, > 24 hours of inpatient observation is recommended.

Recommended Parenteral Regimens for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
plus
Metronidazole 500 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours

Because of the pain associated with IV infusion, doxycycline should be administered orally when possible. Oral and IV administration of doxycycline and metronidazole provide similar bioavailability. Oral metronidazole is well absorbed and can be considered instead of IV for women without severe illness or tubo-ovarian abscess when possible. After clinical improvement with parenteral therapy, transition to oral therapy with doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day and metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day is recommended to complete 14 days of antimicrobial therapy.

Recommended Regimens if M. genitalium Resistance Testing Is Available
If macrolide sensitive: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by azithromycin 1 g orally initial dose, followed by 500 mg orally once daily for 3 additional days (2.5 g total)
If macrolide resistant: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days
Recommended Regimen if M. genitalium Resistance Testing Is Not Available
If M. genitalium is detected by an FDA-cleared NAAT: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days

Although the majority of M. genitalium strains are sensitive to moxifloxacin, resistance has been reported, and adverse side effects and cost should be considered with this regimen. In settings without access to resistance testing and when moxifloxacin cannot be used, an alternative regimen can be considered, based on limited data: doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by azithromycin (1 g orally on day 1 followed by 500 mg once daily for 3 days) and a test of cure 21 days after completion of therapy. Because of the high prevalence of macrolide resistance and high likelihood of treatment failure, this regimen should be used only when a test of cure is possible, and no other alternatives exist. If symptomatic treatment failure or a positive test of cure occurs after this regimen, expert consultation is recommended. Data are limited regarding use of minocycline in instances of treatment failure.

Recommended PID treatment regimens are not effective against M. genitalium. Initial empiric therapy for PID, which includes doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days, should be provided at the time of presentation for care. If M. genitalium is detected, a regimen of moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days has been effective in eradicating the organism. Nevertheless, no data have been published that assess the benefits of testing women with PID for M. genitalium, and the importance of directing treatment against this organism is unknown.

Follow-Up

Test of cure is not recommended for asymptomatic persons who received treatment with a recommended regimen. In settings in which M. genitalium testing is available, persons with persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or PID accompanied by detection of M. genitalium should be treated with moxifloxacin.

### What happens when we routinely give doxycycline to medical abortion patients? [^e9db2469]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Routine provision of antibiotics following medical abortion is common yet practitioners and professional societies differ on its utility. Our study compares the side effects experienced by women who were prescribed doxycycline following medical abortion to those who were not and assesses the adherence to one prescribed regimen.

Study Design

This was a prospective, observational, open-label study from a convenience sample. Women seeking medical abortion were enrolled in nine study sites, including four clinics that routinely prescribe a seven-day course of doxycycline (Doxycycline arm) and five clinics that do not routinely prescribe any antibiotics (No Doxycycline arm). Seven to fourteen days following the administration of mifepristone, women were asked to self-administer a computer-based survey. The survey asked about side effects experienced (both arms) and adherence to the regimen (Doxycycline arm only).

Results

Five hundred eighty-one women were enrolled (278 in the Doxycycline arm and 303 in the No Doxycycline arm). There was a trend toward increased nausea in the Doxycycline arm (47.8% vs. 40.9%; p = .056) and a statistically significant difference in vomiting (25.2% vs. 18.5%; p = .032). Almost all women in the Doxycycline arm reported taking at least one pill, however only 28.3% reported "perfect adherence". The most common reasons reported for taking fewer pills than instructed were that participants were still taking them (beyond 7 days) or that they forgot to take them.

Conclusion

Women who were prescribed doxycycline following medical abortion reported moderate adherence and experienced significantly more vomiting than their counterparts.

Implications

In the absence of robust evidence that prescribing 7 days of doxycycline following medical abortion is effective at reducing serious infections, these data can assist the public health community with deciding whether routine provision is the most appropriate strategy.

### Evidence-informed provision of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of bacterial sexually transmitted infections [^01d2118f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among men who have sex with men and transgender women. In the United States, doxy-PEP is in an early stage of integration into clinical practice, and national guidelines for its use were recently released. The goal of this manuscript is to provide practical guidance for clinicians who are considering or currently prescribing doxy-PEP. We address five clinical questions using post hoc analyses of data from the DoxyPEP randomized controlled trial and discuss the potential implications and limitations of each question with the goal of informing clinical practice and implementation of doxy-PEP programs. The questions address patient eligibility criteria for doxy-PEP, the expected benefit and associated doxy-PEP doses for the average patient, the initial number of doses prescribed, and laboratory monitoring of persons taking doxy-PEP.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF DOXYCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS.

Adults

The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours or 50 mg every 6 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours. In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.

Pediatric Patients:

For all pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg with severe or life-threatening infections (e.g. anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), the recommended dosage is 2.2 mg/kg of body weight administered every 12 hours. Children weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

For pediatric patients with less severe disease (greater than 8 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg), the recommended dosage schedule is 4.4 mg per kg of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.2 mg per kg of body weight (given as a single daily dose or divided into twice daily doses). For pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg, the usual adult dose should be used.

The therapeutic antibacterial serum activity will usually persist for 24 hours following recommended dosage.

When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.

Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS)

If gastric irritation occurs, it is recommended that doxycycline be given with food or milk. The absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk.

Studies to date have indicated that administration of doxycycline at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of doxycycline in patients with renal impairment.

Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infections in Adults (Except Anorectal Infections in Men)

100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for 7 days. As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.

Acute Epididymo-orchitis Caused by N. gonorrhoeae

100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for at least 10 days.

### CDC clinical guidelines on the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infection prevention, United States, 2024 [^0b954f1e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary work group of CDC staff who are physicians with expertise in infectious diseases, STIs, HIV, and public health. A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the question: Does doxycycline taken after vaginal, anal, or oral sex decrease bacterial STIs (i.e. syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea) compared with not taking doxycycline? Studies published through June 2023 using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase were included. Studies that met inclusion criteria (i.e. randomized controlled trials, written in English, and evaluated doxy PEP as STI prophylaxis) were given a summary strength of evidence rating using the same approach as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents (Table) (12). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations evidence-to-decision framework was used to weigh the benefits and harms, values, acceptability, equity, and feasibility. Abstracts presented at major scientific meetings (i.e. Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections and the STI and HIV World Congress) also were reviewed. Literature reviews also were conducted to address the question: Does long-term doxycycline use cause substantial harms such as the development of antimicrobial resistant pathogens, and dermatologic, gastrointestinal, neuropsychiatric, and metabolic side effects? Evidence was not graded. Further details regarding search strategies are available.

TABLE
Rating scheme for strength and quality of evidence supporting CDC recommendations

In addition to the literature reviews, the National Association of County and City Health Officials held a virtual 2-day consultation December 5 and 6, 2022, during which multiple experts, stakeholders, and community members discussed doxy PEP, including benefits and potential harms of use. The meeting report was reviewed by the Doxy PEP Guidelines Development Workgroup, and findings from the consultation were considered during the development of these recommendations. A virtual bioethics consultation took place April 14 and May 1, 2023, and included bioethics experts, academic experts in infectious diseases and health equity, community advocates, and CDC staff. This consultation resulted in a publication, and opinions from individual experts were considered in the development of the guidelines and implementation plans.

Outpatient medication prescription records for malaria chemoprophylaxis were included in the study based on the following working definitions and inclusion criteria for atovaquone–proguanil (AP), mefloquine (MQ), chloroquine (CQ), doxycycline (DX), and primaquine (PQ). Primaquine was further characterized as primary prophylaxis (PQ-1) and presumptive anti-relapse therapy (PQ-PART), which was analyzed separately. All AP and MQ prescriptions were included. Doxycycline was filtered out of the initial search if co-dispensed with either isotretinoin or topical medications typically used in the treatment of acne or rosacea, using the American Hospital Formulary Service drug class, as were the prescriptions associated with dermatology MEPRS codes. Doxycycline was further censored to include only those dispensed as one tablet daily, and those with twice-daily (therapeutic) dosing schemes were excluded. Doxycycline prescriptions of 100-mg tablets with a days supply of 36 or more days, representing the minimum number of tablets dispensed using CDC guidelines for 1 week of travel to a malaria-endemic region were included. Chloroquine prescriptions associated with rheumatology clinics were excluded because of potential indexing issues with hydroxychloroquine. Prescriptions of PQ were sorted by quantity as a proxy for indication. Primaquine in amounts less than eight tablets were excluded from the analysis. Primaquine tablet quantities of 14, 28, and 30 were designated as PQ-PART. Primaquine in other amounts were designated PQ-1. Artemether–lumefantrine and quinine prescriptions were not included in the analysis. Refills were counted as a single, index prescription.

Data analyses were performed on SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics were generated for all variables using Pearson's chi-square test for categorical variables. These results were then stratified by facility status and by military or beneficiary status. Facility status included military treatment facilities (MTFs) as defined by prescriptions filled at either military hospitals and clinics, or deployed medical units, and civilian facilities as defined by prescriptions from nonmilitary medical facilities, retail pharmacies, and mail order prescriptions. Study subjects were identified as "service member" if identified by codes for active duty personnel, National Guard and Reserve personnel, or "beneficiary" which would principally include military retirees and their dependents, as well as the dependents of service members. Individuals with unknown beneficiary status were removed before analysis.

### Treatment of erythema migrans with doxycycline for 7 days versus 14 days in Slovenia: a randomised open-label non-inferiority trial [^bf383050]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Background

Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in Europe and the USA. Doxycycline for 10 days is the primary treatment recommendation for erythema migrans. To reduce potentially harmful antibiotic overuse by identifying shorter effective treatments, we aimed to assess whether oral doxycycline for 7 days is non-inferior to 14 days in adults with solitary erythema migrans.

Methods

In this randomised open-label non-inferiority trial, we enrolled patients with a solitary erythema at the University Medical Centre in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or lactating, immunosuppressed, allergic to doxycycline, or had received antibiotics with anti-borrelial activity within 10 days preceding enrolment or had additional manifestations of Lyme borreliosis Adults were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive oral doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days or 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in proportion of patients with treatment failure, defined as persistent erythema, new objective signs of Lyme borreliosis, or borrelial isolation on skin re-biopsy at 2 months, in a per-protocol analysis (the population that completed the assigned doxycycline regimen according to the study protocol and did not receive any other antibiotics with anti-borrelial activity until the 2-month visit). The non-inferiority margin was 6 percentage points. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who followed the study protocol and were evaluable at the 14-day visit. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03153267.

Findings

Between July 3, 2017, and Oct 2, 2018, we enrolled 300 patients (150 per group: median age 56 years [IQR 47–65]; 126 [45%] of 300 male; skin culture positive 72 [30%] of 239 assessed). 295 patients completed antibiotic therapy as per protocol and 294 (98%) patients were evaluable 2 months post-enrolment. Five (3%) of 147 patients from the 7-day group versus 3 (2%) of 147 patients from the 14-day group (one patient did not attend the 2-month visit and was unreachable by telephone) had treatment failure manifesting as persistence of erythema (difference 1.4 percentage points; upper limit of one-sided 95% CI 5.2 percentage points; p = 0.64). No patients developed new objective manifestations of Lyme borreliosis during follow-up or had positive repeat skin biopsies. Two (1%) of 150 patients in the 7-day and one (1%) of 150 patients in the 14-day group discontinued therapy due to adverse events.

Interpretation

Our data support 7 days of oral doxycycline for adult European patients with solitary erythema migrans, permitting less antibiotic exposure than current guideline-driven therapy.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^dcc318ff]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of Sex Partners

Recent sex partners (i.e. persons having sexual contact with the infected patient < 60 days preceding onset of symptoms or gonorrhea diagnosis) should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment. If the patient's last potential sexual exposure was > 60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be treated.

If health department partner-management strategies (e.g. disease intervention specialists) are impractical or unavailable for persons with gonorrhea and partners' access to prompt clinical evaluation and treatment is limited, EPT can be delivered to the partner by the patient or a collaborating pharmacy as permitted by law (see Partner Services). Treatment of the sexual partner with cefixime 800 mg as a single dose is recommended, provided that concurrent chlamydial infection has been excluded. If a chlamydia test result has not been documented, the partner may be treated with a single dose of oral cefixime 800 mg plus oral doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day for 7 days. If adherence with multiday dosing is a considerable concern, azithromycin 1 g can be considered but has lower treatment efficacy among persons with rectal chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infections). Provision of medication by EPT should be accompanied by written materials for educating partners about gonorrhea, their exposure to gonorrhea, and the importance of therapy. These materials should also educate partners about seeking clinical evaluation for adverse reactions or complications and general follow-up when able. Educational materials for female partners should include information about the importance of seeking medical evaluation for PID, especially if symptomatic; undertreatment of PID among female partners and missed opportunities for diagnosing other STIs among women are of concern. MSM with gonorrhea have a high risk for coexisting infections (especially undiagnosed HIV) among their partners, and they might have partners without HIV who could benefit from PrEP. Data are also limited regarding the effectiveness of EPT in reducing persistent or recurrent gonorrhea among MSM; thus, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT for MSM is recommended (see Partner Services). To avoid reinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from condomless sexual intercourse for 7 days after they and their sex partners have completed treatment and after resolution of symptoms, if present.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease chemoprophylaxis after a high-risk Ixodes spp. bite — For high-risk Ixodes spp. bites in all age groups, we recommend the administration of a single dose of oral doxycycline within 72 hours of tick removal over observation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Doxycycline is given as a single oral dose, 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children. Evidence summarized from four placebo-controlled trials in endemic areas found that among 1082 randomized subjects the placebo-group risk was 3.0% and that antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced risk versus placebo (risk ratio [RR]: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] (.10, .75)); absolute risk: 22 fewer per 1000, 95% CI (7 to 27 fewer per 1000). No serious adverse effects were reported, though drug rashes and gastrointestinal side effects occurred. The guideline notes insufficient evidence to recommend topical antibiotics and calls for additional research to evaluate whether brief courses of amoxicillin or other antibiotics are comparable to doxycycline for prophylaxis.

Intramuscular or Oral Treatment

IM or oral therapy can be considered for women with mild-to-moderate acute PID because the clinical outcomes among women treated with these regimens are similar to those treated with IV therapy. Women who do not respond to IM or oral therapy within 72 hours should be reevaluated to confirm the diagnosis and be administered therapy IV.

Recommended Intramuscular or Oral Regimens for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
or
Cefoxitin 2 g IM in a single dose and probenecid 1 g orally administered concurrently in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
or
Other parenteral third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftizoxime or cefotaxime)
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
* For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.

These regimens provide coverage against frequent etiologic agents of PID; however, the optimal choice of a cephalosporin is unclear. Cefoxitin, a second-generation cephalosporin, has better anaerobic coverage than ceftriaxone, and, in combination with probenecid and doxycycline, has been effective in short-term clinical response among women with PID. Ceftriaxone has better coverage against N. gonorrhoeae. The addition of metronidazole to these regimens provides extended coverage against anaerobic organisms and will also effectively treat BV, which is frequently associated with PID.

### Analysis of patient adherence to filling emergency department discharge prescriptions for empiric treatment of Chlamydia [^e052c419]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) represent an enormous public health burden in the United States. Emergency departments (EDs) are a significant source of medical care, particularly for vulnerable patient populations. Guidelines for the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis have evolved and now recommend doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as the primary regimen for adults. However, the single-dose azithromycin regimen can be given during the ED visit, while the new regimen has nonadherence hurdles. The purpose of this study will be determining the rate of ED discharge prescription pick ups of doxycycline for Chlamydia trachomatis infection at two discharge pharmacies.

Methods

This is a retrospective chart review of information contained in the electronic medical record (EMR) from August 1 st, 2021 - July 31 st, 2022. Adult patients who present to the two EDs in the healthcare system and those who received empiric antibiotic treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis infection prior to, or at, ED discharge will be included. Patients who are pregnant, less than 18 years old, those without a Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid amplification test during their ED visit, or patients whose antibiotic treatment prescription was sent to a pharmacy other than the two primary discharge pharmacies at the respective medical centers will be excluded. The primary outcome of this study will be determining the rate of emergency department (ED) discharge prescription pick ups of doxycycline for empiric treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection at two discharge pharmacies. The secondary outcomes will include the incidence of repeat positive tests between four weeks and 90 days, risk of repeat positive tests in those who do not fill doxycycline, number of positive and negative test results, rate of prescribing adherence to 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines regimens for empiric treatment, and insurance status at the time of discharge fill.

Results

Seven hundred and thirty patients were pulled from the EMR. One hundred of the patients were excluded from the study as they did not receive empiric antibiotic treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis infection prior to, or at, ED discharge leaving 630 participants. Among this group, 369 patients were excluded as their discharge prescription was not sent to the discharge pharmacies within the medical system, leaving 261 individuals in the study. Per chart review, 215 of the patients picked up their doxycycline prescription (82.4%) and 46 (17.6%) patients failed to pick up their prescription. Additionally, 43 (16.5) of the patients who were prescribed empiric therapy had a positive chlamydia trachomatis test, while 209 (83.5%) of those had a negative test. This study also showed 188 (72%) patients received treatment according to the current CDC recommendations.

Conclusion

Majority of patients who received prescriptions from the in-hospital discharge pharmacy picked up their prescriptions.

### Efficacy and safety of adding 6 weeks of doxycycline to the essential package of care to treat filarial lymphedema: a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in Southern India [^50fafb65]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Trial procedures.

The selected participants were men and women 14–65 years old who had leg lymphedema of stages 1–3. The enrollees were given repeated training sessions on lymphedema management (the EPC) to ensure that they were well-informed about the recommended procedures prior to the first drug administration. The participants were then randomized to receive either doxycycline or placebo following a provided randomization table. Based on their lymphedema stages, the participants were segregated into group A (stages 1–3) or group B (stages 4–6)(Note: Findings from group B with its smaller number of patients [N = 20] are not included in the current report).

Daily doxycycline 200 mg or placebo was given to all patients for a period of 6 weeks. Participants were administered the first dose of either doxycycline (100 mg for patients weighing ≤ 50 kg and 200 mg for patients > 50 kg) or placebo according to body weight and were always under the supervision of the staff of the FRC during the initial treatment activity.

The participants were then given a single strip pack of the drug containing enough doses for 1 week. To ensure the smooth administration of the daily drug, a care provider (usually a close relative) was identified, and he/she was advised to oversee the daily taking of the medicine and to accompany the patients during all visits to the FRC. Patients were instructed to return to the center at the end of each week (the dates being marked on the patient's diary by the investigating team) and to return the empty blister pack to confirm the number of tablets likely taken. The patient and the care provider were also asked to record in the diary details of any adverse events (AEs) happening during the period of taking the tablets (42 days), including recording any ADL attacks that occurred. At 3 weeks (day 22) into the treatment, serum transaminase levels were again measured. Urine tests for pregnancy were carried out at baseline and at both 3 and 8 weeks after first taking the drug. A history of any concomitant medications was also repeatedly reported on return visits to the FRC.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of doxycycline hyclate IV (also known as Doxy 100, Acticlate):
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion as C. difficile associated diarrhea has been associated with the use of doxycycline. Symptoms may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.
- **Dental enamel hypoplasia, Tooth abnormalities**: use caution during Tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) which may lead to abnormal permanent discoloration. Use in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions.
- **Increased BUN**: use caution in patients with impaired renal function, for doxycycline can cause an increase in BUN due to its antianabolic action.
- **Increased ICP**: use caution in women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of intracranial hypertension.
- **Photosensitivity of skin**: use caution in patients with excessive sunlight/artificial UV light exposure.
- **Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme**: maintain a high level of suspicion for skin sensitivity reactions, discontinue doxycycline immediately if present.

### Doxycycline for outpatient-treated acute exacerbations of COPD: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^eb46a148]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics do not reduce mortality or short-term treatment non-response in patients receiving treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD in an outpatient setting. However, the long-term effects of antibiotics are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate if the antibiotic doxycycline added to the oral corticosteroid prednisolone prolongs time to next exacerbation in patients with COPD receiving treatment for an exacerbation in the outpatient setting.

Methods

In this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we recruited a cohort of patients with COPD from outpatient clinics of nine teaching hospitals and three primary care centres in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria were an age of at least 45 years, a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, mild-to-severe COPD (Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage 1–3), and at least one exacerbation during the past 3 years. Exclusion criteria were poor mastery of the Dutch language, poor cognitive functioning, known allergy to doxycycline, pregnancy, and a life expectancy of shorter than 1 month. If a participant had an exacerbation, we randomly assigned them (1:1; with permuted blocks of variable sizes [ranging from two to ten]; stratified by GOLD stage 1–2 vs 3) to a 7 day course of oral doxycycline 100 mg daily (200 mg on the first day) or placebo. Exclusion criteria for randomisation were fever, admission to hospital, and current use of antibiotics or use within the previous 3 weeks. Patients in both groups received a 10 day course of 30 mg oral prednisolone daily. Patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was time to next exacerbation in all randomly allocated patients except for those incorrectly randomly allocated who did not meet the inclusion criteria or met the exclusion criteria. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number NTR2499.

Findings

Between Dec 22, 2010, and Aug 6, 2013, we randomly allocated 305 (34%) patients from the cohort of 887 patients to doxycycline (152 [50%]) or placebo (153 [50%]), excluding four (1%) patients (two [1%] from each group) who were incorrectly randomly allocated from the analysis. 257 (85%) of 301 patients had a next exacerbation (131 [87%] of 150 in the doxycycline group vs 126 [83%] of 151 in the placebo group). Median time to next exacerbation was 148 days (95% CI 95–200) in the doxycycline group compared with 161 days (118–211) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1.01 [95% CI 0.79–1.31]; p = 0.91). We did not note any significant differences between groups in the frequency of adverse events during the first 2 weeks after randomisation (47 [31%] of 150 in the doxycycline group vs 53 [35%] of 151 in the placebo group; p = 0.54) or in serious adverse events during the 2 years of follow-up (42 [28%] vs 43 [29%]; p = 1).

Interpretation

In patients with mild-to-severe COPD receiving treatment for an exacerbation in an outpatient setting, the antibiotic doxycycline added to the oral corticosteroid prednisolone did not prolong time to next exacerbation compared with prednisolone alone. These findings do not support prescription of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations in an outpatient setting.

### Doxycycline versus prednisolone as an initial treatment strategy for bullous pemphigoid: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^7b251e6b]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either doxycycline or prednisolone as initial treatment, and followed up for skin and medication assessments at weeks 3, 6, 13, 26, 39, and 52, plus unscheduled visits as required, reflecting normal clinical care. Randomisation was done by the internet and occurred once recruited participants' details had been entered by local physicians and research nurses onto a study database. Treatment was allocated using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size generated by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit and was stratified by baseline severity (3–9, 10–30, and > 30 blisters for mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively). Treatment allocation was sent directly to the local pharmacist who dispensed the appropriate medication directly, allowing the investigator to remain masked for the first 6 weeks. Investigators were subsequently unmasked to adjust or switch medication to reflect normal clinical practice. Participants were not masked to study medications. Given the morbidity of the elderly population and the fact that the characteristic adverse events of each drug are very well described, only adverse events suspected to be related were recorded. Adverse event collection after 6 weeks was not masked. Relatedness of unclear serious adverse events and all deaths was judged by a senior dermatologist independent of the trial team.

Procedures

We compared a strategy of initial treatment with oral doxycycline 200 mg per day or oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg per day for 6 weeks until the primary effectiveness outcome was measured, followed by a period in which the investigators were unmasked to treatments so that they could either continue with the randomised treatment if blister control was adequate, or switch treatments or adjust the dose of prednisolone, as might occur in normal clinical practice. Treatment with either strategy could continue up to 12 months according to blister control and adverse effects. We chose doxycycline because oxytetracycline requires participants to swallow eight large tablets daily and doxycycline has fewer adverse effects. We chose a dose of 0.5 mg/kg per day of prednisolone because a previous systematic review suggested higher doses were associated with unacceptable serious adverse effectsand lower doses might be ineffective. Up to 30 g per week of a potent topical corticosteroid (mometasone furoate) was permitted to be applied to localised lesions for symptom relief for weeks 1–3 only, and again after 6 weeks as per normal practice. Only lesional and not whole body application of topical corticosteroids was permitted.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^a52858c5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 10: bismuth quadruple therapy with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor, metronidazole and tetracycline for 14 days is the recommended first-line treatment in the absence of clarithromycin susceptibility testing or where clarithromycin resistance has been confirmed. Although inferior eradication rates have been reported, doxycycline may be used if tetracycline is unavailable

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

If primary clarithromycin resistance is > 15% and AST is not available before the prescription of first-line therapy, European guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy [PPI, bismuth salt, metronidazole and tetracycline (Table 3)] as the first-line treatment (Fig. 1). Bismuth salts exhibit anti- H. pylori activity in vitro and no resistance to bismuth has yet been reported. Bismuth quadruple therapy containing metronidazole and tetracycline has been shown to consistently achieve first-line cure rates of > 90% in studies published by Hp-EuReg when prescribed independently or in the 3-in-1 capsule.

Current Irish Health Service Executive guidelines recommend doxycycline rather than tetracycline in bismuth quadruple therapy, as doxycycline is less costly and easier to access. It should be noted that lower eradication rates have been reported when doxycycline is given instead of tetracycline in bismuth quadruple therapy. The treatment duration of bismuth quadruple therapy should be 14 days unless locally validated and equally effective 10-day therapies are available.

The European guidelines suggest that nonbismuth quadruple concomitant therapy (PPI, clarithromycin, metronidazole and amoxicillin) may be considered as an alternative to bismuth quadruple therapy in areas where dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance is below 15%. However, this is no longer the case in Ireland (primary dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance: 20.6% (N = 26/115)).

Question 3: What is the best treatment for this diagnosis?
A. Valacyclovir
B. Itraconazole
C. Supportive care
D. Doxycycline
E. Ciprofloxacin

Answers:
A. Valacyclovir 1 g orally twice a day for 10 days — Incorrect. Treatment is not necessary in immunocompetent patients because the infection spontaneously resolves within several weeks. Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is a prodrug of acyclovir, which inhibits DNA synthesis and viral replication. There is a lack of evidence that this medication is effective in the treatment of milker's nodule.
B. Itraconazole 200 mg by mouth twice a day for 6 months — Incorrect. Itraconazole is an antifungal medication that decreases ergosterol synthesis and inhibits fungal cell membrane formation; therefore, it would not be effective against viral illnesses such as milker's nodule.
C. Supportive care — Correct. In humans, milker's nodule is a self-limited diagnosis with no need for antiviral treatment. The infected animals should be isolated and personal protective equipment should be used to decrease the spread of infection. There is a vaccine available for cattle, and infection in humans confers immunity.
D. Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 1 week — Incorrect. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. It would be ineffective against viral infections.
E. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day for 10 days — Incorrect. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that inhibits DNA gyrase in susceptible organisms. This antibiotic would be ineffective against viral diseases such as milker's nodule.

Doxycycline can cause photosensitivity that can be minimized by avoiding prolonged, direct sun exposure and by using sunscreen, and its gastrointestinal side effects can be minimized by taking the drug with a meal or by specifically prescribing doxycycline monohydrate or the enteric-coated doxycycline hyclate; to reduce the risk for esophagitis, advise travelers to swallow the medicine with sufficient fluids and to avoid taking doxycycline before lying down or going to bed. Doxycycline is associated with an increased frequency of vaginal yeast infections, is contraindicated in people with an allergy to tetracyclines, in pregnant women, and in infants and children aged < 8 years, and vaccination with the oral typhoid vaccine Ty21a should be completed ≥ 24 hours before taking a dose of doxycycline.

### Doxycycline adherence for the management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections [^b027b46f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The updated 2021 CDC treatment guidelines recommend a single dose of 500 mg intramuscular ceftriaxone for Neisseria gonorrhea and doxycycline 100 mg by mouth twice daily for 7 days for Chlamydia trachomatis coinfection. However, there is a significant public health concern regarding patient non-adherence to the 7-day course of doxycycline. To date, there are no studies assessing this concern. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate a patient's adherence to doxycycline for chlamydial infections after discharge from the Emergency Department (ED).

Methods

This was an IRB-approved, single-center, retrospective cohort study evaluating the adherence to doxycycline for Chlamydia trachomatis infections. Patients who received treatment and were discharged from the ED with a doxycycline e-prescription between May 2021 and September 2022 were included. Patients were excluded if < 18 years of age, pregnant, a sexual assault victim, or admitted inpatient. The primary endpoint was the incidence of doxycycline prescription pick-up after discharge from the ED. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of repeat ED visits for the same chief complaint within 28 days. Descriptive statistics were computed for all study variables and Fisher's Exact tests were used to assess the outcomes.

Results

A review of 144 patients who tested positive for chlamydia and were discharged from the ED with an e-prescription for doxycycline revealed that 18% of patients did not pick up their prescription (N = 26). Non-adherent patients were more likely to return to the ED with the same chief complaint within 28 days (23.1% vs 7.6%, OR 3.6 [1.2–11.3], p = 0.026). No differences were detected in baseline demographics, housing status, insurance type, sexual orientation, or Sexually Transmitted Infection history.

Conclusion

For patients with a positive chlamydia infection who were discharged from the ED on doxycycline, an 18% non-adherence rate was found and a 3.6-fold higher likelihood of returning to the ED with the same chief complaint if the prescription was not picked up.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^865c5e43]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis — Efficacy across sites and regimen selection indicate superior rectal cure with doxycycline versus azithromycin and outline site-specific and dosing considerations: in men who have sex with men (MSM), microbiologic cure was 100% with doxycycline and 74% with azithromycin; among women with urogenital infection, anorectal detection is reported in 33%–83%. Routine oropharyngeal screening is not recommended; if identified from an oropharyngeal specimen among persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea, it should be treated, and limited evidence indicates doxycycline might be more efficacious than azithromycin for oropharyngeal chlamydia. Doxycycline is efficacious for urogenital, rectal, and oropharyngeal sites, and a delayed-release 200-mg tablet once daily for 7 days is as effective as 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for urogenital infection with lower gastrointestinal side effects. Levofloxacin is an effective alternative but more expensive, erythromycin is no longer recommended because of gastrointestinal side effects, and when nonadherence to doxycycline is a substantial concern, azithromycin 1 g is an alternative that might require posttreatment evaluation and testing because of lower rectal efficacy.

### Efficacy of a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention vs standard of care for female adolescents and young adults with pelvic inflammatory disease: a randomized clinical trial [^bb69bb26]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Study Procedures

At baseline, participants completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview and were randomized to intervention and standard of care control groups based on a computer-generated block randomization sequence that was generated by the study's data analyst (S.C.) and sealed in an envelope until sequential enrollment. Although PID is a polymicrobial illness, the hallmark of assessment and treatment of patients is based on the effective treatment of N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis as commonly known pathogens. All participants provided self- or practitioner-collected vaginal swabs to test for STIs, including N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis infections, and received a full course of medications per the CDC STI treatment guidelines, that were dispensed through their practitioner with routine discharge instructions. All patients received a single intramuscular injection of 250 mg of ceftriaxone per their routine clinical care and received twenty-eight 100-mg doxycycline tablets to take 1 tablet orally twice daily for 14 days. Other medications were available when practitioners requested them (eg, 500 mg of metronidazole twice daily for 14 days) to dispense at discharge with doxycycline. All participants were provided with standard discharge instructions per institutional PID treatment guidelines, and control participants were asked to arrange a 72-hour visit with their primary care practitioner or with the Title X program offered through the institutional adolescent and young adult clinic.

Members of the work group provided names of potential reviewers, aiming for diversity of backgrounds and regions in the United States and expertise in infectious diseases, STI and HIV prevention, antimicrobial resistance, and therapeutics. Peer reviewers reviewed draft recommendations, responded to five specific questions, and provided additional comments. Reviewers disclosed any potential conflicts of interest and conflicts, if present, were resolved. The document was posted on October 2, 2023, for 45 days on the federal registry for public comment. Comments from peer reviewers and the public were addressed and the document revised as appropriate. Evidence and feedback were reviewed by the work group, and final recommendations were developed by CDC staff.

In this report, the terms MSM and TGW who have sex with men are used as they were defined by the studies conferring the evidence base for this guidance. However, the language to describe the populations of focus in this guidance conflates both gender identity, sexual orientation, and sexual behavior that might be separate and distinct for certain persons. In addition, the likelihood of infection with a bacterial STI is related to both behavior and the sexual networks within which the behavior occurs.

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^dfe6686b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Exchanging Doxycycline for Other Antimalarials

There is very limited information on the best regimen for changing from doxycycline to other antimalarials, and recommendations for doing so are based on considering several issues such as drug-drug interactions, half-life differences, and differences in mechanism of action. If changing between atovaquone/proguanil and doxycycline, note that the current atovaquone-proguanil label lists a pharmacokinetic interaction of "concomitant treatment (of P. falciparum malaria) with tetracycline (with atovaquone) has been associated with approximately a 40% reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone", however, there are no accessible published studies that support this. On the contrary, early in vitro studies of atovaquone plus doxycycline and atovaquone plus tetracycline showed potentiation between the two drugs, which was later confirmed in clinical studies by improved cure rates when compared with atovaquone alone.–Therefore, if changing from doxcycyline to atovaquone/proguanil for malaria treatment or prophylaxis, doxycycline can be stopped and atovaquone/proguanil started at the same time. However, the recommended length of the post-trip course of prophylactic medications may change because the drugs target different stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends that the atovaquone/proguanil is continued for up to 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area depending on when the change was made. If changing from atovaquone/proguanil to doxycycline at any time, a full prophylactic course of doxycycline should be taken (for the duration of the stay and 4 weeks after departure). Changing from doxycycline to other antimalarials such as chloroquine or mefloquine will be impacted by the difference in half-lives of these medications. Doxycycline's half-life of 15–25 hours is much shorter than that of chloroquine (6–60 days) and mefloquine (2–3 weeks). A change from doxycycline to chloroquine or mefloquine before travel would still require that chloroquine and mefloquine are taken 1 and 2 weeks before exposure, respectively, to attain effective blood concentrations before travel. It is not recommended to change from doxycycline to chloroquine or mefloquine during or after travel because effective blood concentrations will not be achieved for a few weeks, leaving the traveler unprotected during this time.

### Antibiotic prescribing guideline recommendations in COVID-19: a systematic survey [^38ff81cf]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The methodology follows recommendations from the methodological guide for systematic reviews of clinical practice guidelines by Johnston et al. The protocol was registered on Open Science Framework (OSF):

Eligibility

Guidelines providing explicit recommendations regarding antibacterial use for prevention or management of infection related to COVID-19 from any jurisdiction, in any language, were eligible for inclusion.

Data source

We searched the eCOVID-19 living map of recommendations (RecMap) for eligible guidelines. COVID-19 RecMap aggregates globally published clinical, public health, and health policy guidelines to support contextualised decision making.

Search strategy

COVID-19 RecMap was searched using the terms 'antibiotic', 'antibacterial', 'antimicrobial', and 'anti-infective' as well as additional search for specific antibacterial agents (i.e. azithromycin, doxycycline) that may be have been prescribed for patients with COVID-19. Searches were performed from August 24 2022 to November 15 2022.

Guideline selection process

Screening was performed by two independent reviewers (BL and VL) to assess guidelines for eligibility. The full-text and any supplementary/accompanying material for each search result was screened by each reviewer.

Data collection process

One independent reviewer (BL) extracted data from eligible guidelines which was checked independently by a second reviewer (VL). A spreadsheet was used for data extraction which was piloted and refined based on initial extraction of eligible guidelines. Data extracted included guideline name, date, location, organisation, panel composition, patient population, and aspect of antibiotic prescribing addressed. Aspects of antibiotic prescribing included a) antibiotic initiation (e.g. empiric use of antibiotics, diagnostic recommendations, timeliness of initiation), b) antibiotic selection (e.g. empiric choice of agent based on local resistance rates or targeted based on culture and susceptibility results, use of institutional or local protocols to support, and c) duration of therapy (e.g. fixed duration of therapy or tailored to diagnostic and microbiological findings).

Outcome

We evaluated whether guidelines incorporated at least one element of antimicrobial stewardship, defined as either a) statement regarding careful/judicious antibiotic use, b) statement regarding risk of contributing to antimicrobial resistance, and/or c) statement on adverse effects associated with antibiotic use.

### Vomiting and risk of endotracheal intubation related to preoperative doxycycline use for dilation and evacuation [^40497b2d]. Contraception (2022). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with a second trimester (14 0/7 to 23 6/7 weeks gestation) D&E procedure at the University of California, Davis Medical Center (UCDMC) between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020. The University of California, Davis Institutional Review Board classified this study as exempt. We identified patients in the electronic medical record using a billing records query for Current Procedural Terminology code 59841.

All patients analyzed in this study attended a scheduled preoperative outpatient visit the day before surgery, during which history, procedure description and consent, preoperative and postoperative expectations and precautions, contraception counseling, and osmotic cervical dilator insertion were completed. At UCDMC, the standard of care at this preoperative visit is to prescribe patients four tablets of doxycycline 100 mg for antibiotic prophylaxis, with instructions to take 2 tablets (200 mg) orally with food the evening before surgery, as well as ibuprofen and oxycodone as needed for pain control with cervical dilators. When patients arrive on the day of surgery, the surgical team assesses antibiotic intake and vomiting. Those who did not take their antibiotic as prescribed or who reported vomiting within 30 minutes of taking doxycycline routinely receive intravenous doxycycline 100 mg prior to entering the operating room. Patients with vomiting more than 30 minutes after taking doxycycline do not receive additional antibiotic prophylaxis. Postoperatively, we instruct patients to take the remaining 200 mg oral doxycycline with their first meal after their procedure. For patients at 20 weeks gestation or greater, we also prescribe methergine for bleeding prophylaxis for 48 hours. All patients receive postoperative paperwork with these dosing instructions along with return precautions, recovery expectations and medication risks.

Bacillary angiomatosis and cat scratch disease — antibiotic therapy and dosing are specified as follows: Azithromycin is recommended for cat scratch disease according to the following dosing protocol, with patients > 45 kg receiving 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg for 4 additional days and patients < 45 kg receiving 10 mg/kg on day 1 and 5 mg/kg for 4 more days (strong, moderate). For bacillary angiomatosis, erythromycin 500 mg qid or doxycycline 100 mg bid for 2 weeks to 2 months is recommended (strong, moderate), with evidence noting that cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis therapy has not been systematically examined, either erythromycin (500 mg qid) or doxycycline (100 mg bid) appears effective, the duration of initial therapy should be for 2 weeks to 2 months, relapse may warrant prolonged therapy (months) until immunocompetence returns, and HIV-infected patients may require lifelong treatment; trial data report a single, double-blind placebo-controlled study of 29 patients, 14 of whom received azithromycin, in which lymph node size regressed by 80% at 30 days more commonly in the azithromycin-treated patients (P = 0.02).

### Challenges in treating, including rectal infections: is It time to Go back to doxycycline? [^ec3596f8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate recent publications on efficacy of single-dose azithromycin and 7-day doxycycline when treating Chlamydia trachomatis.

Data Sources

A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane library was conducted (1990 to June 13, 2021) using the terms: Chlamydia trachomatis, genital chlamydia, rectal chlamydia, extragenital chlamydia, azithromycin, doxycycline, and treatment guidelines. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify ongoing trials.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English language studies, including controlled studies, retrospective analyses, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and case reports, reporting microbiological or clinical outcomes in adolescents and adults were considered.

Data Synthesis

Systemic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials reported azithromycin efficacy of 96% to 97% in genital chlamydia. However, reports of treatment failure have emerged, especially among symptomatic males, with an increased risk of microbiological failure after azithromycin than doxycycline (relative risk = 2.45; 95% CI = 1.36–4.41). Retrospective analyses and prospective observational cohort studies reported lower efficacy range following azithromycin than doxycycline (74%-87% vs 92%-100%, respectively) in rectal chlamydia. First randomized controlled trial comparing azithromycin and doxycycline reported significantly higher microbiological cure following doxycycline, with absolute difference of 26% (95% CI = 16%-36%; P < 0.001). The proposed 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention treatment guidelines designate doxycycline as the preferred agent for treatment at any site.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

A growing body of evidence for treatment failure following azithromycin, especially in rectal chlamydia supports updating current practice.

Conclusions

Doxycycline continues to achieve high efficacy in genital and rectal chlamydia. Clinicians should consider efficacy with convenience of dosing regimen, medication compliance, and sexual behavior risks when treating chlamydia infections.

### Single-dose cefixime 800 mg plus doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days compared with single-dose ceftriaxone 1 g plus single-dose azithromycin 2 g for treatment of urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal gonorrhoea: a randomised clinical trial [^8452c9e9]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a single dose of oral cefixime 800 mg plus oral doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days, compared with a recommended single dose of ceftriaxone plus single dose of oral azithromycin, for treatment of uncomplicated urogenital, rectal, or pharyngeal gonorrhoea.

Methods

A noninferiority, open-label, multicentre randomized controlled trial was conducted in Prague, Czech Republic. Some 161 patients, 18–65 years of age diagnosed with uncomplicated urogenital, rectal, or pharyngeal gonorrhoea by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were randomized to treatment with single dose of cefixime 800 mg plus doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 1 week or a single dose of ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscularly plus single dose of azithromycin 2 g. The primary outcome was the number of participants with negative culture and NAAT at 1 week and 3 weeks, respectively, after treatment initiation.

Results

In all, 161 patients were randomized and 152 were included in per-protocol analyses. All 76 (100%; 95% CI, 0.95–1.00) patients treated with ceftriaxone plus azithromycin achieved negative cultures and NAAT after treatment. In the cefixime plus doxycycline arm at week 1, culture was negative in all 76 (100%) patients; at week 3, culture was negative in 70 of the 76 patients (92%; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97) and NAAT negative in 66 of the 76 patients (87%; 95% CI, 0.77–0.94). At week 3, culture and NAAT were negative in 65 of the 76 patients (86%; 95% CI, 0.76–0.93). Per-protocol risk difference was 14.5%; 95% CI, 6.56–22.38. All treatment failures observed in the cefixime arm were pharyngeal gonorrhoea cases.

Discussion

The combination of cefixime and doxycycline did not achieve noninferiority to ceftriaxone and azithromycin for treatment of gonorrhoea when including pharyngeal gonorrhoea. It did, however, show high efficacy for urogenital and rectal gonorrhoea.

### Impact of doxycycline discharge kits on appropriate treatment of sexually transmitted infections among patients in the ED [^b14c9186]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chlamydia trachomatis is the most prevalent, reportable sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States. In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated treatment recommendations from a single azithromycin 1000 mg dose to doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for seven days for the treatment of chlamydia infections. In response to changes in treatment recommendations and addressing patient barriers to treatment, pharmacists at an urban, academic medical center collaborated with the state health department to create doxycycline kits dispensed upon emergency department (ED) discharge.

Objective

To evaluate if ED doxycycline discharge kits improve appropriate and timely treatment of chlamydia.

Methods

This was a single center, retrospective, chart review study of adult patients with a positive chlamydia test while seen in the ED between September 1, 2021 and September 30, 2023. Patients with a listed allergy to doxycycline and those who were incarcerated and/or pregnant were excluded. The primary outcome was appropriate, guideline recommended chlamydia treatment before and after doxycycline discharge kit implementation. Secondary outcomes included rate of ED return visits within 90 days for STI-related complaints, time to treatment in those who received a prescription for doxycycline versus doxycycline kit, and rate of doxycycline initiation via emergency medicine (EM) pharmacist culture call-back list.

Results

A total of 170 patients were enrolled in the study, 72 patients in the pre-kit group and 98 patients in the post-kit group. Significantly more patients received appropriate treatment in the post kit group (pre-kit (45.8%) vs post-kit (69.1%); CI 95% 2.63 (1.4–5.0); p = 0.002). Time to definitive treatment was significantly shorter in the post-kit group (22.7 h pre-kit vs 1.3 h post-kit; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Doxycycline discharge kits significantly increased guideline-directed treatment and decreased time-to-treatment for chlamydia in the ED population at an urban academic medical center.

### Adherence to hygiene protocols and doxycycline therapy in ameliorating lymphatic filariasis morbidity in an endemic area post-interruption of disease transmission in Ghana [^630800df]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Group A participants were randomized to receive either 200 mg/day DOX (DOX 200: n = 117) once daily, 100 mg/day DOX (DOX 100: n = 120) once daily, or placebo-matching DOX (n = 119; Figure 1B). Group B participants were randomized to receive either 200 mg/day DOX (DOX 200: n = 29) once daily or placebo-matching DOX (n = 29). In this paper, only the results for group A are described and discussed; the results for group B (nonconfirmatory pilot trial) will be published separately.

Treatment was directly observed (DOT), with daily tablet intake supervised by a trial clinician. Because 200-mg DOX is not recommended for patients below 50 kg in weight, participants who were randomized to receiving 200 mg/day DOX but had a body weight < 50 kg had their dose reduced to 100 mg/day; one set of tablets within a single blister bed was removed prior to their treatment for the 6-week period as previously described.

To assess the occurrence of acute attacks, follow-ups were undertaken every 2 months until 24 months after treatment onset. Major follow-ups within the study period were scheduled at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment onset to repeat the baseline procedures/measurements and assess adherence to hygiene measures and to reinforce teaching of limb care practices.

Justification for clinical trial sample size.

The trial sample size was based on the outcome from a previous study by our group, in which a progression of approximately 5% was seen in the 200 mg/day DOX group after 2 years, whereas the placebo group had a progression of about 56%. To account for additional emphasis on hygiene measures in all groups in the present trial, which was expected to reduce progression in all treatment arms, the progression for the placebo group was modestly estimated to be 25% (less than half of the over 50% observed in the previous study). The sample size was calculated based on the above assumptions with a power of 95% for the DOX 200-mg group and 81% for the DOX 100-mg group, respectively, to show superiority to the placebo group with the inclusion of 84 participants per treatment arm. A drop-out rate of 30% was estimated, leading to a final sample size of 120 participants per treatment arm and 360 participants in total.

 (doxycycline) capsules

Read this Patient Information before you start taking ORACEA and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or treatment.

What is ORACEA?

ORACEA is a tetracycline-class medicine. ORACEA is a prescription medicine used in adults to treat only pimples or bumps (papules and pustules) caused by a condition called rosacea. ORACEA does not lessen redness caused by rosacea.

ORACEA should not be used for the treatment or prevention of infections.

It is not known if ORACEA is:

effective for use for longer than 16 weeks.
safe for use longer than 9 months.
safe and effective in children. ORACEA should not be used in infants and children less than 8 years of age because it may cause stained teeth in infants and children.

Who should not take ORACEA?

Do not take ORACEA if you are allergic to doxycycline or other medicines in the tetracycline-class. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of these medicines if you are not sure.

### Management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults: evidence reviewed for the 2006 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^7d5618d2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

In April 2005, in preparation for the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted diseases (STD) treatment guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group to examine recent abstracts and published literature addressing management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults. Key questions were posed and answered on the basis of quality of evidence and expert opinion. Clinical trials continue to demonstrate equivalent efficacy and tolerability of azithromycin and doxycycline regimens, and both remain recommended as first-line therapy in nonpregnant individuals. More data and clinical experience are available to support the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of azithromycin in pregnant women, and, in the upcoming guidelines, azithromycin will be recommended as first-line therapy for such patients. Evidence is building that expedited partner therapy (EPT), with provision of treatment or a prescription, may be just as effective as or more effective than standard partner referral in ensuring partner treatment and preventing chlamydia recurrence in women. Although there are more studies needed and barriers to be addressed before its widespread use, EPT will be recommended as an option for partner management.

### Nervous system Lyme disease [^1620ce82]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Medium credibility.

Nervous system Lyme disease — comparative data show oral doxycycline has similar efficacy to parenteral regimens in neuroborreliosis, with aggregation of eight studies finding the overall response rate to doxycycline was 98.6% of that to parenteral penicillin or ceftriaxone (95% CIs 94.8% to 102.5%) and summed relative risk RR is 0.986 (95% CIs 0.948 to 1.025). In a Class II study of Lyme meningitis, doxycycline 200 mg orally daily for 14 days (n = 31) was shown to be comparable to IV penicillin 3 g every 6 hours for 14 days (n = 23), and a non-randomized comparison reported comparable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and clinical responses with ceftriaxone 2 g/day for 10 to 14 days (n = 29) and oral doxycycline 200 mg/day for 10 to 14 days (n = 36). In no study were outcomes demonstrably different whether patients received doxycycline or parenteral beta-lactam regimens; altogether, these studies provide data on 300 patients with definite neuroborreliosis treated with doxycycline, with 15 retreated for persistent symptoms and none developing late neurologic sequelae during follow-up as long as several years. Separately, a Finnish Class III series described prolonged therapy in 60 patients treated for 100 days — half receiving 2 weeks of ceftriaxone followed by oral amoxicillin and half oral cefixime for the entire period — with 29/30 patients in each group considered cured at 1 year follow-up.

### Influence of age on real-life effects of doxycycline for acute exacerbations among COPD outpatients: a population-based cohort study [^13950fb4]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and data source

We applied a retrospective inception cohort study (figure 1) using the University of Groningen's prescription database IADB.nl that contains over 1.2 million dispensings from about 600 000 patients in 60 community pharmacies in the Netherlands since 1994. IADB.nl provided complete information including date of birth, gender, prescribed drug name, anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) codes, dispensing date, quantity dispensed and dose regimen. Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and drugs dispensed during hospitalisation are not available in the database. As Dutch patients practically always register at a single community pharmacy, the patient's drug prescription history is usually complete. Data from January 1994 to December 2015 were used for this study, which was conducted and reported according to checklists of Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines (online supplementary material).

Figure 1
Retrospective cohort study design.

Study population

COPD outpatients with first recorded AECOPD were included in this study. We selected eligible patients according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) presence of COPD identified based on at least two COPD-related drug prescriptions (online supplementary table S1) within 1 year before index date. The date of first recorded AECOPD during the study period was set as index date. (2) The experience of the first recorded AECOPD, which was defined by the prescription of high dose prednisone (ATC-code H02AB07) or prednisolone (H02AB06) short courses (a daily dose of 40 mg for 5 days or a daily dose of 30 mg for 7 days with maximum extension of 14 days) according to treatment guidelines.(3) Registration in the IADB.nl for at least 2 years before and 1 year after the index date. (4) Receipt of doxycycline or either received any antibiotics 3 days before till 7 days after the index date. Furthermore, we excluded patients who met the following exclusion criteria: (1) Receipt of another antibiotic treatment than doxycycline 3 days before till 7 days after the index date. (2) Age under 55 years, to reduce the chance of including possible asthma patients. Age was calculated using the difference between index date and birth date. (3) Presence of potential immunocompromised diseases, which were defined by the prescription of antiviral drugs for HIV infection, immunosuppressant drugs or antineoplastic agents within 1 year before index date and 1 month after index date.

Alternative Parenteral Regimens

Only limited data are available to support using other parenteral second- or third- generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftizoxime or cefotaxime). Because these cephalosporins are less active than cefotetan or cefoxitin against anaerobic bacteria, the addition of metronidazole should be considered.

Ampicillin-sulbactam plus doxycycline has been investigated in at least one clinical trial and has broad-spectrum coverage. Ampicillin-sulbactam plus doxycycline is effective against C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and anaerobes for women with tubo-ovarian abscess. Another trial demonstrated short-term clinical cure rates with azithromycin monotherapy or combined with metronidazole.

When using the clindamycin and gentamicin alternative parenteral regimen, women with clinical improvement after 24–28 hours can be transitioned to clindamycin (450 mg orally 4 times/day) or doxycycline (100 mg orally 2 times/day) to complete the 14-day therapy. However, when tubo-ovarian abscess is present, clindamycin (450 mg orally 4 times/day) or metronidazole (500 mg orally 2 times/day) should be used to complete 14 days of therapy with oral doxycycline to provide more effective anaerobic coverage.

Alternative Parenteral Regimens
Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours
plus
Gentamicin loading dose IV or IM (2 mg/kg body weight), followed by a maintenance dose (1.5 mg/kg body weight) every 8 hours; single daily dosing (3–5 mg/kg body weight) can be substituted
