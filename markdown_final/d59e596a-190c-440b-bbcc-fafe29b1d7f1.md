## Question

What is the cause of skin lesions associated with epilepsy mostly located on trunk and are very nodular

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which neurocutaneous disorder most plausibly explains nodular skin lesions on the trunk in a patient with epilepsy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which syndromes classically combine cutaneous and neurologic features, especially epilepsy. Then, I should verify which of those syndromes typically produces nodular or hamartomatous skin lesions on the trunk. Next, I will review the diagnostic criteria and key cutaneous clues that separate look-alikes. After that, I should consider important differentials that could mimic this presentation. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline practical next steps for confirmation and management, anchoring to consensus guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical frame: epilepsy plus cutaneous nodules on the trunk strongly suggests a neurocutaneous phakomatosis, with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) topping the list, and TSC historically linked to the triad of seizures, intellectual disability, and facial angiofibromas, although the full triad is present in only a minority of patients [^115cWiDL] [^113R9Nbv].

> I will now examine which cutaneous lesions in TSC are nodular and favor the trunk. Wait, let me verify the distribution of shagreen patches and collagenomas: they are connective tissue nevi that often present on the dorsal trunk, particularly the lower back, and can be single or multiple, with variable sizes, which matches a nodular or plaque-like appearance on the trunk and aligns with the described phenotype [^115ipqdr] [^1112zcLv]. Hold on, I should also check for other nodular TSC lesions that could be on the trunk: ungual fibromas are periungual nodules, and fibrous cephalic plaques are forehead/scalp variants of angiofibromas; while not exclusively trunk, they reinforce the propensity for hamartomatous nodular lesions in TSC and support the broader pattern recognition [^112LkaAs] [^115nbrRq].

> Next, I should review the neurologic correlation. TSC has a very high prevalence of epilepsy, often beginning in infancy, with cortical tubers and subependymal nodules as the substrate for seizures; this mechanistic brain–skin link strengthens the likelihood that trunk nodular lesions in an epileptic patient reflect TSC rather than a purely cutaneous disorder [^113kdyNH]. Let me double-check the diagnostic weight of cutaneous features: in the updated international criteria, facial angiofibromas, hypomelanotic macules, shagreen patch, and ungual fibromas are major features, and a pathogenic TSC1/TSC2 variant is itself diagnostic, so nodular trunk lesions compatible with shagreen/collagenoma in the setting of epilepsy would materially advance the case toward definite TSC if accompanied by even one other major feature or by genetic confirmation [^114MbHTM] [^1122dZ1T].

> But wait, what if this is neurofibromatosis 1 instead? NF1 can produce nodular neurofibromas on the trunk and is a neurocutaneous disorder. However, NF1's cutaneous signature is more typically café-au-lait macules and axillary/inguinal freckling rather than the orange-peel textured shagreen patch, and NF1 is less consistently tied to early-onset epilepsy as a defining feature compared with TSC, which tempers its likelihood here given the nodular trunk emphasis and the seizure history [^113R9Nbv] [^113kdyNH]. I should confirm that the absence of classic NF1 stigmata would further lower its probability in this scenario [^113R9Nbv].

> I need to ensure I consider infectious mimics that can produce subcutaneous nodules with seizures. Cysticercosis can cause both epilepsy and subcutaneous nodules, but the epidemiology and lesion distribution differ from TSC's hamartomatous trunk lesions; nonetheless, in the right geographic context, I should keep it in mind and correlate with exposure risk and imaging rather than assuming a genetic phakomatosis outright [^116sazPy] [^114wrkQ8]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the nodularity and trunk predilection still fit TSC's connective tissue nevi better than cysticercosis in most settings, but a careful exposure history and, if indicated, serology or imaging would help exclude it [^116sazPy].

> Let me synthesize the most likely diagnosis. Given the combination of epilepsy and nodular lesions on the trunk, the best-fitting entity is tuberous sclerosis complex, with the trunk nodules most consistent with shagreen patches or collagenomas, which are major diagnostic features in TSC and frequently localize to the dorsal trunk, while TSC's strong association with epilepsy provides the necessary neurologic correlation [^115ipqdr] [^113kdyNH] [^114MbHTM]. I should confirm that this conclusion remains contingent on documenting at least one additional major feature or a pathogenic TSC1/TSC2 variant to meet definite diagnostic criteria, but the clinical pattern is highly suggestive and warrants targeted evaluation [^114MbHTM] [^1122dZ1T].

> Next, I should review practical confirmation steps. I will now examine the skin carefully for other TSC features such as hypomelanotic macules (ash-leaf or confetti), facial angiofibromas, ungual fibromas, and dental enamel pits, and I should use Wood's lamp if needed to reveal subtle hypopigmented lesions. Concurrently, I should order brain MRI to assess for cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, and SEGA, and arrange genetic testing for TSC1/TSC2, as a pathogenic variant is independently diagnostic and informs counseling and surveillance [^114BDtrc] [^114MbHTM] [^112LkaAs]. Hold on, I should verify that early-life features like cardiac rhabdomyoma or infantile spasms, if present, would further support the diagnosis and guide anticipatory management, including early consideration of vigabatrin when infantile spasms are suspected in TSC [^112FtQ9j] [^1147HjhP].

> Finally, I need to outline management implications once TSC is confirmed. Annual dermatologic surveillance and lesion-directed therapy for symptomatic or disfiguring skin lesions are recommended, with options including surgical excision, laser, or topical mTOR inhibitors for angiofibromas and other TSC-related cutaneous lesions. Systemic mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus or sirolimus are indicated for internal manifestations like SEGA or renal angiomyolipoma and can also improve cutaneous disease, so coordination with neurology, nephrology, pulmonology, and dermatology is essential for comprehensive care [^111itfNW] [^112LkaAs] [^114MbHTM]. Let me reconsider the role of topical therapy: topical sirolimus has growing evidence for facial angiofibromas and may be appropriate for selected cutaneous lesions, but systemic therapy should be reserved for patients with internal disease warranting it, balancing benefits and wound-healing risks [^1144Db56] [^117GFEjX].

> In summary, the most likely cause of nodular trunk skin lesions in a patient with epilepsy is tuberous sclerosis complex, with the nodules representing shagreen patches or collagenomas. This neurocutaneous diagnosis fits the skin findings, the seizure disorder, and the known diagnostic criteria, and it should be confirmed with a structured skin and systemic evaluation, brain MRI, and TSC1/TSC2 genetic testing to enable early, guideline-concordant surveillance and therapy [^115ipqdr] [^114MbHTM] [^114BDtrc].

The most likely cause of nodular skin lesions on the trunk in patients with epilepsy is **tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)** [^notfound], a genetic disorder characterized by hamartomas in multiple organs, including the skin and brain [^114MbHTM]. The nodular lesions are typically **angiofibromas** (facial), **shagreen patches** (lower back/flank), or **ungual fibromas** [^112LkaAs], and are often accompanied by seizures and cognitive impairment [^113kdyNH]. TSC is caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, leading to mTOR pathway dysregulation and abnormal cell growth [^113CvqyL]. Other neurocutaneous disorders (e.g. neurofibromatosis, Sturge-Weber) and infectious or inflammatory causes are less likely based on the described lesion morphology and distribution [^113R9Nbv] [^114wrkQ8].

---

## Clinical features of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)

TSC is an autosomal dominant disorder with multisystem involvement, including the skin, brain, kidneys, heart, and lungs [^114MbHTM]. The **classic triad** includes seizures, intellectual disability, and facial angiofibromas, though not all patients exhibit all three features [^115cWiDL].

---

### Cutaneous manifestations of TSC

Cutaneous lesions are among the most common and recognizable features of TSC, often providing the initial clue to diagnosis [^112LkaAs]. The **nodular lesions** on the trunk are typically one of the following:

- **Angiofibromas**: Small, reddish-brown papules, often on the face, but can occur on the trunk. They are composed of fibrous and vascular tissue [^115nbrRq].

- **Shagreen patches**: Firm, flesh-colored plaques with an orange-peel texture, commonly located on the lower back or flank. Histologically, they are connective tissue nevi [^115ipqdr].

- **Ungual fibromas**: Periungual fibromas, typically appearing in adolescence or adulthood, are nodular lesions around the nails [^1122dZ1T].

---

### Neurological manifestations of TSC

TSC is strongly associated with epilepsy, which is often refractory and may present in infancy as infantile spasms [^114MbHTM]. Seizures are linked to cortical tubers and subependymal nodules in the brain [^113kdyNH].

---

## Pathophysiology of TSC-related skin lesions

TSC results from mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively [^113CvqyL]. These proteins regulate the **mTOR pathway**, which controls cell growth and proliferation [^114MbHTM]. Mutations cause mTOR dysregulation, leading to abnormal cell growth and hamartoma formation in multiple organs, including the skin [^112P9rxq].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While TSC is the most likely cause of nodular skin lesions on the trunk in patients with epilepsy, other neurocutaneous disorders and conditions should be considered:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Differentiating features** |
|-|-|-|
| Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) | Café-au-lait macules, neurofibromas, Lisch nodules | - Autosomal dominant <br/> - Caused by NF1 gene mutations [^notfound] |
| Sturge-Weber syndrome | Facial port-wine stain, seizures, hemiparesis | - Vascular malformation <br/> - No nodular skin lesions [^notfound] |
| Cysticercosis | Subcutaneous nodules, seizures | - Infectious <br/> - Travel history <br/> - Serology [^notfound] |
| Rheumatoid nodules | Subcutaneous nodules, arthritis | - Associated with rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - No epilepsy [^114dUujP] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis of TSC is based on clinical criteria, genetic testing, and imaging studies [^112LkaAs] [^114BDtrc]. The **diagnostic criteria** include major and minor features, with cutaneous lesions comprising several major features [^1122dZ1T]. Genetic testing for TSC1 and TSC2 mutations confirms the diagnosis and aids genetic counseling [^112LkaAs] [^113k6NYB]. Brain MRI identifies cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) associated with TSC [^114BDtrc].

---

## Management

Management of TSC-related skin lesions includes **surgical excision**, laser therapy, and topical mTOR inhibitors [^111itfNW]. Systemic mTOR inhibitors (e.g. everolimus) are effective for treating multiple TSC manifestations, including skin lesions, SEGAs, and renal angiomyolipomas [^117GFEjX]. Regular surveillance and **multidisciplinary care** are essential for optimal outcomes [^113k6NYB].

---

The most likely cause of nodular skin lesions on the trunk in patients with epilepsy is **tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)** [^notfound], characterized by hamartomatous lesions of the skin and brain, often presenting with seizures and cognitive impairment [^114MbHTM].

Case

A 63-year-old white man presented to the clinic for evaluation and management of multiple skin tags that first presented in childhood. Physical examination revealed a grouped collection of soft, nontender, pedunculated, skin-colored papules overlying the patient's left scapula (Figs 1 and 2). Although the patient initially denied any personal or family history of dermatologic disease, specific questioning revealed his siblings had similar findings to various degrees. Two shave biopsies (Fig 3) were performed to confirm the diagnosis. Referrals to a geneticist and ophthalmologist were offered but deferred by the patient because he had no plans to conceive and no active visual complaints.

Question 1: What other finding would you expect on examination and history taking in this patient?
A. Shagreen patches
B. Hemangioblastomas
C. Pectus excavatum
D. Café au lait macules
E. Ash-leaf spots

Answers:
A. Shagreen patches — Incorrect. Shagreen patches are commonly observed with tuberous sclerosis complex.
B. Hemangioblastomas — Incorrect. Hemangioblastomas are most commonly observed with Von Hippel Lindau.
C. Pectus excavatum — Incorrect. Pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum can be observed in Legius syndrome, also known as NF1-like syndrome.
D. Café au lait macules — Correct. Café au lait macules, Lisch nodules, and axillary freckling are other commonly observed cutaneous manifestations of segmental neurofibromatosis. The patient did not exhibit any other manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1, including other eruptions of neurofibromas, axillary or groin freckling, or café-au-lait macules. Although the patient did decline a referral to ophthalmology, which may have recognized Lisch nodules, none were observed on our physical examination.
E. Ash-leaf spots — Incorrect. Ash-leaf spots are commonly observed with tuberous sclerosis complex, associated with mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes.

### Linear basal cell carcinoma of the lower eyelid: reconstruction with a musculocutaneous transposition flap [^116inBU1]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

LBCC is objectively described as a basal cell carcinoma that extends in one direction, with a length-to-width ratio of approximately 3:1. Periocular skin, especially the lower eyelid, is the most common location, followed by the neck. However, cases on the trunk, inguinal crease, lower face, and preauricular region have been reported. Regarding its histologic features, the nodular pattern is the most prevalent, although about 32% of cases are described as belonging to the infiltrative and morpheaform subtypes. Therefore, this entity could be considered a potentially aggressive variant of basal cell carcinoma.

Trauma and Koebner phenomenon are suggested as etiologic factors, and the association of LBCC with previous surgical procedures or radiotherapy has been reported. Nevertheless, in most patients, the trigger that explains these lesions remains undetermined.

### Tuberous sclerosis complex [^111vBFLC]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal-dominant, neurocutaneous, multisystem disorder characterized by cellular hyperplasia and tissue dysplasia. The genetic cause is mutations in the TSC1 gene, found on chromosome 9q34, and TSC2 gene, found on chromosome 16p13. The clinical phenotypes resulting from mutations in either of the 2 genes are variable in each individual. Herein, advances in the understanding of molecular mechanisms in tuberous sclerosis complex are reviewed, and current guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and management are summarized.

### Selective suppression of excessive gluN2C expression rescues early epilepsy in a tuberous sclerosis murine model [^111rRN6p]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant disease affecting multiple organ systems (brain, skin, kidney, heart and lung) and caused by germline mutations in one of the tumour suppressor genes, TSC1 or TSC2. Inactivation of either of these genes leads to hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and promotes neuropathological abnormalities associated with TSC. The most devastating clinical and pathological expressions of TSC involves the central nervous system, and includes malformative brain lesions, the cortical tubers, epilepsy, autism, cognitive impairment and glial tumours. Epilepsy begins in infancy and is difficult to treat with 85–90% patients remaining with pharmacoresistant seizures.

The molecular mechanisms governing epileptogenesis in TSC and the contribution of tuber formation have been intensively studied during the last decade and were subjects of intensive debates. Recent evidence indicates that gliomas are formed by biallelic TSC1 or TSC2 gene inactivation, reflecting a double-hit mechanism according to which a germline or a somatic mutation (likely occurring during development) affects the non-mutated allele, producing 'loss of heterozygosity'. However, loss of heterozygosity at either TSC gene is a rare event in tubers in human, and although it may affect selected population of giant cells within cortical tubers, most of the cells in whole tuber sections have heterozygote mutations.

### Emerging treatments in the management of tuberous sclerosis complex [^116K8TYm]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of nonmalignant hamartomas in the brain, heart, skin, kidney, lung, and other organs. It is associated with autism, epilepsy, and other neurocognitive and behavioral disabilities. Wide phenotypic variation occurs in disease severity and natural course: some patients demonstrate minimal effects, e.g., skin changes; others manifest profound seizures and mental retardation. Tuberous sclerosis complex is caused by mutations in either the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 or 2 gene (coding for hamartin and tuberin, respectively). The tuberous sclerosis complex 1/tuberous sclerosis complex 2 protein dimer complex is a crucial inhibitory element in the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, regulating cell growth and proliferation. Until recently, few options existed, other than surgery, for treating symptoms of tuberous sclerosis complex related to the growth of hamartomas. Increased understanding of the genetic cause of the disease and underlying dysregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway has led to clinical trials of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, including sirolimus and everolimus. This review gives an overview of tuberous sclerosis complex and its molecular causes, and summarizes results from recent clinical trials of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors in patients with the disease.

### Multiple fibrofolliculomas within a fibrous cephalic plaque in a patient with tuberous sclerosis [^113L3KYv]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 52-year-old African American man with a long-standing diagnosis of TSC presented to our clinic for evaluation of his facial lesions (referred by his neurologist who encouraged him to follow-up with specialists for establishment of care for his TSC). A physical exam revealed multiple firm brown dome-shaped papules on the cheeks, nose, and chin, as well as several skin-colored papules and plaques on the forehead and right cheek (Fig 1). The patient also had numerous hypopigmented macules on the thighs. The largest skin-colored nodule on the right cheek was removed by shave biopsy. Two brown dome-shaped papules on the nose and one small skin-colored papule from the central forehead were also removed by shave biopsy. Histopathology of the nodule (Fig 1, B) showed multiple foci of thin epithelial strands radiating from the upper part of the isthmus, surrounded by compact thin collagen fibers containing fibroblasts that stain for CD34 (cluster of differentiation 34), consistent with multiple fibrofolliculomas (Fig 2). An elastic stain revealed an absence of elastic fibers in the stroma surrounding the epithelial strands within the fibrofolliculomas (Fig 3, A). Within the stroma between the fibrofolliculomas, the elastic fibers were irregularly distributed with a decrease in amount in some areas (Fig 3, B). Histopathology of the specimens corresponding to the 2 brown papules from the nose showed increased capillary-sized vessels and fibrosis with stellate fibrocytes consistent with AF. The histopathology of the small skin-colored papule on the forehead showed a solitary fibrofolliculoma (Fig 4). Our patient met clinical criteria for TSC based on imaging studies demonstrating bilateral subependymal nodules, cortical tubers, a renal angiomyolipoma, multiple renal cysts, and the presence of multiple AF and confetti skin lesions.

### Intractable epilepsy in hemimegalencephaly and tuberous sclerosis complex [^115LP5Rs]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Hemimegalencephaly is a rare brain malformation consisting of the enlargement of 1 hemisphere, often associated with abnormal cortical gyration, thick cortex, large neurons, and increased astrocytes. Cranial asymmetry is the first clinical sign usually present at birth; in the most severe cases, hemimegalencephaly may be evident during pregnancy. Hemiparesis, intractable epilepsy, and developmental delay are the typical clinical manifestations. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting about 1 in 6000 live births; the number of spontaneous mutations is remarkable. It is characterized by the development of hamartias, or nongrowing lesions, and hamartomas, which grow as benign tumors and rarely progress to malignancy. These lesions most frequently involve the brain, skin, kidneys, eyes, and heart. The rare association of hemimegalencephaly and tuberous sclerosis complex has been reported in a few cases. The authors report the case of a 4-year-old boy with left hemimegalencephaly, tuberous sclerosis complex genetically confirmed, and intractable epilepsy originating from the nonhemimegalencephalic hemisphere.

### Everolimus (Afinitor) [^111u6wNg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma

A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-2, NCT00790400) of AFINITOR was conducted in 118 patients with renal angiomyolipoma as a feature of TSC (n = 113) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n = 5). The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of ≥ 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age ≥ 18 years. Patients received AFINITOR 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion ≥ 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase ≥ 20%, and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of ≥ Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no).

Twenty-four children with giant congenital melanocytic nevi underwent brain MRI at 1.5 T scanner. Melanin deposits in the brain were found in seven children (29.2%) located in temporal lobes, thalamus, cerebellum, and pons. One patient showed leptomeningeal involvement. Six patients were asymptomatic, and one had epilepsy. As opposed to previous reports, localization of skin nevi on anterior part of trunk was correlated to central nervous system involvement. In all patients with brain involvement skin nevi showed picture of compound nevus with neurofibromatic component.

Phacomatoses:

These diseases (tuberous sclerosis and Sturge-Weber syndrome being the most important from epileptological point of view) may be easy to diagnose as they are represented by skin lesions and abnormalities of other organs, raising a strong suspicion in most cases. It is to be noted however, that e.g. in rare cases of Sturge-Weber syndrome no facial angioma is indicative of the diagnosis. Contrast administration is crucial in such cases to detect the leptomeningial angioma. The MRI protocol is otherwise the same, as hippocampal sclerosis is a possible complication.

Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) or better mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS):

The hippocampus is a part of the paleocortex and limbic system, together with the amygdala, the parahippocampal cortex, the fornix and the mammillary body. Its unique anatomy explains why specially designed sequences are required for its proper depiction. During the development of the brain, the hippocampus rotates around its long axis and finally reaches a spiral inner architecture of grey and white matter layers on its cross-section. During the rotation, the hippocampal sulcus may not completely close, leaving a pouch that can cause a DDG problem. The spiralling grey matter layers are divided into four sectors (cornu Ammonis – CA1-CA4). HS is based on the selective vulnerability of the neurons predominantly in the CA1 and CA4 sectors. The pathological consequences are atrophy, gliosis, disruption of the inner architecture, dilatation of the temporal horn, atrophy of the fornix (the bundle of white matter fibres collecting at the surface of the hippocampus, the fimbria) and of the mammillary body. The other limbic structures listed above may be involved too. The pathological changes are reflected on the images of an adequate MRI examination as hippocampal atrophy, increased signal intensity (SI) on FLAIR/T2 and decreased SI on T1 weighted images, blurring/disruption of the inner architecture, dilatation of the temporal horn, atrophy of the ipsilateral fornix and mammillary body. There are also increased diffusivity (differentiating the abnormality from post-ictal cytotoxic oedema with restricted diffusion) and MRS changes (predominantly decreased N-acetyl-aspartate). The diagnosis of HS is very important since 1. It is one of the most common causes of pharmacoresistant epilepsy; 2. Surgical removal of the abnormal hippocampus provides a great chance of a seizure-free state; 3. As part of the double pathology complex, it may continue to cause seizures after the excision of a tumour or MCD, resulting in surgical failure.

### Cutaneous manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex and the paediatrician's role [^112cv84H]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Skin lesions are frequently reported in individuals with TSC and are potentially disfiguring, painful or emotionally distressing. The advent of targeted therapy with mTOR inhibitors has proved promising for the treatment of TSC-associated skin lesions. Although topical formulations of mTOR inhibitors seem to be better tolerated than systemic therapies, adequately powered and controlled prospective studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of topical sirolimus or everolimus in various subtypes of TSC-associated skin manifestations. Oral mTOR inhibitors, approved to treat internal manifestations of TSC such as SEGAs and renal angiomyolipomas, have also been effective in cutaneous disease.

TSC is a lifelong disease in which tumours may develop in multiple organ systems over a patient's lifetime; therefore, early diagnosis is paramount. Many types of TSC-associated skin lesions can develop at birth or during early childhood, highlighting the role of the paediatrician in the diagnosis of the disease. Therefore, awareness in the paediatric community of TSC-associated skin lesions is critical to ensure that patients receive an early diagnosis and systemic workup, timely initiation of treatment strategies and appropriate referrals for follow-up care.

### Plasma cell myeloma with immature plasma cells in the skin arising within the areas of chronic stasis dermatitis [^114baf4b]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Plasma cell neoplasms of the skin can present as solitary, extraosseous lesions (plasmacytomas) or lesions secondary to PCM. The secondary lesions are typically due to a direct extension from an underlying focal bony involvement and rarely spread through the blood and lymphatics. Although most secondary cutaneous plasmacytomas occur after an established diagnosis, they may be the initial manifestation of an underlying disease. The skin and soft tissue make up 14%-30% of plasma cell neoplasms and are more associated with IgA- and IgD-producing myelomas, which is consistent with this patient's increase in the serum IgA level. The appearance and location of the lesions may vary, but they are often violaceous nodules — few in number — on the trunk. This patient's cutaneous findings, immunohistochemical studies, underlying PCM, and initial positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan ruling out skeletal lesions pointed toward a hematogenous spread of PCM.

Diagnosis of TSC

Outside of positive genetic testing confirming a pathological TSC1 or TSC2 mutation, the clinical diagnosis of TSC relies on a combination of identifiable major and minor characteristics, with cutaneous findings composing a large part of both major (hypomelanotic macules, angiofibromas, ungual fibromas, shagreen patch) and minor ('confetti' skin lesions) features (table 1). To establish a 'definite' clinical diagnosis of TSC, one must document either two major features or one major feature with two or more minor features. One can garner a 'possible' clinical diagnosis with the identification of either one major or two or more isolated minor features.

Table 1
Tuberous sclerosis complex diagnostic criteria: major and minor features

Cutaneous manifestations of TSC are readily apparent upon thorough physical examination. In addition to internal organ evaluation, a detailed dermatological examination is recommended upon diagnosis of TSC, followed by at least annual skin examinations. Patients should be advised to use sun protection as a preventive measure to minimise the appearance of some skin lesions.

### Molecular genetic aspects of the phakomatoses: tuberous sclerosis complex and neurofibromatosis 1 [^114Ta9pV]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The phakomatoses are a diverse group of diseases characterized by skin lesions in early childhood followed by the development of tumors in many other organs. Tuberous sclerosis complex and neurofibromatosis 1 are of special interest to the neurologist because of their prominent neuro-oncological and neuro-developmental consequences. The cloning of genes responsible for these two diseases has led to the identification of causative mutations, an understanding of basic cellular pathophysiology and the development of animal models. Current laboratory investigations are focused on bringing clinical relevance to these findings, including the prospects of molecular diagnostics and rational therapeutics.

Mastocytoma in children — presentation and associated findings: Mastocytoma typically presents as a brown or red nodular lesion and can show blistering; usually it presents as a single elevated brown or yellow lesion, and at initial diagnosis blistering over the lesion can be observed; a few children may present with more than 1 lesion, and upon stroking the lesion, flushing with sudden reddening of the skin and sweating may occur.

Systemic treatment with mTOR inhibitors

Rapamycin (sirolimus) and its analogues (eg, everolimus) inhibit the mTOR complex and, as a result, impede mTOR overactivation, which may shrink existing lesions and prevent tumour growth associated with TSC. Oral mTOR inhibitors have proved effective in the treatment of a range of TSC-related manifestations. Systemic mTOR inhibitor–associated adverse effects should be monitored, and commonly reported events include stomatitis, upper respiratory tract infection, wound healing complications and hypercholesterolaemia. If side effects become severe or intolerable, dose adjustments or interruptions may be necessary.

Oral sirolimus is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of pulmonary LAM associated with TSCand is being studied for the treatment of cutaneous TSC-related manifestations. A recent retrospective study showed positive long-term effects of oral sirolimus on various skin lesions in 14 women being treated for TSC LAM. Of 11 patients with baseline photographs of their skin lesions, significant improvements were observed in angiofibromas and shagreen patches (p = 0.018 and 0.039, respectively), but not in ungual fibromas (p = 0.109), after median treatment durations of 12, 10 and 6.5 months, respectively. Three patients with angiofibromas and shagreen patches were observed after treatment cessation of between 6 and 48 months; shagreen patches, but not angiofibromas, worsened after treatment discontinuation.

Oral everolimus has been evaluated in several studies of patients with SEGA, renal angiomyolipomas, LAM and epilepsy associated with TSC. Oral everolimus is approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of certain TSC-associated SEGAs and renal angiomyolipomas. The effect of oral everolimus on skin lesions was evaluated prospectively as a secondary endpoint in two pivotal phase III studies, EXIST-1 and EXIST-2. The skin lesion response rate, based on the Physician's Global Assessment, was significantly higher for everolimus than for placebo in both studies. The clinical experience gained from these trials indicates that oral everolimus is effective in improving cutaneous TSC lesions. Although thought to be effective in treating cutaneous TSC manifestations, oral mTOR inhibitors are currently reserved for patients whose internal disease warrants systemic treatment.

Treatment of TSC-associated cutaneous disorders

International TSC management guidelines recommend that any rapidly changing, disfiguring or symptomatic TSC-associated skin lesion be treated according to clinical context and type of lesion, using methods such as surgery, lasers or topical mTOR inhibitors. Determining the best approach to the treatment of cutaneous lesions also depends on clinical presentation, severity and presence of other TSC manifestations (table 2). In patients with growing SEGA, angiomyolipoma or LAM, treatment with systemic mTOR inhibitors, which address the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, might be indicated and is also likely to result in simultaneous improvement of skin lesions. However, systemic mTOR inhibitors can contribute to surgical complications and delayed wound healing; therefore, elective procedures (eg, cutaneous surgery, laser treatment) might best be avoided while on systemic therapy. In patients not receiving systemic treatment, topical mTOR inhibitors or surgical procedures may be indicated.

### Birt-hogg-dubésyndrome initially diagnosed as tuberous sclerosis complex [^114YvNBn]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHDS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a pathogenic variant of the FLCN gene. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) results from a heritable pathogenic variant of TSC1 or TSC2. Both BHDS and TSC may present with papules on the nose and cheeks; fibrofolliculomas (FFs) and trichodiscomas (TDs) are observed in BHDS, and multiple angiofibromas (AFs) are classically seen in TSC. In both disorders, skin lesions may appear in association with bilateral pulmonary cysts and renal tumors. Similarities in the most striking features of BHDS and TSC may render it challenging to distinguish the 2 disorders.

### Detailed primary localised cutaneous nodular amyloidosis clinical and pathological workup [^112CqFKW]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Primary localised cutaneous nodular amyloidosis is a rare form of amyloidosis characterised by amyloid deposition in the skin but a lack of further organ involvement; therefore, it is not a systemic disease that progresses to complication. Limited knowledge exists on the causes and outcomes of long-term cutaneous nodular amyloidosis patients. This study reports a case of a woman in her late 80s presenting with a primary cutaneous nodular amyloidosis, with yellow, white plaques and a focal area of violaceous nodules along the inferior lumbar spine. Notably, this rash has been present for nearly 40 years. Histopathological examination revealed amyloid deposits, but further examination showed no amyloid systemic involvement. Recognition of primary nodular amyloidosis through skin biopsy is essential, and current clinical recommendations are to perform pathology examinations to make the diagnosis.

### The genomic landscape of tuberous sclerosis complex [^113CvqyL]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Other major organs affected by TSC lesions are the skin, kidney, lung and heart. Skin lesions include hypomelanotic macules and facial angiofibromas that are important diagnostic features of TSC and affect nearly all TSC patients. Renal angiomyolipomas (RAs) affect more than 70% of patients and are typically benign lesions that can cause kidney dysfunction and require treatment if significantly large, abundant or susceptible to bleeding. In fact, RAs are the most common cause of mortality in adult TSC patients. Finally, heart tumours called cardiac rhabdomyomas (CRMs) are another major diagnostic feature of TSC, as they can be detected prenatally and are most common in infants.

While TSC may be inherited (familial), it is more often the result of de novo (sporadic) germline mutations in one of two tumour suppressor genes, TSC1 (encoding TSC1, also known as hamartin) and TSC2 (encoding TSC2 or tuberin). Purely heterozygous germline mutations as well as mosaic mutations have been identified in TSC patients. Along with TBC1D7, TSC1 and TSC2 form a physical complex that supports the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity of TSC2 towards the small GTPase, RHEB, a direct and positive regulator of MTOR (specifically, MTOR complex I or MTORC1). MTORC1 integrates signals from growth factors, amino acids and energy to promote cell growth, division and survival. Accordingly, loss-of-function mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 lead to constitutive MTORC1 activation that is uncoupled from upstream signalling inputs. This molecular insight led to the evaluation of MTOR inhibitors in clinical trials and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for therapeutic use in TSC patients. Despite considerable promise, MTOR inhibitors are not universally effective across the TSC population, fail to maintain tumour reduction following cessation of treatment, and may be associated with undesirable side effects. Therefore, a critical need remains to develop additional therapeutic options for TSC, including those that target tumour growth.

### Treatment of facial angiofibromas of tuberous sclerosis by shave excision and dermabrasion in a dark-skinned patient [^1138TGdx]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis is an inherited disease expressed clinically by the triad of mental retardation, seizures, and tuberous lesions. Facial angiofibromas, a common manifestation of tuberous sclerosis, can cause considerable cosmetic disfigurement, emotional distress, obstruction of vision, and hemorrhage. Treatment by shave excision, as the first step to remove the larger nodules, followed by dermabrasion, to smooth and sculpt the final surface, has been recommended as the most effective form of therapy. However, this method of treatment raises the question of risk for development of hypopigmentation in susceptible patients. The authors present their treatment of angiofibromas with shave excision and dermabrasion in a dark-skinned patient.

Figure 2
Representative skin lesion subtypes in tuberous sclerosis. (A) Facial angiofibromas, (B) shagreen patch and (C) periungual or subungual fibromas (also known as Koenen tumours).

Hypomelanotic macules are often the earliest and most frequently reported cutaneous finding in TSC. They present as hypopigmented macules and patches of various morphologies and should not be confused with de-pigmented patches seen in other pigmentary disorders such as vitiligo. In fair-skinned individuals, hypomelanotic macules can be difficult to identify, necessitating the use of a Wood lamp to make them more conspicuous. Medium to large (1–12 cm in diameter) hypopigmented patches are one of the earliest visible signs of TSC, occurring in > 50% of children at birth and in nearly all patients by the age of 2. These patches are referred to as 'ash leaf' spots because they can resemble the leaf of the eastern mountain ash tree, shaped like a long oval with one rounded and one tapered end. Polygonal 'thumbprint'-like macules are the most commonly observed morphology and are usually smaller (0.5–2 cm in diameter) than the ash-leaf type. Hypomelanotic macules appear asymmetrically and are most common on the trunk and buttocks. Scalp involvement is rare, but when present can lead to poliosis.

'Confetti-like' skin lesions, another type of hypomelanotic macule, have been reported to occur in 2.8–28% of patients with TSC. These appear as numerous, small (approximately 1–3 mm in diameter) hypopigmented macules that occur symmetrically; they are typically spread over the distal extremities. Confetti-like skin lesions can appear any time from childhood to adulthood.

Shagreen patches, a type of connective tissue hamartoma, are found in approximately half the patients with TSC. They typically develop during the first decade of lifeand are elevated pink to yellow-brown plaques with an orange peel–like texture, ranging from several millimetres to several centimetres in length (figure 2 B). Shagreen patches are asymmetric and usually appear on dorsal surfaces, such as the back and the lumbosacral regions, but occasionally occur on the chest or the abdomen.

### Molecular implications of skin lesions in tuberous sclerosis [^113H8vnj]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2008). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis (TS), neurocutaneous disorder resulting from the mutation of 1 of 2 genes, TSC1 or TSC2, is often associated with the formation of hamartomatous lesions in various organ systems, including the skin. TS patients may present with hypomelanic macules, confetti-like spots, facial angiofibromas, ungual fibromas, shagreen patches, forehead plaques, and other dermatological signs. Some of these manifestations are pathognomic for TS and thus should be carefully evaluated when TS diagnosis is suspected. Little is known however on molecular links connecting disease pathogenesis and formation of such hamartomas. In the current review, we describe molecular pathways thought to be responsible for the development of the disease and show how their upregulation may affect the skin. Special attention is paid to protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and mammalian target of rapamycin, which have recently been found to participate in the control of melanin biosynthesis through microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and tyrosinase transcription.

### A row of nodules on the right side of the face [^1174bE2W]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 38-year-old woman attended the consultation because of a row of reddish-brown papules with superficial telangiectasias on the right side of her face (Fig 1). The lesions were painful to palpation and arranged in a curved line from the inner canthus to the labial commissure. Although her parents had observed the papules since her childhood and interpreted them as nevi, the patient was now concerned about the appearance of new satellite lesions. A punch biopsy taken from a papule was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Fig 2, A, original magnification: ×400; B, original magnification: ×100) and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against carcinoembryonic antigen (Fig 2, C, original magnification: ×250).

Question 1: Considering the clinical and histopathologic images, what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Syringomas
B. Angiofibromas
C. Trichoepitheliomas
D. Spiradenomas
E. Eccrine nevus

Answers:
A. Syringomas – Incorrect. Syringomas present as small, skin-colored papules in the periocular area. The lesions tend to appear in adolescence; they are not typically congenital.
B. Angiofibromas – Incorrect. Angiofibromas are usually numerous and can be found on both sides of the face in patients with tuberous sclerosis. There are also special types of angiofibroma that are not associated with genetic syndromes, including fibrous papules in the nose and pearly penile papules. Histology would show a fibrovascular proliferation.
C. Trichoepitheliomas – Incorrect. Trichoepitheliomas are small, multiple, bilateral lesions that appear after puberty and increase in numbers with age. Histology shows rudimentary hair follicles.
D. Spiradenomas – Correct. Spiradenomas are skin-colored, pink or red papular lesions of elastic consistency that most commonly appear on the scalp, neck, and upper trunk. Involvement of the face is uncommon, and even rarer are multiple tumors in a curvilinear distribution. Spiradenomas usually appear after puberty, but they can occasionally be seen in children. The appearances in this case are unusual, and the diagnosis could only be confirmed by the histologic appearance of the tumor.
E. Eccrine nevus – Incorrect. Eccrine nevi are a malformation of eccrine sweat glands. These rare lesions usually appear at birth and can produce a localized area of excessive sweating.

### Tuberous sclerosis complex: one disorder, three generations and an assortment of radiological and clinical presentations [^113KBsbA]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

This case report presents markedly different clinical and radiological manifestations of the same disease in a family over three consecutive generations with varying treatment strategies. The index case/proband primarily presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, bleeding per rectum and seizures. Further evaluation revealed bilateral renal angiomyolipoma and cerebral subependymal nodules, in conjunction with facial adenoma sebaceum, periungual fibromas and hypomelanotic ash-leaf macules. Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex, identifying a mutation in the TSC2 gene. The entire family was evaluated for inherited disorders, leading to the detection of tuberous sclerosis in three adult offspring and a grandchild. The uncharacteristic neurological and cardiac manifestations in the proband are noteworthy. Another important aspect is the missed diagnosis in patients despite obvious clinical features and interaction with healthcare facilities, reflecting a gap in disease awareness and a lack of clinical vigilance.

### Dermatologic and dental aspects of the 2012 international tuberous sclerosis complex consensus statements [^112LkaAs]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

The 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Clinical Consensus Conference was convened to update the last consensus statement in 1998. Skin and dental lesions are common in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and are a frequent concern for patients. Recognition of these lesions is imperative for early diagnosis, given the treatment advances that may improve patient outcomes.

Objective

To detail recommendations for the diagnosis, surveillance, and management of skin and dental lesions in TSC.

Evidence Review

The TSC Dermatology and Dentistry Subcommittee, 1 of 12 subcommittees, reviewed the relevant literature from 1997 to 2012.

Findings

A consensus on skin and dental issues was achieved within the Dermatology and Dentistry Subcommittee before recommendations were presented, discussed, and agreed on in a group meeting of all subcommittees from June 14 to 15, 2012.

Conclusions and Relevance

Skin and dental findings comprise 4 of 11 major features and 3 of 6 minor features in the diagnostic criteria. A definite diagnosis of TSC is defined as the presence of at least 2 major features or 1 major and 2 or more minor features; in addition, a pathological mutation in TSC1 or TSC2 is diagnostic. Skin and oral examinations should be performed annually and every 3 to 6 months, respectively. Intervention may be indicated for TSC skin or oral lesions that are bleeding, symptomatic, disfiguring, or negatively affecting function. Options presented include surgical excision, laser(s), or use of a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor.

### Tubers and tumors are CLIPped together in tuberous sclerosis complex [^116F68Zo]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) arises from heterozygous pathogenic variants in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, resulting in hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Affected individuals manifest with various symptoms including refractory epilepsy, developmental delay, autism, cortical malformations, and tumor formation in brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, lung, and skin. In the brain, 3 main types of lesions are seen: cortical tubers, subependymal nodules (SENs), and subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). Cortical tubers are foci of dysplastic cortex that can generate seizures and contain dysmorphic neurons and astrocytes and giant cells, large cells that express neural progenitor, neuronal, and glial markers. SENs and SEGAs are intraventricular brain tumors that can cause complications such as hydrocephalus, with SENs often progressing into SEGAs.

Prior TSC studies to determine how mTOR pathway hyperactivation alters cortical development have mostly utilized rodent models, but pathological brain lesions seen in humans with TSC are largely absent in Tsc1 +/− and Tsc2 +/− mice, and are a rare feature of the Eker rat model that contains a heterozygous Tsc2 mutation. In mice, homozygous mutations in Tsc1/Tsc2 are necessary to recapitulate brain pathology. A predominant theory has been that a somatic "second hit" causing biallelic pathogenic variants in TSC1 or TSC2 initiates tumor and tuber formation in TSC. Sequencing of human tissue has revealed biallelic pathogenic TSC1/TSC2 variants in most SENs and SEGAs, and less commonly in cortical tubers. However, whether a second hit is necessary to initiate the formation of the tubers and tumors is unknown. Furthermore, tubers, SENs, and SEGAs have similar transcriptional signaturessuggesting a common cell type of origin, but identifying this cell remains elusive. In a recent study, Eichmüller et al. hypothesized that a second hit is not required and that a vulnerable cell type gives rise to TSC brain lesions because of TSC1/TSC2 haploinsufficiency. Here, the authors used human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that were heterozygous for a pathogenic TSC2 variant, along with isogenic controls, and differentiated the cells into human cerebral organoids (hCOs), three-dimensional cultures that resemble structural aspects of the developing fetal brain.

### Differentiating the mTOR inhibitors everolimus and sirolimus in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex [^115itg9j]. Neuro-Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic autosomal dominant disorder characterized by benign tumor-like lesions, called hamartomas, in multiple organ systems, including the brain, skin, heart, kidneys, and lung. These hamartomas cause a diverse set of clinical problems based on their location and often result in epilepsy, learning difficulties, and behavioral problems. TSC is caused by mutations within the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that inactivate the genes' tumor-suppressive function and drive hamartomatous cell growth. In normal cells, TSC1 and TSC2 integrate growth signals and nutrient inputs to downregulate signaling to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an evolutionarily conserved serine-threonine kinase that controls cell growth and cell survival. The molecular connection between TSC and mTOR led to the clinical use of allosteric mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) for the treatment of TSC. Everolimus is approved for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and renal angiomyolipomas in patients with TSC. Sirolimus, though not approved for TSC, has undergone considerable investigation to treat various aspects of the disease. Everolimus and sirolimus selectively inhibit mTOR signaling with similar molecular mechanisms, but with distinct clinical profiles. This review differentiates mTOR inhibitors in TSC while describing the molecular mechanisms, pathogenic mutations, and clinical trial outcomes for managing TSC.

Bleomycin-induced skin toxicity is a rare and unique complication. We report a 35-year-old man with nodular lymphocytic predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma, stage IVB, who was started on adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastin and dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy. He developed pruritic hyperpigmented, patchy skin lesions on the neck, back, chest and thighs after IA cycle of ABVD chemotherapy. Lesions were not typical flagellate rash but hyperpigmented, patchy and mildly pruritic lesions over the trunk and proximal extremities. Lesions increased with continuation of bleomycin and improved gradually after removing the drug from chemotherapy schedule. The patient was in complete remission after VI cycles of chemotherapy (AVD Regimen) and skin lesions healed with minimal residual hyperpigmentation.

### Vascular abnormality in TSC: leaky plumbing is a problem, but not THE problem [^1126tMo8]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare life-threatening genetic disease characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors throughout multiple organs in the body, particularly the lungs, kidneys, and brain. Lesions found in the brain of TSC patients include subependymal nodules and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, both of which typically form deep within the ependymal lining of the ventricles, and cortical tubers, the namesake of TSC, which form more superficially in the cerebral cortex. These abnormalities in brain anatomy are thought to underlie the severe neurological symptoms of TSC, which include developmental delay, autism, and epilepsy.

In TSC patients with epilepsy, seizures commonly originate from one of the cortical tubers, suggesting a direct link between this anatomical abnormality and one of the disease's most debilitating symptoms. Indeed, surgical resection of well-identified tuber foci is frequently successful at eliminating refractory seizures in TSC patients. Thus, cortical tubers themselves represent an obvious therapeutic target for TSC. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanism by which tubers cause seizures (and which might be prophylactically or therapeutically targeted) is unknown. Tuberous sclerosis complex is caused by mutations to the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, either of which disrupts the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. However, relevant downstream pathways of mTOR by which cortical tubers promote epileptogenesis have not been identified.

In the highlighted work, Guo et alexplore the hypothesis that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represents a critical pathway in the pathogenesis of TSC. Vascular endothelial growth factor, a subfamily of signaling protein that promotes angiogenesis, is positioned downstream of the mTOR/AP-1 pathwayand is implicated in tuber-associated epilepsy for at least 3 reasons: (1) VEGF is elevated in serum and affected organs in TSC patients, (2) in TSC patient tissue, cortical tubers have an elevated density of blood vessels, and (3) blood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage, a consequence of elevated VEGF, has been implicated in tuber-associated epilepsy. Together these findings point to a model wherein mutations to TSC1 or TSC2 genes lead to elevated activity in the mTOR/AP-1/VEGF pathway, which contributes to the formation of ictogenic tubers via increased angiogenesis and increased BBB leakiness.

### A telangiectatic nodule on the anterior shin [^115y4oy4]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: For patients with biopsy-proven trichoblastoma, what is the most appropriate next step?
A. Management and treatment will vary by case
B. Surgical excision
C. Clinical monitoring
D. Mohs micrographic surgery
E. Superficial radiation therapy

Answers:
A. Management and treatment will vary by case – Correct. There is no one correct treatment for all cases of trichoblastoma; management should be determined by patient desires and clinician judgment. Despite being a benign tumor, trichoblastoma has the potential for malignant transformation into trichoblastic carcinoma. Unlike BCC, which rarely ever metastasizes, trichoblastic carcinoma is more aggressive with a much higher metastatic potential and mortality. Because of the possibility for malignant transformation, surgical excision of trichoblastoma is often performed and may sometimes even be necessary for accurate histologic diagnosis. Although these lesions are frequently excised, clinical monitoring is also an appropriate option for patients who may not desire or be candidates for surgery.
B. Surgical excision in all cases – Incorrect. Although surgical excision is an appropriate and common treatment, trichoblastoma is a benign tumor, and not all cases have to be removed, especially if the patient does not want treatment.
C. Clinical monitoring in all cases – Incorrect. Although clinical monitoring is an appropriate option, there are several reasons why a patient and clinician might opt to remove trichoblastoma surgically (ie, risk of transformation, cosmetic concern, or to aid histologic evaluation).
D. Mohs micrographic surgery – Incorrect. Trichoblastoma is a benign tumor and Mohs micrographic surgery in most cases would be unnecessary. Most trichoblastomas can be removed adequately with simple surgical excision.
E. Superficial radiation therapy – Incorrect. Trichoblastoma is a benign tumor that can be treated successfully with excision. Radiation therapy would not be an appropriate method of treating trichoblastomas.

### Childhood tuberous sclerosis complex in Southern Sweden: a paradigm shift in diagnosis and treatment [^115H93fb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder with almost complete penetrance that affects multiple organ systems. The estimated prevalence of TSC in Sweden is 5.38/100 000 individuals. TSC is caused by loss-of-function variants in tumour suppressor genes either TSC1 or TSC2, which cause upregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin1 (mTOR1) signalling pathway. In TSC, mTOR1 signalling pathway disinhibition accelerates cell growth and proliferation, with subsequent growth of hamartomatous tumours in the brain, heart, kidneys, eyes, skin, and lungs. TSC can be diagnosed based on clinical diagnostic criteria, or by finding a pathogenic TSC1 or TSC2 variant, or both.

In the last few decades, TSC diagnostics, treatment, and surveillance have advanced markedly. For instance, everolimus, an mTOR-inhibitor (mTORi), has been found particularly efficient for treating subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA), angiomyolipomas (AML), facial angiofibromas, and epilepsy in TSC patients, if used continuously.

Focal seizures and infantile spasms often occur in the first year of life and early seizure onset is associated with intellectual disability (ID) and drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) in TSC patients. Preventive treatment with vigabatrin, introduced at the first detection of epileptiform activity, before clinical seizure onset, may delay epilepsy onset and decrease its severity.

We reviewed the complete TSC clinical spectrum in a Swedish paediatric cohort and investigated changes in diagnostics and treatment over the last two decades. To our knowledge this is the first not registry-based retrospective study of all TSC manifestations in the modern era.

### The genomic landscape of tuberous sclerosis complex [^117MCnv2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous, autosomal dominant genetic disease affecting ∼1 in 6,000 to 10,000 live births. TSC causes highly variable, multisystem growth of benign tumours and other hamartomatous lesions that cause diverse clinical problems. Abnormal brain growths are one of the most common features of TSC and lead to epilepsy, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, autism, behavioural problems and hydrocephalus. Most prevalent of these are cortical tubers, largely static malformations of the cerebral cortex that are present at birth and associated with seizure activity. Approximately 80% of patients develop subependymal nodules (SENs) on the lateral ventricle walls, which can progress into subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), larger well-circumscribed tumours near the foramen of Monro. Several studies have suggested an association between brain lesions and neurological symptoms in TSC patients, underscoring the need to understand and reduce these growths to improve quality of life.

### Updated international tuberous sclerosis complex diagnostic criteria and surveillance and management recommendations [^114MbHTM]. Pediatric Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on tuberous sclerosis complex:

- **Definition**: TSC is a genetic neurocutaneous disorder affecting multiple organs including skin, brain, kidneys, heart, and lungs.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of TSC is linked to mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, encoding hamartin and tuberin proteins that regulate the protein kinase B/mTOR signaling pathway. Mutations in these genes lead to dysregulation of the mTOR pathway, resulting in abnormal cell growth and the formation of hamartomas in multiple organ systems. Autosomal dominant inheritance is reported in about one-third of cases.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of TSC is estimated at 1 per 5,800–10,000 live births.
- **Risk factors**: The main risk factor for TSC is the family history of the condition; however, spontaneous mutations are also common. Some patients may have concomitant autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease as a result of a contiguous gene deletion involving TSC2 and PDK1.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of TSC is highly variable involving multiple organ systems (brain, skin, heart, lungs, and kidneys), with symptoms ranging from mild to severe and often not appearing until later in life. Most features of TSC become evident only in childhood after 3 years of age. Cutaneous manifestations include hypopigmented macules, facial angiofibromas, fibrous cephalic plaques, and ungual fibromas. Neurological manifestations include seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and autism spectrum disorder. Renal manifestations include renal angiomyolipomas, renal epithelial cysts, and renal cell carcinoma. Pulmonary manifestations include pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis and multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia. Cardiovascular manifestations include cardiac rhabdomyomas and cardiac arrhythmias. Retinal manifestations include retinal hamartomas and retinal achromic patches.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of TSC is worse in cases with CNS and renal tumors.

### Confluent soft nodules on buttocks [^115mJMko]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 45-year-old Hispanic woman presented with asymptomatic nodules on her buttocks. She denied any trauma or application of new topical agents to the area. On physical examination, the patient is noted to have confluent 1–2 cm soft, skin-colored nodules on bilateral medial buttocks (Fig 1). A 4-mm punch biopsy of the right medial buttock was performed (Figs 2 and 3).

Question 1: Based on the physical examination and dermatopathology, what is your diagnosis?
A. Elephantiasis nostras verruciformis
B. Neurofibromas
C. Pseudoverrucous papules
D. Shagreen patch
E. Silicone granuloma

Answers:
A. Elephantiasis nostras verruciformis – Incorrect. Elephantiasis nostras verruciformis occurs in the setting of chronic lymphedema, resulting in hypertrophic cutaneous changes in gravity-dependent areas. Histopathology would show dilated lymphatic channels and epidermal hyperplasia, not lobules of fat cells with multinucleated giant cells.
B. Neurofibromas – Incorrect. Neurofibromas are a type of cutaneous nerve tumors that present in patients with neurofibromatosis. Neurofibromas can present as soft nodules; however, histopathology would show Schwann cells, fibroblasts, and perineural cells.
C. Pseudoverrucous papules – Incorrect. Pseudoverrucous papules are commonly described in patients with colostomies, urostomies, or chronic fecal incontinence, as these areas tend to entrap moisture and heat, which can irritate the skin. Histopathology would show epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis.
D. Shagreen patch – Incorrect. Shagreen patches are firm yellow/pink patches or plaques on the lumbar region and are associated with tuberous sclerosis. This patient does not report of a history of tuberous sclerosis or of findings consistent with tuberous sclerosis, such as epilepsy, developmental delay, ash-leaf spots (hypomelanotic macules), or angiofibromas.
E. Silicone granuloma – Correct. Figs 2 and 3 depict numerous small nucleated vacuolated spaces throughout the dermis and subcutis and eccentrically nucleated vacuolated histiocytes with larger variably-sized fat microcysts, consistent with a diagnosis of silicone granuloma. This, in addition to the location of the nodules on the patient, should raise suspicion for a granulomatous reaction secondary to silicone injection.

### Management of infantile spasms during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112FtQ9j]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

If the etiology of infantile spasms is not clear after thorough history and physical examination, a brain MRI is crucial to the etiological workup, as it can affect treatment choices. Two examples follow. First, the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex may be made by brain MRI, because skin lesions can be subtle, and affected children may first come to medical attention because of infantile spasms. The diagnosis affects treatment selection, as tuberous sclerosis complex is preferentially treated with vigabatrin (rather than hormonal therapy). Second, when a structural brain lesion is identified, an epilepsy surgery evaluation can be expedited if standard medical treatment fails.

Genetic testing is also a high-yield priority early in the diagnostic workup. A pathogenic genetic abnormality is found in nearly half of those tested, including in 24% of those where the initial history, examination, and MRI do not identify a cause. A comprehensive epilepsy gene panel is generally recommended as the first-line test at this time, and microarray may be considered in the presence of dysmorphism or other organ system involvement.

### Topical use of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in tuberous sclerosis complex – A comprehensive review of the literature [^1144Db56]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetically determined multisystem disorder that may affect almost any human organ. The discovery of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and its involvement in tuberous sclerosis complex-related pathology has led to the introduction of mTOR inhibitors into clinical practice. Topical administration of mTOR inhibitors for skin lesions related to tuberous sclerosis complex may represent a reasonable alternative for more invasive procedures. A growing number of patients have been described exhibiting positive therapeutic effects from the topical administration of these agents. The aim of this review was to systematically analyze available literature on the use of topical mTOR inhibitors to treat dermatologic lesions related to tuberous sclerosis complex.

Results

A comprehensive review of PubMed, Medscape, and Cochrane databases between 1995 and 2015 was performed to identify available studies describing topical use of mTOR inhibitors in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex. In most studies, topical mTOR inhibitor application proved to be effective in the treatment of skin lesions related to tuberous sclerosis complex. Facial angiofibromas were the target lesions in most instances. Few studies reported clinical improvement of hypomelanotic macules. These drugs directly address the molecular defect related to tuberous sclerosis complex manifestations.

Conclusions

Currently available clinical data suggest that topical application of mTOR inhibitors may be effective in the treatment of facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. Ongoing randomized clinical trials of topical mTOR inhibitors for TSC-related cutaneous lesions should add clarity to the role of these agents.

A 63-year-old man with a 1-year course of IgA-λ multiple myeloma (MM) and a history of autologous stem cell transplantation presented with multiple nontender, nodular violaceous skin lesions that were located predominantly on his trunk. Diagnostic workup using F-FDG PET/CT revealed disseminated disease including highly hypermetabolic (sub)cutaneous lesions, consistent with active manifestations of MM. Histopathology confirmed monoclonal, λ-restricted plasma cell infiltrates with a high proliferation index (Ki-67) of about 80%. Cutaneous manifestation of MM is an uncommon observation in clinical practice portending poor prognosis.

### Tuberous sclerosis complex surveillance and management: recommendations of the 2012 international tuberous sclerosis complex consensus conference [^113k6NYB]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Ongoing surveillance and management recommendations for individuals previously diagnosed with TSC

Once the diagnosis of TSC is established and initial diagnostic evaluations completed, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor progression of known problems or lesions and emergence of new ones (Table 3). Some manifestations begin in childhood and are less likely to be present or cause new problems in adulthood, such as cardiac rhabdomyomas or subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. In contrast, problems with LAM are typically limited to adults, and renal manifestations require significantly more monitoring and intervention in adulthood compared with childhood because of the cumulative nature of angiomyolipomata and other renal lesions. Finally, other aspects of TSC may be present throughout the entire lifespan of the individual, such as epilepsy and TAND, but specific manifestations and impact on overall health and quality of life can vary. Thus, ongoing periodic surveillance is needed after initial diagnosis for optimal care and prevention of secondary complications associated with TSC. Management of specific complications of TSC will often require input from a multidisciplinary team.

Genetics

Genetic testing and counseling should be offered to individuals with TSC when they reach reproductive age, and first-degree relatives of affected individuals should be offered clinical assessment and, where a mutation has been identified in the index case, genetic testing. (Category 1)

Brain

Symptomatic SEGA or SEGA associated with increasing ventricular enlargement, or with unexplained changes in neurological status or TAND symptoms, require intervention or more frequent clinical monitoring and reimaging. For acutely symptomatic individuals, surgical resection is the recommended intervention, and cerebrospinal fluid diversion may also be necessary. For growing but otherwise asymptomatic SEGA, either surgical resection or medical therapy with mTOR inhibitors can be effective. Shared decision-making with the patients or their parents in selecting the best treatment option should take the following considerations into account: risk of complications or adverse effects, cost of treatment, expected length of treatment, and potential impact on TSC comorbidities. Patients with unilateral, single, gross total resectable SEGA without individual risk factors or other comorbidities preferentially may benefit from surgery, whereas patients with multisystem disease or multiple or infiltrating SEGA lesions that are not amenable to gross total resection may favor mTOR inhibitor treatment.

### Everolimus [^116LK43H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma

A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-2, NCT00790400) of everolimus tablets was conducted in 118 patients with renal angiomyolipoma as a feature of TSC (n = 113) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n = 5). The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of ≥ 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age ≥ 18 years. Patients received everolimus tablets 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion ≥ 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase ≥ 20%, and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of ≥ Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no).

### A case of generalized xanthogranuloma with systemic involvement [^112yhf1X]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AXG manifests as solitary and oligolesional yellow-to-orange papules on the face, neck, and lower arms. Unlike juvenile xanthogranuloma, the lesions tend to persist and do not regress spontaneously. There is no association with systemic diseases such as neurofibromatosis or leukemia.

XD is a rare, benign, normolipidemic form of NLCH, affecting the skin and mucous membranes. It normally manifests as nodular lesions on the eyelids and flexures such as axillae, inguinal folds, and antecubital and popliteal fossae. Approximately 40% to 60% of the patients carry lesions on the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. Extracutaneous manifestations involve multiple osteolytic lesions, pulmonary and central nervous system infiltration, and diabetes insipidus.

ECD is also a rare, disseminated form of NLCH. Recent reports suggest conflicting results of monoclonal ECD involving B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) V600E mutations in approximately 55%. It is primarily a disease of long bones presenting with medullary sclerosis radiographically, sparing epiphyses. Extraskeletal manifestations can occur in almost every organ. Cutaneous lesions include diffuse dermal or subcutaneous nodules, intertrigo-like lesions, and pigmented patches on the lips and oral mucosa.

Immunohistochemical results suggest NLCH cell lineage. Cutaneous lesions in our patient, similar to those of AXG, showed diffuse dermal and subcutaneous nodules without merging into plaques or forming groups. Xanthomas symmetrically involving eyelids, trunk, face, and proximal extremities of flexor surfaces, which are characteristic of XD, were not detected. The patient had multiple osteolytic lesions, which are characteristic features of XD. Extracutaneous manifestations revealed a variety of symptoms common to all 3 diseases, which prevented a clear-cut diagnosis. Characteristic features of the 3 diseases for the differential diagnosis of our patient are summarized in Table I. Because the patient has not shown aggressive disease progression, it is reasonable to consider our patient closer to AXG and XD than ECD. To our knowledge, no reports describing a case such as this have been published, which increased the difficulty in reaching a final diagnosis.

### Tuberous sclerosis: current update [^117Fyqqt]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a relatively rare autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder secondary to mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes. Although manifestation of the classic triad of seizures, intellectual disability, and facial angiofibromas may facilitate timely diagnosis of TSC, the multisystem features that may indicate TSC in the absence of these manifestations remain highly variable. In addition, patients with TSC are at risk of developing multiple benign and malignant tumors in various organ systems, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Thus, imaging plays a critical role in diagnosis, surveillance, and management of patients with TSC. It is crucial that radiologists be familiar with TSC and the various associated imaging features to avoid a delayed or incorrect diagnosis. Key manifestations include cortical dysplasias, subependymal nodules, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, cardiac rhabdomyomas, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and angiomyolipomas. Renal angiomyolipomas in particular can manifest with imaging features that mimic renal malignancy and pose a diagnostic dilemma. Other manifestations include dermatologic and ophthalmic manifestations, renal cysts, renal cell carcinomas, multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia, splenic hamartomas, and other rare tumors such as perivascular epithelioid tumors. In addition to using imaging and clinical features to confirm the diagnosis, genetic testing can be performed. In this article, the molecular pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and imaging features of TSC are reviewed. Current recommendations for management and surveillance of TSC are discussed as well. © RSNA, 2021.

### Fibroblasts from normal skin of a tuberous sclerosis patient show upregulation of mTOR pathway [^111s8YBJ]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2009). Low credibility.

Skin lesions are one of the characteristic features in tuberous sclerosis (TS), a neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutation of 1 of 2 tumor suppressor genes, encoding hamartin and tuberin. So far, however, studies on skin abnormalities present in TS patients are very few and do not contribute to the knowledge of the disease. In our current work, we cultured fibroblasts from healthy skin of a TS patient and evaluated upregulation of pathways found to be implicated in progression of TS tumors. We found that even healthy skin fibroblasts show upregulation of S6 ribosomal protein.

### Multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia lacking typical clinical features of the tuberous sclerosis complex: a case report and literature review [^113uuzJL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

TSC is an autosomal-dominant neurocutaneous disease with high phenotypic variability and is characterized by classic Vogt's triad of facial sebaceous adenoma, epilepsy, and mental retardation. The pathological changes of TSC are mainly multiple hamartoma lesions in many organs, most often involving the skin and central nervous system, as well as the kidney, lung, liver, heart, blood vessels and skeletal systems. It is mainly a clinical diagnosis based on clinical features, but many cases had insufficient clinical characteristics in the disease diagnosis. With the development of genetic analysis technology, the diagnostic criteria updated by the International TSC Consensus Conference in 2012 added the results of genetic testing, considering the pathogenic mutation of TSC1 or TSC2 as an independent diagnostic criterion. The TSC1 and TSC2 genes are considered tumor suppressor genes. TSC is caused by mutations in either TSC1 (chromosome 9q34) or TSC2 (chromosome 16p13) gene, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. A "pathogenic" mutation was defined as a mutation that clearly prevents protein synthesis and/or inactivates the function of the TSC1 or TSC2 proteins. Previous studies have shown that the pathogenic germline mutations of TSC1/TSC2 are mainly small insertion-deletion mutations or nonsense mutations. In this case, gene sequencing suggested that the nonsense mutation of the TSC1 gene resulted in the loss of protein expression. According to related studies, pathogenic variants in TSC2 are usually associated with a more severe phenotype of TSC than TSC1, and TSC arising from a TSC1 mutation is less symptomatic and more likely to be overlooked. Inactivation mutation in TSC1 or TSC2 leads to hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which results in increased cell growth and proliferation in multiple organ systems, including the lung. More than 50% of TSC cases are associated with lung involvement, and the prevalence increases with age. Well-established pulmonary manifestations of TSC include lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and MMPH. MMPH is less common than LAM which is typical of cystic destruction with smooth muscle-like spindle cell infiltration and aggregation.

In conclusion, we describe an asymptomatic case of MMPH secondary to TSC diagnosed by pathological biopsy combined with genetic sequencing. Thus, MMPH must be considered in the differential diagnosis of multiple ground-glass nodules in both lungs, even in cases lacking clinical manifestations of TSC, and the diagnosis can be further assisted by imaging examination, histopathology and genetic sequencing.

Case descriptions

Patient 1

A 10-year-old boy presented with a 5-year history of numerous papulo-nodules on the face and back of the scalp. These had initially started when the patient was 9 to 10 months old, progressively increasing in size and quantity. These lesions were asymptomatic, without pain nor pruritus. Past medical history was notable for new-onset seizure during sleep at 6 years of age. An electroencephalogram indicated epileptogenicity from the bilateral independent centrotemporal regions, believed to be benign rolandic epilepsy. On examination, there were approximately 30 discrete, 1 to 3 mm, pink-to-skin-colored, smooth papules and nodules, some clustered, predominantly on the central face and nose, with additional nodules scattered on the occipital scalp (Fig 1, A, B). Darier sign was negative. There was no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. A complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were normal. He had multiple shave biopsies at 5 years of age, some leaving circular scars. Multiple biopsies from the original presentation, and more recent biopsy of a scalp nodule revealed similar findings: a dermal proliferation comprised of nests of histiocytoid/epithelioid cells with gray cytoplasm and indistinct borders, embedded in a fibromyxoid stroma (Fig 2, A-C). Immunostaining was positive for CD68, NK1/C3, and factor XIIIa, but negative for MART-1 or S-100 (Fig 2, D). A diagnosis of cellular neurothekeoma, polypoid-type was made. The patient was being bullied at school and sought removal of the facial lesions thus he was referred to Plastic Surgery. Five lesions were removed via elliptical excision with layered closure under general anesthesia, and the patient recovered uneventfully.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes in tuberous sclerosis complex [^113kdyNH]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. The TSC proteins hamartin and tuberin form a heterodimeric complex involved in intracellular signalling and the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, which plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. 1 In addition to the primary mutation event, stochastic second‐hit mutations in the normal copy allele during embryogenesis lead to marked upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and consequently the development of hamartomatous lesions and random variation in the size and location of lesions, leading to highly variable phenotypic expression. In the brain, subependymal nodules in the ventricular walls and cortical tubers at the grey–white matter interface arise and are associated with a high risk of epilepsy, which occurs in up to 90% of individuals and typically begins in the first year of life. Epileptic (infantile) spasms are common, but are often preceded by or coexist with focal seizures. 2 More than half of patients with TSC have some form of intellectual impairment and approximately one‐third have profound disability, while a significant proportion does not display impairment. 3 A bimodal distribution of IQ in individuals with TSC has been reported, 4 although whether this reflects a genotype–phenotype correlation or the effect of epilepsy is unclear. 5 With the advent of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitory treatment for several complications of TSC and speculation that it may hold promise for improving cognitive development, it has become especially important to characterize the longitudinal pathways leading to intellectual impairment in individuals with TSC, to identify the risk processes that could be targets for treatment.

### Cutaneous manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex and the paediatrician's role [^111Rtc74]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder stemming from unregulated activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, resulting in the growth of hamartomas in multiple organs. TSC-related skin lesions often develop early in life and can be disfiguring, emotionally distressful and even painful at times. Recognition of TSC-associated skin features by paediatricians can be a catalyst for facilitating early implementation of treatment strategies and establishing appropriate follow-up care. The range of potential treatment options for symptomatic or disfiguring TSC-associated skin lesions includes non-pharmacological (surgical excision, laser therapy) and pharmacological (eg, topical or systemic mTOR inhibitors) alternatives. In this review, we discuss the relevance of TSC-associated skin findings, highlight available treatment options, review guideline recommendations and emphasise the role of the primary care physician in the management of this complex disease.

### A novel mutation in ABCB6 associated with dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria in a Saudi family [^116x7pvt]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

DUH is a rare heterogeneous pigmentary genodermatosis characterized by generalized asymptomatic hypopigmented and hyperpigmented macules that vary in size with a reticulated pattern appearing in early childhood or infancy, mainly over trunk and extremities, while face, palms, soles, nail, hair, and mucous membranes are less affected. Ocular abnormalities, such as photosensitivity, neurosensory hearing defects, learning difficulties, mental retardation, and epilepsy have been rarely reported to be associated with DUH.

DUH is generally autosomal dominant with variable penetrance, but autosomal recessive and sporadic cases have been described.

The histopathologic features depend upon the location from which the skin is biopsied. Hyperpigmented lesions will show an increase in melanin in the basal layer, pigmentary incontinence, and some melanophages in the upper dermis. In contrast, hypopigmented lesions exhibit decreased melanin deposition in the basal layer. As seen on electron microscopy, the number of melanosomes in melanocytes and keratinocytes is significantly reduced in hypopigmented lesions compared with hyperpigmented lesions and normal skin.

ABCB6 belongs to the family of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters, which transport various molecules across extracellular and intracellular membranes. The ABCB6 gene is located either on 6q242-q252 or 12q21-q23, is expressed in lysosomes and early melanosomes of melanocytes, and regulates the early steps of melanogenesis. Downregulation of ABCB6 can impair the formation of luminal fibrils derived from the pigment cell-specific pre-melanosomal protein, most likely due to abnormalities in copper homeostasis.

The human ABCB6 gene (OMIM 605452) was first cloned in the year 2000 and is located on chromosome 2q36. The ABCB6 gene contains 19 exons in the protein-coding region and belongs to the ABC transporter family. ABCB6 is involved in the active transport of peptides, steroids, polysaccharides, amino acids, phospholipids, ions, bile acids, and pharmaceutical drugs.

A previously healthy 7‐year‐old boy presented with generalized tonic‐clonic seizures for approximately 1 month. He was the first child of unrelated, healthy parents and had exhibited normal development. MR imaging demonstrated a large, right‐sided temporal lobe mass‐like lesion measuring 44 × 25 × 24 mm. The lesion exhibited hypointense on T1‐weighted images and a distinct heterogenous high signal intensity on T2/FLAIR images with nodular contrast enhancement (Figure 1). He underwent surgical gross total resection of the tumor and postoperatively he was free of symptoms. Eight months post‐surgery, neuroimaging gave no indication of tumor recurrence.

### Tuberous sclerosis [^115iuzcQ]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic multisystem disorder characterised by widespread hamartomas in several organs, including the brain, heart, skin, eyes, kidney, lung, and liver. The affected genes are TSC1 and TSC2, encoding hamartin and tuberin respectively. The hamartin-tuberin complex inhibits the mammalian-target-of-rapamycin pathway, which controls cell growth and proliferation. Variations in the distribution, number, size, and location of lesions cause the clinical syndrome to vary, even between relatives. Most features of tuberous sclerosis become evident only in childhood after 3 years of age, limiting their usefulness for early diagnosis. Identification of patients at risk for severe manifestations is crucial. Increasing understanding of the molecular abnormalities caused by tuberous sclerosis may enable improved management of this disease.

### Cutaneous manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex and the paediatrician's role [^112P9rxq]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem disorder that affects an estimated 40 000 individuals in the USA and approximately 2 million people worldwide, with a birth incidence of about 1 in 6000. Mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene TSC1 (encoding hamartin) or, more commonly, TSC2 (encoding tuberin) are implicated in the pathogenesis of TSC via a loss of inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, allowing subsequent growth of hamartomas in various organs, including the brain (cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs)), kidneys (renal angiomyolipomas), lung (lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)), heart (cardiac rhabdomyomas) and skin.

Cutaneous findings are the most common and readily visible manifestation of TSC. More than 90% of patients with TSC have one or more skin lesions, which usually develop early in life. It is important for the paediatrician to be able to identify TSC-associated skin manifestations to ensure prompt diagnosis, early treatment initiation and appropriate referral for follow-up of other TSC-related sequelae. This review focuses primarily on cutaneous TSC-associated features, available treatment options and guideline recommendations regarding the management of patients with TSC.

### Novel mutations in Chinese han patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: case series and review of the published work [^114K9GV8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by hamartomas in multiple organ systems. This study was performed in one familial and two sporadic cases with TSC. Two novel mutations (c.1884_1887delAAAG and c.5266A > G) and two previously reported mutations (c.4258_4261delTCAG and c.1960G > C) were identified by direct DNA sequencing. Of the four mutations, c.1884_1887delAAAG and c.1960G > C were found in a family and identified in the same allele by TA cloning sequencing. However, c.1960G > C was reported to be non-pathogenic. Furthermore, correlations between genotypes and phenotypes of Chinese Han patients since 2014 were performed by paired χ²-tests in our published work review, which has not been reported. The results showed that patients with TSC2 mutations had a higher frequency of mental retardation and there were no significant differences of seizures and skin lesions with TSC1 mutations. Genetically, they had a higher frequency of familial inheritance.

### Large right temporal mass in young adolescent [^1128GNUn]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans – Incorrect. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a locally aggressive tumor of fibroblastic origin. The initial lesion is a skin-colored plaque that develops a red/brown color and a nodular surface. The lesion grows slowly and its histology shows storiform islands of bland spindle cells and the diffused expression of CD34 immunohistochemically.
B. Nodular fasciitis – Correct. Nodular fasciitis usually manifests as a rapid growing, well-defined, benign, self-limiting soft-tissue lesion, which tends to be < 4 cm. It is most commonly observed in the upper extremities, particularly the forearm, followed by the trunk, lower extremity, and head and neck region. The benign proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are typically mistaken for a sarcomatous lesion because of its rapid growth, abundant spindle-shaped cells, and mitotic activity.
C. Keloid – Incorrect. Keloid is a benign, firm, smooth, hard growth caused by a spontaneous, exaggerated fibroblast reaction to injury — often in the earlobe. Histology shows numerous fibroblasts and keloidal collagen, which are large, abnormal, hyalinized bundles of collagen.
D. Desmoid tumor – Incorrect. Desmoid tumor (fibromatosis) is a benign but locally aggressive neoplasm. Most affected sites include the mandible, submandibular area, neck, and tongue. Histology shows bland spindles cells invading muscles and other normal tissues.
E. Proliferative myositis – Incorrect. Proliferative myositis is an infiltrative, poorly demarcated intramuscular mass. Although it is similar to nodular fasciitis, it is characterized by large basophilic cells resembling ganglion cells. Histology shows ganglion-like cells and no damage to muscle fibers. The result is a checkerboard pattern with lesional cells between patches of intact muscle.

The NCCN framework allows recommendations based on all classes of evidence by categorizing recommendations with regard to the type and strength of evidence used to support the recommendation and is well-suited for application across many organ systems and specialties for a rare disease such as TSC with multisystem involvement. NCCN Clinical Guidelines category 1 recommendations are based on high-level evidence and uniform consensus, whereas category 2 recommendations are based on lower-level evidence and either uniform consensus or consensus. Category 3 recommendations are those for which a consensus cannot be reached, regardless of evidence. Additional details regarding this framework, including definitions for high- and low-level evidence, are provided in Table 1.

For the purposes of this summary document, the 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Group surveillance and management recommendations are organized into two sections: (1) recommendations applicable at the time of initial diagnosis and (2) recommendations applicable to follow-up health care. There is some overlap with this approach because some features discovered upon initial diagnosis may require immediate intervention, additional workup, or specialist referral. By necessity, discussion in this summary is limited to the most relevant and salient points. More detailed discussion of specific recommendations for the different TSC disease focus areas, supporting evidence thereof, and other special considerations will be published separately by each International Tuberous Sclerosis Consensus Complex Group subcommittee.

### Clinical characteristics of connective tissue nevi in tuberous sclerosis complex with special emphasis on shagreen patches [^115ipqdr]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) frequently develop collagenous connective tissue nevi. The prototypical lesion is a large shagreen patch located on the lower back, but some patients only manifest small collagenomas or have lesions elsewhere on the body. The ability to recognize these variable presentations can be important for the diagnosis of TSC.

Objective

To describe the clinical characteristics of connective tissue nevi on the trunk and extremities of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective analysis of patient medical records and skin photography was performed; 104 adult patients with TSC were enrolled in an observational cohort study that was enriched for those with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and was therefore composed mostly of women (99 women, 5 men). All patients included were examined at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, from 1998 to 2013. Connective tissue nevi were categorized per anatomic location and size. Lesions less than 1 cm in diameter were termed collagenomas. Shagreen patches were characterized as small (1 to < 4 cm), medium (4 to < 8 cm), and large (≥ 8 cm).

Main Outcome and Measures

Frequency, anatomic location, size, and histological appearance of connective tissue nevi in patients with TSC.

Results

Overall, 58 of 104 patients (median [range] age, 42 [19–70] years) with TSC (56%) had at least 1 connective tissue nevus on the trunk or thighs; of these, 28 of 58 patients (48%) had a solitary lesion, and 30 of 58 patients (52%) had 2 or more lesions. Overall, 120 lesions from 55 patients were classified by size; 46 lesions (38%) were collagenomas; 39 lesions (32%) were small shagreen patches; 21 lesions (18%), medium shagreen patches; and 14 lesions (12%), large shagreen patches. The distribution of lesions was 9% (n = 11), upper back; 29% (n = 35), middle back; 51% (n = 61), lower back; and 11% (n = 13), other locations. All 26 shagreen patches that were analyzed histopathologically had coarse collagen fibers and 24 of 26 stained with Miller elastic stain had decreased elastic fibers. On immunoblot analysis, fibroblasts grown from shagreen patches expressed higher levels of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 than paired fibroblasts from normal-appearing skin.

Conclusions and Relevance

Tuberous sclerosis complex-related connective tissue nevi are not limited to the lower back, and occasionally present on the central or upper back, buttocks, or thighs. Elastic fibers are typically decreased. Recognition of these variable presentations can be important for TSC diagnosis.

### Pineal region giant cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis: case report [^114u7Ptm]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of hamartomas in multiple organs including the brain, skin, eye, kidney, and heart. Neurological features include seizures and mental retardation. Cortical tubers and subependymal nodules are the characteristic intracranial lesions of tuberous sclerosis. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, typically located adjacent to the foramen of Monro, can enlarge and cause symptomatic ventricular obstruction. The authors describe the case of a 3-year-old boy with a history of tuberous sclerosis and retinal lesions who presented with an enlarging enhancing pineal region mass. Via an infratentorial supracerebellar approach, the mass was removed using both the operative microscope and a rigid neuroendoscope. Pathological examination showed a giant cell astrocytoma. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of tuberous sclerosis associated with a giant cell astrocytoma of the pineal region. Diagnostic considerations are discussed.

### Clinical syndrome… [^115GReBo]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The physical examination showed a sleepy, afebrile infant in no acute distress and weighing 9. 1 kg. The infant was unable to sit up or hold a sitting position. Of note, an oval depigmented area about 2 cm in greatest diameter with irregular borders was present on the skin over the infant's left lateral trunk. The appearance of this area was consistent with an ash-leaf spot. A CT scan of the father's brain showed subependymal nodules. Further detailed physical examination revealed a flesh-colored papule in the nail bed of the third toe of the left foot, consistent with an ungual fibroma. He was also found to have an orange-peel–textured lesion on his lower back. Malignant brain tumors rarely occur in patients with tuberous sclerosis. However, up to 8 percent of patients with the disorder develop subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, typically near the foramen of Monro.

9 The astrocytomas may originate from a subependymal nodule. 10 These well-circumscribed lesions should not be confused with the giant cell variant of glioblastoma multiforme, a malignant astrocytoma. DERMATOLOGIC MANIFESTATIONS The ash-leaf spot is the earliest skin lesion in patients with tuberous sclerosis. This hypomelanotic macule is most easily visualized with a Wood's light. 4 Ash-leaf spots are found at birth or in early infancy in 87 percent of patients with the disorder. By themselves, these hypomelanotic macules are not diagnostic of tuberous sclerosis because they are also relatively common in the general population.
8. The shagreen patch, a thickened orange-peel–textured area of connective tissue hamartoma, is most often found on the mid to lower back. This lesion develops in 21 percent of patients with tuberous sclerosis. 2 Shagreen patches may develop between two and six years of age.

Ungual fibromas are flesh-colored papules that may displace and distort the nail bed. These lesions are found in 19 percent of patients with tuberous sclerosis.

### Presentation and diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex in infants [^1147HjhP]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous genetic disorder with a high prevalence of epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders. TSC can be challenging to diagnose in infants because they often do not show many clinical signs early in life. In this study, we describe the timing and pattern of presenting and diagnostic features in a prospective longitudinal study of infants with TSC.

Methods

Two multicenter, prospective studies enrolled 130 infants with definite TSC by clinical or genetic criteria and followed them longitudinally up to 36 months of age. Periodic study visits included medical and seizure histories, physical and neurologic examinations, and developmental assessments. Ages at which major and minor features of TSC and seizures were first identified were analyzed.

Results

The most common initial presenting features of TSC were cardiac rhabdomyomas (59%) and hypomelanotic macules or other skin findings (39%), and 85% of infants presented with either or both. Ultimately, the most prevalent diagnostic TSC features were hypomelanotic macules (94%), tubers or other cortical dysplasias (94%), subependymal nodules (90%), and cardiac rhabdomyomas (82%). Thirty-five percent of infants presented prenatally, 41% presented at birth or within the first month of life, and 74% met criteria for TSC diagnosis at or within 30 days of presentation. Seizure onset occurred before or at initial presentation in only 15% of infants, but 73% developed epilepsy within the first year of life.

Conclusions

Infants with TSC can often be identified early, before the onset of neurologic sequelae, enabling earlier diagnosis, surveillance, and possibly disease-modifying treatment.

### Cutaneous manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex and the paediatrician's role [^115nbrRq]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation of TSC-associated cutaneous manifestations

The subtypes of skin lesions tend to develop in an age-dependent manner, many arising early in life. Figure 1 provides a general timeline when certain lesions are more likely to be seen, allowing physicians examining paediatric patients to tailor their index of suspicion accordingly. Some cutaneous features can be subtle, especially in young children, and they are not all specific for TSC.

Figure 1
Age-dependent expression of tuberous sclerosis complex–associated cutaneous manifestations. This figure was published in Dermatology, 3rd ed, Bolognia JL, Jorizzo JL, Schaffer JV, Chapter 61: Neurofibromatosis & Tuberous Sclerosis, 925–942, copyright Elsevier 2012.

Facial angiofibromas, sometimes erroneously referred to as adenoma sebaceum, are the most visually apparent TSC-associated, often starting to appear within the first 2–5 years of life and ultimately occurring in approximately 75% of patients. They are usually pink to red-brown papulonodules with a smooth, glistening surface and are typically distributed symmetrically on the face, at times mistaken for acne (figure 2 A). Angiofibromas start small and gradually increase in size, with their growth being augmented by puberty. Fibrous cephalic plaques are histologically similar and represent a larger variant of angiofibromas. They are raised, firm plaques, usually located on the forehead or scalp and have a tan to yellow-brown colour. Fibrous cephalic plaques, which can occur at any age, vary in size and shape and can grow to as large as several centimetres in diameter.

Nodular lichen myxedematosus (LM) is a rare disease and is one of the five subtypes of localized LM. It is distinctly characterized by multiple nodules on the trunk and limbs with or without papular lesions. A healthy 6-year-old boy presented with complaints of "knots" on his right chest, upper limb, and thigh for 4 months. To our knowledge this is the first case of nodular LM reported in a child.

### Nevoid telangiectasia patches in a 17-year-old boy [^116aqpsK]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Morphea, also known as localized scleroderma, is an autoimmune condition characterized by inflammation and sclerosis of the skin and underlying soft tissues. It is characterized by distinctive cutaneous inflammation and fibrosis, and damage which produce atrophy. Unlike systemic scleroderma, morphea does not often involve the extra-cutaneous systems and also lacks the specific antibodies as found in systemic scleroderma. While early presentations are often of an erythematous patch or edematous plaque, morphea can also appear as telangiectatic patches.

Question 2: What subtype of morphea does this patient have?
A. Circumscribed
B. Generalized
C. Linear
D. Pansclerotic
E. Mixed

Answer:
A. Circumscribed – Incorrect. Otherwise also known as plaque morphea, it begins as an erythematous-to-violaceous, edematous plaque of several centimeters and is most often located on the trunk with 3 or less lesions.
B. Generalized – Correct. Defined as 4 or more morpheaform plaques involving at least 2 different anatomic sites.
C. Linear – Incorrect. One or more linear streaks of cutaneous induration that may involve the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and underlying bone.
D. Pansclerotic – Incorrect. A very rare variant presenting with extensive full-thickness skin involvement sparing acral skin.
E. Mixed – Incorrect. A combination of 1 or more morphea subtypes.

The more modern and clinically appropriate classification, the 'Pauda criteria', divides morphea into circumscribed, generalized, linear, pansclerotic, and mixed subtypes. Each subtype has different clinical manifestations and degree of involvement of the subcutaneous soft tissues. The patient's findings were consistent with generalized morphea.

Question 3: Which is the most common extracutaneous manifestation associated with morphea?
A. Gastrointestinal
B. Neurological
C. Musculoskeletal/articular
D. Vascular
E. Respiratory

Answer:
A. Gastrointestinal – Incorrect. This includes gastrointestinal reflux.
B. Neurological – Incorrect. Such as in the en coup de sabre type, neurological abnormalities can include migraines, trigeminal neuralgia, seizures, behavioral changes, and learning disability.
C. Musculoskeletal/articular – Correct. This is the most common extracutaneous manifestation of morphea and includes sacroiliitis, generalized synovitis, and inflammatory arthritis.
D. Vascular – Incorrect. This can include Raynaud's phenomenon, deep vein thrombosis, and vasculitis.
E. Respiratory – Incorrect. This includes restrictive pulmonary disease, bronchopneumonia.

### Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma complicated by hemophagocytic syndrome with significant response to pralatrexate: a case report [^114CGEBK]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 54-year-old African American female presented with new-onset seizures, 20 pounds of unintentional weight loss, and nodular skin lesions over both arms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was normal, and a lumbar puncture was negative for infection or malignancy. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed multiple 1–2 cm bilateral axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes. A skin biopsy showed nonspecific chronic granulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis. Prednisone 20 mg daily was begun empirically. The patient was then referred to our dermatology clinic for further care.

Upon initial evaluation, persistent dermal nodules with scattered erythematous papules and variable overlying hemorrhagic crust involving the bilateral arms and torso, and palpable bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy were observed (Fig 1). Skin biopsies of the right arm and abdomen showed an atypical pannicular cytotoxic T-lymphocytic infiltrate positive for CD8 and T-cell receptor-beta-F1, with areas of adipocytic rimming, consistent with SPTCL (Fig 2, A - D). Positron-emission tomography/computed tomography scan showed extensive subcutaneous involvement and bilateral axillary nodes measuring 1–2 cm. Core needle biopsy of a right axillary lymph node revealed reactive changes with no evidence of malignancy.

### Geometric favre-racouchot syndrome following image-guided superficial radiation therapy [^1152LxNQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that the patient in Case 1 had additional NMSCs on the forearm and trunk. The forearm BCC was treated at the same time as the forehead lesion. The trunk lesion began treatment 6 months after the forehead and forearm lesions were treated. Neither of these other treatment sites developed comedones. This suggests that the location of the lesion may play a role in the development of FRS, especially in those actively smoking tobacco products during treatment. All 3 patients who developed FRS were treated for nodular BCC. It is unknown if there is a high predisposition for patients with this type of malignancy to develop FRS. It is possible that because BCC is the most common cutaneous malignancy, FRS is more likely to be seen with this malignancy. It is unknown if the underlying pathophysiological changes from BCC are more likely to cause FRS compared to SCC.

While the precise pathogenesis of FRS is not well understood, it is likely due to a combination of UV skin damage, acnegenic drugs, radiation, and tobacco exposure. It is believed that chronic UV exposure damages the elastic network in the upper and mid dermis through oxidative stress, causing dermal and epidermal atrophy and disorganized and thickened elastic fibers. As a result, these changes facilitate sebum retention and keratinization of pilosebaceous follicles. This creates an environment conducive to comedone, nodule, and cyst formation. Drugs that can cause acne include steroids, isoniazid, anticonvulsants, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs. More specifically, androgens can cause comedogenesis by activating androgen receptors located on cells of pilosebaceous ducts.

Radiation therapy and tobacco use can cause degenerative changes in connective tissue stroma similar to solar elastosis. We hypothesize that the degenerative changes caused by tobacco work synergistically with underlying actinic damage and radiation exposure, increasing the risk of developing FRS. Additionally, the high concentration of sebaceous glands on the face may also contribute to its formation. This theory is supported in Case 1 where the patient developed comedones after IG-SRT to the lesion on his forehead, but not at the treatment sites on his forearm and trunk, which are areas less exposed to tobacco smoke. In these cases, a combination of sun-damaged skin, radiation treatment, and direct contact with tobacco smoke may be the mechanism by which these comedones form.

### Innumerable nevi with giant congenital melanocytic nevus clinically mimicking neurofibromatosis: a diagnostic challenge [^113r92Q6]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Case report

A 31-year-old half Thai, half white woman presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of multiple disfiguring pigmented papules and nodules covering her entire body. Her dermatologic history was significant for a GCMN treated with curettage at age 2. The patient reported that she was born with many pigmented papules and nodules, which increased in number throughout her life. She was otherwise healthy with no cognitive deficits, seizures, evidence of neurocutaneous melanosis, or skeletal malformations. There was no family history of a similar skin disorder or neurofibromatosis.

Physical examination found a large plaque with residual skin-colored and pigmented nodules involving her left back (crossing midline), posterior neck, and left anterior chest. She had evidence of scar and residual pigmented patches and nodules consistent with regrowth after curettage of the GCMN, which covered an area with estimated greatest diameter of more than 60 cm. The patient also had greater than 1000 well-circumscribed, dome-shaped papules and exophytic, pedunculated nodules diffusely throughout the body, which ranged from 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter and were skin-colored to dark brown. Clinically, many of these lesions resembled NFs (Fig 1). Examination was negative for café-au-lait spots, axillary or groin freckling, ocular abnormalities including Lisch nodules, skeletal abnormalities, and any other abnormalities. No ophthalmologists or neurologists were consulted at this time. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of a representative shave biopsy from the right thumb revealed a melanocytic nevus, with clear nesting, melanin production, and a well-circumscribed proliferation of chiefly epithelioid nevomelanocytes within the dermis (Fig 2). The cells showed maturation with descent and some neurotization in the deeper extent. Comparative genomic hybridization found no gains or losses in chromosomal material.

### Corneal infantile myofibromatosis caused by Novel activating imatinib-responsive variants in… [^1167kyqE]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Infantile myofibromatosis (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] #228550) is a rare tumor of mesenchymal origin occurring with a prevalence of 1:150 000 life births. Characteristically, the fibrous tumor presents at birth or in early childhood. The tumorous lesions are most commonly located in the head and neck region and can present on the skin, soft tissue, bone, and visceral organs. Rare cases of ocular and periocular tissue involvement have been described including lesions of the sclera, as well as extraocular lesions of the eyelid skin, periorbital soft tissue, and orbital bones. Skin lesions are typically diagnosed early in life as they present as painless, subcutaneous, nodular, and blueish skin alterations with slight skin discoloration due to vascularization. If left untreated, the skin lesions can spontaneously resolve and leave a mark of skin indentation. Visceral involvement is associated with a poor prognosis of the disease. The localized form can occur at different sites. Corneal myofibromas have been described in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 2. Myofibromateous lesions characteristically show positive stainings for Vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), whereas they are negative for the vascular endothelial marker CD34, the melanin marker S-100, and have a low Ki-67 proliferation index.

### Common skin rashes in children | AAFP… [^112hWkJg]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Most children have a fever and sore throat one to two days before the rash develops on the upper trunk. The rash spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles, with characteristic circumoral pallor. This differs from some viral exanthems that develop more slowly. The rash is characterized by confluent, erythematous, blanching, fine macules, resembling a sunburn, and sandpaper-like papules. In skinfolds, such as the axilla, antecubital fossa, and buttock creases, an erythematous, nonblanching linear eruption may develop. Petechiae on the palate may occur, as well as erythematous, swollen papillae with a white coating on the tongue. Tinea Infection Tinea is a common fungal skin infection in children that may affect the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails.

The diagnosis is based on physical examination findings and is confirmed by potassium hydroxide microscopy, periodic acid–Schiff staining of hair follicles, or fungal culture. Tinea capitis, the most common skin infection in children in the United States, is characterized by scaling or circumscribed alopecia and broken hair follicles. Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy is another useful finding to distinguish tinea capitis from other causes of alopecia. The characteristic lesion found in children with tinea corporis is an erythematous annular patch or plaque with a raised border and central clearing; scaling along the border is common. The distribution of atopic dermatitis lesions can vary based on the age of the child. Infants and younger children often have lesions on the extensor surfaces of extremities, cheeks, and scalp. Older children and adults often present with patches and plaques on the flexor surfaces.

Hands and feet are also commonly affected. Thickened plaques with a lichenified appearance may be seen in more severe cases. Children with atopic dermatitis often have dry, flaky skin and are at risk of secondary cutaneous infections.

### Neuromyotonia: a skin-deep problem [^112CEUdW]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A 45-year-old woman was evaluated for right-sided hemicorporal scar-like skin lesions on her arm and thoracic and inguinal areas that appeared shortly after reduction mammoplasty. Five years later, she developed spontaneous cramps and involuntary abnormal, painful, twitching movements in the same areas. With time, the cramps worsened and disabled the patient. The use of her right arm triggered contractures of muscles and abnormal movements. A diagnosis of neuromyotonia (NMT) was established on the basis of clinical findings and on electromyographic findings of a burst of high-frequency motor unit potentials recorded in the right triceps in the area of skin lesions. The results of medullary, encephalic MRI as well as a comprehensive metabolic panel were normal. She was positive for antinuclear antibodies without specificity. Neither antineural antibodies nor antivoltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies (specifically, leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein 1 and contactin-associated protein-like-2) were detected. Her skin lesions were diagnosed as morphea. Two combined strategies of treatment were initiated: antiepileptic drugs for NMT and corticosteroids and methotrexate for morphea. NMT is a rare, debilitating neurological complication of morphea.

### Mapping lesion-related epilepsy to a human brain network… [^116UX7qN]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Lesion network nodes in the basal ganglia and cerebellum derived from ischemic stroke data were used as an a priori search space to test for similar findings in four validation data sets with different lesion etiologies. Negative functional connectivity to voxels in the basal ganglia and cerebellum was significantly associated with epilepsy in hematomas, traumas, tumors, and tubers. One-sided P values are shown after false discovery rate correction for multiple testing. Brain slices are shown in radiological orientation. A, Functional connectivity with the lesion network nodes in the basal ganglia and cerebellum defines a distributed brain network map of areas at increased risk or decreased risk of epilepsy when lesioned. Regions of increased risk in this network include the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, areas around the central sulcus, and CA1 region of the hippocampus.

Objective To assess whether lesion locations associated with epilepsy map to specific brain regions and networks. Design, Setting, and Participants. Lesion location mapping methods were used to test whether lesions associated with poststroke epilepsy map to a specific brain region. 10 We assessed lesion overlap of each lesion to the cortex, subcortex, cortical lobes and vascular territories. Since larger lesions are more likely to lead to epilepsy, 19 we controlled for lesion volume in all analyses. To identify any lesioned brain regions or voxels associated with epilepsy, we performed voxel-based lesion symptom mapping using both univariate and multivariate methods, correcting for lesion volume. 20–22. Functional connectivity between lesion locations and regions in the basal ganglia and cerebellum was strongly associated with poststroke epilepsy.

Specifically, lesion locations related to epilepsy were more negatively connected to the substantia nigra, globus pallidus internus, and cerebellum compared to control lesions. We refer to these regions as lesion network nodes. In each of the 4 other lesion types, negative functional connectivity between lesion locations and voxels in the substantia nigra, globus pallidus internus, and cerebellum was associated with epilepsy.

### Tuberous sclerosis complex: advances in diagnosis, genetics, and management [^115cWiDL]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant multisystem neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by the development of multiple hamartomas distributed throughout the body, skin, brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs. Two-thirds of patients represent sporadic mutations. The classic triad is seizures, mental retardation, and cutaneous angiofibromas. However, the full triad occurs in only 29% of patients; 6% of them lack all three of them. Two tumor suppressor genes responsible for TSC have been identified: TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 and TSC2 on chromosome 16. This article highlights the most recent significant advances in the diagnosis and genetics of TSC, along with a discussion on the limitations and the usefulness of the revised 1998 clinical criteria for the tuberous sclerosis complex. The "ash leaf" macule often comes in other shapes, such as round; most are polygonal, usually 0.5 cm to 2.0 cm in diameter, resembling a thumbprint. Since the death of its describer, Thomas Fitzpatrick, we call each a "Fitzpatrick patch". Special attention is paid in this work to TSC treatment options, including therapeutic trials with rapamycin, also known as sirolimus.

Learning Objective

After completing this learning activity, participants should familiar with tuberous sclerosis complex, its cutaneous signs and systemic findings stratified by patient age, its genetics, and the potential for meaningful therapeutic intervention.

### Skin involvement and outcome measures in systemic autoimmune diseases [^114dUujP]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

This paper focuses on skin manifestations that can be observed in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjögren syndrome (SS), dermatomyositis (DM) and Behçet syndrome (BS). In RA the most widely recognized skin lesion is the rheumatoid nodule. Other cutaneous manifestations can be observed either non-specific or related to the disease itself and/or to the commonly used drugs. Cutaneous manifestations are considered one of the most typical extraglandular features of primary SS, generally they are distinguished in vasculitic and non vasculitic lesions. Among non-vasculitc lesions, skin dryness (xerosis) has been shown to be very common in pSS while vasculitis lesions include typically flat and palpable purpura and urticarial vasculits. In DM the skin manifestations are also frequent and include a heliotrope rash (blue-purple discoloration) on the upper eyelids with edema, a flat red rash on the face and upper trunk, and erythema of the knuckles with a raised violaceous scaly eruption (Gottron rash). The most frequent mucocutaneous finding in BS is aphthous stomatitis which can not usually be differentiated from idiopatic reccurrent aphthous stomatitis on clinical grounds. The most typical skin manifestations are nodular lesions, which are commonly seen in BS and may be due to panniculitis [erythema nodosum (EN)-like lesions] or superficial thrombophlebitis.

Hereditary renal cell carcinoma — features of tuberous sclerosis (TSC) include major features such as renal angiomyolipoma; cortical dysplasias, including tubers and cerebral white matter migration lines; angiofibromas (≥ 3) or fibrous cephalic plaque; hypomelanotic macules (3 to > 5 mm in diameter); subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA); and ungual fibromas (≥ 2). Minor features include "Confetti" skin lesions (numerous 1- to 3-mm hypopigmented macules scattered over regions of the body such as the arms and legs), dental enamel pits (> 3), and intraoral fibromas (≥ 2). The combination of angiomyolipoma and LAM does not meet criteria for definite diagnosis, and multiple angiomyolipoma are a major feature.

### Phakomatoses [^113R9Nbv]. Dermatologic Clinics (2019). Medium credibility.

Phakomatoses present with characteristic findings on the skin, central or peripheral nervous system, and tumors. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most common syndrome and is characterized by Café-au-lait macules, intertriginous freckling, Lisch nodules, and tumors including neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and gliomas. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is characterized by benign hamartomas presenting with hypomelanotic macules, shagreen patches, angiofibromas, confetti lesions and tumors including cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and tumors of the kidney, lung, and heart. Managing these disorders requires disease specific supportive care, tumor monitoring, surveillance for selected cancers, and treatment of comorbid conditions.

### What is that nodule? A diagnostic approach to evaluating subcutaneous and cutaneous nodules [^114wrkQ8]. Journal of Clinical Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, subcutaneous nodules can be caused by tuberous sclerosis complex, xanthoma, erythema elevatum diutinum, sparganosis, cystercosis, echinococcosis, lepromatous leprosy, sporotrichosis, Kaposi sarcoma, botryomycosis, zygomycosis, onchocerciasis, cysticercosis, eccrine spiradenoma, panniculitis, rheumatic fever, neurofibromatosis, rheumatoid arthritis and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. In addition, subcutaneous nodules can be caused by medications such as pregabalin.

### Scalp fibroma: a rare cutaneous manifestation of tuberous sclerosis [^111Kup3r]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We report a case of a 23-year-old woman with a history of generalised tonic-clonic seizures, reddish brown maculopapular swelling over the face and an enlarging swelling over the scalp. Physical examinations revealed angiofibroma of the face and other typical cutaneous lesions of tuberous sclerosis, for example, shagreen patch and periungual fibroma. Scalp swelling was labelled as fibroma by dermatologists, which was further supported by the histopathological findings. Fibroma of the face is one of the commonest lesions, however, fibroma of the scalp is a rarely described entity.

Case report

A 13-year-old boy was referred to our outpatient clinic with a large patch of nonscarring alopecia on the left fronto-parietal scalp dating since birth (Fig 1). History of epileptic fits along with weakness confined to the right side of his body was reported by the parents at the age of 4 years. There was neither a history of parental consanguinity or birth trauma nor a family history of developmental problems. General examination findings were normal except for a slight increase in the head circumference, which was above normal for age at 23.6 inches (average 20.5–22 inches). Mental development was otherwise normal. On dermatologic examination, multiple skin-colored skin papules resembling skin tags were noticed on the left upper eyelid and eyebrow (Fig 2, A). Small depressed atrophic macules were also seen on the left side of the forehead and above the left eyebrow. Ophthalmologic evaluation of the left eye found conjunctival congestion, hypertrophy of the bulbar conjunctiva, and a yellowish red conjunctival nodule consistent with limbal dermoid (Fig 2, B). Fundus examination of both eyes was normal.

Neurologic examination found spasticity (hypertonia and hyperreflexia) at the right side indicating upper motor neuron lesion. Computed tomography scan of the brain showed a left parieto-occipital porencephalic cyst, left temporal arachnoid cyst, and left parietal schizencephaly encroaching the left cerebral hemisphere along with cerebral calcifications (Fig 3). Electrocardiography, echocardiography, abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging of spine, and x-ray of the jaw were unremarkable.

Biopsy specimens were taken from the 3 involved sites: the hairless patch, the lid papules, and the hypertrophied conjunctiva. Histopathologic examination of the involved scalp found absent hair follicles and fibrovascular stroma with remnants of degenerated muscle fibers (Fig 4). Biopsy of the lid papules found hamartomatous mass of fibrovascular stroma resembling an angiofibroma (Fig 5), while the conjunctival biopsy found fat deposition of mature adipocytes (Fig 6). Minimal inflammatory infiltrate in the form of lymphocytes together with small collections of mast cells were evident at higher magnification in both skin and conjunctival lesions. In addition, vascular hyperplasia of variable-sized blood vessels was prominent in all biopsy specimens. Based on the existing clinical, pathologic, and imaging findings, a diagnosis of Haberland syndrome was made.
