## Question

What are the most common symptoms of allergic reactions caused by black mold exposure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common symptoms of allergic reactions caused by black mold exposure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "black mold" typically refers to and whether it meaningfully changes symptom patterns. Then, I should verify the established mechanisms of mold-related disease and which of those are relevant to allergy. Next, I will review high-quality sources to extract the most frequently reported symptoms. After that, I should distinguish true allergic symptoms from irritant or toxic attributions. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized list and note modifiers such as asthma, atopy, and exposure context, while double-checking for any overstatements I need to correct.

> Let me first confirm the entity in question. "Black mold" in public discourse usually refers to Stachybotrys chartarum, but wait, let me verify whether Stachybotrys produces a unique allergic symptom profile compared with other molds. The medical literature indicates that Stachybotrys is a minor indoor component and that while it can produce mycotoxins, there is no convincing evidence that inhalation of Stachybotrys spores causes a distinct human disease beyond what is seen with other molds, and allergic symptoms from molds are generally nonspecific to genus in sensitized individuals [^3b8292a4] [^a692a1a9].

> Next, I should review the accepted mechanisms of mold-related illness to anchor which symptoms are truly allergic. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: molds can cause disease via allergy (IgE-mediated), infection (in immunocompromised hosts), and irritation from volatile organic compounds or spores, but the latter is not an allergic mechanism. I need to ensure I focus on IgE-mediated allergic symptoms and avoid conflating irritant or unsubstantiated toxic effects with allergy [^08b7ff24] [^4a055321] [^3324d342].

> I will now examine authoritative summaries for the most common allergic symptoms. The CDC consistently lists nasal congestion or runny nose, sneezing, red or itchy eyes, coughing or wheezing, and skin rash as the principal effects in mold-sensitive people, with symptoms often overlapping with other aeroallergen responses. Let me double-check that these are framed as allergic rather than purely irritant, and yes, they are described in the context of mold allergy and asthma exacerbation risk in sensitized individuals [^e6f4ac3b] [^7c3b0117] [^7ca323a6].

> Let me consider the relative frequency of these symptoms in clinical cohorts. In a series of 65 patients presenting with mold-related complaints, rhinitis was reported by 62%, cough by 52%, and respiratory symptoms overall by 34%, with 53% demonstrating skin test reactivity to molds; this supports nasal and respiratory symptoms being the most prevalent allergic manifestations in mold-exposed, symptomatic individuals, though I should note this is a small, selected sample and not a population-based prevalence study [^2cbb4249].

> Hold on, I should verify the distinction between allergic and irritant effects. Mold can cause irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, skin, or lungs even in people who are not allergic, which can mimic allergy but is mechanistically different; I need to ensure I flag this so we don't over-attribute nonallergic irritation to IgE-mediated disease. The CDC and ACMT emphasize that while irritant symptoms can occur, the evidence for clinically meaningful inhalational mycotoxin toxicity in indoor settings is weak, reinforcing that most consistent, reproducible symptoms in mold-exposed individuals are allergic or irritant rather than toxic [^7c3b0117] [^4a055321] [^3324d342].

> Next, I should review modifiers that change risk and severity. People with asthma or atopy are more likely to have pronounced symptoms, and dampness-related exposures can exacerbate asthma; hypersensitivity pneumonitis can occur in susceptible hosts exposed to high microbial burdens, though that is a distinct immune-mediated lung disease rather than simple IgE allergy. I need to ensure I don't conflate HP with allergic rhinitis or asthma, as HP presents with flu-like systemic symptoms and pulmonary findings rather than isolated upper airway complaints [^6e38a711] [^e9e967c4] [^7c3b0117].

> Let me synthesize the most common allergic symptoms hierarchically, while keeping the strength of evidence in mind. Based on CDC summaries and clinical series, the most frequent allergic symptoms from mold exposure are upper respiratory: nasal congestion or runny nose and sneezing; ocular: red, itchy, or watery eyes; lower respiratory: cough and wheeze, particularly in those with asthma; and dermatologic: skin rash or urticaria in sensitized individuals. I should confirm that this aligns with general allergic disease patterns, and yes, these mirror typical aeroallergen responses with prominence of mucosal and cutaneous symptoms [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117] [^2cbb4249].

> But wait, what if someone claims "brain fog" or chronic fatigue from black mold? I need to check whether those are established allergic symptoms. The literature does not support chronic neurocognitive symptoms as part of IgE-mediated mold allergy; such complaints are typically categorized as nonspecific, unproven, or related to other mechanisms and should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses rather than being attributed to mold allergy per se [^4a055321] [^3324d342] [^0d31a647].

> Final answer, keeping it clinically actionable: The most common allergic symptoms attributable to mold exposure, including so-called black mold, are nasal congestion or runny nose, sneezing, red or itchy eyes, cough or wheeze, and skin rash, with symptom expression modulated by atopy and asthma status. These reflect IgE-mediated hypersensitivity rather than mycotoxin toxicity, and their prevalence and severity rise with sensitization and ongoing exposure to damp, moldy environments [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117] [^2cbb4249].

---

The most common symptoms of allergic reactions to black mold (Stachybotrys chartarum) are **respiratory symptoms** — nasal congestion, sneezing, coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath — especially in people with asthma or mold sensitization [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117]. Other frequent effects include **eye irritation** (red, itchy, watery eyes), **skin rash or hives**, and **throat irritation** [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117]. These symptoms are typically IgE-mediated and occur with exposure to mold spores or fragments; they are not due to mycotoxin toxicity, which remains unproven from indoor inhalation [^4a055321] [^3324d342]. Severe reactions can occur in sensitized individuals, but anaphylaxis is rare [^notfound].

---

## Respiratory symptoms

Respiratory symptoms are the **most common** allergic response to black mold exposure, particularly in individuals with asthma or mold sensitization [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117]:

- **Nasal congestion**: Stuffiness or runny nose is frequently reported [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

- **Sneezing**: Common in allergic reactions to mold spores [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

- **Coughing**: Persistent cough, often accompanied by wheezing, is common [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

- **Wheezing**: Especially prevalent in individuals with asthma or other respiratory conditions [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

- **Shortness of breath**: Difficulty breathing, particularly during physical activity or in enclosed spaces with mold exposure [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

---

## Ocular symptoms

Exposure to black mold can cause **significant eye irritation**, including:

- **Redness**: Bloodshot or irritated eyes are common [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

- **Itching**: Persistent itching sensation in the eyes [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

- **Watery eyes**: Excessive tearing or watering of the eyes [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

---

## Dermatological symptoms

Skin reactions are also common, particularly in individuals with **sensitive skin** or pre-existing dermatological conditions:

- **Skin rash**: Generalized or localized rashes may occur upon exposure to mold spores [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

- **Hives**: Urticaria, characterized by raised, itchy welts on the skin [^notfound].

- **Itching**: Generalized itching or pruritus without visible rash [^notfound].

---

## Throat and sinus symptoms

Black mold exposure can also cause **throat and sinus-related symptoms**, including:

- **Sore throat**: Irritation or scratchiness in the throat [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

- **Throat irritation**: Persistent irritation or discomfort in the throat [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

- **Sinus congestion**: Pressure or fullness in the sinuses, often accompanied by headaches [^notfound].

---

## Severity and variability of symptoms

The severity and type of allergic symptoms vary depending on **individual susceptibility**, the **duration and intensity of exposure**, and the presence of **underlying conditions** such as asthma or immunodeficiency. Individuals with asthma or compromised immune systems may experience more severe reactions, including exacerbation of asthma symptoms and increased risk of respiratory infections [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

---

## Conclusion

The most common symptoms of allergic reactions to black mold exposure include **respiratory symptoms** (nasal congestion, sneezing, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath), **ocular symptoms** (redness, itching, watery eyes), **dermatological symptoms** (skin rash, hives, itching), and **throat and sinus symptoms** (sore throat, throat irritation, sinus congestion). These symptoms are typically allergic in nature and vary in severity based on individual susceptibility and exposure levels [^e6f4a711] [^7c3b0117].

### Are indoor molds causing a new disease? [^ab420802]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms for disease caused by mold-infection, allergy, and toxicity-are established and well recognized by clinicians. In each case the corresponding diseases are specific to a particular fungus. The mechanisms involved include a recognized inflammatory pathology that leads to objective clinical evidence of disease. Recent widespread litigation has arisen out of an unproved assertion that exposure to indoor molds causes an ill-defined illness. This illness is characterized by the absence of objective evidence of disease and by the lack of a defined pathology. There is usually no specificity for the involved fungus purported to cause the illness. Those publications that claim such an illness are reviewed. They are found to lack scientific validity, often on the basis of faulty methodology and insufficient information. There is no coherent clinical description for the presumed illness. Recommendations are offered for published reports and studies to address this problem.

### The myth of mycotoxins and mold injury [^712a8a33]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

In recent years, mold has been blamed for many symptoms or a constellation of symptoms. These symptoms are usually vague and subjective and difficult or impossible to measure or quantify. Moreover, there is no scientific evidence that mold has anything to do with these symptoms. In particular, the concept of toxic mold syndrome has permeated the public consciousness, and mycotoxins have falsely been associated with autoimmune diseases and a variety of other conditions. In fact, there is no evidence that the presence of mycotoxins in the air is enough to cause any disease known to man. Molds legitimately can cause allergies and can be a trigger for asthma. Certain specific molds such as Aspergillus can be a cause of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In immunocompromised hosts, both dermatologic and systemic infections can result from various fungi and can be associated with significant morbidity or even mortality. However, the existence of toxic mold syndrome has been disproven, despite the numerous disreputable practices such as testing homes for mold spores, measuring "mycotoxins" in the urine, and testing patients for IgG to mold. In truth, none of these techniques have been validated, nor do they have any relevance to any clinical disease. All that these tests that are being performed by laboratories of disrepute does is to further propagate misinformation and inflict unnecessary and often exorbitant costs on patients desperate for a clinical diagnosis, right or wrong, for their constellation of maladies.

### Allergy and "toxic mold syndrome" [^2cbb4249]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

"Toxic mold syndrome" is a controversial diagnosis associated with exposure to mold-contaminated environments. Molds are known to induce asthma and allergic rhinitis through IgE-mediated mechanisms, to cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis through other immune mechanisms, and to cause life-threatening primary and secondary infections in immunocompromised patients. Mold metabolites may be irritants and may be involved in "sick building syndrome". Patients with environmental mold exposure have presented with atypical constitutional and systemic symptoms, associating those symptoms with the contaminated environment.

Objective

To characterize the clinical features and possible etiology of symptoms in patients with chief complaints related to mold exposure.

Methods

Review of patients presenting to an allergy and asthma center with the chief complaint of toxic mold exposure. Symptoms were recorded, and physical examinations, skin prick/puncture tests, and intracutaneous tests were performed.

Results

A total of 65 individuals aged 1 1/2 to 52 years were studied. Symptoms included rhinitis (62%), cough (52%), headache (34%), respiratory symptoms (34%), central nervous system symptoms (25%), and fatigue (23%). Physical examination revealed pale nasal mucosa, pharyngeal "cobblestoning", and rhinorrhea. Fifty-three percent (33/62) of the patients had skin reactions to molds.

Conclusions

Mold-exposed patients can present with a variety of IgE- and non-IgE-mediated symptoms. Mycotoxins, irritation by spores, or metabolites may be culprits in non-IgE presentations; environmental assays have not been perfected. Symptoms attributable to the toxic effects of molds and not attributable to IgE or other immune mechanisms need further evaluation as to pathogenesis. Allergic, rather than toxic, responses seemed to be the major cause of symptoms in the studied group.

### Mold and human health: a reality check [^52195f77]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

There are possibly millions of mold species on earth. The vast majority of these mold spores live in harmony with humans, rarely causing disease. The rare species that does cause disease does so by triggering allergies or asthma, or may be involved in hypersensitivity diseases such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or allergic fungal sinusitis. Other hypersensitivity diseases include those related to occupational or domiciliary exposures to certain mold species, as in the case of Pigeon Breeder's disease, Farmer's lung, or humidifier fever. The final proven category of fungal diseases is through infection, as in the case of onchomycosis or coccidiomycosis. These diseases can be treated using anti-fungal agents. Molds and fungi can also be particularly important in infections that occur in immunocompromised patients. Systemic candidiasis does not occur unless the individual is immunodeficient. Previous reports of "toxic mold syndrome" or "toxic black mold" have been shown to be no more than media hype and mass hysteria, partly stemming from the misinterpreted concept of the "sick building syndrome". There is no scientific evidence that exposure to visible black mold in apartments and buildings can lead to the vague and subjective symptoms of memory loss, inability to focus, fatigue, and headaches that were reported by people who erroneously believed that they were suffering from "mycotoxicosis". Similarly, a causal relationship between cases of infant pulmonary hemorrhage and exposure to "black mold" has never been proven. Finally, there is no evidence of a link between autoimmune disease and mold exposure.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Allergenic extract is used for diagnostic testing and for the treatment (immunotherapy) of patients whose histories indicate that upon natural exposure to the allergen, they experience allergic symptoms. Confirmation is determined by skin testing. Diagnostic use of allergenic extracts usually begins with direct skin testing. This product is not intended for treatment of patients who do not manifest immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the allergenic extract following skin testing.

### The medical effects of mold exposure [^08b7ff24]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Exposure to molds can cause human disease through several well-defined mechanisms. In addition, many new mold-related illnesses have been hypothesized in recent years that remain largely or completely unproved. Concerns about mold exposure and its effects are so common that all health care providers, particularly allergists and immunologists, are frequently faced with issues regarding these real and asserted mold-related illnesses. The purpose of this position paper is to provide a state-of-the-art review of the role that molds are known to play in human disease, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, sinusitis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In addition, other purported mold-related illnesses and the data that currently exist to support them are carefully reviewed, as are the currently available approaches for the evaluation of both patients and the environment.

### Toxic mold: phantom risk vs science [^ca0f5fe8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the available literature on the subject of fungi (molds) and their potential impact on health and to segregate information that has scientific validity from information that is yet unproved and controversial.

Data Sources

This review represents a synthesis of the available literature in this area with the authors' collective experience with many patients presenting with complaints of mold-related illness.

Study Selection

Pertinent scientific investigation on toxic mold issues and previously published reviews on this and related subjects that met the educational objectives were critically reviewed.

Results

Indoor mold growth is variable, and its discovery in a building does not necessarily mean occupants have been exposed. Human response to fungal antigens may induce IgE or IgG antibodies that connote prior exposure but not necessarily a symptomatic state. Mold-related disease has been discussed in the framework of noncontroversial and controversial disorders.

Conclusions

When mold-related symptoms occur, they are likely the result of transient irritation, allergy, or infection. Building-related illness due to mycotoxicosis has never been proved in the medical literature. Prompt remediation of water-damaged material and infrastructure repair should be the primary response to fungal contamination in buildings.

### Indoor air quality and health does fungal contamination play a significant role? [^5007e5e2]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Fungal contamination in buildings can vary greatly, and their presence in a dwelling does not necessarily constitute exposure. Measurement of mold spores and fragments varies depending on the methodology and instruments used. Meaningful comparison of data is rarely possible. The presence of a specific immune response to a fungal antigen only connotes that exposure to one or more related species has occurred, but not that there is a symptomatic clinical state. The response of individuals to indoor bioaerosols is complex and depends on age, gender, state of health, genetic makeup, and degree and time of bioaerosol exposure. In general, mold contamination in buildings is associated with incursion of water or moisture, which should be remedied as efficiently as possible. When disease occurs, it more likely is related to transient annoyance or irritational reactions. Allergic symptoms may be related to mold proliferation in the home environment. Because molds are encountered both indoors and outdoors, it is difficult to determine where the sensitivity initially arose and if the response is solely provoked by either an indoor or outdoor source. As an indoor allergen, mold is considered to be an infrequent participant in the induction of allergic disease when compared with housedust mites, animal dander, and cockroach allergens. Infection in healthy individuals is rare and usually is caused by an outdoor source. Building-related disease caused by mycotoxicosis has not been proved in the medical literature.

### Clinical evaluation and management of patients with suspected fungus sensitivity [^23819184]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Fungus-sensitized patients usually present with symptoms that are similar to symptoms presented by those who are sensitized to other aeroallergens. Therefore, diagnosis and management should follow the same pathways used for patients with allergic conditions in general. The physician should consider that a relationship between fungal exposure and symptoms is not necessarily caused by an IgE-mediated mechanism, even when specific fungal IgE is detected. Until recently, IgE-mediated allergy has been documented only for a limited number of fungi. We propose a series of questions to be used to identify symptoms that occur in situations with high fungal exposure and a limited skin-prick-test panel (Alternaria, Cladosporium, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Candida) that can be amplified only in cases of high suspicion of other fungal exposure (eg, postfloods). We also review in vitro testing for fungi-specific IgE. Treatment includes environmental control, medical management, and, when appropriate, specific immunotherapy. Low-quality evidence exists supporting the use of subcutaneous immunotherapy for Alternaria to treat allergic rhinitis and asthma, and very low quality evidence supports the use of subcutaneous immunotherapy for Cladosporium and sublingual immunotherapy for Alternaria. As is the case for many allergens, evidence for immunotherapy with other fungal extracts is lacking. The so-called toxic mold syndrome is also briefly discussed.

### Organic dusts and disease: a continuous research challenge [^6122de39]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Research on organic dust during recent years has revealed major clinical effects and some causative agents. Many of the symptoms reported are caused by an inflammation in the airways, characterized by a neutrophil response. This condition can cause a non-allergic asthma. There are also reactions characterized by lymphocyte accumulation and by specific IgE antibody formation. Causative agents identified as bacterial endotoxins, molds, and different allergens.

### Adverse human health effects associated with molds in the indoor environment [^a692a1a9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Molds are common and important allergens. About 5% of individuals are predicted to have some allergic airway symptoms from molds over their lifetime. However, it should be remembered that molds are not dominant allergens and that the outdoor molds, rather than indoor ones, are the most important. For almost all allergic individuals, the reactions will be limited to rhinitis or asthma; sinusitis may occur secondarily due to obstruction. Rarely do sensitized individuals develop uncommon conditions such as ABPA or AFS. To reduce the risk of developing or exacerbating allergies, mold should not be allowed to grow unchecked indoors. When mold colonization is discovered in the home, school, or office, it should be remediated after the source of the moisture that supports its growth is identified and eliminated. Authoritative guidelines for mold remediation are available. Fungi are rarely significant pathogens for humans. Superficial fungal infections of the skin and nails are relatively common in normal individuals, but those infections are readily treated and generally resolve without complication. Fungal infections of deeper tissues are rare and in general are limited to persons with severely impaired immune systems. The leading pathogenic fungi for persons with nonimpaired immune function, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus, and Histoplasma, may find their way indoors with outdoor air but normally do not grow or propagate indoors. Due to the ubiquity of fungi in the environment, it is not possible to prevent immunecompromised individuals from being exposed to molds and fungi outside the confines of hospital isolation units. Some molds that propagate indoors may under some conditions produce mycotoxins that can adversely affect living cells and organisms by a variety of mechanisms. Adverse effects of molds and mycotoxins have been recognized for centuries following ingestion of contaminated foods. Occupational diseases are also recognized in association with inhalation exposure to fungi, bacteria, and other organic matter, usually in industrial or agricultural settings. Molds growing indoors are believed by some to cause building-related symptoms. Despite a voluminous literature on the subject, the causal association remains weak and unproven, particularly with respect to causation by mycotoxins. One mold in particular, Stachybotrys chartarum, is blamed for a diverse array of maladies when it is found indoors. Despite its well-known ability to produce mycotoxins under appropriate growth conditions, years of intensive study have failed to establish exposure to S. chartarum in home, school, or office environments as a cause of adverse human health effects. Levels of exposure in the indoor environment, dose-response data in animals, and dose-rate considerations suggest that delivery by the inhalation route of a toxic dose of mycotoxins in the indoor environment is highly unlikely at best, even for the hypothetically most vulnerable subpopulations. Mold spores are present in all indoor environments and cannot be eliminated from them. Normal building materials and furnishings provide ample nutrition for many species of molds, but they can grow and amplify indoors only when there is an adequate supply of moisture. Where mold grows indoors there is an inappropriate source of water that must be corrected before remediation of the mold colonization can succeed. Mold growth in the home, school, or office environment should not be tolerated because mold physically destroys the building materials on which it grows, mold growth is unsightly and may produce offensive odors, and mold is likely to sensitize and produce allergic responses in allergic individuals. Except for persons with severely impaired immune systems, indoor mold is not a source of fungal infections. Current scientific evidence does not support the proposition that human health has been adversely affected by inhaled mycotoxins in home, school, or office environments.

### Inhalational mold toxicity: fact or fiction? A clinical review of 50 cases [^ff94ef4a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Three well-accepted mechanisms of mold-induced disease exist: allergy, infection, and oral toxicosis. Epidemiologic studies suggest a fourth category described as a transient aeroirritation effect. Toxic mold syndrome or inhalational toxicity continues to cause public concern despite a lack of scientific evidence that supports its existence.

Objectives

To conduct a retrospective review of 50 cases of purported mold-induced toxic effects and identify unrecognized conditions that could explain presenting symptoms; to characterize a subgroup with a symptom complex suggestive of an aeroirritation-mediated mechanism and compare this group to other diagnostic categories, such as sick building syndrome and idiopathic chemical intolerance; and to discuss the evolution of toxic mold syndrome from a clinical perspective.

Methods

Eighty-two consecutive medical evaluations were analyzed of which 50 met inclusion criteria. These cases were critically reviewed and underwent data extraction of 23 variables, including demographic data, patient symptoms, laboratory, imaging, and pulmonary function test results, and an evaluation of medical diagnoses supported by medical record review, examination, and/or test results.

Results

Upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract, systemic, and neurocognitive symptoms were reported in 80%, 94%, 74%, and 84% of patients, respectively. Thirty patients had evidence of non-mold-related conditions that explained their presenting complaints. Two patients had evidence of allergy to mold allergens, whereas 1 patient exhibited mold-induced psychosis best described as toxic agoraphobia. Seventeen patients displayed a symptom complex that could be postulated to be caused by a transient mold-induced aeroirritation.

Conclusion

The clinical presentation of patients with perceived mold-induced toxic effects is characterized by a disparate constellation of symptoms. Close scrutiny revealed a number of preexisting diagnoses that could plausibly explain presenting symptoms. The pathogenesis of aeroirritation implies completely transient symptoms linked to exposures at the incriminated site. Toxic mold syndrome represents the furtive evolution of aeroirritation from a transient to permanent symptom complex in patients with a psychogenic predisposition. In this respect, the core symptoms of toxic mold syndrome and their gradual transition to chronic symptoms related to nonspecific environmental fragrances and irritants appear to mimic what has been observed with other pseudodiagnostic categories, such as sick building syndrome and idiopathic chemical intolerance.

### Health effects of mold in children [^e1a36695]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Mold is ubiquitous, and exposure to mold and its products of metabolism is unavoidable, whether indoors or outdoors. Mold can produce a variety of adverse health outcomes by four scientifically validated pathophysiologic mechanisms: hypersensitivity, toxicity, infection, and irritation. Some adverse health outcomes have been attributed to mold for which mechanisms of injury are not well defined or are implausible. This article discusses these adverse health outcomes, focusing predominantly on those for which valid associations have been established.

### Mold… [^e6f4ac3b]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Mold can look like spots of many different colors, and it can smell musty. If you see or smell mold, you should remove it.
- If mold is growing in your home, you need to clean up the mold andfix the moisture problem.
- Learn what mold is, how to prevent it, and how to clean it up. Possible health effects Exposure to damp and moldy environments may cause a variety of health effects, or none at all. For some people, mold can cause a stuffy nose, sore throat, coughing or wheezing, burning eyes, or skin rash. People with asthma or who are allergic to mold may have severe reactions. Immune-compromised people and people with chronic lung disease may get infections in their lungs from mold. For people who are sensitive to molds exposure to molds can lead to symptoms such as stuffy nose, wheezing, and red or itchy eyes, or skin.

Severe reactions, such as fever or shortness of breath, may occur among workers exposed to large amounts of molds in occupational settings, such as farmers working around moldy hay. In 2004 the Institute of Medicine found there was sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure to mold with upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, and wheeze in otherwise healthy people; with asthma symptoms in people with asthma; and with hypersensitivity pneumonitis in individuals susceptible to that immune-mediated condition. In 2009, the World Health Organization issued additional guidance, the WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould. Other recent studies have suggested a potential link of early mold exposure to development of asthma in some children, particularly among children who may be genetically susceptible to asthma development, and that selected interventions that improve housing conditions can reduce morbidity from asthma and respiratory allergies.

If you use bleach mix bleach with ammonia or other cleaners. This will produce a poisonous gas. Never
- Follow manufacturers' instructions when you use bleach or any other cleaning product.
- Open windows and doors to provide fresh air.
- Wear rubber boots, rubber gloves, and goggles during cleanup. For more information, read the guide on safely cleaning up mold.

### Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: current concepts and future questions [^e9e967c4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis) caused by inhaled allergens can progress to disabling or even fatal end-stage lung disease. The only truly effective treatment is early recognition and control of exposure. Although patients produce antibody exuberantly, the immunopathogenesis involves cellular immunity — notably, CD8(+) cytotoxic lymphocytes, multinucleate giant cell granulomas, and ultimately interstitial fibrosis. Many causative agents have been recognized in occupational dusts or mists, but most current new cases arise from residential exposure to pet birds (pigeons and parakeets), contaminated humidifiers, and indoor molds. The symptoms and physical findings are nonspecific. Serum IgG containing high titers of specific antibody to the offending antigen is elevated. Pulmonary function tests show restrictive and diffusion defects with hypoxemia, especially after exercise. Occasionally, small airways disease causes obstruction. Radio-graphic changes vary according to the stage of the disease and are best evaluated by means of high-resolution computed tomography. In typical cases, the history of a known exposure and the presence of a characteristic interstitial lung disease with serologic confirmation of IgG antibody to the offending antigen suffice for diagnosis. In more obscure cases, observation of changes after a natural environmental exposure, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy might be indicated. Among the many questions that remain are the following: What is the prevalence of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and how often is it the cause of chronic interstitial fibrosis? What is the long-term prognosis? Why do most individuals exposed to these antigens develop a vigorous antibody response whereas only a few develop the disease? How does exposure to endotoxin and cigarette smoking affect the disease? To answer these questions, standardized and validated clinical laboratory immunochemical tests are needed, in addition to a systematic approach to diagnosis, classification of disease severity, risk assessment, and management. This review is limited to the disease caused by airborne allergens and focuses on its immunopathogenesis, eliciting agents, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prognosis.

### Self-reported adverse reactions associated with mycoprotein (quorn-brand) containing foods [^16f194ae]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Mycoprotein, which is produced by a mold and is the basis of Quorn-brand meat substitutes, is a novel cause of allergic and gastrointestinal reactions, but little information has been available on its associated symptomatology.

Objective

To describe the nature and frequency of adverse reactions to mycoprotein.

Methods

Self-reports of adverse reactions to mycoprotein were collected via a Web-based questionnaire (www.quorncomplaints.org) and then analyzed.

Results

Analysis of 1,752 adverse reactions found that Quorn products caused allergic and gastrointestinal symptoms, with some people experiencing both. Allergic reactions, including urticaria and anaphylaxis, occurred within 4 hours of consumption in 312 people. Of those reactions, 45.8%, 1 fatal, began within 1 hour of exposure. Of those 312 individuals, 188 (60.3%) reported repeated reactions after repeated consumption of Quorn, and 2 people experienced 8 reactions (13 people did not say whether they experienced more than 1 reaction). Quorn foods caused gastrointestinal symptoms, including emesis and diarrhea, within 8 hours of consumption in 1,692 people. Of the gastrointestinal symptoms, 66.6% occurred 46 to 180 minutes after consumption of the products. Symptoms ranged from mild nausea to emesis severe enough to warrant medical attention.

Conclusion

Mycoprotein may be causing numerous and sometimes life-threatening allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. The acceptance in the food supply of this nonessential ingredient deserves reconsideration.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^97ecdd8c]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Mold — exposure and health effects in indoor environments — includes routine exposure to more than 200 species of fungi indoors and outdoors, and certain molds can cause allergic reactions and immune responses (e.g., asthma), infectious disease (e.g., histoplasmosis), and toxic effects. An Institute of Medicine (IOM) review found sufficient evidence for an association between damp indoor environments and upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, wheeze, hypersensitivity pneumonitis in susceptible persons, and asthma symptoms in sensitized persons; a previous review concluded sufficient evidence for associations between fungal allergen exposure and asthma exacerbation and upper respiratory disease. Mold toxins can cause direct lung damage leading to pulmonary diseases other than asthma, and despite media attention, no good evidence supports that residential mold problems are more frequent now than in past years. Allergic sensitization is common: an estimated 6%–10% of the general population and 15%–50% of those who are genetically susceptible are sensitized to mold allergens, and fifty percent of the 937 children in a large multicity asthma study showed sensitivity to mold. Many molds also produce mycotoxins that can be a health hazard on ingestion, dermal contact, or inhalation.

### Procedures to assist health care providers to determine when home assessments for potential mold exposure are warranted [^391c3595]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Drawing evidence from epidemiology and exposure assessment studies and recommendations from expert practice, we describe a process to guide health care providers helping their patients who present with symptoms that might be associated with living in damp housing. We present the procedures in the form of a guided 2-part interview. The first part has 5 questions that triage the patient toward a more detailed questionnaire that reflects features of housing conditions known to be reliably associated with exposures to mold and dampness contaminants. We chose the questions based on the conditions associated with moisture problems in homes across the United States and Canada. The goal is to facilitate the clinician's effort to help patients reduce exposure to environmental triggers that elicit symptoms to better manage their disease.

Mold toxin exposure by inhalation and ingestion has significant health consequences for humans. In this article, we discuss the sources of these everyday toxins and their relevance to patient health. The effects of mycotoxins can present across all body systems, and the resulting symptoms can be acute, cumulative, and chronic. These effects can occur discretely, but they can also present alongside other clinical entities. It is important for the clinician to recognize the phenomenon of mycotoxin illness, because as a primary cause, it does not resolve with current standards of care for conditions secondary to it.

### Health problems | Mold… [^7c3b0117]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Research has found that people who spend time in damp buildings report health problems including respiratory symptoms and infections, developing or worsening asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis or hay fever, and eczema. Allergies Allergies or allergic responses to mold are common. In mold-allergic individuals, inhaling or touching mold may cause an allergic response, such as the following:

- Sneezing
- Nasal stuffiness or runny nose
- Red, itchy, or watery eyes
- Skin rash Mold can also cause irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, skin, or lungs even in people who are not allergic to mold. Asthma Asthma is a lung disease that affects the airways in the lungs. Airways can become inflamed and narrowed at times. This makes it harder for air to flow out of the lungs when breathing out. People with asthma may have one or more of the following symptoms:

- Coughing
- Wheezing
- Chest tightness
- Shortness of breath.

Asthma is associated with exposure to irritants, allergens, and physical conditions called triggers. Many asthma triggers can be in the workplace. Research shows evidence of an association between damp indoor spaces and asthma symptoms in individuals with pre-existing asthma. This means exposure to molds in workplaces can make pre-existing asthma worse. There is also evidence of an association between damp indoor spaces and new-onset asthma. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an immune system disorder. It causes the lungs to become inflamed in reaction to certain substances like:

- Inhaled bacteria
- Fungi
- Plant protiens
- Animal proteins
- Chemicals It can seem like the flu or pneumonia, but hypersensitivity pneumonitis does not get better with antibiotics for infection. Symptoms of this illness can vary.

Some persons experience:

- Shortness of breath
- Cough
- Muscle aches
- Chills
- Fever
- Night sweats
- Extreme fatigue
- Weight loss Symptoms may improve after a few hours or days when away from the substance or allergen causing illness. Likewise, hypersensitivity pneumonitis may be work-related if a worker's symptoms and medical tests improve when away from work and worsen when returning to work. With continued exposure, persistent lung inflammation over time could lead to permanent lung damage.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^c054427b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

For individuals with asthma who have allergy symptoms or a test result suggesting that they are allergic to dust mites, the Expert Panel recommends using multicomponent interventions to reduce dust mite levels in the home and improve asthma outcomes. Use of pillow and mattress covers alone does not improve asthma outcomes.

Overall, the studies of allergen mitigation strategies provide low certainty of evidence that these strategies are beneficial for key asthma outcomes. Therefore, the Expert Panel recommends tailored allergen intervention strategies only for individuals with asthma who are exposed to these specific allergens and have either symptoms based on clinical history or an allergy to these substances based on allergy testing.

Based on current data on the use of a variety of single-component and multicomponent strategies to reduce exposure to allergens, the Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementing allergen exposure reduction strategies:
Allergen mitigation strategies can be used in individuals of all ages with asthma of all levels of severity.
Clinicians need to tailor mitigation strategies to the individual based on their allergy symptoms, sensitization, and exposures. Clinicians should consider allergen testing when appropriate, before committing individuals to specific allergen mitigation strategies that may be burdensome. See Table IIIA for allergen-specific mitigation interventions addressed in the systematic review report. Table IIIB summarizes the certainty of evidence on various allergen mitigation interventions.
The Expert Panel recognizes the existing inequities in access to specialists and allergen testing. The panel therefore advises clinicians to, at a minimum, take a clinical history of symptoms and exposures for all individuals with asthma to help determine the need for allergen mitigation.
Allergy testing (with a skin prick or allergen-specific IgE test) may have false-positive and false-negative results, and certain allergens (eg, dust) may also act as irritants. For an individual whose symptoms worsen on exposure to specific aeroallergens, the Expert Panel recommends that the clinician consider mitigating that aeroallergen even if the individual's test result is negative.
Some of the interventions examined provide no or low certainty of evidence about their efficacy in improving asthma outcomes (including exacerbations, quality of life, asthma control, and symptoms). The Expert Panel recognizes that some of the interventions, especially integrated pest management and mold mitigation, may have broader public health benefits. However, these interventions do not replace routine good practices, including regular and frequent house cleaning and laundering of bedding materials.
Some people are allergic to dander (flakes of skin) or saliva from pets. The few studies on pet removal have had inconclusive results. However, if an individual with asthma experiences symptoms around a pet, the individual should consider removing the pet from the home, keeping the pet outdoors, or, if neither of these options is feasible, keeping the pet out of commonly used rooms. Testing for sensitization to pets may be particularly worthwhile for those with chronic or uncontrolled symptoms and might help support what can be a difficult decision to remove a pet from the home.
Some cleaning and integrated pest management interventions may trigger asthma and/or be hazardous. Individuals with asthma need to balance the potential benefits and harms of interventions before implementing them.
If an individual with asthma has sensitization to an allergen on skin prick testing and is exposed to that allergen but has no objective evidence of worsened disease control and denies having symptoms, chronic exposure could have led to the development of clinical tolerance to that allergen in that environment. Allergen-specific mitigation strategies could adversely modify this established balanced relationship between the individual and the environment.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians need to consider the complexity of the patient population and the limitations of the evidence identified. Clinicians may also find it helpful to consider the severity of a patient's asthma, the small benefit, and the extent of previous symptoms and exacerbations when recommending allergen mitigation interventions. Allergen mitigation interventions may be expensive or difficult for patients to use or maintain. Clinicians should consider the cost implications of certain interventions, especially among those with limited financial resources, and assess the magnitude of the potential value of an intervention in improving an individual's asthma outcomes.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^18bdf23f]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergy diagnostic testing — fungi clinical significance and categorization are constrained by confounders and sampling limits; Summary Statement 159 states that the clinical significance of a single fungus test reagent may be difficult to ascertain because of sampling method, culture conditions, nonculturable species, allergenic differences between spores and hyphae, and preferential ecologic niches (A), and Summary Statement 160 notes that for clinical purposes molds are often characterized as outdoors (Alternaria and Cladosporium), indoors (Aspergillus and Penicillium), or both (Alternaria, Aspergillus, and Penicillium) (B). Traditional gravity or Rotorod air sampling equipment does not collect fungal spores as efficiently as pollens, and many counting stations have not differentiated fungal forms. Although clinicians sense that fungi contribute to respiratory allergy with dark-spored asexual forms especially implicated, apart from the association of spore blooms with thunderstorms there is little evidence linking exposure to well-defined single agents with isolated or recurring morbidity.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions include, but are not limited to urticaria; itching; edema of extremities; respiratory wheezing or asthma; dyspnea; cyanosis; tachycardia; lacrimation; marked perspiration; flushing of face, neck or upper chest; mild persistent clearing of throat; hacking cough or persistent sneezing.

1)	Local Reactions

A mild burning immediately after injection is expected; this usually subsides in 10–20 seconds. Prolonged pain or pain radiating up arm is usually the result of intramuscular injection, making this injection route undesirable. Subcutaneous injection is the recommended route.

Small amounts of erythema and swelling at the site of injection are common. Reactions should not be considered significant unless they persist for at least 24 hours or exceed 50 mm in diameter.

Larger local reactions are not only uncomfortable, but indicate the possibility of a severe systemic reaction if dosage is increased. In such cases dosage should be reduced to the last level not causing reaction and maintained for two or three treatments before cautiously increasing.

Large, persistent local reactions or minor exacerbations of the patient's allergic symptoms may be treated by local cold applications and/or use of oral antihistamines.

2)	Systemic Reactions

Systemic reactions range from mild exaggeration of patient's allergic symptoms to anaphylactic reactions.14Very sensitive patients may show a rapid response. It cannot be overemphasized that, under certain unpredictable combinations of circumstances, anaphylactic shock is always a possibility. Fatalities are rare but can occur.5Other possible systemic reaction symptoms are fainting, pallor, bradycardia, hypotension, angioedema, cough, wheezing, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and urticaria.13, 14

Careful attention to dosage and administration limit such reactions. Allergenic extracts are highly potent to sensitive individuals and OVERDOSE could result in anaphylactic symptoms. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians administering allergenic extracts understand and prepare for treatment of severe reactions. Refer to "OVERDOSAGE" section.

### Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis [^e8661d00]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

This article reviews the history of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and the clinical, pathologic, and radiographic criteria necessary to establish its diagnosis and differentiate this disease from other types of chronic rhinosinusitis. Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis is a noninvasive fungal form of sinus inflammation characterized by an often times unilateral, expansile process in which the typical allergic "peanut-butter-like" mucin contributes to the formation of nasal polyps, hyposmia/anosmia, and structural changes of the face. IgE sensitization to fungi is a necessary, but not sufficient, pathophysiologic component of the disease process that is also defined by microscopic visualization of mucin-containing fungus and characteristic radiological imaging. This article expounds on these details and others including the key clinical and scientific distinctions of this diagnosis, the pathophysiologic mechanisms beyond IgE-mediated hypersensitivity that must be at play, and areas of current and future research.

Groups with disproportionate exposure — people of color and low-income families are described as more likely than others to live in poor housing conditions, with more than twice as many non-Hispanic Black individuals reporting living in substandard housing as White individuals. An even larger racial disparity in nonmetropolitan areas is noted, with African American households 3 times as likely to live in low-quality housing. Low-income and non-White students are more likely to attend schools with dilapidated infrastructure, and exposure to cockroach and mouse allergen was highly prevalent in the school environment among children in socioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods. In one project, African American children had more than 2 times the odds of sensitization to A alternata compared with White children, and mold sensitization was identified as a significant predictor of asthma-related emergency department visits in Black children.

WARNINGS

Refer to boxed "WARNINGS", "PRECAUTIONS", "ADVERSE REACTIONS" and "OVERDOSAGE" sections for additional information on serious adverse reactions and steps to be taken, if any occur.

Extreme caution is necessary when using diagnostic skin tests or injection treatment in highly sensitive patients who have experienced severe symptoms or anaphylaxis by natural exposure, or during previous skin testing or treatment. IN THESE CASES THE POTENCY FOR SKIN TESTS AND THE ESCALATION OF THE TREATMENT DOSE MUST BE ADJUSTED TO THE PATIENT'S SENSITIVITY AND TOLERANCE.

Benefit versus risk needs to be evaluated in steroid dependent asthmatics, patients with unstable asthma or patients with underlying cardiovascular disease.

Injections should never be given intravenously. A 5/8 inch, 25 gauge needle on a sterile syringe allows deep subcutaneous injection. Withdraw plunger slightly after inserting needle to determine if a blood vessel has been entered.

Proper measurement of dose and caution in making injection will minimize reactions. Adverse reactions to allergenic extracts are usually apparent within 20–30 minutes following injection of immunotherapy.

Extract should be temporarily withheld or dosage reduced in case of any of the following conditions: 1) flu or other infection with fever; 2) exposure to excessive amounts of allergen prior to injection; 3) rhinitis and/or asthma exhibiting severe symptoms; 4) adverse reaction to previous injection until cause of reaction has been evaluated by physician supervising patient's immunotherapy program.

### Racial differences in odds of asthma exacerbations among aspergillus fumigatus-sensitized adults with asthma [^4925ee72]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Allergic sensitization to mold is a risk factor for poor asthma outcomes, but whether it accounts for disparities in asthma outcomes according to race or socioeconomic status is not well-studied.

Objective

To identify factors associated with allergic sensitization to molds and evaluate associations of sensitization to molds with asthma exacerbations after stratifying by race.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with asthma who had an outpatient visit to a large health system between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2023 and received aeroallergen testing to Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium, Alternaria, and Cladosporium. We used logistic regression models to evaluate factors associated with mold sensitization and the effect of mold sensitization on asthma exacerbations in the 12 months before testing, overall and then stratified by race.

Results

A total of 2732 patients met the inclusion criteria. Sensitization to each mold was negatively associated with being a woman (odds ratios [ORs] ≤ 0.59, P ≤ .001 in 5 models) and positively associated with the Black race (ORs ≥ 2.16 vs White, P < .0005 in 5 models). In the full cohort, sensitization to molds was not associated with asthma exacerbations (ORs = 0.95–1.40, P ≥ .003 in 5 models and all above the corrected P value threshold). Among 1032 Black patients, sensitization to A fumigatus, but not to other molds, was associated with increased odds of asthma exacerbations (OR = 2.04, P < .0005).

Conclusion

Being a man and Black race were associated with allergic sensitization to molds. Sensitization to A fumigatus was associated with asthma exacerbations among Black patients but not the overall cohort, suggesting that A fumigatus allergy is a source of disparities in asthma outcomes according to race.

### Impact of fungi on immune responses [^60f0a003]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Spores and fungal fragments found in indoor and outdoor environments originate from opportunistic fungi and they can contribute to inflammatory responses, causing a broad range of symptoms. Papers were selected and reviewed with an emphasis on the molecular mechanisms involved in the effect of fungi on immune cells, especially mast cells (MCs). Fungi can bind to antibodies and complement them, allowing them to be recognized by cells of the innate immune system, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and MCs, which are then stimulated via Toll-like receptor signaling. Fungi can cause diseases mediated by MCs and aggravate allergic inflammation. Immunosuppressed subjects can be particularly susceptible to developing diseases caused by opportunistic fungi. Mold also liberates mycotoxins that could be on volatile spores and stimulate MCs to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, but this mechanism is not known. Fungi can activate the immune system directly or through mycotoxins, leading to stimulation of immune cells and chronic neuroinflammatory symptoms. Some of these processes may be inhibited by the new anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 37.

### Indoor fungal exposure [^c5bb84bc]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Fungi affect humans in complex ways and are capable of eliciting a number of disease responses, such as infectious, allergic, and irritant and toxic effects. Fungal exposure is unequivocally associated with exacerbations of asthma, although the role of fungi in causing the disease is yet to be determined. The association between home dampness and respiratory health effects is strong, and fungal exposure is suspected to be associated with this linkage. Fear of toxin exposures has generated debate over the possible toxic health effects of airborne fungi; however, several recent reviews discount the health impacts of mycotoxin through indoor exposures. Nevertheless, fungal contamination of indoor environments is undesirable. Knowledge of sources and characteristics of fungal spore release and dispersal are important for understanding the processes of exposure. Environmental monitoring for fungi and their disease agents are important aspects of exposure assessment, but few guidelines exist for interpreting their health impacts. Much work is needed in isolating, characterizing and standardizing fungal disease agents to properly assess the prevalence of fungal health effects.

### Climate change, exposome change, and allergy: a review [^f111277e]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Climate change is a major threat to human respiratory health and associated allergic disorders given its broad impact on the exposome. Climate change can affect exposure to allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, molds, as well as other factors such as temperature, air pollution, and nutritional factors, which synergistically impact the immune response to these allergens. Exposome change can differentially exacerbate allergic reactions across subgroups of populations, especially those who are more vulnerable to environmental stressors. Understanding links between climate change and health impacts can help inform how to protect individuals and vulnerable populations from adverse health effects.

### The role and abatement of fungal allergens in allergic diseases [^fcfadc1c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Sensitivity to a variety of fungi is known to be a factor in allergic rhinitis and asthma. In this review methods for measuring exposure to fungi in the indoor environment are evaluated. A variety of markers for the presence of fungi are also described in addition to their known relationship to either toxic or adverse immunologic effects. Key studies documenting the clinical effects of different types of fungi are also reviewed, as well as a description of abatement methods that either have been successful or need further investigation. Although many studies have shown an association between exposure to fungi and allergic disease, in many cases a direct cause-and-effect relationship has not been established. Improved knowledge of the epidemiology and mechanisms behind fungal-induced human disease will hopefully establish this causal link and suggest methods for reducing morbidity.

However, the cause-and-effect relationship between inhalational exposure to mold and other untoward health effects (eg, acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in infants and other illnesses and health complaints) requires additional investigation. Pediatricians play an important role in the education of families about mold, its adverse health effects, exposure prevention, and remediation procedures.

### Mold… [^6e38a711]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Mold can look like spots of many different colors, and it can smell musty. If you see or smell mold, you should remove it.
- If mold is growing in your home, you need to clean up the mold andfix the moisture problem.
- Learn what mold is, how to prevent it, and how to clean it up. Possible health effects Exposure to damp and moldy environments may cause a variety of health effects, or none at all. For some people, mold can cause a stuffy nose, sore throat, coughing or wheezing, burning eyes, or skin rash. People with asthma or who are allergic to mold may have severe reactions. Immune-compromised people and people with chronic lung disease may get infections in their lungs from mold. For people who are sensitive to molds exposure to molds can lead to symptoms such as stuffy nose, wheezing, and red or itchy eyes, or skin.

Severe reactions, such as fever or shortness of breath, may occur among workers exposed to large amounts of molds in occupational settings, such as farmers working around moldy hay. In 2004 the Institute of Medicine found there was sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure to mold with upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, and wheeze in otherwise healthy people; with asthma symptoms in people with asthma; and with hypersensitivity pneumonitis in individuals susceptible to that immune-mediated condition. In 2009, the World Health Organization issued additional guidance, the WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould. Other recent studies have suggested a potential link of early mold exposure to development of asthma in some children, particularly among children who may be genetically susceptible to asthma development, and that selected interventions that improve housing conditions can reduce morbidity from asthma and respiratory allergies.

If you use bleach mix bleach with ammonia or other cleaners. This will produce a poisonous gas. Never
- Follow manufacturers' instructions when you use bleach or any other cleaning product.
- Open windows and doors to provide fresh air.
- Wear rubber boots, rubber gloves, and goggles during cleanup. For more information, read the guide on safely cleaning up mold.

### Characterization of a population presenting with suspected mold-related health effects [^d4f0b94b]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous epidemiologic studies have reported a relationship between dampness and increased respiratory symptoms in adults and children, which has led to increasing concerns among the general population about potential mold-related health effects.

Objective

To identify characteristics of patients with possible mold-related health effects that might help allergists better understand how to evaluate such patients in their practices.

Methods

The parameters that were evaluated for the total population included age, sex, upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms, systemic symptoms, atopic status, pet ownership, smoking history, mold sensitization, mold exposure, and exposure location. Subgroups stratified by atopic status, mold sensitization, and indoor mold exposure confirmed by an environmental mold report prepared by certified industrial hygienists were also analyzed. Significant associations were determined by correlation coefficients and logistic regression analysis.

Results

A total of 135 patients with possible mold-related health effects secondary to prolonged indoor mold exposure were evaluated. For the overall population, a strong correlation was found among atopy, mold sensitization, and sensitization to specific molds identified in the patient's environmental report. Mold intracutaneous testing was not useful for discriminating between atopic and nonatopic individuals. There were no associations among the patients' presenting symptoms, atopic status, and magnitude of mold exposure. Similar findings were identified when subgroup analysis was performed.

Conclusions

Patients who present with mold-related health effects manifest heterogeneous characteristics. Medical history, skin testing, and current indoor mold sampling practices have significant limitations in establishing a causal link among mold exposure health effects.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^33a9207c]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) — clinical features and diagnosis: ABPA is a complex pulmonary disease characterized by repeated episodes of wheezing, fleeting pulmonary opacities and development of bronchiectasis, sometimes with malaise, weight loss and hemoptysis, and some patients expectorate brownish sputum plugs; ABPA is most commonly diagnosed in people with asthma or cystic fibrosis due to a hypersensitivity response to Aspergillus fumigatus, a common indoor and outdoor mold; diagnosis is based on composite criteria including immediate hypersensitivity reaction to A. fumigatus, total serum IgE, specific IgG to A. fumigatus, radiological features and blood eosinophils; sensitization to fungal allergens, without the full picture of ABPA, is often found in asthma, particularly in severe asthma, where it is sometimes called 'severe asthma with fungal sensitization'.

### Mold sensitization is common amongst patients with severe asthma requiring multiple hospital admissions [^18806bdc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

One of the fungi which we investigated and for which antigenic extracts are available, Candida albicans, is a yeast, does not become airborne but does produce hyphae in tissue. Thus it is possible that human asthma due to fungal allergens may have three sources of allergen exposure – outdoor mold spores, indoor mold spores and endogenous fungal growth on body surfaces including the skin and gut.

Fungal sensitization is relatively uncommon in our British asthma patients and in Finnish schoolchildren compared with Arizona and Australia where up to 31% of asthmatic children and up to 23% of non-asthmatic controls react to at least one fungal allergen. The prevalence of Alternaria sensitization in Italian patients with respiratory symptoms ranges from 2% in Northern Italy to 29% in Southern Italy. Some of these differences are probably due to difficulties in the standardization of mold allergen extracts or skin testing techniques. Also fungal sensitization is commoner in children and declines with age. However, it is likely that the significance of a positive skin test to fungal allergens varies in different climatic zones. Our data and those of O'Hollaren, Sureik and Black suggests that fungal skin sensitization tests may identify adults who are at risk of especially severe asthma. The difference in the prevalence of mold sensitization between patients with multiple asthma admissions and the other groups in our study was so striking that it is extremely unlikely to have occurred by chance. Mold allergy tests may be useful to screen for children and adults who are at greatly increased risk of developing severe or fatal asthma. A large prospective study will be required to confirm these preliminary findings.

2 RISK AND RISK ASSESSMENT

Risk is defined as "[exposure to] the possibility of loss, injury, or other adverse or unwelcome circumstance; a chance or situation involving such a possibility" (Oxford English Dictionary). Risk is ubiquitous in all aspects of life, and many entities, including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the WHO‐International Programme for Chemical Safety (WHO‐IPCS), have produced definitions specific to their own activities. All of these definitions have in common the concept of risk as probability, associated with uncertainty about the outcome. The concept of risk is wide‐ranging, and any discussion must therefore carefully define the risk concept at issue to avoid confusion and ambiguity.

2.1 Risk and health outcomes

The risk to allergic consumers associated with allergenic foods is the probability and nature of an adverse event (ie, an allergic reaction) following exposure. This concept of risk clearly includes not only the probability that an effect will be experienced, but also a consideration of what that effect might be, that is, severity. In this context, the most appropriate operational definition of risk is that proposed by WHO‐IPCS in Environmental Health Criteria 240 5 as "a function of the probability of an adverse health effect and the severity of that effect, consequential to a hazard(s) in food".

Assessment of the risk associated with allergenic foods, as defined above, has been extensively discussed. 6, 7 In the approach described, the hazard is characterized through modelling the population dose distribution of MEDs obtained through double‐blind, placebo‐controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs). 8, 9 The generation of these data from human studies is a strength, but the methodology used for DBPCFC (where challenges are stopped at objective symptoms) limits our ability to characterize the effect of dose on reaction severity. Better knowledge about the severity component and how it varies with dose would provide great benefit, reducing uncertainty among the susceptible population and giving them more choice through the reduced need for PAL.

Figure 1 illustrates semiquantitatively the risks associated with allergic reactions, characterized as type (as symptom severity) and relative frequency of outcomes following allergen exposure, ranging from no symptoms to life‐threatening symptoms and finally to death, a rare but unpredictable outcome. As discussed below, the perception of severity can differ significantly among stakeholders including allergic individuals, their parents/carers, and healthcare professionals, even for the same reactions.

We designed an online platform named "Health Diary" to collect participants' daily health behaviors, perception of environmental conditions, exposure to allergens, contacts with persons with ILI, indoor and outdoor exposure time, and self-report of any uncomfortable symptoms including asthma-related symptoms. The platform utilized a responsive web design to facilitate filling in the questionnaire through computer, mobile phone or tablet. Upon enrollment, participants were asked to fill in their demographic data including gender, age, township of residence, whether they had dehumidifiers at home, whether they had carpets at home, whether they had black mold spots on the walls, and whether they had been clinically diagnosed with asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis.

In sleeping behavior, the diary questionnaire items included what time they got up and went to bed, and sleeping quality (very good, good, fair, poor, very poor). Among food intake, we listed 10 categories of food including (1) whole grains, rootstock, rice and flour, (2) vegetables, (3) fruits, (4) meat, (5) seafood, (6) legumes, (7) eggs, (8) dairy products, (9) fried foods, and (10) desserts and sugary drinks. The portions of the food were measured on five-point scales (i.e. 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3+) with different units. Each food category on the online questionnaire item was accompanied by an explanation to ensure all participants had the same understanding of the size of a portion. The participants recorded both exercise intensity and time. In health-related status, the participants reported their overall mood during the past day, and any uncomfortable symptoms such as breathing difficulty or wheezing, persistent cough without catching a cold, pain in the throat, chest pain, sneezing, nasal congestion, itchy eyes or skin, fever (> 38 °C), clinically diagnosed cold, encountering persons with ILI symptoms, and using ICS or a bronchodilator. Environment-related items in the diary included experience of secondhand exposure in the working space or at home, whether they played with hairy pets, whether they saw cockroaches at home, the types and time duration of transportation, how long they stayed indoors, the perceptions of temperature (very cold, cold, fair, hot, or very hot), and outdoor/indoor air quality (very bad, bad, fair, good, or very good), which was grouped into two categories of bad air quality (very bad, bad) and the others in the analysis.

### Mushroom allergy and anaphylaxis [^7d7205ca]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Third, Table I in Ali and Smith, which details the results of testing of 27 cases of mushroom allergy identified in the authors' literature review, shows that cooked mushroom species were used for in vivo testing of samples from almost every patient. Only in case 14 was a boiled mushroom used for in vivo testing. Cooking is the preparation of any food with heating by using methods such as grilling, frying, etc. However, as a cooking method, boiling is performed in water. Should a cooking method such as boiling or frying with heat be used as a reliable standard method, or should a more sensitive method to detect mushroom allergy be used? I think that a short discussion of this issue would be good here.

Regarding a few minor points, the case discussed in by Ali and Smithhere is not the first from Australia; it differs from the previously reported case in that the case patient was slightly older and developed a slightly more severe hypersensitivity reaction — a grade 3 hypotensive reaction according to Brown's anaphylaxis grading system. In the literature, as shown in Table I in Ali and Smith, a grade 2 (moderate-grade anaphylaxis) anaphylactic reaction to A bisporus and Agaricus campestris in a 13-year-old male from Australia has been reported previously. This previously reported case also involved an adult without sensitization following occupational exposure to boiled A bisporus as well as exposure to other edible mushroom varieties.

The sentence "Although exposure to edible fungal spores (especially in occupational settings) can lead to sensitization with rhinitis" in the second paragraph of Ali and Smith's introduction is not clear. Here, the authors consider the possibility that those with a mushroom food allergy may be especially sensitized to mold fungal allergens owing to cross-reactive antigens, which may in turn lead to allergic rhinitis symptoms.

In conclusion, I would like to thank Ali and Smith for their case report and its results, which are accompanied by a good, high-quality literature review and inform us about mushroom food allergy.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse systemic reactions usually occur within minutes and consist primarily of allergic symptoms such as: generalized skin erythema, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, rhinitis, wheezing, laryngeal edema, itching of nose and throat, breathlessness, dyspnea, coughing, hypotension and marked perspiration. Less commonly, nausea, emesis, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and uterine contractions may occur. Severe reactions may cause anaphylaxis or shock and loss of consciousness and rarely death.

The treatment of systemic allergic reactions is dependent upon the system complex. Antihistamines may offer relief of recurrent urticaria, associated skin reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms. Corticosteroids may provide benefit if symptoms are prolonged or recurrent. (See Overdose section)

Local Reactions consisting of erythema, itching, swelling tenderness and sometimes pain may occur at the injection site. These reactions may appear within a few minutes to hours and persist for several days. Local cold applications and oral antihistamines may be effective treatment. For marked and prolonged local reactions the use of antihistamines or anti-inflammatory medications may be dictated. Serious adverse reactions should be reported to Nelco Laboratories immediately and a report can be filed to: MedWatch, The FDA Medical Product Problem Reporting Program, at 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852–9787, call 1-800-FDA-1088.

### Spectrum of noninfectious health effects from molds [^017d580f]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Molds are multicellular fungi that are ubiquitous in outdoor and indoor environments. For humans, they are both beneficial (for the production of antimicrobial agents, chemotherapeutic agents, and vitamins) and detrimental. Exposure to mold can occur through inhalation, ingestion, and touching moldy surfaces. Adverse health effects may occur through allergic, infectious, irritant, or toxic processes. The cause-and-effect relationship between mold exposure and allergic and infectious illnesses is well known. Exposures to toxins via the gastrointestinal tract also are well described. However, the cause-and-effect relationship between inhalational exposure to mold toxins and other untoward health effects (eg, acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in infants and other illnesses and health complaints) is controversial and requires additional investigation. In this report we examine evidence of fungal-related illnesses and the unique aspects of mold exposure to children. Mold-remediation procedures are also discussed.

### Innate and adaptive immune response to fungal products and allergens [^13decc0d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Exposure to fungi and their products is practically ubiquitous, yet most of this is of little consequence to most healthy individuals. This is because there are a number of elaborate mechanisms to deal with these exposures. Most of these mechanisms are designed to recognize and neutralize such exposures. However, in understanding these mechanisms it has become clear that many of them overlap with our ability to respond to disruptions in tissue function caused by trauma or deterioration. These responses involve the innate and adaptive immune systems usually through the activation of nuclear factor kappa B and the production of cytokines that are considered inflammatory accompanied by other factors that can moderate these reactivities. Depending on different genetic backgrounds and the extent of activation of these mechanisms, various pathologies with resulting symptoms can ensue. Complicating this is the fact that these mechanisms can bias toward type 2 innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, to understand what we refer to as allergens from fungal sources, we must first understand how they influence these innate mechanisms. In doing so it has become clear that many of the proteins that are described as fungal allergens are essentially homologues of our own proteins that signal or cause tissue disruptions.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Refer to "STORAGE" section for proper storage condition for allergenic extract. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Some allergenic extracts naturally precipitate.

Physicians undertaking immunotherapy should be concerned with patient's degree of sensitivity. The initial dilution of allergenic extract, starting dose, and progression of dosage must be carefully determined on the basis of the patient's history and results of skin tests. Strongly positive skin tests may be risk factors for systemic reactions. Less aggressive immunotherapy schedules may be indicated for such patients.

Precaution is necessary when using extract mixture for skin testing. The diluting effect of individual components within a mixture may cause false negative reactions. Patients extremely sensitive to a common allergen in several components of a mixture may be more likely to experience a systemic reaction than when skin tested individually for each component.9

PRICK-PUNCTURE TESTING: To identify highly sensitive individuals and as a safety precaution, it is recommended that a prick-puncture test using a drop of the extract concentrate be performed prior to initiating very dilute intradermal testing. Prick-puncture testing is performed by placing a drop of extract concentrate on the skin and puncturing the skin through the drop with a small needle such as a bifurcated vaccinating needle. The most satisfactory sites on the back for skin testing are from the posterior axillary fold to 2.5 cm from the spinal column, and from the top of the scapula to the lower rib margins. The best areas on the arms are the volar surfaces from the axilla to 2.5 or 5 cm above the wrist, skipping the anticubital space. A positive reaction is approximately 10–15 mm erythema with 2.5 mm wheal. Smaller, less conclusive reactions may be considered positive in conjunction with a definitive history of symptoms on exposure to the allergen. The more sensitive the patient the higher the probability that he/she will have symptoms related to the exposure of the offending allergen. Hence, the importance of a good patient history. Less sensitive individuals can be tested intradermally with an appropriately diluted extract.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) position on mold-related inhalation exposures — ACMT reaffirms its support and endorsement of the Institute of Medicine- now the National Academy of Medicine(NAM) - report on Damp Indoor Spaces and Health and notes that, although this position statement was not reaffirmed by NAM, we continue to support their 2004 position. ACMT agrees with NAM and AWMF that damp indoor spaces present health risks to humans in association with allergic mechanisms resulting from fungi, dust mites, bacteria, cockroaches, and possibly other antigens that proliferate in moist environments, and concurs that residences, schools, offices, and other buildings should be designed to prevent water intrusion, and that when water damage or chronic moisture is identified it should be remediated as soon as possible.

### ACMT position statement: medical toxicology considerations in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with concerns about mold-related inhalation exposures [^3410b8f0]. ACMT (2025). High credibility.

ACMT position statement — laboratory testing for mycotoxin exposure assessment notes that "mycotoxin antibody testing" has been utilized in epidemiological studies of damp indoor spaces but states that identification or measurement of antibodies to mycotoxins is not an accepted method to assess human exposure, has not been validated in well-designed epidemiological studies, and is not recommended for the assessment of human exposure to mycotoxins. The document further clarifies that fungal immunoassay tests, including immunoglobulin testing for IgG and IgE, can be clinically useful for immunological conditions from exposure to fungal antigens but do not provide information about the source or magnitude of exposure to mycotoxins and therefore have no role in exposure assessment in this context.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^a1e4e844]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Some but not all study findings suggested that multicomponent interventions that included mold mitigation reduce symptoms to an extent. The results of studies of multicomponent interventions that included pet removal were inconclusive.

Most studies did not examine harms, and none reported any important harms from the various allergen mitigation strategies studied. Because of the lack of benefits identified and the potential harms from applications of chemicals, the Expert Panel does not recommend the use of acaricides.

Rationale and discussion

Overall approach for developing allergen mitigation recommendations.

When developing each of the four recommendations in this section, the Expert Panel considered the benefits and harms of each of the allergen mitigation interventions and the level of evidence available for assessing the interventions. In addition, the Expert Panel considered the acceptability of the interventions to individuals with asthma and their providers as well as the ease of use, costs, and impact on health equity of each intervention.

Potential harms.

Although the identified harms from most of the interventions were minimal, studies rarely examined harms. Therefore, the Expert Panel considered theoretical harms, patient burden, and initial and ongoing costs in its recommendations. For example, the Expert Panel's judgment was that interventions for mold mitigation and carpet removal could be associated with risks or be costly or difficult to complete. Another Expert Panel determination was that impermeable pillow and mattress covers are low-risk interventions with limited costs but are likely to require frequent cleaning of the bedding above the covers to be effective.

Prioritization of outcomes.

Furthermore, the Expert Panel considered the impact of the interventions on asthma symptoms as a critical outcome. The Expert Panel recognized that none of the studies used a validated outcome measure of asthma symptoms, and the definition of asthma symptoms was not standardized across studies. However, asthma symptoms are a relevant patient-centered outcome that was important to individuals with asthma in focus groups and that could be particularly relevant to assess for low-risk interventions.

### Mold sensitization is common amongst patients with severe asthma requiring multiple hospital admissions [^01523039]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

A key question is whether severe asthma is actually caused by sensitivity to molds or is simply associated with it. In any case, mold sensitivity will certainly not be the only cause of severe attacks of asthma; upper respiratory tract virus infections and some drugs being two of other well documented causes. The greater degree of mold sensitization in the severe asthma group could simply reflect an extreme example of the generalized increase in atopy amongst this group. However, we believe that mold allergy may be responsible for severe asthma attacks for several reasons.

First, the temporal relationship between high environmental spore counts and asthmatic attacks is strong. Airborne spore levels may be up to 1000 times higher than pollen levels. The data of Targonski and colleagues provide strong evidence that asthma deaths in Chicago are more likely to occur on days when local mold spore counts are high. High mold spore counts have been associated with asthma admissions in New Orleans (adults) and in Derby, UK (adults and children). Asthma symptoms are increased in California and Pennsylvania on days when mold spore counts are high. The young patients of O'Hollaren and colleagues who were Alternaria -sensitive had their near-fatal asthma episodes in summer and early fall when mold spore levels would be expected to be high.

### Delayed onset type I allergic reaction following black tattoo removal using picosecond laser [^ae841fde]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Laser treatment is widely regarded as the most effective method for tattoo removal with up to 5.8% of all tattoo complications in a hospital setting being related to tattoo removal. Alongside the use of nanosecond lasers, the use of picosecond lasers is rising as a mainstay device for tattoo removal. However, the literature reporting adverse reactions associated with their use is scarce. It is known that laser-assisted tattoo removal has the potential to produce a range of degradation products, which can be linked to human toxicity or hypersensitivity reactions, typically manifesting as delayed Type IV allergic cutaneous reactions. Although rare, immediate Type I allergic reactions have been reported in the context of nanosecond laser usage and included itch, swelling, redness, and localized urticaria occurring within minutes to hours after the laser sessions, conform the time span of a Type I reaction. It has been suggested that these reactions are due to the extracellular release of tattoo pigment fragments, directly triggering an immune response.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in adults: a review [^ef21ba40]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on asthma:

- **Definition**: Asthma is a chronic disorder of the lower respiratory tract characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversible airflow obstruction presenting with episodic or persistent symptoms of wheezing, dyspnea, and cough.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of asthma is complex and not fully understood. It involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors that lead to airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling. Exposure to allergens triggers an inflammatory response in the airways, leading to bronchoconstriction, increased mucus production, and airway remodeling.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of asthma in the US is estimated at 8.2% in the general population involving all ages.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for asthma include a genetic predisposition, atopy, and exposure to environmental factors, such as air pollutants, volatile organic compounds, benzene, formaldehyde, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, xylenes, cleaning agents, insecticides, dampness, mould, and allergens. Additionally, respiratory infections and a personal or family history of allergies are significant risk factors.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of asthma include recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms can vary in frequency and severity and are often worse at night or in the early morning.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of asthma can vary widely among patients. It is generally a controllable chronic condition that can lead to a good QoL with appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications.

### Sensitization pattern affects the asthma risk in Finnish adult population [^f39e5b30]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is a large global variation in the sensitization pattern and its association with allergic diseases. In temperate and tropical urban environments, mite monosensitization can be the predominant cause of allergic airway diseases, whereas in other environments, polysensitization is more typical. Sensitization to mite allergens associates with asthma. However, it is suggested that mite sensitization might play a minor role in Northern Europe. The aim of the study was to analyze how sensitization pattern affects the asthma risk in Finnish adults, with a special focus on mites.

Methods

A population-based case-control data (N = 523) from Finnish adult asthma patients with one or two matched controls were used. Asthma was diagnosed based on a typical history of asthmatic symptoms and lung function tests. The allergic sensitization was determined based on skin prick test (SPT) of five mites, three molds, and nine other aeroallergens. Information on demographics was obtained by a questionnaire.

Results

The proportion of sensitization to any allergen was 55% in the asthma group and 39% in the control group (P = 0.001, OR 2.06, 95% CI = 1.35–3.14). Sensitization to animal dander, pollen, or Aspergillus fumigatus was associated with asthma. Polysensitization to more than one allergen types and the number of SPT-positive reactions associated with asthma, whereas sensitization to only one allergen type was not associated with asthma.

Conclusions

The large number of sensitizations to several types of allergens distinguishes subjects with asthma. Mite sensitization had little independent association with asthma in Finland.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^b0056b9c]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergy diagnostic testing — airborne fungi sampling considerations: Reported prevalence of outdoor airborne fungi depends on sampling technique and collecting device, and viable culture yields vary with time and duration of culture. In general, Cladosporium and Alternaria are predominant in summer, and indoor mold sampling almost always detects Aspergillus and Penicillium. Although many species are identifiable, their comparative significance is difficult to ascertain, and cross‑allergenicity among major classes of airborne fungi has not been well delineated.

### Fungi: toxic killers or unavoidable nuisances? [^f705fe0d]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

This discussion is focused on the many roles of fungi in human health, and also to put the mycotoxin literature into perspective.

Data Sources

Data are derived from the literature referenced in PubMed from the National Library of Medicine, earlier references in the authors' reprint collection, and ongoing research. Studies for review were either selected from the peer-reviewed literature or from standard texts that are well recognized in the field.

Results

The review yielded many studies of the role of fungi in allergic disease, but none that systematically documented such a role for mycotoxins or fungal volatiles. Many case studies were found, but none of these unequivocally document a cause/effect relationship between mycotoxin exposure by inhalation and human disease in residential, school, or office settings.

Conclusions

The review led to the conclusion that that the primary result from fungal exposure is allergic disease, and that the evidence for inhalation disease resulting from mycotoxin exposure in residential and office settings is extremely weak.

### Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management [^c5270750]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Dampness and mold in homes — Moisture-related exposures contribute to asthma, and risk quantification and management steps are described: "Excessive moisture in homes can contribute to asthma through an increase in mold exposure as well as increased cockroach and dust mite allergen". In children with persistent asthma, "The prevalence of mold sensitization… is approximately 50%", and nationally "56% of homes had levels of some molds above thresholds observed to be associated with asthma symptoms". "Children sensitized and exposed to the major indoor molds appear to be at greater risk of asthma exacerbations", and "Remediation of mold has been shown to reduce symptoms and medication use… and its effects may not depend on whether the population is sensitized to mold". Evaluation "includes an assessment of sensitization to the major indoor molds, which can be accomplished with specific IgE testing… or through referral to a board-certified allergist for skin testing". To identify moisture problems, "Air sampling, thermography, moisture meters, environmental history, and direct observation are all useful", and parental report "suggests that the parents be counseled to intervene on the home environment". Caution is noted that "reports from air sampling are uninterpretable without concomitant indoor and outdoor sampling".

### Immunotherapy for mold allergy [^1d3c6384]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the available studies regarding mold immunotherapy. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed articles related to mold immunotherapy using the following keywords: mold, allergy, asthma, and immunotherapy. In addition, references cited within these articles were also reviewed. Articles were selected based on their relevance to the topic. Allergic responses to inhaled mold antigens are a recognized factor in allergic rhinitis and asthma. There are significant problems with respect to the production of relevant allergen material for the diagnosis and treatment of mold allergy with immunotherapy. Mold allergens contain proteases and should not be mixed with other allergens for immunotherapy. Most of the immunotherapy studies focus on two molds, Alternaria and Cladosporium. There is a lack of randomized placebo-controlled trials when evaluating the efficacy of mold immunotherapy with trials only focusing on immunotherapy to Alternaria and Cladosporium. Additional studies are needed regarding mold allergy and immunotherapy focusing on which molds are important for causing allergic disease.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^c292d694]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
Evolution of symptoms and clinical reactivity at food challenge. Many individuals will experience initially subjective symptoms, with objective symptoms appearing with further doses (A). Anaphylaxis will only develop if the food challenge continues. Others will experience anaphylaxis as their first objective symptom: either at a dose of allergen exposure with no preceding subjective symptoms (B), or with prior subjective symptoms (C), without evidence of a clear dose‐response for symptoms. Note that anaphylaxis can occur at all levels of exposure (both at low levels of allergen exposure, represented by the solid bars, and higher doses indicated by dotted lines). Reproduced under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License from reference

For any given individual patient, therefore, the absence of prior anaphylaxis may be due to insufficient allergen exposure causing previous reactions, (rather than the patient being at an inherently lower risk). Therefore, a history (or not) of anaphylaxis is a poor predictor of future anaphylaxis. Reassuringly, there is no robust evidence that food‐allergic individuals who react to very low levels of allergen are at greater risk of anaphylaxis.,

A history of reaction to only relatively large exposures (with no or minimal symptoms to smaller doses) may be useful in informing the approach to allergen avoidance in any given individual, particularly given more recent data suggesting that reaction thresholds for an food‐allergic person are fairly reproducible under typical challenge conditions, at least for peanut and cow's milk.

### Health problems… [^7ca323a6]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Research has found that people who spend time in damp buildings report health problems including respiratory symptoms and infections, developing or worsening asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis or hay fever, and eczema. Allergies Allergies or allergic responses to mold are common. In mold-allergic individuals, inhaling or touching mold may cause an allergic response, such as the following:

- Sneezing
- Nasal stuffiness or runny nose
- Red, itchy, or watery eyes
- Skin rash Mold can also cause irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, skin, or lungs even in people who are not allergic to mold. Asthma is associated with exposure to irritants, allergens, and physical conditions called triggers. Many asthma triggers can be in the workplace. Research shows evidence of an association between damp indoor spaces and asthma symptoms in individuals with pre-existing asthma.

This means exposure to molds in workplaces can make pre-existing asthma worse. There is also evidence of an association between damp indoor spaces and new-onset asthma. Symptoms of work-related asthma tend to get better when away from work. However, in some cases, symptoms do not improve until an extended time away from the exposure or trigger. Workers who are already sensitized to mold may even respond to a trace amount of mold. Asthma takes ongoing monitoring and management to keep it under control. It is important for affected individuals to have a comprehensive asthma treatment plan and regular follow-up with their healthcare providers. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an immune system disorder. It causes the lungs to become inflamed in reaction to certain substances like inhaled bacteria, fungi, plant proteins, animal proteins, or chemicals.

It can seem like the flu or pneumonia, but hypersensitivity pneumonitis does not get better with antibiotics for infection. Symptoms of this illness can vary. Some persons experience:

- Shortness of breath
- Cough
- Muscle aches
- Chills
- Fever
- Night sweats
- Extreme fatigue
- Weight loss Symptoms may improve after a few hours or days when away from the substance or allergen causing illness. Likewise, hypersensitivity pneumonitis may be work-related if a worker's symptoms and medical tests improve during time away from work and worsen when returning to work. With continued exposure, persistent lung inflammation over time could lead to permanent lung damage.

### Exposure and health effects of fungi on humans [^c1119675]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Fungi are ubiquitous microorganisms that are present in outdoor and indoor environments. Previous research has found relationships between environmental fungal exposures and human health effects. We reviewed recent articles focused on fungal exposure and dampness as risk factors for respiratory disease development, symptoms, and hypersensitivity. In particular, we reviewed the evidence suggesting that early exposure to dampness or fungi is associated with the development of asthma and increased asthma morbidity. Although outdoor exposure to high concentrations of spores can cause health effects such as asthma attacks in association with thunderstorms, most people appear to be relatively unaffected unless they are sensitized to specific genera. Indoor exposure and dampness, however, appears to be associated with an increased risk of developing asthma in young children and asthma morbidity in individuals who have asthma. These are important issues because they provide a rationale for interventions that might be considered for homes and buildings in which there is increased fungal exposure. In addition to rhinitis and asthma, fungus exposure is associated with a number of other illnesses including allergic bronchopulmonary mycoses, allergic fungal sinusitis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Additional research is necessary to establish causality and evaluate interventions for fungal- and dampness-related health effects.

### Voluntary guidelines for managing food allergies in schools and early care and education programs [^cfefc2ca]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

Food allergy symptoms and severity in children — symptoms associated with an allergic reaction to food include mucous membrane symptoms (red watery eyes or swollen lips, tongue, or eyes), skin symptoms (itchiness, flushing, rash, or hives), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, pain, cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, or acid reflux), upper respiratory symptoms (nasal congestion, sneezing, hoarse voice, trouble swallowing, dry staccato cough), lower respiratory symptoms (deep cough, wheezing, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or chest tightness), cardiovascular symptoms (pale or blue skin color, weak pulse, dizziness or fainting, confusion or shock, hypotension [decrease in blood pressure], or loss of consciousness), and mental or emotional symptoms (sense of "impending doom", irritability, change in alertness, mood change, or confusion). Children sometimes do not exhibit overt and visible symptoms after ingesting an allergen, making early diagnosis difficult, and some children may not be able to communicate their symptoms clearly; complaints such as abdominal pain, itchiness, or other discomforts may be the first signs of an allergic reaction. Signs and symptoms can become evident within a few minutes or up to 1–2 hours after ingestion of the allergen, and rarely, several hours after ingestion. Symptoms of breathing difficulty, voice hoarseness, or faintness associated with change in mood or alertness or rapid progression of symptoms that involve a combination of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or cardiovascular symptoms signal a more severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) and require immediate attention. The severity of reactions to food allergens is difficult to predict and varies depending on the child's particular sensitivity and exposure, and ingesting a food allergen triggers most severe reactions.

### Studies of sick building syndrome. IV. mycotoxicosis [^8adb03f4]. The Journal of Asthma (2002). Low credibility.

There has been increasing public attention to the potential health risks of mold exposure, particularly in wet buildings. A variety of molds has been isolated from both damaged homes and businesses, including agents that secrete toxigenic materials. One area that is attracting particular notice is the relative toxigenic potential of mycotoxins. Although exposure to molds can produce significant mucosal irritation, there are very few data to suggest long-term ill effects. More importantly, there is no evidence in humans that mold exposure leads to nonmucosal pathology. In fact, many of the data on toxigenic molds are derived from animal toxicity studies, and these are based primarily, on ingestion. Although every attempt should be made to improve the quality of indoor air, including avoidance of molds, the human illnesses attributed to fungal exposure are, with the exception of invasive infections and mold allergy, relatively rare. In this review we discuss selected aspects of the microbiology of mycotoxin-producing molds and their potential role in human immunopathology with respect to wet building environments.

### Attributes of stachybotrys chartarum and its association with human disease [^9963d1ad]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Mold contamination and toxicities are not limited to crops and animals; they are also a concern in human health. Molds occur in outdoor and indoor environments, and water-damaged buildings harbor and provide substrate for several mold species. Of these, Stachybotrys chartarum poses a particular threat to occupants. Patients with building-related symptoms and infant idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage often have histories of living in moldy, water-damaged buildings. Although a causal connection is far from being unequivocally proven, S. chartarum has been associated with such clinical conditions. These illnesses could be attributed in part to mycotoxins released by S. chartarum. Recently, a hemolysin released by this mold was found to be hemolytic in vitro and in vivo. In addition, allergenic proteins have been characterized from S. chartarum. The exact mechanism of S. chartarum pathogenesis has not yet been defined. Moreover, a causality-effect relation is not yet established. This review summarizes available information on the pathogenic attributes of S. chartarum and calls for well-controlled objective studies.

### Effect of alcaftadine 0.25% on ocular itch associated with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials [^242964df]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

SAC and PAC account for the majority of cases of ocular allergy. Both conditions result from IgE cross-linking on the surface of mast cells following ocular exposure to allergen and present with similar signs and symptoms. SAC and PAC may differ in the specific allergen(s) that cause the reaction in an individual and in the duration of symptoms. SAC, typically characterized by an acute to subacute onset triggered primarily by tree, grass, and weed pollen, is more common and occurs during periods of high pollen counts. In contrast, PAC tends to occur throughout the year, caused typically by indoor antigens such as dust, molds, or animal dander. Ocular symptoms experienced by individuals suffering from allergic conditions can significantly impact daily activities and quality of life.–

Alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution (Lastacaft ®; Allergan, Inc. Irvine, CA, USA) is a once-daily, dual-action antiallergic that inhibits histamine receptor activation and stabilizes mast cells and has been approved for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in the United States. In preclinical investigations, alcaftadine exhibited high affinity for both H 1 and H 2 receptors, as well as in vitro antagonism of H 4 receptors. Alcaftadine 0.25% has been shown to be safe and effective in the prevention of ocular itching using the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model of allergic conjunctivitis. In pivotal studies, when compared with placebo, alcaftadine 0.25% was superior at reducing ocular itching at 15 minutes and 16 hours after instillation.

Future research opportunities

The Expert Panel has identified the following topics related to allergen mitigation interventions (eg, acaricides, air purifiers, HEPA vacuum cleaners, carpet removal, pet removal, cleaning products, and mold mitigation) that require additional research:
Effectiveness of allergen mitigation interventions that use the validated outcome measures recommended by the Asthma Outcomes Workshop
Effectiveness of allergen mitigation interventions in individuals with asthma who have demonstrated exposure and/or sensitization to these allergens at home, school, or work
Multicomponent interventions targeted to specific allergens in study populations consisting only of people with demonstrated sensitization and exposure to those allergens
Comparisons of different combinations of multicomponent interventions to determine the optimal combination(s) of allergen-specific mitigation strategies that improve outcomes
Studies to determine the allergen reduction thresholds for symptoms
Interactions and necessity of exposure, sensitization, and symptoms to determine which individuals with asthma will benefit most from allergen mitigation strategies (eg, whether an allergen-specific mitigation strategy is beneficial for an individual with asthma who has sensitization on skin prick testing to an allergen, is exposed to that allergen, and denies having symptoms)

In addition, reports of studies on the effectiveness of allergen mitigation interventions must include details on the intervention studied (eg, the models of air purifiers used) and the protocols for using the intervention (eg, how often the air purifier was turned on, where it was located, and how often the filter was changed). These aspects of the intervention need to be measured, and levels of adherence to the protocol need to be reported.

### Delayed onset type I allergic reaction following black tattoo removal using picosecond laser [^4cad476c]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

However, in our case, we suspect that laser treatment caused a delayed onset Type I allergic reaction to one of the breakdown products or metabolites, which was released into the blood circulation approximately 1 week after the treatment.

Symptoms indicative for a Type I allergic reaction included the limited local complaints upon first laser treatment and the progressive course of widespread urticaria, angioedema, and laryngeal edema after the 2 successive laser treatments. A delayed onset of these symptoms with an exact equal time span of 1 week was repeatedly observed after each laser treatment.

During laser tattoo removal, tattoo pigments break down into smaller particles as a result of photomechanical interaction and can be engulfed and eliminated through phagocytosis, lymphatic drainage, and may undergo hepatic metabolization. Moreover, tattoo pigments can also be metabolized directly in the skin by cytochrome P450 and transferred toward regional lymph nodes and the circulatory system. We hypothesize that one of these routes are involved in the delayed onset of allergic symptoms in our case. However, whether the timespan corresponds with average rates of lymphatic clearance of breakdown products or formation of metabolites is currently unknown. One similar case report describes an urticarial and systemic anaphylactic reaction 3 days after laser treatment with a 755-nm picosecond alexandrite laser of a multicolored tattoo. Current literature on the metabolism of (degraded) tattoo pigments remains scarce and has mainly focused on azo-based tattoo pigments associated with yellow-, orange-, and red-colored tattoos, rather than black inks. Pretreatment with antihistamines and topical and oral corticosteroids have been reported to prevent local Type I allergic reactions; the efficacy of these interventions in patients experiencing delayed progressive systemic allergic symptoms is unknown. We advised our patient to discontinue further laser treatments to prevent potential worsening of the allergy. Up to now, 2 delayed onset Type I allergic reactions have been reported after picosecond laser-assisted tattoo removal. However, it is currently unknown whether these types of reactions may similarly occur on breakdown products of nanosecond lasers.

### Symptoms after mould exposure including stachybotrys chartarum, and comparison with darkroom disease [^c62b7a92]. Allergy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Mould-attributed symptoms have included features which overlap with unexplained syndromes such as sick building syndrome.

Objectives

We describe questionnaire and chart review findings in patients following exposure to moulds which include Stachybotrys and compare responses with two control groups.

Methods

Thirty-two patients presented with symptoms attributed to mould exposures. Exposure identification for 25 patients had reported S tachybotrys chartarum as well as other mould (Aspergillus, Penicillium), 88% at work. The remaining seven had professionally visualized or self-reported/photographic exposure evidence only. A chart review was performed and a follow-up with a questionnaire, including questions on current health status, and nonspecific symptoms.

Results

Cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness (at presentation) were reported in 79%, 70% and 64%, respectively, and persisted > 6 weeks in 91%. Skin test(s) were positive to fungal extract(s) in 30%. Seventeen returned questionnaires were obtained 3.1 (SD 0.5) years after the initial clinic assessment. Among this subgroup, persisting asthma-like symptoms and symptoms suggestive of sick building syndrome were frequent, and similar to a group previously assessed for darkroom disease among medical radiation technologists. The mould-exposed group more commonly reported they were bothered when walking in a room with carpets, complained of a chemical or metallic taste in their mouth, and had problems in concentration when compared with a control physiotherapist group (P < 0.005).

Conclusions

Although only a minority with health concerns from indoor mould exposure had demonstrable mould-allergy, a significant proportion had asthma-like symptoms. Other symptoms were also common and persistent after the initial implicated exposure.

### Environmental justice and allergic disease: a Work group report of the AAAAI environmental exposure and respiratory health committee and the diversity, equity and inclusion committee [^539286a2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Disparities in allergic disease — Among African American and multiracial populations, asthma shows 1.5- to 2-fold greater prevalence and 2- to 3-fold greater risk of emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization, and death compared with non-Hispanic White populations, and asthma prevalence is also higher among people living below 100% of the federal poverty line. In the 2018 National Health Interview Survey, Black and Hispanic respondents self-reported allergic rhinitis (AR) less frequently than non-Hispanic White respondents, yet AR among racial and ethnic minority populations may be significantly underrecognized and underdiagnosed; studies of predominantly Black and Hispanic urban children found higher AR symptom burden and lower quality of life compared with White children. The prevalence and incidence of eczema or atopic dermatitis (AD) was higher in non-Hispanic Black populations compared with Hispanic and non-Hispanic White individuals, and children living in poverty had a higher prevalence of AD compared with children from higher-income families.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^5b1f80f6]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Mold — travelers might visit flooded areas as part of emergency, medical, or humanitarian relief missions, and water damage to buildings can lead to mold contamination. People with asthma or who are allergic to mold may have severe reactions, and immunocompromised people and people with chronic lung disease may get pulmonary infections from mold. To reduce exposures that could result in adverse health effects, travelers should avoid areas with visible mold contamination or odor and use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, goggles, waterproof boots, and NIOSH-approved particulate respirators; if the traveler plans to participate in activities such as ripping out moldy drywall, consider wearing a NIOSH-approved half-face or full-face respirator. Travelers should anticipate the environment to which they are traveling and bring enough PPE because supplies might be scarce or unavailable in the countries visited, and travelers should keep hands, skin, and eyes clean and free from mold-contaminated dust. For additional information, review CDC's recommendations for Mold Cleanup and Remediation and see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for more about mold and respirators.

### Reply [^c630bc35]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

The purpose of our case report was not to claim the "first" Australian reported case of mushroom anaphylaxis but rather to report an older Australian adult with significant hypotensive anaphylaxis. Our patient was 77 years old at the time of her index reaction, and this age is indeed much more advanced than that of the 13-year-old teenager in the pediatric report. Although this same reference has been mentioned in the comment, this publication reports only 1 patient. Therefore, clarification is required regarding the specific article that is being referred to for the adult without occupational exposure in whom sensitization to boiled Agaricus bisporus and other edible mushroom varieties was demonstrated.

Regarding our mention of inhalational exposure and sensitization, this is in reference to individuals who have had exposure to fungal spores, particularly in the occupational setting (eg, farmers, who through frequent inhalation may develop localized symptoms of allergic rhinitis). Indeed, this is commonly reported; however, such exposure has not commonly been linked to anaphylaxis after consumption. As observed in our comprehensive summary of the literature, and as in our case patient, for mushroom anaphylaxis on ingestion, previous sensitization through such routes was not common.

### Mold sensitization is common amongst patients with severe asthma requiring multiple hospital admissions [^efc08aa9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Third, there is evidence that indoor mold exposure may contribute to asthma severity. Many patients report respiratory symptoms in damp and moldy houses and a review of nine population-based studies found that seven reported one or more positive associations between fungal levels and health outcomes. The study of Williamson and colleagues in Scotland reported that asthmatic patients were more than twice as likely than control patients to live in a house that was considered damp or moldy by a building surveyor. Furthermore, in that study, there was a positive association between a patient's asthma severity and the degree of dampness which the surveyor measured in the patient's home (r = 0.3, p = 0.006) and independently with an index of visible mold growth in their dwelling (r = 0.23, p = 0.035). In a study of German children, it was found that bronchial hyper-reactivity was associated with damp housing that was only partly explained by exposure to house dust mite antigen, suggesting that other factors such as mold growth may also be important. Taskinen et al found that the prevalence of asthma was similar (4.8%) amongst children attending a school with moisture and mold problems compared with a control school but asthma symptoms such as wheeze and cough were commoner in the damp moldy school as were emergency visits to hospital (OR 2.0, p < 0.01).

Fourth, we know that Aspergillus in particular is a major respiratory allergen causing the vast majority of cases of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. It is likely that these cases represent the extreme of a spectrum of mold allergy, the slightly less severe manifestation of which is severe asthma as described in this study and without all the serological and radiological markers characterisitic of ABPA. The reactivity of asthmatic patients to multiple mold allergens could be due to genuine sensitization to a variety of molds or it could be due to cross-reactivity between mold allergens. The paper of Hemmann and colleagues suggests that Aspergillus and Candida allergens may share IgE-binding epitopes. However, it is believed that multiple mold sensitization skin test reactions are usually due to sensitivity to multiple antigens rather than cross reactivity. Few fungi of the > 1 million species of fungi thought to exist worldwide have been subjected to the antigenic scrutiny that Aspergillus and a few other common airborne fungi have and it is likely that sensitization to other fungi will be discovered in the future.

### Guide for interpreting reports from inspections / investigations of indoor mold [^4e688ca0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Inspections and testing of indoor environments for mold growth increased dramatically in the past decade. Allergists can now be presented copies of reports and laboratory data and asked to provide an interpretation, although allergists are seldom trained to review environmental data. There is no single sampling method that is both specific for mold growth and robust enough to reliably detect mold growth. There is no standard method for these inspections or testing and no widely recognized credential for investigators, and therefore reports also vary in quality, objectives, and thoroughness. Despite these issues, observations from informed inspections coupled with results from qualified analyses of samples that are collected with a useful strategy can usually indicate whether mold growth is present in a building, but the nature of the report should be assessed before any interpretation of the results and data are attempted. This rostrum discusses objectives of inspections, describes qualifications for investigators, outlines the limitations of various sampling methods applicable to mold and to some degree endotoxin, and provides guidance for data interpretation.

### Allergen-specific IgG antibodies for cat allergy? [^4a9e7870]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Increased global prevalence of IgE-mediated allergies has led to increased morbidity. IgE-mediated allergies are caused by exposure to specific allergens in foods, pollen, mold, animals, insects, and others. Allergic diseases include allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Reactions can be mild to severe. In some cases, like in those with cat allergies, systemic reactions leading to status asthmaticus or anaphylaxis, potentially life-threatening conditions, can occur. Pharmacotherapy to prevent and treat symptoms typically includes antihistamines, β 2 -agonists, topical corticosteroids, mast cell stabilizers, and leukotriene inhibitors. At the current time, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only disease‐modifying treatment that alters the course of immune response, with benefits often observed even after cessation of therapy, but now there could be a new approach on the horizon.

The work by Shamji and colleagues (pp.) in this issue of the Journal, and the 2018 study by Orengo and colleagues, report successful AIT for cat allergy and potentially, if verified by larger trials, could lead to a major leap forward for AIT. Allergens used for cat allergy AIT, both sublingual and subcutaneous, have progressed from crude extracts to sophisticated and targeted allergens. Crude cat allergen extracts were used for AIT through the mid-1990s; subsequent studies used extracts of Fel d 1 or recombinant Fel d 1, the major cat allergen. Overall, although some cat AIT studies with crude cat extracts or Fel d 1 have shown promising results in total rhinoconjunctivitis symptom scores, peak expiratory flow rate responses, medication scores, or allergen-specific or nonspecific bronchial provocation tests, others have found no significant differences between placebo and active groups. More recent studies have used an equimolar mixture of seven short synthetic peptides that corresponded to major T-cell epitopes, which were derived from the primary sequence of the major cat allergen Fel d 1 (Cat-PAD). Although initial studies using Cat-PAD for cat allergy showed benefits, a larger 2016 phase 3 trial showed no difference between the placebo and active group in the mean combined score (combined total rhinoconjunctivitis symptom scores and rescue medication use score). Safety data for cat AIT are limited because of the lack of high-quality placebo-controlled trials; however, reports of reactions requiring epinephrine have been reported. AIT may benefit those in whom allergies are not well controlled by pharmacotherapy or those who are monosensitized to Fel d 1.

### Mold and dampness exposure and allergic outcomes from birth to adolescence: data from the BAMSE cohort [^f251bad6]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Indoor mold and dampness is a major environmental problem globally, with estimates ranging from 18% to 50% of household dwellings 1, 2, 3. Efforts to improve household energy efficiency and reduce heat loss can increase the risk of dampness and fungal contamination 4. Excessive indoor dampness fosters microbial proliferation and results in exposure to various microbial agents, like spores and cell fragments containing toxins, inflammatory substances, and allergens 5. These substances have been shown to cause irritation and immunostimulation, and induce inflammatory processes 6. Exposure to mold and dampness has been suggested to increase the risk of asthma and allergic disease, and both allergic and nonallergic pathways have been proposed 7.

In epidemiological studies, exposure to a moldy or damp indoor environment in early life has been associated with atopic diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, and immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization in young children 7, 8, 9, 10. The most consistent and highest excess risks have been noted for asthma 8 and rhinitis 11, while fewer and less conclusive studies have been conducted for IgE sensitization 6. Studies have attempted to elucidate the association between exposure to moldy indoor environments early in life and allergic health outcomes in school age 10, 12, 13, but the results have been inconsistent and few prospective studies have followed children beyond 10 years of age 8, 14, 15. Furthermore, the role of dampness and mold for persistence and late‐onset asthma is not clear 16.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether exposure to mold or dampness during infancy influences the risk of asthma, rhinitis, or IgE sensitization in children followed prospectively from birth to adolescence. In conjunction, we assessed clinical phenotypes of asthma, looking at the timing of onset and persistence of symptoms.

### Health disparities in allergic and immunologic conditions in racial and ethnic underserved populations: a Work group report of the AAAAI committee on the underserved [^6eb3b100]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Environmental exposures and home/community interventions — pollution-related injustice contributes to racial and ethnic disparities in asthma, with diesel bus depots concentrated in disadvantaged neighborhoods and associated with increased respiratory disease burden. Environmental control of dust mite, cockroach, mold, and mouse allergen and programs to reduce home allergen and pollutant exposures, including testing for sensitization and trigger identification, are described. Community health workers have successfully delivered home interventions, and effective approaches for minority groups include telemedicine or web-based self-care, multidisciplinary team education, and home health care visits using community health workers; these interventions may decrease health care utilization by empowering patient self-management.

### Future research trends in understanding the mechanisms underlying allergic diseases for improved patient care [^bed58c2e]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

The exposome includes the entire environmental exposures that a person experiences, from conception throughout the whole life (Figure 2). 73 A clear missing knowledge is the lack of thorough epidemiological studies encompassing a holistic approach with exposome and reactome (response patterns) over a life span. This wide gap further opens especially because validated methods for exposome assessment, especially the personal one, are lacking. Furthermore, a clear bias emerges since biogenic and anthropogenic pollutants are measured outdoors while people spend a considerable part of their lives indoors. The research focus in environmental health and allergy should therefore be to study the impact of indoor and outdoor pollutants focusing on the role of combined exposures to air pollution, microclimate, green spaces, and allergens. Innovative approaches to characterize environmental exposures including satellite data and stationary and personal monitoring should be developed. 74 This further requires the development of new informatics tools and data analytics to analyze the large and complex generated datasets. The aim should be to understand the impact of environment through the entire life span on the complete disease spectrum to unravel the interaction of the environment with the barrier organs including their microbiomes, the immune system, and the whole body. Climate change exhibits direct and indirect effects on human health–related aspects. Climate variability modifies the abundance and occurrence of plants and fungi, noticeably those with high allergological importance. The effect of climate change on human health is both a threat and foremost a research focus especially in the field of allergy. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the interactions of environment with the human body but also environment‐environment interactions will enable us to develop prevention strategies for allergies.

### American contact dermatitis society allergens of the year 2000 to 2020 [^996bb33a]. Dermatologic Clinics (2020). Medium credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed type IV hypersensitivity skin reaction to external stimuli. Patterns of dermatitis depend on allergen exposure and patch testing is the gold standard to identify causal agents. The American Contact Dermatitis Society identifies an "Allergen of the Year" in order to highlight facts about particular allergens, which may range from showing increasing prevalence of disease, to documenting low levels of relevant allergic reactions. This article reviews the allergens of the year from 2000 to 2020 with an emphasis on clinical relevance. Categories of allergens include adhesives, dyes, medications, metals, preservatives, rubber accelerators, surfactants, and other skin care product ingredients.

### Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management [^0a3bc227]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Indoor environmental control practices for asthma management emphasize that individually tailored environmental control measures have been shown to reduce asthma symptoms and exacerbations, are similar in efficacy to controller medications, and appear to be cost- effective when the aim is to reduce days of symptoms and their associated costs; the efficacy of environmental control measures has been sustained for up to 1 year after the intervention. As a part of developing tailored strategies, an environmental history may be obtained to evaluate the key indoor environmental exposures that are known to trigger asthma symptoms and exacerbations, including both indoor pollutants and allergens, and may include questions regarding the presence of pets or pests or evidence of pests, knowledge of whether the community's climatic characteristics favor dust mites, and sources of indoor air pollution including smokers in the home, use of gas stoves and appliances, and presence of mold in the home. The leading indoor environmental contributors to asthma symptoms are indoor allergens (pets, dust mites, mice, rats, cockroaches, molds) and pollutants (airborne PM [particulate matter], SHS [secondhand smoke], NO2 [nitrogen dioxide]). For evaluation, serum allergen-specific IgE (immunoglobulin E) antibody tests may be performed or the patient may be referred to a board-certified allergist for evaluation and allergy skin testing to identify indoor allergens that are most likely to be clinically relevant. Environmental control strategies are tailored to each potentially relevant indoor exposure and are based on knowledge of the sources and underlying characteristics of the exposure, and strategies include source removal, source control, and mitigation strategies.

Adverse Reactions:

Allergic reactions to any of the ingredients can occur, ranging from mild skin irritation to severe anaphylaxis in rare cases. Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folate.

Niacinamide, a form of niacin, may cause flushing, itching, and tingling sensations in some individuals, particularly when taken in higher doses. This effect is usually harmless but can be uncomfortable. Some individuals may experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, bloating, or diarrhea, especially when consuming higher doses of certain ingredients like garlic and black pepper. Certain ingredients in the product, such as garlic and black pepper, may interact with medications. Garlic may potentiate the effects of anticoagulant medications, while black pepper may affect the metabolism of certain drugs.

### Home assessment and remediation [^02e64d42]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Awareness of the relationship of fungi to asthma in indoor air is very old and well documented. There is substantial evidence that mold and dampness exacerbate asthma in sensitized individuals. Many governmental and nongovernmental organizations around the world have issued guidelines to the effect that the elimination of moisture intrusion and the removal of moldy items from living space can improve respiratory health. The process of home assessment for moisture and mold presence is discussed along with factors that can be used to guide fungal exposure reduction efforts. An approach to the assessment process itself is outlined, and common causes of moisture and mold damage are described. Points that should be included in a report resulting from a home assessment and rudimentary elements of report interpretation are discussed. Emphasis is that interpretation of sampling for moisture and fungal presence should be provided by the person performing the assessment. We conclude that multifaceted remediation contributes to fungal allergen avoidance. The use of an indoor environmental professional to generate evaluation reports and remediation activities can be a valuable contribution to an overall allergen avoidance strategy.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^86c2ca15]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinician's Summary:

The Expert Panel conditionally recommends SCIT as an adjunctive treatment for individuals who have demonstrated allergic sensitization and evidence of worsening asthma symptoms after exposure to the relevant antigen or antigens either acutely (eg, allergy to pets) or on a seasonal basis (eg, allergy to grass or ragweed) or a chronic basis (eg, allergy to dust mites). Individuals who place a high value on possible small improvements in quality of life, symptom control, and a reduction in long-term and/or quick-relief medication use and a lower value on the risk of systemic reactions of wide-ranging severity might consider SCIT as adjunct therapy.

For individuals with allergic asthma, the Expert Panel makes the following suggestions to implement SCIT:
Clinicians can consider SCIT for adults and children (at a developmental stage at which allergic sensitization can be demonstrated) with allergic asthma, a history compatible with a temporal association of worsening symptoms with exposure to aeroallergens, and testing (as described previously) that confirms this sensitization.
Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is not well controlled by their current medical therapy and the treating clinician considers allergen exposure to be a significant contributor to this lack of asthma control. However, clinicians should attempt to optimize asthma control before initiating SCIT to reduce the potential for harm.
Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is well controlled by their current therapy when these individuals and/or their clinicians want to reduce the individuals' medication burden.
In addition to assessing whether an individual with allergic asthma has an appropriate history before considering SCIT, clinicians must formally assess allergic sensitization using either immediate hypersensitivity skin testing or in vitro antigen-specific IgE antibody testing. This evaluation needs to be performed by a trained health care professional skilled in proper testing and result interpretation. The need for these types of specialty evaluations, as with the need for many diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions, may limit access to care, depending on local availability of these tests and the patient's health insurance coverage of testing.
Clinicians should not administer SCIT in individuals with severe asthma. Furthermore, clinicians should not initiate, increase, or administer maintenance SCIT doses while individuals have asthma symptoms. These individuals should achieve optimal asthma control before beginning SCIT to minimize the harms (systemic reactions) associated with SCIT, which tend to intensify as baseline asthma severity increases.
The presence of allergic sensitization is necessary but not sufficient to define the allergic asthma phenotype. A positive test result may not be associated with asthma control over time but might, instead, reflect sensitivity in a different organ (eg, the nose in allergic rhinitis).
Allergen exposure could be the only triggering mechanism for allergic asthma symptoms, or it could be just one triggering factor for an individual, and another factor or factors (eg, respiratory tract infections, irritant exposure, or exercise) might also play a role in triggering allergic asthma symptoms. Because of the heterogeneous nature of allergic asthma, determining the precise efficacy of immunotherapy in reducing the allergic component of an individual's asthma can be difficult.
Clinicians should administer SCIT in their offices and provide direct supervision because of the risk of systemic reactions. Such reactions can include a range of anaphylactic symptoms involving the skin (urticaria), respiratory tract (rhinitis and asthma), gastrointestinal tract (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension and arrhythmias). Although rare, deaths after injections have been reported.
Individuals with asthma should not administer SCIT at home.
Because clinicians should administer SCIT with direct supervision, personnel with appropriate training should prepare and administer injections for each individual's dosing schedule, from the build-up to the maintenance phase. Equipment and personnel should be available to treat serious anaphylactic reactions.
One of the potential benefits of SCIT is its immunomodulatory effects, which can reduce the allergic inflammatory response in various tissues. Thus, SCIT has the potential to be disease-modifying and to reduce the clinical expression or severity of asthma over time.
Before administering each SCIT injection, clinicians should assess individuals with asthma for worsened asthma symptoms that suggest recent loss of asthma control. Physicians should consider withholding SCIT injections temporarily in patients whose asthma symptoms have worsened until their asthma control is restored.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma who are considering SCIT that this treatment has the potential to reduce asthma symptoms and the severity of disease over time. Individuals need to come to their doctor's office for SCIT because of the associated risk of systemic reactions. Local and systemic reactions of SCIT include a range of anaphylactic symptoms involving the skin (urticaria), respiratory tract (rhinitis and asthma), gastrointestinal tract (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension and arrhythmias). Although rare, deaths after injections have been reported. Individuals with asthma should not administer SCIT at home. Before initiating immunotherapy, clinicians must review with the individual who has asthma the travel arrangements and time needed to travel to and from the clinic as well as the requirement for at least a 30minute observational period after each injection. These requirements may complicate compliance. Missed appointments due to scheduling problems are a safety and an efficacy concern because they may increase the likelihood of local and systemic reactions. Missed appointments can also complicate the ability to reach a maintenance dosing regimen that maximizes therapeutic benefit. Delayed systemic reactions (those occurring more than 30 minutes after injection) occur in approximately 15% of individuals after injection. The Expert Panel recommends that individuals who have had previous clinically significant reactions to immunotherapy ideally should have injectable epinephrine and carry it on their person to and from the clinic on the day of their injection.

Immunoglobulin testing for IgG and IgE — Immunoglobulin testing can be used to assess immunological conditions from exposure to fungal antigens including common allergies and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but it does not inform mycotoxin exposure and therefore has no role in exposure assessment in this context.

### Peanut allergy diagnosis: a 2020 practice parameter update, systematic review, and GRADE analysis [^69b95a56]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Peanut allergy pretest probability and testing indications — High pretest probability should be considered as a situation where there was ingestion of peanut and typical IgE-mediated symptoms of an allergic reaction resulted; testing is of the highest utility in these scenarios. Moderate pretest probability should be considered where there is less clarity that peanut was ingested and resulted in IgE-mediated symptoms; testing is of unclear utility in these situations, and an oral food challenge (OFC) may be required to definitively establish a diagnosis when there is peanut sensitization above a certain threshold. Low pretest probability should be considered in situations outlined on-page; in these situations testing is of exceptionally limited to no utility whatsoever, is not associated with any shift of posttest odds over baseline, and is not indicated, and an OFC is likely required to establish that detected peanut sensitization is clinically irrelevant.

### Aspergillus fumigatus [^ff4d7985]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

DO NOT INJECT INTRAVENOUSLY.

Epinephrine 1:1000 should be available.

Concentrated extracts must be diluted with sterile diluent prior to first use on a patient for treatment or intradermal testing. All concentrates of glycerinated allergenic extracts have the ability to cause serious local and systemic reactions including death in sensitive patients. Sensitive patients may experience severe anaphylactic reactions resulting in respiratory obstruction, shock, coma and /or death.(4) (See Adverse Reactions) An allergenic extract should be temporarily withheld from patients or the dose of the extract adjusted downward if any of the following conditions exist: (1) Severe symptoms of rhinitis and/or asthma (2) Infections or flu accompanied by fever and (3) Exposure to excessive amounts of clinically relevant allergen prior to a scheduled injection. When switching patients to a new lot of the same extract the initial dose should be reduced 3/4 so that 25% of previous dose is administered.

### Stachybotrys: relevance to human disease [^3b8292a4]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

Recent public concern about the danger of environmental fungi has focused attention on one particular mold, Stachybotrys. The purpose of this review is to examine and critique the published literature on Stachybotrys for objective scientific and clinical evidence of disease caused by the presence of this fungal organism in the environment.

Data Sources

Data were obtained from all published research and reviews of Stachybotrys indexed in MEDLINE since 1966.

Study Selection

The publications used for this review were those that contained information about human health effects of this microorganism. The critique of these publications is the author's.

Results

Stachybotrys is a minor component of the indoor mycoflora, found on certain building material surfaces in water-damaged buildings, but airborne spores are present in very low concentrations. Published reports fail to establish inhalation of Stachybotrys spores as a cause of human disease even in water-damaged buildings. A possible exception may be mycotoxin-caused pulmonary hemorrhage/hemosiderosis in infants, although scientific evidence to date is suggestive but not conclusive. Based on old reports ingestion of food prepared from Stachybotrys-contaminated grains may cause a toxic gastroenteropathy. No convincing cases of human allergic disease or infection from this mold have been published.

Conclusions

The current public concern for adverse health effects from inhalation of Stachybotrys spores in water-damaged buildings is not supported by published reports in the medical literature.

### Hydroquinone [^cb6fbb87]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people.

Since this product contains no sunscreen, an effective broad spectrum sun blocking agent should be used and unnecessary solar exposure avoided, or protective clothing should be worn to cover bleached skin in order to prevent repigmentation from occurring.

Hydroquinone may produce exogenous ochronosis, a gradual blue-black darkening of the skin. If this condition occurs, discontinue treatment and consult your physician. The majority of patients developing this condition are Black, but it may also occur in Caucasians and Hispanics.

### Reintroduction failure after negative food challenges in adults is common and mainly due to atypical symptoms [^cb743b7f]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Fear of allergic reactions was another common reason, as was previously shown in children. 11, 14, 17 This was illustrated by the relatively higher score on state anxiety (anxiety in the specific situation of eating) before food challenge in the group who failed reintroduction. Adequately addressing anxiety appears another important issue to be integrated in the follow‐up care, for example by identifying the presence, discussing the impact and considering counselling by a psychologist.

Typical allergic symptoms during reintroduction were also reported, but only in two patients. Symptoms were never severe, confirming the strong diagnostic value of the food challenge procedure. 3 Literature in children shows a somewhat higher frequency of typical allergic symptoms upon reintroduction, namely in 3%‐12%, but in line with our data, the reported symptoms are not severe. 12, 13 Dambacher et al 12 suggested that the explanation for this false‐negative result of the food challenge is that the threshold dose for the allergic reaction is higher than the dose reached at the food challenge. This was, however, not the cause in our study, where typical allergic symptoms occurred during following the reintroduction schema which did not exceed the highest dose of the food challenge. Another explanation might be the influence of the matrix of the food challenge on the threshold dose 31 or the presence of cofactors during reintroduction in daily life. 32 In these (rare) cases, it is important to reconsider the challenge result and adjust the dietary advice. Since no severe allergic symptoms were reported, we feel that the reintroduction procedure can be performed at home.

### Allergy versus gastric anisakiasis: a case of repeated-associated symptoms [^625277e8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

The clinical course of this case is very informative in understanding the pathophysiology of Anisakis -associated diseases. This case report is valuable because Anisakis infections were endoscopically proved for both episodes experienced by the patient. The first episode was a typical systemic anaphylaxis that was completely improved by intramuscular adrenaline injection, and the cause could have been Anisakis infection. This episode is in line with the disease concept of GAA.

Conversely, in the patient's second episode, she initially complained of gastrointestinal symptoms only, suggesting gastric anisakiasis. However, systemic allergic symptoms ultimately appeared 9.5 hours after the start of abdominal symptoms (16.5 hours after the patient had consumed raw tuna slices), but all of these symptoms were immediately treated with intramuscular adrenaline. Thus, the series of symptoms (abdominal symptoms + systemic allergic symptoms) might have been induced by an IgE-mediated allergic reaction to Anisakis infested on the gastric mucosa. Had the Anisakis larva possibly been spontaneously expelled, the patient may not have experienced systemic allergic symptoms. Additionally, her abdominal symptoms indicating gastric anisakiasis might have been improved had we injected intramuscular adrenaline even before systemic allergic symptoms occurred and even before the larva was removed endoscopically, as evidenced by the observed improvement in the abdominal symptoms after adrenaline treatment before the endoscopic removal of Anisakis larvae in the first episode.

In conclusion, gastric anisakiasis and Anisakis allergy may possibly occur as a syndrome with different clinical manifestations induced by a common pathophysiology — that is, an immediate allergic reaction induced by Anisakis infection on the gastric mucosa. Clinical feature studies using a large number of cases are needed for further examination.
