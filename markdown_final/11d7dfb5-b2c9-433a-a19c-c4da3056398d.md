## Question

Treatment plan for a patient encopoarated CBT and medication management for Bipolar-1 /adhd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step treatment plan for a patient with comorbid Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, incorporating CBT and medication management, with explicit reasoning and citations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and differential diagnosis. Then, I should establish treatment priorities and safety. Next, I will outline mood stabilization pharmacotherapy, followed by when and how to add ADHD pharmacotherapy. After that, I will integrate CBT and other psychotherapies, define monitoring and safety protocols, and finally address special populations and summarize a practical algorithm with contingencies for nonresponse and relapse prevention.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and rule out mimics, because symptom overlap between ADHD, mania/hypomania, anxiety, personality disorders, and substance effects can mislead diagnosis and treatment sequencing. I should verify childhood onset and chronicity for ADHD versus episodicity for bipolar disorder, and I need to check for mixed features, psychosis, and suicidality that would alter urgency and medication choices [^1111MV1s] [^116TscTM]. Hold on, I should verify that screening tools like the MDQ are only adjuncts and not diagnostic, and I will use collateral history and longitudinal mood charting to strengthen validity before committing to a treatment plan [^1111MV1s].

> Next, I should review treatment priorities using a hierarchical approach: stabilize mood first, then address ADHD, because ADHD treatments can destabilize bipolar disorder if introduced too early. I need to ensure acute mania, psychosis, or active suicidality are treated immediately, and only after euthymia is sustained should I consider stimulants or atomoxetine for ADHD [^114RoQaS] [^113k7kL9]. Wait, let me verify that guidelines align with this sequence. Yes, both CANMAT/ISBD and VA/DoD emphasize mood stabilization before treating comorbid ADHD, with explicit cautions about antidepressants and stimulants in unstable mood states [^114RoQaS].

> I will now examine mood stabilization pharmacotherapy for acute mania or mixed states. First-line options include lithium, valproate, or second-generation antipsychotics such as quetiapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, asenapine, with olanzapine or ziprasidone as alternatives, and I should avoid antidepressants during mania or with mixed features due to switch risk [^116gW6b1]. Hold on, I should verify dosing and monitoring. Lithium requires serum level checks and renal and thyroid monitoring, valproate needs hepatic and hematologic labs and level monitoring, and antipsychotics warrant metabolic screening and movement disorder surveillance, with inpatient care if risk is high or insight is poor [^116gW6b1].

> For bipolar depression, I need to check that first-line options include quetiapine, lurasidone with lithium or valproate, cariprazine, or lamotrigine, and I should confirm that antidepressants are generally avoided unless absolutely necessary and then only with a mood stabilizer and close monitoring for switch risk [^112SFpep]. Wait, I initially thought SSRIs might be broadly acceptable here, but I should correct that; guidelines advise caution and generally discourage antidepressant monotherapy in bipolar depression due to mania risk, so if used, they should be adjunctive and carefully monitored [^1132hWd6].

> Once euthymia is sustained for at least several weeks, I should consider ADHD pharmacotherapy. Stimulants such as methylphenidate or mixed amphetamine salts are reasonable adjuncts with mood stabilizers, and atomoxetine or bupropion are nonstimulant alternatives, but I need to ensure the bipolar regimen is optimized first to mitigate mania risk [^113k7kL9]. Hmm, wait a minute, I recall a signal that methylphenidate monotherapy increased mania risk in BD; let me verify that and confirm that concurrent mood stabilization mitigates this, which is supported by registry data and guideline cautions, reinforcing the need for combination therapy rather than stimulant monotherapy in BD [^113k7kL9]. I should double-check contemporary safety syntheses; a recent meta-analysis suggests psychostimulants in euthymic or depressed BD patients have limited risk of inducing mania, but heterogeneity is high, so I will still start low, go slow, and monitor closely [^116wiHTw].

> Now, I will integrate psychotherapy, starting with psychoeducation for the patient and family about bipolar disorder, early warning signs, sleep hygiene, and adherence, because this reduces relapse and improves functioning. CBT, IPSRT, family-focused therapy, and structured psychoeducation are all reasonable adjuncts, though no single modality is clearly superior, so I should match the approach to patient preference and needs [^113ZQ16B] [^115CLEd3] [^114ntsr2]. Hold on, I should verify that CBT is acceptable in BD; yes, guidelines suggest psychotherapy as adjunctive to pharmacotherapy outside acute mania, with CBT showing benefits for residual symptoms and relapse prevention, and WHO endorses individual psychological interventions including CBT in remission phases [^115CLEd3] [^1171DLeN].

> For ADHD-specific CBT, I need to ensure the bipolar disorder is stable before initiating structured CBT targeting executive dysfunction, organization, and emotional regulation. Adult ADHD CBT protocols are effective adjuncts to medication, but I should exclude severe mood instability or active mania from CBT enrollment to avoid overstimulation and nonadherence [^116MZLLQ] [^115UoYq2]. Wait, let me verify that the RCT literature supports CBT plus medication over medication alone in adults with ADHD; yes, randomized data demonstrate added benefit of CBT on top of pharmacotherapy, which supports sequencing CBT after mood stabilization in comorbid cases [^115UoYq2].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I will track mood weekly at initiation and then monthly with standardized scales such as YMRS for mania and IDS or PHQ for depression, and I will monitor ADHD symptoms with ASRS or similar scales once stimulants are introduced, while also checking adherence, sleep, substance use, and side effects at each visit [^notfound]. I need to ensure metabolic monitoring every three months for antipsychotics, periodic lithium and valproate levels, and thyroid and renal labs for lithium, and I will educate the patient to report emergent insomnia, irritability, or racing thoughts promptly as possible prodromal symptoms [^113U8oCE].

> I should confirm emergency contingencies. If there are early signs of mania such as decreased need for sleep, increased energy, or impulsivity, I will pause or reduce stimulant dose, reassess mood stabilizer adherence and levels, and consider adding or increasing an antimanic agent, with urgent psychiatric evaluation if symptoms escalate [^113k7kL9] [^116gW6b1]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines support holding or tapering stimulants during mood elevation. Yes, both VA/DoD and CANMAT advise prioritizing mood stabilization and adjusting ADHD medications if mood symptoms emerge [^114RoQaS].

> For special populations, let me consider pediatrics and geriatrics. In youth, comorbidity is common and ADHD symptoms may persist despite mood stabilization, so combined treatment is often necessary, with careful attention to metabolic risks and family psychoeducation, while in older adults I should screen for neurocognitive disorders and cardiovascular risk before initiating stimulants, using extra caution and lower starting doses with close monitoring [^114xrkz2]. I should double-check that case-based evidence supports stimulant use in geriatric BD with comorbid ADHD; yes, case reports suggest feasibility with mood stabilizers, but this remains low-certainty evidence requiring individualized risk–benefit assessment [^116UZkJe].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. First, confirm diagnoses and stabilize mood with lithium, valproate, or an SGA while avoiding antidepressants and stimulants in acute mania, then maintain euthymia for several weeks and optimize the mood regimen, next add a stimulant or atomoxetine at low dose with upward titration every one to two weeks while monitoring mood weekly, and concurrently initiate CBT or structured psychoeducation to enhance adherence and functional recovery, with ongoing measurement-based care and contingency plans for mood shifts [^116gW6b1] [^113k7kL9] [^113ZQ16B]. I should confirm that this sequence aligns with guideline hierarchies and safety cautions; it does, and it balances limited but growing evidence on stimulant safety in euthymic BD with the primacy of mood stabilization [^116wiHTw] [^114RoQaS].

> Finally, I need to ensure long-term maintenance and relapse prevention. Preferred maintenance agents include lithium, quetiapine, lamotrigine, aripiprazole, and olanzapine, chosen based on prior response, polarity, and tolerability, and I will continue psychotherapy and psychoeducation to sustain gains and detect early relapse signs, adjusting the ADHD regimen only within a stable mood context [^112SFpep] [^113ZQ16B]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for maintenance. Yes, multiple high-quality sources support adjunctive psychotherapies to reduce recurrence and improve functioning when paired with pharmacotherapy [^113ZQ16B] [^115CLEd3].

For comorbid bipolar I disorder and ADHD, **stabilize mood first** with mood stabilizers and/or atypical antipsychotics [^114RoQaS] [^113k7kL9], then **add stimulants cautiously** once euthymic, as they are effective for ADHD and generally safe with mood stabilization [^112sPDUz] [^116wiHTw]. Use **CBT as adjunctive therapy** to improve adherence, reduce relapse, and enhance functioning [^113ZQ16B] [^115CLEd3]. Monitor closely for mood destabilization and adjust treatment as needed [^114fkRFV].

---

## Diagnostic assessment and differential diagnosis

Careful assessment is essential to distinguish ADHD from bipolar disorder and other comorbidities, as **symptom overlap** is common [^1111MV1s] [^113k7kL9]. ADHD is chronic and pervasive, whereas bipolar disorder is episodic with discrete mood episodes [^113HX5fN]. Use structured interviews, collateral information, and validated scales (e.g. MDQ, HCL-32, ASRS) to improve diagnostic accuracy [^1111MV1s].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Mood stabilization

Mood stabilization is the **first priority** [^114RoQaS]; initiate mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate, lamotrigine) and/or atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, aripiprazole, olanzapine) to achieve euthymia before addressing ADHD [^113k7kL9] [^112SFpep].

---

### ADHD treatment

Once euthymic, **stimulants** (methylphenidate or amphetamines) can be added cautiously; they are effective for ADHD and generally safe with mood stabilization, though monitor for mood destabilization [^112sPDUz] [^116wiHTw]. Non-stimulant options (atomoxetine, bupropion) are alternatives if stimulants are contraindicated or poorly tolerated [^113k7kL9].

---

## Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

CBT is an **effective adjunct** to pharmacotherapy, improving adherence, reducing relapse, and enhancing functioning [^113ZQ16B] [^115CLEd3]. Key elements include:

- **Psychoeducation**: Teach about both disorders, triggers, and early warning signs [^113ZQ16B].
- **Cognitive restructuring**: Address maladaptive thoughts and behaviors [^113yQTnF].
- **Behavioral activation**: Increase adaptive activities and routines [^113ZQ16B].
- **Relapse prevention**: Develop coping strategies and crisis plans [^114fkRFV].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Regular monitoring is essential to detect mood changes, side effects, and adherence issues; use standardized scales (YMRS, IDS, ASRS) and track mood, sleep, and substance use [^113U8oCE] [^111YAcCH]. Adjust pharmacotherapy based on response and tolerability, and modify CBT to address emerging needs [^113ZQ16B].

---

## Potential risks and benefits

### Benefits

Improved mood stability and reduced relapse result from mood stabilization and **adjunctive CBT** [^113ZQ16B] [^115CLEd3]. ADHD symptom control improves once **stimulants** are added cautiously with mood stabilization [^112sPDUz] [^113k7kL9]. Overall functioning and quality of life also improve with **integrated care** [^113yQTnF].

---

### Risks

Mood destabilization can occur with **stimulants** if not adequately stabilized; monitor closely and adjust as needed [^112sPDUz] [^116wiHTw]. Medication side effects warrant **regular monitoring** and management [^114fkRFV]. Nonadherence increases **relapse risk**; address with psychoeducation and adherence strategies [^114EwuXa].

---

## Summary of treatment plan

| **Phase** | **Interventions** | **Goals** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute phase | Mood stabilization (lithium, valproate, atypical antipsychotics) | Stabilize mood, reduce mania/depression |
| Stabilization phase | Adjunctive CBT, psychoeducation | Improve adherence, reduce relapse |
| Maintenance phase | - Continued mood stabilization <br/> - Cautious stimulant addition <br/> - Ongoing CBT | - Maintain euthymia <br/> - Control ADHD symptoms <br/> - Enhance functioning |

---

Integrated treatment for comorbid bipolar I disorder and ADHD should **prioritize mood stabilization first**, then cautiously add stimulants with adjunctive CBT, with close monitoring and adjustments to optimize outcomes [^114RoQaS] [^113ZQ16B].

Development of a recovery plan — person-centered planning should center on goals identified by the individual being served, and within a recovery-oriented framework it is necessary to return to the "organic whole of the person" and the individual's ongoing life; identifying strengths, supportive community, and internal purpose, values, and mission can refocus on the individual managing their life with mental health care as an adjunct; immediate involvement of families or other supports also can enhance outcomes; frequency of care is a balance between what is necessary to provide clinical assistance and the individual's availability, and frequency of care should be addressed in a recovery plan with the individual being served; timeliness of care is reported to have been a determinative factor in the engagement of services; models of care might consider whole health activities to nurture balance; adherence enhancement customized for the individual, such as customized adherence engagement (CAE), might be helpful for individuals struggling with medication adherence, and individuals engaged in CAE might use this tool to stay on medication and remain in open communication with the provider.

3.3.1 Step 1: review general principles and assess medication status

Examination of a patient presenting in a manic state should include an immediate assessment for risk of aggressive behaviour, violence and safety threat to others, suicide risk especially in those with mixed features, degree of insight and the ability to adhere to treatment, comorbidity (including substance use that may be aggravating or contributing to clinical presentation), and availability of a psychosocial support network. A physical examination with laboratory investigations (described in Section 8) should be conducted, but may be deferred for patients who are uncooperative. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting (eg, ambulatory or inpatient).

Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a manic episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to drugs of abuse, medications, other treatments, or a general medical or neurological condition (although, even in these cases, symptomatic treatment may be applied on a short‐term basis). Steps should be taken to rule out any other factors that may be perpetuating symptoms such as prescribed medication, illicit drug use/abuse or an endocrine disorder. Any patients presenting with mania who have been taking antidepressants should have these medications discontinued. If there is a previous diagnosis of BD, it is appropriate to immediately commence antimanic agents. If this is the first emergence of manic symptoms, clinicians are advised to confirm the diagnosis of BD by monitoring patients for a period of time after antidepressant discontinuation and obtain collateral information to confirm whether symptoms remain and antimanic treatment is necessary. Patients should also be supported to discontinue stimulant use, including caffeine and alcohol. Current and prior therapies should be assessed, including appropriateness of medications, dosing, and trough serum levels (where indicated), as well as past response; and this should be used to direct subsequent therapeutic choices. Attention should be paid to managing withdrawal symptoms that may occur in manic patients with histories of substance abuse.

When the symptoms of mania have remitted, behavioural and educational strategies should be applied to promote ongoing medication adherence, reduce residual symptoms, help identify early signs of relapse, and support functional recovery (see Section 2).

3.3.2 Step 2: initiate or optimize therapy and check adherence

It is recommended that, for all patients (including those who are untreated as well as those receiving a non‐first‐line treatment), therapy be initiated with one of the available first‐line monotherapy or combination treatments.

### Prepubertal bipolar disorder: proper diagnosis should lead to better treatment response [^113W5Rio]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment research in prepubertal bipolar disorder remains in a rudimentary stage. Phenomenological evidence suggests it is a heterogeneous disorder with varying degrees of rapid cycling, aggression, and psychosis often accompanied by comorbid diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and anxiety disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder. Longitudinal and family history studies suggest prepubertal bipolar disorder may be more treatment-resistant than later-onset bipolar disorder. Neurobiological studies to guide treatment, though promising, remain in their infancy. Clinical trials to date (mostly open studies) often have lumped together subjects with manic, hypomanic, and mixed presentations with different and/or undiagnosed comorbidities, making meaningful comparisons of treatment response difficult. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed to clarify best treatment options for bipolar subtypes with and without comorbid disorders. More homogeneous diagnostic groupings based on episode and duration criteria and a more patient-centered, symptom-based approach should be considered in treatment designs.

### Evidence-based guidelines for treating bipolar disorder: revised second edition – recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^11253K1E]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines specify the scope and target of treatment for bipolar disorder. The second version, like the first, is based explicitly on the available evidence and presented, like previous Clinical Practice guidelines, as recommendations to aid clinical decision making for practitioners: they may also serve as a source of information for patients and carers. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed but selective qualitative review of the available evidence. A consensus meeting, involving experts in bipolar disorder and its treatment, reviewed key areas and considered the strength of evidence and clinical implications. The guidelines were drawn up after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. The strength of supporting evidence was rated. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, clinical management, and strategies for the use of medicines in treatment of episodes, relapse prevention and stopping treatment.

### Update on attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and tic disorders: a review of the current literature [^1138vcH5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Tic disorders impact quality of life, but when they are co-occurring with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, the combined impact takes a toll on psychosocial functioning and adds another layer of complexity to treatment approaches. A review of the current literature supports evidence of a unique relationship between comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and tic disorders, emphasizing the intricate phenotype and impairment associated with these co-occurring conditions. The complexity of these symptoms requires careful diagnosis and appropriate treatment as determined by the level of impairment and can include pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, or a combination of therapies. To achieve the greatest benefits in improving quality of life and eliminating further comorbidity, an ideal treatment plan would include a comprehensive evaluation as well as a hierarchical treatment approach involving education of the child, family, and teachers; careful medication management; and cognitive and behavioral training.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in the management of pediatric-onset bipolar disorder [^117MpUyu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis of pediatric-onset bipolar disorder is controversial, an increasing literature of systematic research has challenged the traditional view that this disorder is a rare condition. This article summarizes research regarding the atypical presentation of pediatric bipolar disorder and its overlap with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and other comorbid conditions, as well as family-genetic and treatment data. When structured interview data were examined, cases of pediatric mania constituted 16% of referrals to our outpatient clinic. Presentation is atypical by adult standards and includes irritability, chronicity, and mixed state. Family-genetic and treatment data help to establish diagnostic validity. Pediatric bipolar disorder is not a rare condition. Treatment requires a combined pharmacotherapy approach to address issues of comorbidity. Atypical antipsychotic medications have provided promising treatment results, but additional controlled clinical trials are needed.

Table 6
Features of depression that may increase suspicion of a bipolar vs unipolar illness

In addition to this under‐diagnosis, there are also concerns that BD may be over‐diagnosed in some circumstances. 41 For instance, the symptoms of borderline personality disorder, substance use disorder (SUD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) overlap significantly those of hypomania/mania, and some reports suggest that patients with these conditions often get misdiagnosed with BD. These conditions also are often comorbid with BD, which makes the diagnosis of this condition often challenging. 42

Validated self‐report instruments, such as the Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ), may be used as a screening tool to flag patients for whom a more detailed assessment is needed. It is important to note, that such tools have poor sensitivity and specificity, especially in community or highly comorbid populations, and will thus have an elevated risk of also flagging those with borderline traits. 43 As such, tools such as the MDQ should be used only as an adjunct for screening clinical populations and not for diagnostic or treatment planning purposes.

To improve the accuracy of diagnosis, it is important that clinicians strictly adhere to diagnostic criteria rather than relying on heuristics. 44 It is important to complete a careful psychiatric history, including in first‐degree relatives, with attention paid to any suspected periods of increased activity, irritability, or other change in behaviours. Collateral information from friends and family members should be included wherever possible. Ongoing monitoring of symptoms, such as mood charting, can also help to detect bipolarity that may only become apparent over time. Confirmation of the diagnosis can then be made more confidently when episodes are prospectively observed.

2.2.5 Comorbidities and mimics

As described in Section 6, patients diagnosed with BD very commonly have one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, with SUDs, impulse control disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders (especially cluster B disorders) particularly common. 45 The presence of comorbidity increases the complexity of the illness and can make an accurate diagnosis even more difficult.

In addition to differentiating BD from other psychiatric diagnoses, alternative causes of mood symptoms, such as personality disorders, medical or neurological conditions, substance use, and medications must be considered in the differential diagnosis (Table 7).

### Evidence-based guidelines for treating bipolar disorder: revised third edition recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^115Xmr49]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines specify the scope and targets of treatment for bipolar disorder. The third version is based explicitly on the available evidence and presented, like previous Clinical Practice Guidelines, as recommendations to aid clinical decision making for practitioners: it may also serve as a source of information for patients and carers, and assist audit. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the corresponding evidence. A consensus meeting, involving experts in bipolar disorder and its treatment, reviewed key areas and considered the strength of evidence and clinical implications. The guidelines were drawn up after extensive feedback from these participants. The best evidence from randomized controlled trials and, where available, observational studies employing quasi-experimental designs was used to evaluate treatment options. The strength of recommendations has been described using the GRADE approach. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, clinical management, and strategies for the use of medicines in short-term treatment of episodes, relapse prevention and stopping treatment. The use of medication is integrated with a coherent approach to psychoeducation and behaviour change.

Treatment of comorbid conditions

ADHD. Stimulants may also be used for comorbid ADHD in stable/euthymic youth taking optimal doses of anti‐manic medications. Adjunctive mixed amphetamine salts (level 3) 611 and methylphenidate (level 3) 612 have both been shown to be effective in addressing attention symptoms and have been well tolerated overall within the RCTs completed to date, theoretical and epidemiological data regarding risks of induction of mood elevation notwithstanding. 613 Although open trials suggest potential benefits of atomoxetine (level 4), 614, 615 the possibility of inducing mania or hypomania remains, 616 suggesting the need for RCTs before clinical recommendations can be made.

Substance use. Comorbid substance use should be treated concurrently to mood symptoms, with inpatient hospital or community residential treatment employed as clinically indicated. A small study suggests that lithium may be effective for reducing substance use in this population (level 3), 617 and FFT should also be considered (Section 2). Positive trials of N ‐acetylcysteine for cannabis use disorders among adolescents, 618 smoking, 619 and bipolar depression among adults 281 suggest that N ‐acetylcysteine may benefit adolescents with comorbid bipolar and SUDs; however, studies examining this hypothesis have not yet been completed (level 4).

7.3 Management of bipolar disorder in older age

7.3.1 Presentation and course

Because of the aging population in Canada and many countries around the world, knowledge of pertinent issues related to the management of older adults is becoming increasingly important. Approximately 6% of geriatric psychiatry outpatients and 10% of inpatients have BD, 620 and proportionally this population is one of the highest users of psychiatric and physical health services. 621 Approximately 25% of the patients with BD in the USA in 2005 were over the age of 60 years, 622 and by 2030 > 50% of patients with BD are expected to be aged > 60 years. 623

The lifetime prevalence of late‐life BD is about 1%‐2% with a 1‐year prevalence of 0.1%‐0.7% in the general population. About 90%‐95% of older adults with bipolar disorder have their initial episode prior to age 50 years, although there is a minority who will have a later onset. 624, 625 Late onset is often related to neurological or physical comorbidity, 626 and may carry a negative prognosis, 627 although this is not a consistent finding. 628

2.4 Chronic disease management

Due to the chronic, relapsing and remitting nature of BD, a long‐term, multidisciplinary approach to management is needed. The Chronic Disease Management Model 56 outlines several important principles to enhance long‐term care for these individuals and their families (Table 9). After basic clinical management, including attention to diagnosis, comorbidity, and medical health has been established, patient health education and pharmacotherapy should be the initial and foundational steps for all patients. Ideally, the patient will be connected to a health care team which includes at least one other health care professional (typically a nurse) in addition to the psychiatrist for psychoeducation, ongoing monitoring, psychosocial support, and referral to community resources. 57 All patients should have access to a primary care provider to attend to mental and physical health needs. If the patient is stable and discharged to primary care, the mental health care system should provide support directly to the primary care provider with attention to continuity of care. 58 Additional psychosocial treatments (described below) may also be selected to fit the specific needs and preferences of the patient.

Table 9
The chronic disease management model

A strong therapeutic alliance is central to improve treatment adherence and outcomes. 59, 60 Providers should encourage individuals to actively participate in treatment planning, using a shared decision‐making approach. 61, 62 Whenever possible, family members or key friends should be included as part of the care team. There is evidence that specialized, team‐approach‐based interventions combining pharmacotherapy and psychoeducation are more effective than standard community care. 63

Regular, ongoing monitoring of mood symptoms and other measures related to the patient's own individual recovery, such as sleep, cognition, functioning, and quality of life is encouraged. 18 For many patients, daily recording of mood symptoms such as through a mood diary or National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Life Chart Method‐Self Rating Scale can help identify early warning signs of relapse, as well as outline relationships between mood and treatment or lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, or stress. 64 While many patients will agree with the value of completing a mood diary, and this strategy has been shown to improve treatment, regular completion can be a burden. 65 Online solutions such as mobile apps may improve adherence, 66 such as the Self‐Monitoring and Psychoeducation In Bipolar Patients smartphone app (SIMPLE) which provides weekly and daily mood tests, with reminders to take medication or see their doctor. 67, 68, 69

Comorbid conditions management and referral (KAS 7) indicates the PCC, if trained or experienced in diagnosing comorbid conditions, may initiate treatment of such conditions or make a referral to an appropriate subspecialist for treatment, and if the PCC is not trained or experienced in making the diagnosis or initiating treatment, the patient should be referred to an appropriate subspecialist to make the diagnosis and initiate treatment; this is a Grade C, recommendation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Evidence‐based medicine ultimately must proceed on the basis of what works for an individual patient. Data from randomized placebo controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for making clinical judgments. However, there are many pitfalls to this assumption. Patients are highly selected for homogeneity for the RCTs and typically do not represent the range and complexity of patients in the general population. There is little room for generating clinical predictors of response, as only half the patients receive the active medication, real responders cannot be readily separated from placebo responders, and secondary analyses of possible predictors and subgroups have methodological limitations that are frowned upon by the FDA and many journal editors and referees.

However, the most egregious deficit is that there are rarely sufficient RCTs in patients with bipolar disorder to cover the whole range of first‐, second‐, or third‐line treatments and even when an RCT does exist in a given area, it often provides no guidance for the clinician interested in knowing what might be the next best option for nonresponders. Another problem is that most current treatment guidelines take the perspective that most patients are responsive to initial treatment, while in reality, many patients (perhaps the majority in some settings) present with complex late stage illness that shows considerable treatment refractoriness that is rarely addressed in RCTs. These treatment refractory patients are often excluded from industry‐sponsored RCTs, as relatively early stage and treatment naive patients are more likely to show responsiveness and thus help obtain FDA approval for a given drug. An additional gap in RCTs is the unfortunate exclusion of people with serious suicidal ideation, personality disorder, and medical, behavioral, and substance abuse comorbidities.

In this manuscript, we review potential treatment options for these more difficult patients, and focus on the most sought after goal of achieving and maintaining remission. We thought it appropriate to take a clinician's perspective in thinking about other types of evidence which clinicians might use. Here we include data: from nonrandomized studies; comparative studies without a placebo; studies of effectiveness, safety, and utility of a drug in related but nonbipolar populations; preliminary and pilot studies; and even those based on minimal treatment effectiveness, but having a strong theoretical foundation and/or a record of safety.

Clinicians who treat children and adolescents with bipolar disorder desperately need current treatment guidelines. These guidelines were developed by expert consensus and a review of the extant literature about the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric bipolar disorders. The four sections of these guidelines include diagnosis, comorbidity, acute treatment, and maintenance treatment. These guidelines are not intended to serve as an absolute standard of medical or psychological care but rather to serve as clinically useful guidelines for evaluation and treatment that can be used in the care of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. These guidelines are subject to change as our evidence base increases and practice patterns evolve.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines specify the scope and target of treatment for bipolar disorder. They are based explicitly on the available evidence and presented, similar to previous Clinical Practice guidelines, as recommendations to aid clinical decision-making for practitioners. They may also serve as a source of information for patients and carers. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the available evidence. A consensus meeting, involving experts in bipolar disorder and its treatment, reviewed key areas and considered the strength of evidence and clinical implications. The guidelines were drawn up after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. The strength of supporting evidence was rated. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, clinical management and strategies for the use of medicines in short-term treatment of episodes, relapse prevention and stopping treatment.

### Evidence-based guidelines for bipolar disorder therapy… [^117WVWi6]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with depression are now recognized as having bipolar disorder, a chronic biphasic mood disorder with episodes of both depression and mania or hypomania. Successful management of bipolar disorder requires suppression of acute mania, treatment of acute depression, and prevention of relapse into either condition. No single medication can achieve all of these objectives. McIntyre and colleagues examined evidence supporting the efficacy of each of the medications commonly used to treat bipolar disorder. Their review article stresses the need for individualization of therapy and adaptation to the changing needs of each patient over time. The second-generation antiepileptic drugs divalproex and carbamazepine are highly effective in patients with acute mania, but have less effect in patients with depression and in the prevention of symptom recurrence.

These drugs are useful in patients who do not respond to lithium, but their use is limited by side effects such as weight gain and sedation, as well as multiple drug-drug interactions and the need to monitor blood levels of the drug along with hepatic and hematologic indexes. The conventional antipsychotic agents, such as haloperidol, have been used to treat acute mania, but their use is limited by dysphoria, tardive dyskinesia, and extrapyramidal effects. The novel antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine, have direct antidepressant effects and are highly effective against mania. These actions appear to be independent of the antipsychotic effects of these drugs, and most bipolar patients benefit at low dosages.

This group of drugs may be particularly effective as adjunctive therapy with antidepressants in patients with bipolar depression and in maintenance therapy, when combined with lithium or divalproex. The biggest disadvantage of the novel antipsychotics is weight gain; lipid and glucose abnormalities also occur. Although evidence is limited, antidepressants are commonly used for short periods to treat patients in the depressed phase of bipolar disorder. The danger of precipitating mania is reported to be greatest with tricyclic agents. The authors conclude that a combination of medical and psychosocial strategies is required for successful treatment of bipolar disorder. Patients frequently have problems adhering to therapy and require education and assistance with lifestyle issues to cope with this lifelong condition.

The BAP has provided a review of the research evidence and clinical experience in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It has produced guidelines that give very real practical advice to clinicians in the day-to-day management of this difficult condition. Its recommended enhancement of routine care may well increase adherence to treatment, especially if the patient is involved in choice of medicine, leading to lower overall morbidity. It is timely since awareness of the specific needs of bipolar patients is growing and there is an increased choice of effective treatments for all phases of the illness.

### Suspected geriatric onset of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in a patient with comorbid bipolar disorder [^112LzbCi]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case report describes a suspected rare onset of geriatric ADHD in the context of long-standing adult bipolar disorder that was effectively managed with psychostimulant medication and mood stabilizers. A limitation to this case study includes the limited psychiatric history of symptoms prior to her presentation in our care system, and it is unclear how long she had been suffering from symptoms of ADHD; as well as the lack of symptom scoring data. It is possible that ADHD could have onset at a younger age and been underdiagnosed, but the patients presenting chief complaint of new forgetfulness suggests geriatric onset. Additionally, methylphenidates' possible antidepressant effect may also have therapeutic benefit in this case. The findings of this case report emphasize the importance of appropriately recognizing and treating suspected comorbid ADHD and bipolar disorder in any age group, including the geriatric population for which this occurrence appears very rare, as there are no known reported cases prior.

Importantly, major neurocognitive disorders were considered in the differential diagnosis for this patient, and donepezil was prescribed by psychiatry prior to the initiation of psychostimulants with no observed clinical benefit, although this does not rule out a possible neurocognitive diagnosis. Additionally, neurology consultation was not suggestive of cognitive decline, but rather of suspected undertreated psychiatric illness, and even recommendation to discontinue donepezil. The incidence of major and minor neurocognitive disorders is far more common in the geriatric population than geriatric onset ADHD. Still, both conditions also have overlapping symptoms in regard to difficulties with concentration and attention. Notably, there have been recent investigations of utilizing psychostimulants (including methylphenidate) in treating apathy associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Methylphenidate is also used off-label for major depression in the elderly with medical illness, palliative care, or terminal illness. It is possible that the patient we describe in this case report benefitted from methylphenidate in this manner, reducing symptoms of possible pseudodementia. However, because the primary symptoms were intention with subsequent frustration and depression thereafter, we consider it more likely that the therapeutic response was due to treating the geriatric onset ADHD. Although, if pseudodementia was the primary concern, this case would still demonstrate a safe and effective utilization of methylphenidate in an elderly patient, and there is evidence that psychostimulant augmentation of antidepressants may be an effective strategy in adults.

Evidence suggests that manual-based psychotherapies, when provided as augmentations to appropriate psychopharmacological treatment, are effective at improving outcomes compared with psychopharmacology alone, with improvements including reduced illness recurrence and decreased mania and depression severity at follow-up (typically assessed 6–12 months after treatment completion). A systematic review including a total of 24 studies comparing psychotherapies and TAU found lower recurrence rates for manualized psychotherapies than control treatments (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.43–0.74).

6.2 Limitations, gaps, and future directions

Positive RCTs for maintenance treatment and bipolar depression are lacking, although preliminary positive open trials hold promise. Pharmacologic treatment of comorbidities other than ADHD is another gap. Given concerns about heterogeneity of longitudinal course, it would be helpful to examine whether subtype of BD or age of onset moderates treatment response. Future studies should include neuroimaging, neurocognition, and peripheral biomarkers as moderators and predictors of treatment response. Large‐scale RCTs of nutritional interventions are warranted, based on positive pilot RCTs and open‐label trials. Studies concentrating on CycD and OS‐BRD are crucial to address the need for titrated and evidence‐based options, along with more masked maintenance studies to look at altering trajectories, and head‐to‐head trials and trials of combinations with non‐pharmacologic treatments. Although systematically addressing the topic of offspring of parents with BD was beyond the scope of this article, it is important to note that there is also a need for large‐scale RCTs examining the relative efficacy, tolerability, and safety of antidepressants vs mood stabilizers for anxiety and/or depression, and the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of stimulants for ADHD, among BD offspring.

### Cognitive-behavioural therapy in medication-treated adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and co-morbid psychopathology: a randomized controlled trial using multi-level analysis [^115UoYq2]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Method

Trial design

A parallel-group RCT was conducted at an ADHD out-patient setting within the Mental Health Services at Landspitali – The National University Hospital of Iceland. All participants meeting inclusion criteria were independently and individually randomly allocated (1:1) to receive the R&R2ADHD programme (CBT/MED) or treatment as usual (TAU/MED). Assessments occurred at three time points: baseline, end of treatment and 3 months after treatment. The study was registered with the International Clinical Trials Registry (no. 12611000533998).

An a priori power calculation was conducted using G*Power (Faul et al.) to estimate the sample size required. Safren et al. obtained a large effect size between CBT-treated medicated adults with ADHD and those treated by medication only. In view of the fact that the Safren et al. study involved individual rather than group therapy, where the effect size is likely to be larger, we used an estimated effect size of 0.50. The power was set at 80% and the level of significance at 0.05. This suggested a sample of n = 51 in each group.

Participants

Participants were either hospital referrals for out-patient rehabilitation made by the Mental Health Services at the Landspitali University Hospital, referrals from private practitioners or self-referrals from an advertisement placed with a national ADHD support group (Icelandic ADHD Association). Participants were eligible for the study if they were over 18 years of age, had a current ADHD diagnosis and had been stable on prescribed ADHD medication for at least 1 month. Participants were asked to keep dosages unchanged during the study. Exclusion criteria were severe mental illness (i.e. psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder), severe eating disorder, active suicidal ideation, active drug abuse and history of intellectual impairment as the treatment programme would not be suitable for these patient groups without modification. Exclusion criteria were assessed from a review of medical records, in addition to a baseline assessment by an experienced mental health practitioner (see Baseline assessments section).

### Recognizing and managing bipolar disorder in children [^114xXraM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder affects people of all ages, including preschool-aged children. Two major difficulties in diagnosing children with bipolar disorder are its overlap with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its developmentally distinct presentation from that in adults, with high rates of irritability, chronicity, and mixed states. Comorbid conditions are common in bipolar disorder and, in addition to ADHD, include depression, anxiety disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. Family studies have helped to confirm the validity of bipolar disorder in children. In terms of treatment, children do not appear to respond well to conventional mood stabilizers alone. However, using an atypical antipsychotic either alone or in addition to another mood stabilizer has shown utility in treating manic symptoms, depression in mixed states, and aggression. Amphetamine salts have been helpful in treating bipolar children with comorbid ADHD, but no data are available on treating comorbid depression in bipolar children. Because childhood-onset mania is commonly chronic rather than episodic, highly comorbid, and characterized by high rates of irritability, future clinical trials should examine the overlap of mania with other disorders in children to determine routes to accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^114RoQaS]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

7.4.1.1 Epidemiology

Most patients diagnosed with BD will also have at least one comorbid psychiatric diagnosis. The most common comorbid conditions are substance use disorder, anxiety disorder, personality disorder, and impulse control disorder (such as ADHD, ODD, and CD). 45 Comorbidity impacts the course of BDs by increasing the likelihood of treatment resistance and suicide risk, and also by increasing the time spent with impairing symptoms. 34, 50, 669, 670

When treating comorbid conditions, determining which disorder to address first requires careful consideration. Some comorbid disorders may be managed with the same treatment employed to manage bipolar symptoms (eg, quetiapine for comorbid anxiety and BD), while other comorbid disorders (eg, ADHD) may require distinct treatments. Importantly, some treatments for comorbid disorders may lead to bipolar symptom destabilization; for instance, an antidepressant employed to treat an anxiety disorder may provoke mood elevation.

Safely and effectively managing comorbid conditions often necessitates the implementation of a hierarchical approach, depending on each patient's individual needs and preferences. In general, the disorder or symptom associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality — such as acute mania, psychosis, or suicidal ideation — should be managed first. Substance use disorders may be addressed concurrently or sequentially, depending on severity and contribution to mood instability. Once mood stability is established, the treatment of additional comorbid conditions, such as ADHD or metabolic disorders, should follow based on their impact and the patient's preference.

There is a dearth of research to guide the best management of BD in the context of comorbid conditions. There have been few trials designed with comorbid symptoms as the primary target for mood‐stabilizing treatments — evidence is mainly derived from secondary analysis of published data. Thus, the limited research informing the treatment of comorbidities constrains our ability to make definitive recommendations. However, because comorbidity is so common and burdensome for patients, appropriate management is a challenging daily reality in clinical practice. Therefore, CANMAT decided to provide a brief overview of relevant clinical issues and the evidence base for pharmacological treatments for treating comorbid populations. The reader is advised to consult the following references for the role of psychological treatments in managing comorbidity. 671, 672, 673

### Challenges and opportunities in the diagnosis and treatment of early-onset psychosis: a case series from the youth affective disorders clinic in stockholm, Sweden [^116iFZu9]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

Affective and psychotic symptom interplay

As mood symptoms receded, latent psychotic symptoms became evident. Addressing these was crucial for managing the patient's suicidality, and clinicians may consider the possibility of latent psychotic symptoms in severe psychiatric presentations unresponsive to standard treatments.

This case accentuates the need for continual reassessment, especially when treatment resistance or new symptomology is observed. Given the stakes involved — sometimes life and death — meticulous attention to these factors is not just advisable but essential.

Patient 2: differential diagnosis in youth with complex neuropsychiatric presentations

The second case shows that treating bipolar disorder with psychotic features can make gender dysphoria assessments possible. Prior to treatment, the patient had been denied such assessments due to the severity of their symptoms. Up to 25% of individuals with schizophrenia may also experience gender dysphoria. The case confirms both conditions can co-exist, and gender dysphoria may persist post-psychotic treatment. Effective treatment of psychotic symptoms thus serves dual purposes: improving mental health and facilitating gender reassignment assessments.

Furthermore, this case underscores the importance of adhering to a hierarchical approach in the diagnostic process. Similar to case 1, the auditory hallucinations were initially considered to be symptoms of less severe disorders rather than signs of an ongoing psychotic process. It was not until structured screening tools suggested the possibility of psychosis, which was initially thought to indicate dissociation associated with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD), that a reevaluation occurred. As with case 1, a significant remission of symptoms was only achieved after these experiences were reclassified as psychotic symptoms and treated with targeted antipsychotic medication.

Patient 3: misdiagnosis and the primacy of severe mental disorders

This case emphasizes the need for thorough assessments in patients with rapidly worsening behavioral and cognitive symptoms. The symptom overlap between disorganized psychosis and comorbid ADHD/ASD further highlights the risks of not using a diagnostic hierarchy. Initial assessments focused on neuropsychiatric and behavioral comorbidities, potentially overlooking broader severe mental illnesses like psychosis. Such misdiagnoses can lead to ineffective treatments that exacerbate the condition; such as the prescription of central stimulants to a child with severe psychotic symptoms. In youth with acute episodes and significant functional impairments, clinicians may improve outcomes by focusing on possible severe mental illnesses rather than multiple, less severe conditions. This approach requires deep understanding of neurobiology, cognitive processes, and symptom trajectory. Overall, the case stresses the importance of precise differentiation among these conditions, and suggests prioritizing treatment of severe mental disorders for better outcomes.

### Adult ADHD and its comorbidities, with a focus on bipolar disorder [^114Aargt]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a syndrome that most often presents in childhood. However, the condition is also relatively common in adults, with prevalence rates reaching 5% in the general population, with more than half the children affected by ADHD retaining the condition during their adult years. While the disorder in children is most often described as a disorder involving hyperactivity and impulsiveness, ADHD presents with very different characteristics in adulthood, notably with less externalizing symptoms and with a higher rate of psychiatric comorbidities, including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (BD), anxiety disorders and substance abuse. This review will focus on the evidence relating to bipolar disorder BD and its potential link with ADHD, looking at epidemiological, familial and neuroimaging studies. The comorbid presentation of people suffering with ADHD and BD (ADHD/BD) is associated with a more severe disease course, more severe mood disorder symptoms, and lower functional scores. Importantly, the co-segregation of these two conditions makes ADHD diagnosis challenging because its symptoms are often mistakenly assumed to be part of BD. As a result, patients with comorbid ADHD/BD are under-diagnosed and under-treated. Optimal diagnosis, understanding and treatment of the comorbid condition are important, as ADHD/BD has been associated with significant functional impairment and suboptimal treatment responses when compared to ADHD or BD populations alone.

### Suspected geriatric onset of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in a patient with comorbid bipolar disorder [^116UZkJe]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

An increasing number of adults over 60 years old are presenting with requests for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the prevalence of ADHD in older adults in geriatrics is unknown. Further, comorbid bipolar disorder and adult ADHD are likely underrecognized with many patients only receiving treatment for one of these conditions. The occurrence of bipolar disorder with geriatric onset ADHD is unknown.

Case Presentation

A 64-year-old Hispanic woman with a psychiatric history of bipolar I disorder (diagnosed in early adulthood) was diagnosed with ADHD suspected of geriatric onset, and able to be successfully managed on concurrent mood stabilizers and psychostimulant medication.

Conclusions

The findings of this case report emphasize the importance of appropriately recognizing and treating comorbid ADHD and bipolar disorder in any age group, including the geriatric population for which this occurrence appears to be very rare. Additionally, this case report demonstrates the safe utilization of psychostimulant medications in a geriatric patient with bipolar disorder without inducing a manic episode or other significant adverse reactions.

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy: applications for the management of bipolar disorder [^113yQTnF]. Bipolar Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

This paper reviews cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for bipolar disorder (BD). Data on the poor outcome of about 50% of patients diagnosed with BD supports the addition of a psychosocial intervention for the treatment of this recurring disorder. The psychoeducational nature of CBT, the effectiveness of CBT in increasing compliance to pharmacological treatment, and the ability of CBT to prevent relapse in unipolar depression (UD) are well suited to the treatment of BD.

Method

Psychosocial interventions for BD will be briefly reviewed. Individual and group CBT interventions (published and unpublished) will also be reviewed. The significance of comorbid anxiety disorders regarding response to treatment will also be discussed. A review of the treatment protocol with the specific cognitive-behavioral interventions as applied to BD will be presented. Finally, a case example will be presented to illustrate the application of CBT to BD.

Results

Preliminary results indicate that CBT may be an effective adjunctive, intervention for the treatment of BD. Specifically CBT may be helpful in increasing compliance, improving quality of life and functioning, help early symptom recognition, decrease relapse and decrease depressive symptomatology.

Conclusions

Preliminary data on CBT for BD are promising but more rigorous randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of CBT for BD. An other area of research should be to pursue the understanding of cognitive processes in BD which would allow us to refine and develop CBT interventions unique to this disorder.

### Expanded treatment options and addressing unmet needs in the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder [^1127zhQT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Bipolar disorder presents on a spectrum, with bipolar depression on one end and bipolar I on the other and a host of other presentations in between. In addition to its many permutations and the difficulty of differentiating between diagnoses, comorbidities, incorrect treatment, and low self-report contribute to delayed diagnoses and inappropriate or delayed treatment. Once a diagnosis is reached, the latest evidence of the safety and efficacy profiles of existing and emerging treatments adds to the complexity when developing treatment strategies for patients with bipolar disorder. As guidelines are updated and new treatments become available, developing individualized treatment regimens is key and collaboration between clinician and patient and family is critical in optimizing patient outcomes. New treatment options can reduce some of the side effect burdens associated with treating bipolar disorder, and clinicians should use measurement-based care to assess whether treatment changes are necessary, which requires engaging with the patient to monitor efficacy and manage side effects. It is important to ensure that the patient and family understand the information to foster informed decision making and create a better therapeutic alliance. Involving patients in designing their own treatment strategies according to their tolerability criteria can help combat the 90% nonadherence rate, and ultimately lead to better patient care.

### Methodological recommendations for cognition trials in bipolar disorder by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders targeting cognition task force [^1126SDYb]. Bipolar Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

There is a need for consensus on how to tackle medical and psychiatric comorbidity in cognition trials. In general, patients should be excluded if they have a history of moderate or more severe brain injury, neurological disease, current uncontrolled thyroid condition, unstable medical illness, current or recent (i.e. within the past 1‐3 months) alcohol and substance use disorders, or intellectual disability, since these are likely to hamper the chances of treatment efficacy on cognition. Patients should also be excluded if they have a current comorbid diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder verified during the diagnostic screening interview, since the investigational treatment aims target cognitive deficits associated more specifically with bipolar disorder. Comorbid anxiety and sleep disorders may exacerbate patients' cognitive impairment. However, they should not be exclusion criteria since this would impede recruitment and generalizability, given the high comorbidity between bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders 36 and high rates of circadian rhythm disturbance and abnormal sleep in bipolar disorder. 37 However, careful recording of anxiety symptoms and sleep quality during the trial is advisable as this enables investigation of their potential influence on treatment effects on cognition in exploratory post hoc analyses. Finally, patients recruited into cognition trials should have mastery of the language in which the neuropsychological tests are validated/administered, as this is necessary for obtaining valid cognitive assessments during the trial.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: rational pragmatic approaches to management [^111P5Vu8]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The evidence for efficacy of many currently available treatments for bipolar disorder is based on studies of nonrefractory patients with bipolar disorder. Therefore, not surprisingly, most treatment recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder and its many comorbidities depend heavily on data from placebo controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs), but these RCTs provide little direction for the clinician as to what next steps might be optimal in non‐ or partial‐responders and in those with ongoing medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Given this and the paucity of RCTs at later treatment junctures, we thought it appropriate to begin a discussion of the quality of the data that some experts in the field might consider using in choosing and sequencing drugs and their combination. We acknowledge that many other clinical investigators may prefer very different sequences, but thought the suggestions offered here might be useful to some clinicians in the field, might start discussions of other options in the literature, and, at the same time, provide a preliminary outline for a new round of much‐needed clinical trials to better inform clinical practice. Given the very wide range of the quality of the data and clinical principles on which the current suggestions are based, only minimal references are included and a comprehensive review of the literature supporting each option would be outside the scope of this manuscript.

### The role of pharmacologic treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder [^117T7Lwt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

With the growth in the number of pharmacologic options available for the treatment of bipolar disorder, clinicians face a challenge in appropriately selecting and sequencing newer and older treatments. Because evidence-based practice has been suggested as a way to improve outcomes across specialties in medicine, a number of practice guidelines and treatment algorithms for bipolar disorder have been developed to aid clinical decision-making. Most of these guidelines and algorithms are based on detailed reviews of the medical literature, with an emphasis on systematic reviews and randomized, controlled trials. Some guidelines incorporate a consensus of expert opinion when the literature does not provide clear evidence. This review examines areas of overlap and discordance in practice guidelines issued by the American Psychiatric Association and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, as well as treatment algorithms developed by the Expert Consensus Guideline Series and the Texas Medical Algorithm Project.

Early-onset bipolar disorder (BD) is often misdiagnosed and inadequately treated because of the varying constellation of symptoms that occur across different developmental stages, the variety of disorders with similar presentation, and the frequent comorbidities. The etiology of BD is complex, but research confirms the major role that genetics and environment play in its development. The pediatrician initially identifies most cases, with subsequent referral to mental health providers. A complex case involving a child initially diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and later found to have comorbid childhood BD is considered, illustrating diagnostic considerations and appropriate behavioral and psychopharmacological intervention.

Bipolar disorder

How does one distinguish ADHD from Bipolar Disorder (BD)?

As a neurodevelopmental disorder, the features of ADHD are usually present early in childhood and often cause functional impairment by the time a child is in primary school, whereas BD usually presents in teenage years with peak onset described as between 15 and 19 years. Another factor that helps distinguish ADHD from BD is the course of symptoms as in ADHD the symptoms are pervasive and generally chronic over time (with some variation in severity); BD presents with an episodic course of symptoms (in children and adolescents these episodes may have shorter durations than those seen in adults) with periods of euthymia interspersed. Lastly, ADHD is a disorder of attention, motor activity and impulsivity whereas BD is a disorder of mood. Of course, these disorders may occur co-morbidly as well, and if this is the case appropriate management strategies should be employed.

How does one distinguish Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) from BD?

BD is a disorder of mood characterised by discrete mood episodes. Periods between the mood episodes also described as euthymia are usually characterised by stable psychosocial functioning. Borderline personality disorder (BPD), also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD), is a personality disorder characterised by a long-term pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships, distorted sense of self and marked affective instability. The affective instability is often triggered by environmental factors and usually lasts hours to days, unlike the mood episodes in BD which last weeks to months. Other clinical variables that help distinguish BD from BPD include: response to pharmacology in BD, a family history of BD, and the fact that BPD is often associated with significant early life trauma. When in developing individualised treatment approach, adopting a dimensional approach in addition to a categorical approach, is beneficial particularly when these conditions are co-morbid.

### Practice parameter on the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents [^116barhH]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic treatment sequencing by disorder — evidence guidance indicates that traditionally, psychosocial treatments, following their recommended dosing, duration, and monitoring, are recommended before pharmacological treatment, but data are increasingly available from comparative treatment trials to guide the selection of first-line treatment. To date, randomized controlled trials suggest that medication management for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the first-line treatment and that medication combined with behavioral treatment may be required for optimal outcome in children with more complex problems. For obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), beginning with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), especially if delivered by expert psychotherapists, or combined treatment is the best option. In contrast, the Treatment of Adolescent Depression Study demonstrated efficacy for combination therapy and medication management but not for cognitive-behavioral therapy alone at 12 weeks, suggesting that beginning with psychotherapy only in moderate to severe depression may not be the best first step. Prescribers are guided by the evidence base in developing their treatment plan, the evidence base for pediatric psychopharmacology is far from complete, and when a disorder precludes active participation in targeted psychosocial treatment (e.g. OCD with psychotic symptoms), beginning with medication and supportive psychological treatment may be a reasonable approach.

4.4 Pharmacological treatment for acute bipolar depression

Lithium, anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics, and other agents such as antidepressants have all been investigated for efficacy in managing bipolar depression. These treatments have been evaluated using the criteria for strength of evidence for efficacy (Table 1) as well as safety and tolerability (Section 8). Recommendations are summarized in Table 14.

Table 14
Hierarchical rankings of first and second‐line treatments recommended for management of acute bipolar I depression

4.4.1 Step 1: review general principles and assess medication status

Examination of a patient presenting in a depressed state should include an assessment of the nature and severity of depression and associated symptoms, risk of suicide/self‐harm behaviour, ability to adhere to a treatment plan, availability of a psychosocial support network, and functional impairment. Laboratory investigations (described in Section 8) should also be completed. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting (eg, ambulatory or inpatient), with consideration given to management of safety risks. Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a depressive episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to alcohol/drug use, medications, other treatments, or a general medical condition. Patients should be supported to discontinue stimulant use and limit nicotine, caffeine, drug, and alcohol use. Course of illness and treatments used in current and prior episodes should be assessed, including past response to and tolerability of specific medications and doses, and used to direct subsequent therapeutic choices. Consideration should be given to restarting medications if their recent discontinuation appeared to coincide with a depressive relapse.

Psychoeducation and other psychosocial strategies should also be offered alongside pharmacological treatment to promote ongoing medication adherence, reduce residual symptoms and suicidal behaviour, help identify early signs of relapse, and support functional recovery (see Section 2).

4.4.2 Step 2: initiate or optimize therapy and check adherence

It is recommended for all patients that pharmacotherapy be initiated with one or more of the available first‐line agents. The choice of agent or agents to manage an acute bipolar depressive episode should be discussed with the patient and their supporters (as appropriate) and take into account current and prior medication use and response, personal preference, and the safety and tolerability of each agent, as well as clinical features that may influence prognosis (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choices").

Psychiatric comorbidities and cross-cutting screening — overlapping presentations and assessment: Mental conditions that may include symptoms similar to anxiety disorders include ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychotic disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and learning disorders. Anxiety disorders commonly co-occur with each other; other common comorbidities include depression, ADHD, and behavior, bipolar, obsessive-compulsive, eating, learning, language, and substance-related disorders, and with selective mutism, developmental and communication disorders frequently co-occur. Comorbidities may heighten distress and functional impairment and may worsen treatment outcomes, and each comorbid disorder may require a separate treatment plan and may influence the selection of treatment for the anxiety disorder. Use of the Parent- and Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure or screening questions embedded in structured interview guides can standardize and enhance the efficiency of the psychiatric review of symptoms to assess for psychiatric comorbidities; if screen questions are positively endorsed, the ensuing interview can ascertain whether full diagnostic criteria are met for the given disorder, and each condition with full diagnostic criteria is diagnosed as such unless DSM-5 hierarchical rules apply.

The planning process should incorporate psychoeducation about BD, including information about the effectiveness of maintenance pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial rehabilitation, strategies for clinical management, and opportunities for recovery, and shared decision-making with the patient, the patient's social supports (where appropriate), and the treatment team. Issues to think about include the following: defining the relationship with the provider, treatment team, or both; planning monitoring of moods, symptoms, and treatment adherence; agreeing on a medication regimen with effectiveness for preventing mania and depression, including discussing side effects and their management; considering psychotherapy to build coping and self-management skills and to prevent recurrences; considering programs providing psychoeducation and support for caregivers, family members, and significant others; and providing access to peer support in the care system or the community.

4.1.2 Differential diagnosis

Diagnosing PBD requires changes in mood and behavior that are uncharacteristic of the individual and more extreme than developmentally appropriate, persist long enough to satisfy duration criteria, and have a clear impact on functioning. If comorbid disorders are present, mood symptoms need to be above and beyond the regular symptoms for the other disorder. For example, if symptoms of ADHD get worse episodically, and during these episodes the youth presents symptoms more specific to mania (eg, decreased need for sleep), a PBD diagnosis should be considered. Symptom sequence may help differentiate BD from some other disorders: a teen with BD might first experience symptoms of hypomania and depression and then begin using substances, in contrast to another teen who experimented with drugs first and then began showing irritability. However, it can be difficult to separate onset of a comorbid disorder from onset of manic/hypomanic symptoms.

Although the new and controversial DSM‐5 diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) cannot formally be diagnosed if the youth has BD, 82 the phenotype commonly overlaps with those of all BD subtypes 60, 83, 84 as well as other conditions, particularly oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). 85, 86 Thus, one must evaluate the potential presence of BD even if DMDD is identified, and vice versa. The reliability of DMDD diagnoses was low in the DSM‐5 field trials, suggesting that it may be challenging to accurately identify clinically.

4.1.3 Course

Multiple longitudinal studies have prospectively followed cohorts of youths for 4 or more years. Consistent findings include (i) high rates of progression from BD‐NOS or CycD to BD‐I or BD‐II (eg, 43%), 64 particularly in youth with a family history of BD; (ii) high rates of recovery from episodes, particularly with treatment (eg, 81.5%); 87, 88 (iii) high rates of recurrence of depression, hypomania, or mania (eg, 62.5%); 64, 87, 89, 90 and (iv) patterns of comorbidity 91 and treatment response congruent with adult BD. 92 The prodrome of BD‐I or BD‐II, often identified retrospectively in adult studies, commonly involves attenuated mood symptoms; and sleep disturbance may be a marker clinically (see reference for detailed discussion of prodrome). 93

### Suspected geriatric onset of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in a patient with comorbid bipolar disorder [^116gSNoq]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

An increasing number of adults over 50 years old are presenting with requests for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the exact prevalence of ADHD in older adults in geriatrics is unknown. The prevalence of ADHD is generally accepted among psychiatrists to decrease with age, but there are limited controlled studies that investigate using ADHD medications in adults over 50 years old. There are estimates that childhood ADHD may persist into adulthood at age 25 between 15 and 65% of cases; however, older adults and geriatrics with ADHD are an even less studied population with estimates generally below 5% of the population.

Although ADHD and bipolar disorders are common mental health conditions, the degree of their comorbid occurrence in adulthood, and especially geriatric age, remains unclear. There are estimates of ADHD and adult bipolar disorder occurring comorbidly in as many as 1 in 13 patients; however, many of these cases may be unrecognized and untreated. Other studies report even higher comorbidity, emphasizing the need for accurate diagnosis and treatment plan formulation. The under-recognition of both disorders when they occur comorbidly is likely due to some symptomatology overlap, as well as the similar impacts that each condition has on major life area functioning for patients. Still, appropriate recognition and treatment of both conditions are optimal, and the effective management of both conditions is likely to result in improved quality of life and functioning.

Anxiety disorders

Patients with BD frequently experience symptoms of anxiety and comorbid anxiety disorders (GAD, panic disorder, post‐traumatic stress disorder and others). Clinical samples indicate that 24%‐56% of patients with BD meet criteria for one or more anxiety disorders, with the highest rates in women. 720 Comorbid anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders are associated with a higher number of mood episodes and depressive symptoms, including suicidality and sleep disturbance, and greater impairment of psychosocial functioning and quality of life. 721 The presence of a comorbid anxiety disorder is also associated with high rates of use of antidepressants, 722 which should be employed with caution due to their potential for mood destabilization (Section 4).

While the CANMAT Task Force report 720 described key studies and treatment recommendations in length, those recommendations have been updated below. However, it remains the case that there are few studies that have focused exclusively on anxiety symptoms or disorders comorbid with BD, whether for treatment efficacy or safety. While there are treatment options, the limitations resulting from a paucity of data prevent the development of clear guidelines or treatment algorithms.

A "step‐wise" approach was recommended in the 2012 CANMAT recommendations for managing comorbid anxiety. In general, mood stabilization is the priority before specific anxiety treatments are considered (Figure 9). Despite clinical experience, antidepressants, particularly serotoninergic agents, should be employed with caution due to their potential to provoke mood destabilization. While benzodiazepines are an important clinical tool because they can rapidly alleviate anxiety, clinicians should strive to prescribe them at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period possible, given the concerns about suicide risk, abuse and dependence. CBT continues to be an appropriate first‐line treatment for anxiety.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder — residual anxiety in remitted patients: For individuals with fully or partially remitted bipolar disorder and with residual anxiety symptoms, we suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence suggests that CBT is effective for individuals with fully or partially remitted BD 1 or BD 2 with residual anxiety symptoms, with a systematic review suggesting a reduction in residual anxiety in the psychotherapy group compared with those in the control group after treatment completion. For non-mindfulness CBT specifically, two of five RCTs suggested a reduction in anxiety symptoms in the psychotherapy group compared with the control group, and for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) specifically, two of three RCTs showed a reduction when compared with control, while the third RCT found within-group reduction but no between-group difference. Although earlier narratives discussed quetiapine's benefits possibly including reductions in comorbid anxiety, the Work Group determined that the strength of the evidence was not sufficient to include a suggestion for pharmacotherapy with quetiapine for comorbid anxiety. The recommendation is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and it concluded that the benefits of CBT for individuals with fully or partially remitted BD 1 or BD 2 outweighed the potential harm.

A significant minority of children or youth with MDD will eventually go on to develop BD, with an average rate of 28% being reported. 572, 573 Risk factors for switch to mania following a depressive episode include a family history of mood disorders, emotional and behavioural dysregulation, subthreshold manic symptoms, cyclothymia, atypical depression and psychosis. 572 A recent meta‐analysis suggested that the most potent predictors were family history, an earlier age of onset and the presence of psychotic symptoms. 574 There is an increased prevalence of BD among offspring of parents with BD. 575, 576, 577 Although there is no uniform strategy for managing depression (or ADHD, anxiety, etc.) in the child of a parent with BD, increased caution is warranted when prescribing antidepressant or stimulant medications as these have the potential to precipitate mania/hypomania. 578 Patients and their parents should be informed of the potential switch risk and close monitoring for treatment‐emergent manic/hypomanic switch should be instituted.

Self‐report and/or parent‐reported questionnaires can be informative and can raise the index of suspicion for BD. 579 However, scores on such questionnaires as the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) "dysregulation phenotype", previously described as "BD phenotype", have poor capacity for differentiating BD from other complex and severe symptomatic presentations. 580 Questionnaires can be used as screeners, but do not substitute for a thorough diagnostic evaluation. Longitudinal rating by parents may be most helpful in diagnosis and assessment of treatment response. An online program for weekly parental ratings (of depression, anxiety, ADHD, oppositional behaviour, and mania) of children aged 2‐12 years is available at, click on Child Network. 581

Bipolar disorder (BD) maintenance monotherapy selection — medications with evidence of effectiveness for the acute episode, a breadth of effectiveness that includes prevention of both mania and depression, and a low side effect burden should be viewed as preferred or first line treatments. When providers consider monotherapies for maintenance treatment for individuals with BD 1, agents with evidence for prevention of both manic and depressive episodes should be preferred; for others with BD 2 (and without a history or risk of severe hypomanic episodes associated with adverse consequences), effectiveness for prevention of mania may not be salient.

### Incorporating trial data into bipolar disorder management [^111RgX1W]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine integrates data from clinical trials into clinical care while efficacy studies assess simplified interventions in simplified populations. The findings of such studies are useful in obtaining Food and Drug Administration approval of medications but often fail to generalize to the more complex populations and interventions commonly seen in clinical practice. Recently, an increased emphasis has been placed on effectiveness studies (also referred to as pragmatic or practical studies) designed to yield findings that can be generalized to the clinical management of patients with bipolar disorder. Mood stabilizers and increasingly second-generation antipsychotics are considered the foundation of treatment for bipolar disorder. In contrast, adjunctive antidepressants should be avoided when patients present with manic and mixed episodes. Additional interventions — such as psychoeducation and care coordination — when combined with pharmacotherapy, can lessen the frequency and severity of mood episodes, especially mania. These interventions, combined with judicious pharmacotherapy, can help minimize the impact of adverse effects and related nonadherence so that patients can achieve affective stability, regain psychosocial function, and maintain health.

Multi-morbidity is common in both children and adults of both sexes. In children, around one-half will have at least one psychiatric disorder comorbid to ADHD and around one-quarter will have two or more comorbid disorders. These are typically 'current' episodes of comorbidity, the most frequent in childhood being disruptive behavioural disorders (e.g. oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder), anxiety (e.g. generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder) and mood (e.g. depression, bipolar disorder). Others include specific developmental disorders of language, learning and motor development, autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability, many of which present across the lifespan. Adults with ADHD also experience high rates of co-occurring conditions, especially anxiety, mood and substance use disorders (including cigarette smoking). Therefore, the clinical presentation is complex, and this is often further complicated by academic and social impairments, leading to academic and occupational failure, delinquent and antisocial behaviour.

Autism spectrum disorders

The worldwide prevalence of ASD is around 1%, but some data suggest it may be higher. Following the publication of DSM-5 in 2013, ASD is now characterised by two categories: (1) persistent deficits in the ability to initiate and to sustain reciprocal social interaction and social communication and (2) restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities, including differences in sensory sensitivities and interests. Individuals with ASD exhibit a range of intellectual and language functioning. Symptoms typically present in early childhood (by 2–3 years of age) with or without language delay and may be associated with early developmental delays and/or loss of social or language skills. However, many people may not receive a diagnosis of ASD until adulthood. This may be due to a variety of factors including lack of awareness of ASD across the lifespan, poor recognition of ASD in females and/or lack of services. DSM-5 notes that symptoms must be associated with clinically significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Symptoms are usually a pervasive feature of the individual's functioning which are observable across settings. However, they may vary according to social, educational or other contexts and may be masked by 'camouflaging'. Symptoms are relatively stable across the lifespan, although there may be some developmental gains in adolescence and adulthood due to increased interest in social interaction, behavioural improvement associated with interventions and/or compensations applied and/or the environmental supports provided.

Psychotherapy for bipolar disorder (BD) — for individuals with bipolar 1 or bipolar 2 disorder, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any one specific psychotherapy among cognitive behavioral therapy, family or conjoint therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, and non-brief psychoeducation. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation and indicates it is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, with very low confidence in the quality of the evidence and limitations including small sample sizes, heterogeneity in psychotherapy delivery, and few head-to-head comparisons. The Work Group emphasizes that this does not mean they recommend neither for nor against psychotherapy as an augmentation to psychopharmacology for BD, but rather that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any particular approach.

7.4.1.2 ADHD

ADHD and BD co‐occur far more commonly than would be expected based on their individual prevalences in the general population. Approximately 10%‐20% of patients with BD meet the criteria for adult ADHD and up to 20% of adults with ADHD also meet the criteria for BD. 764 BD and ADHD have a high degree of symptom overlap, making the comorbid diagnosis difficult and requiring careful attention to childhood history and lifetime course of illness. Patients with comorbid ADHD often experience a more treatment‐refractory course, more mood episodes, greater functional impairment and a heightened risk of suicide. 765

The treatment of ADHD presenting comorbidity with BD is discussed in detail in a previous CANMAT Task Force Recommendation paper. 765 Recommendations were to treat bipolar symptoms first with mood stabilizers and/or atypical antipsychotics to stabilize mood before considering treatment for ADHD symptoms. Mixed amphetamine salts (level 3), 611 methylphenidate (level 3), 612 atomoxetine (level 4), 615 bupropion (level 4), 766 or lisdexamfetamine (level 4) 767 add‐ons to mood‐stabilizing treatments have been reported to be efficacious in improving ADHD symptoms.

In a s Swedish national patient registry study of patients with BD and ADHD, methylphenidate monotherapy significantly increased the risk of mania, while those patients treated concurrently with a mood stabilizer experienced a significantly reduced risk of mania when methylphenidate was employed. 289

Methods

Study Design

This study is a randomized clinical noninferiority trial with an embedded health economic evaluation for children and adolescents with OCD (N = 152) comparing stepped-care CBT (n = 74) with in-person CBT alone (n = 78). Recruitment began October 6, 2017, and ended May 24, 2019. Follow-up ended April 14, 2020. Blinded clinician assessments were conducted before treatment, after treatment, at 3-month follow-up, and at 6-month follow-up (primary end point). The study protocoland primary efficacy resultshave been published elsewhere. The study participant flow is presented in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden, and all participants and their parents or legal guardians provided verbal and written informed consent prior to inclusion (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:). This study followed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards reporting guideline.

Participants

Participants were 152 children and adolescents recruited from 2 specialist pediatric OCD clinics in Stockholm and Gothenburg, Sweden. Families could also self-refer to the study via a dedicated study website. Eligible participants were children and adolescents who had a primary diagnosis of OCD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition), had a total score of 16 or more on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms), were between 7 and 17 years of age, were able to read and write Swedish, and had daily access to a computer with an internet connection. Participants taking psychotropic medication were required to have had a stable dose during the 6 weeks prior to inclusion. Comorbid conditions were allowed, except for organic brain disorder, global learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, or severe eating disorder. Patients were excluded if they had suicidal ideation, were housebound or in need of intensive or inpatient treatment, had completed a course of CBT for OCD within the last 12 months, or had ongoing psychological treatment for OCD or an anxiety disorder. Detailed information on the study sample is presented in Table 1.

### Bipolar disorders: evaluation and treatment… [^112SFpep]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment Prompt diagnosis and treatment improve prognosis by reducing the risk of relapse and doubling the rate of response to medications. 38 Medications are the mainstay of therapy and are selected depending on the presenting phase of illness, severity, and patient factors such as prior responses or current medications 12, 18, 38. Among patients using pharmacotherapy, relapse occurs in up to 25% in the first year; the risk of relapse increases to 40% among patients who are untreated and to more than 70% of patients within five years, regardless of treatment approach. 12, 18, 39 It is recommended that pharmacotherapy be continued indefinitely.
12. Comanagement with a psychiatrist can aid the primary care physician in navigating diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, including relapse, treatment resistance, comorbid psychiatric conditions, and the risk of self-harm. Patients should be educated about the teratogenic effects of many mood stabilizers.

ACUTE DEPRESSION All patients should be assessed for risks to themselves or others and the need for inpatient treatment. Although several agents are effective for acute depression, quetiapine, cariprazine, lurasidone in combination with lithium or valproic acid, and electroconvulsive therapy appear to be the most fast-acting therapeutic options. 12 Although patients are highly responsive to antipsychotics, these medications are associated with weight gain, diabetes, and extrapyramidal effects. 51 When mood stabilizers alone are insufficient., augmentation of treatment with anti-depressant medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or bupropion may be considered. 52 These therapies are less likely to induce mania compared with tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or medications that have dual properties, such as venlafaxine.

18 When treating sleep disturbance in patients who have depression, physicians should avoid prescribing trazodone because it can induce mania.
53. MAINTENANCE THERAPY High-quality evidence supports the use of lithium, lamotrigine, quetiapine, quetiapine in combination with lithium or valproic acid, aripiprazole, and olanzapine for maintenance therapy in patients who have bipolar disorders.

### The integration of measurement and management for the treatment of bipolar disorder: a STEP-BD model of collaborative care in psychiatry [^113U8oCE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with bipolar disorder are among the most challenging to treat. These patients frequently present with complex mood and other symptoms that change over time, complex psychiatric and medical comorbid conditions, and multiple medications. Clinicians rarely systematically assess or measure all of these factors and instead rely on memory and general impressions. It is imperative that clinicians systematically track and monitor these relevant variables to ensure treatment decisions are based on precise clinical data. By integrating measurement and management, clinicians and patients can collaborate to assess the effectiveness of treatments and to make joint decisions about critical points at which to adjust treatment. This method was shown to be successful in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD).

Bipolar disorder in children often is confused with attention deficit disorder, substance-induced mood disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. It is not uncommon for some of these disorders to be comorbid with pediatric bipolar disorder. This article provides the reader with a review of the existing literature on differentiating these illnesses and recognizing the phenomenology of each disorder as it pertains to a psychiatric diagnostic work-up of a child. Clinically helpful overlapping and unique characteristics of each disorder are discussed and a practical approach to differentiate these disorders is provided.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: an expert consensus [^116vU7Wf]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Course specifiers are extensions to a diagnosis that further clarify the course, severity, or special features of the disorder. Increasing evidence suggests that the concept of predominant polarity, a proposed course specifier for bipolar disorder, may have clinical relevance for the management of bipolar disorder, which is closer to the real‐world clinical practice and more pragmatic than the nosologically complex differentiation between bipolar subtypes such as BP‐I and bipolar disorder type II (BP‐II). For optimal outcomes, bipolar disorder requires an individualized, long‐term, patient care management plan, and an integrative approach that includes maintenance treatment, adjunctive psychosocial therapies, diligent monitoring for any treatment‐emergent complications, and promotion of a healthy lifestyle including stress management.

Accurate and timely diagnosis, prompt implementation of effective therapies, and medication adherence remain some of the key challenges and unmet needs in the management of bipolar disorder. Non‐adherence to treatment is associated with significantly increased risks of recurrence, relapse, hospitalization, and suicide attempts, and higher overall treatment costs. The estimated direct and indirect costs of bipolar disorder, including BP‐I, in the United States alone are estimated to be more than $195 billion annually, yet the greatest societal cost associated with bipolar disorder relates to significant loss of life due to suicide, followed by cardiovascular disease and other physical comorbidities. Furthermore, bipolar disorder can cause progressive brain damage; thus, frequent relapses may result in greater cognitive and functional impairment, increasing the burden of illness for the patients and their supporters.

### The comorbidity of ADHD and bipolar disorder: any less confusion? [^111qT8Wm]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical confusion surrounding childhood ADHD and bipolar disorder centers on overlaps between severe ADHD with mood lability and mania/hypomania. Perplexity has been exacerbated by the removal of mood symptoms from the diagnostic criteria for ADHD and a lack of stringent criteria for a manic/hypomanic episode. This review summarizes current knowledge of the relationship between ADHD and bipolar disorder, the rates with which ADHD and bipolar disorder coexist in youth of differing ages, their presence in community, clinical, and high risk samples, and their longitudinal course. Treatment studies are reviewed, highlighting findings in comorbid cases, which support the efficacy of stimulants and other agents for ADHD without worsening mood symptoms, and efficacy of second generation antipsychotics for bipolar disorder. In conclusion, a lack of clarity regarding the diagnostic boundaries between childhood ADHD and bipolar disorder remains, however, treatments targeting symptoms of each disorder when comorbid, provide some efficacy.

General principles

The general principles for managing adults with BD also apply to children and youth. In youth, themes of comorbidity and tolerability are accentuated. Comorbid ADHD is more common in children and adolescents as compared to adults with BD. Moreover, ADHD symptoms often do not improve following mood stabilization, and may require concurrent ADHD treatment. In addition, due to elevated risk for accelerated atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular disease in this population, cardiovascular risk factors should also be assessed regularly and intervention implemented. Lifestyle management including attention to diet, substance use, smoking and physical activity should be implemented alongside any psychological or pharmacological interventions. 582 Relatedly, children and adolescents are more susceptible than adults to the metabolic side effects of psychiatric medications, particularly the atypical antipsychotics that are considered first‐line treatments. 583 Taken together, these distinguishing features underscore the importance of ensuring that polypharmacy, as often required, is judicious and informed by a balance of factors including mood symptom burden, global functioning, and physical health.

Acute management of mania

First‐line. Lithium (level 1), 583, 584, 585 risperidone (level 1), 584, 586 aripiprazole (level 2), 587 asenapine (level 2), 588 and quetiapine (level 2) 583, 589 are recommended as first‐line options. Risperidone may be preferable to lithium for non‐obese youth, and youth with ADHD. 584

Second‐line. Due to safety and tolerability concerns, olanzapine (level 2) 590 and ziprasidone (level 2) 591 should be considered second‐line options. Quetiapine adjunctive therapy (level 3) 592 is also recommended as a second‐line treatment.

Third‐line. Despite low response rates in two RCTs, a long history of use among adults with BD, combined with positive findings in open‐label studies are grounds for considering divalproex as a third‐line option for youth who do not respond to or tolerate first or second‐line agents (level 4). 593

Not recommended. Oxcarbazepine was not superior to placebo in a large RCT (level 2 negative). 594

ADHD treatment — adolescents (KAS 5c) specifies that for adolescents (age 12 years to the 18th birthday) with ADHD, the PCC should prescribe FDA-approved medications for ADHD with the adolescent's assent (grade A: strong recommendation). The PCC is encouraged to prescribe evidence-based training interventions and/or behavioral interventions as treatment of ADHD, if available, and educational interventions and individualized instructional supports, including school environment, class placement, instructional placement, and behavioral supports, are a necessary part of any treatment plan and often include an IEP or a rehabilitation plan (504 plan). Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A for Medications and Grade A for Training and Behavioral Therapy; Strength is Strong recommendation; benefits note that training interventions, behavioral therapy, and FDA-approved medications have been demonstrated to reduce behaviors associated with ADHD and to improve function, and family preference, including patient preference, is likely to predict engagement and persistence with a treatment.

### Evidence-based… [^112ymcDL]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Cognitive Component: Focused on identifying and modifying "thinking errors" or "thought distortions" so that the patient's thoughts are more aligned with success and confidence. Behavioral Component: Involves engineering the environment to be more conducive to concentration and focus, and learning what reinforces and maintains problem behaviors, and constructive behaviors so that constructive changes can be implemented that support the patient's ability to function well. It includes training in skills to promote relaxation and quiet the mind; communication skills training and exposure therapy, which helps a patient, overcome certain fears and avoidance. It also includes behavioral rehearsal, behavioral practice, and role-playing. Currently, two classes of FDA-approved medications are used for ADHD treatment: stimulant and non-stimulant.

Methylphenidate and amphetamine are the two most commonly used stimulant medications for treatment of ADHD in adults. They both affect dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake in certain parts of the brain and, as a result, increase the amount of these neuro
- transmitters to facilitate brain functioning. While methylphenidate and amphetamine have different mechanisms of action in the brain, they generally have a similar effect in terms of improvement of ADHD symptoms. It is suggested that all adults with a new ADHD diagnosis, uncontrolled symptoms or any change in medication should be seen within 30 days and monthly there after until the symptoms and function improve. When symptoms and function improve, visits every 3–6 months are recommended. At the follow up visit, consider the following: About 60% of adults experience improvements in quality of life and symptom reduction in response to treatment.

Comorbid conditions such as mood and anxiety disorders are also highly treatable. If patients are significantly distressed or agitated, presenting a danger to themselves or others, short-term use of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics for control of irritability and agitation can be helpful, particularly in the inpatient setting. Care should be taken to limit access to large quantities of medications and to avoid development of benzodiazepine dependence. These medications should be prescribed for a maximum of seven to 10 days.

### Practice parameter on the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents [^112gEgYw]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Principle 12 — Medication combinations in children and adolescents states that before the use of medication combinations, the prescriber needs to develop a treatment and monitoring plan, educate the patient and family, obtain assent/consent, and then implement the treatment trial. Common strategies include treating multiple disorders in the same patient (e.g., a stimulant and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)), adding a medication for unique advantages in a single disorder (e.g., the addition of lithium to ongoing antidepressant treatment), and addressing side effects of an effective agent (e.g., benzotropine for extrapyramidal symptoms secondary to an antipsychotic). The document notes limited evidence in children and adolescents for using two antidepressants or two antipsychotics as an initial approach or specific endpoint, though such pairings are not uncommon during transitions. It adds that for bipolar disorder in adults data support the use of two mood stabilizers, with preliminary support for similar strategies in children, and that two stimulant formulations (short and long acting) may be used to "sculpt" dosing for extended coverage. It cautions that evidence supporting combinations based on matching mechanisms to hypothesized central nervous system abnormalities is "rudimentary at best", that there is limited data to support using two antidepressants to cover two neurotransmitter systems, and that basing decisions on theories or clinical correlates such as specific symptom profiles, EEG, or single-photon emission computed tomography testing may put patients at risk for unnecessary combinations "to cover the neurotransmitter bases" or "to treat the EEG or single-photon emission computed tomography results".

Treatment for bipolar disorder consists of 2 goals: 1) managing urgent situations and 2) transitioning patients into maintenance therapy. Patients with bipolar disorder who present in urgent situations, including symptoms of suicidality, aggression, occupational impairment, legal involvement, and psychosis, require quick and efficient identification and resolution of symptoms. Once patients are stabilized, clinicians must then implement maintenance therapy to manage behavioral symptoms, promote optimal functioning, and ultimately, to reach full, functional recovery.

There is a strong literature supporting a relationship between ADHD and SUD. Clearly, ADHD adolescents with conduct or bipolar disorder as partof their clinical picture are at the highest risk for SUD. ADHD without comorbidity appears to confer an intermediate risk factor for SUD that appears to manifest in young adults and college students. Both family genetic and self-medication influences may be operational in the development and continuation of SUD in ADHD subjects: however, systematic data are lacking. Patients with ADHD and SUD require multi-modal intervention incorporating addiction and mental health treatment. Pharmacotherapy in individuals with ADHD and SUD needs to take into consideration abuse liability, potential drug interactions, and compliance concerns. Although the existing literature has provided important information on the relationship of ADHD and SUD, it also points to a number of areas in need of further study. The mechanism by which untreated ADHD leads toSUD and the risk reduction of ADHD treatment on later SUD, needs to be understood better. The influence of adequateness of treatment of ADHD on later SUD needs to be delineated. Given the prevalence and major morbidity and impairment caused by SUD and ADHD. prevention and treatment strategies for these patients need to be developed and evaluated further.

### Adjunctive psychotherapy for bipolar disorder… [^113ZQ16B]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was illness recurrence. Secondary outcomes were depressive and manic symptoms at 12 months and acceptability of treatment. Results. There is increasing recognition that pharmacotherapy alone cannot prevent recurrences of bipolar disorder or fully alleviate postepisode symptoms or functional impairment. 1 Psychotherapy, when provided at all, is viewed as an adjunctive treatment. 2 Evidence from randomized clinical trials indicates that combining pharmacotherapy with manualized psychotherapies — including. cognitive behavioral therapy, family-focused therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, and group psychoeducation — is more effective than pharmacotherapy alone in stabilizing symptoms and reducing recurrences among outpatients with bipolar disorder. 1, 3, 4 The comparative effectiveness of these approaches, however, has received scant attention. Two raters classified each active intervention group as belonging to 1 of the following nodes: traditional CBT with cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, and problem-solving; standard-length psychoeducation; IPSRT; family or conjoint therapy; or functional remediation. When examined by a standard NMA, evidence suggested that CBT, psychoeducation, and family or conjoint therapy were associated with significantly improved outcomes compared with TAU, although with substantial uncertainty. What do our findings suggest about treating outpatients with bipolar disorder.

When the goals center on prevention of recurrences, patients should be engaged in family or group psychoeducation with guided skills training and active tasks to enhance coping skills rather than being passive recipients of didactic education. When the immediate goal is recovery from moderately severe depressive or manic symptoms, cognitive restructuring, regulating daily rhythms, and communication training may be associated with stabilization. It is unclear whether CBT techniques work best in an individual format; in this NMA, family and group formats were more closely associated with depression improvement than individual formats.

### Prescribed psychostimulants and other pro-cognitive medications in bipolar disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis of recurrence of manic symptoms [^116wiHTw]. Bipolar Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Clinicians are often hesitant to prescribe psychostimulants in bipolar disorder (BD) due to concerns of inducing (hypo)mania, despite limited published evidence on associations between prescribed psychostimulant use and recurrence of mood episodes in BD. The current systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the emergence of (hypo)manic symptoms in patients with BD receiving prescribed psychostimulants or other pro-cognitive medications in euthymic or depressive states.

Methods

A systematic search was performed of MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO from inception to April 5, 2023 and search of Clinicaltrials.gov and Clinicaltrialsregister.eu for unpublished data. References of included studies were hand-searched. Randomized trials and prospective longitudinal studies that evaluated psychostimulants and non-stimulant medications recommended for the treatment of ADHD by the Canadian ADHD practice guidelines were included. The review was reported in line with PRISMA guidelines and was preregistered on PROSPERO (CRD42022358588).

Results

After screening 414 unique records, we included 27 studies, of which five reported data that was quantitatively synthesized (n = 1653). The use of psychostimulants in BD was not associated with increased scores on the Young Mania Rating Scale in patients who were in a euthymic or depressed state (SMD IV -0.17; 95% CI, -0.40 to 0.06) compared to placebo. There was a high degree of study-level heterogeneity (I² = 80%). A qualitative synthesis of studies revealed a limited risk of medication-induced manic symptoms.

Conclusions

Our review provides preliminary evidence to suggest psychostimulants and non-stimulant ADHD medications have a limited risk of precipitating (hypo)mania symptoms. More extensive studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of these medications are warranted.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^116TscTM]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Distinguishing early‐onset mania or hypomania from other psychiatric disorders is important as there is a high level of symptomatic overlap for multiple conditions including but not limited to ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), substance abuse, personality disorders and generalized anxiety disorder 555, 570 (Table 22). The discrete episodes of mania/hypomania and the non‐overlapping symptoms can facilitate accurate diagnosis. When a comorbidity is present, such as ADHD, overlapping symptoms (eg, distractibility and hyperactivity) should only count towards a diagnosis of mania or hypomania if they intensify during intervals of elation or irritability. Notably, ADHD is an ongoing condition whereas BD is episodic, and decreased sleep, hypersexuality, hallucinations or delusions, and homicidal or suicidal thoughts and actions occur with childhood mania, but are rare or absent in uncomplicated ADHD.

Table 22
Differential diagnosis of manic symptoms in children and adolescents

It is important to note that, while chronic irritability with episodic behavioural outbursts or rages can be seen in multiple paediatric psychiatric disorders (including emerging personality disorders, substance abuse, ODD, pervasive developmental disorders, and major depressive episodes), such irritability and explosiveness are not sufficient to make a diagnosis, even when severe. The recent DSM‐5 diagnosis DMDD — which includes chronic irritability as a defining feature — lists BD as an exclusion criterion. However, the DMDD phenotype is evident in about 25% of adolescents with episodic BD, and is associated with factors such as greater family conflict and ADHD comorbidity. 571 Classical BD and chronic irritability are therefore not mutually exclusive, the nonspecific nature of the latter notwithstanding.
