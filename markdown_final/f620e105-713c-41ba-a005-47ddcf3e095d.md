## Question

Acetazolamide to treat necrotizing fasciitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether acetazolamide has any appropriate role in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about acetazolamide's approved indications and mechanism to see if there is any plausible therapeutic rationale. Then, I should verify the evidence‑based standard of care for necrotizing fasciitis and whether any guideline or review mentions acetazolamide. Next, I will check the literature for any reports of acetazolamide use in necrotizing fasciitis. After that, I should review acetazolamide's safety profile to ensure there are no adverse effects that could worsen necrotizing infections. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and address potential confounders like drug class confusion or adjunctive therapies.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and labeled uses of acetazolamide, because if there is no mechanistic or regulatory basis relevant to necrotizing infections, that is already telling. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor indicated for glaucoma, certain seizure disorders, diuresis in fluid retention, and prevention of acute mountain sickness; it is nonbacteriostatic, lacks antimicrobial activity, and lowers serum bicarbonate causing a metabolic acidosis with potential electrolyte shifts, without any tissue‑preserving or antitoxin effects that would be relevant to necrotizing fasciitis [^notfound] [^111M1fFu] [^111fBK7f] [^117GY37s].

> Next, I should review the standard of care for necrotizing fasciitis to ensure I am not missing a niche use. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines emphasize that outcomes hinge on immediate surgical source control plus prompt broad‑spectrum antibiotics with MRSA, streptococcal, gram‑negative, and anaerobic coverage; early debridement ideally within 6–12 hours is repeatedly linked to improved survival, and empiric regimens typically include piperacillin‑tazobactam or a carbapenem combined with vancomycin or linezolid, with antitoxin agents like clindamycin considered when streptococcal or clostridial disease is suspected [^112aMeRh] [^113GSnmq] [^notfound] [^1113mh5p] [^111uc3NL] [^116Ctuot].

> I will now examine whether any authoritative guideline or review even mentions acetazolamide in this context, because silence across high‑quality sources can be informative. Wait, let me verify across IDSA, EAST, and contemporary reviews: none list acetazolamide as therapy for necrotizing soft tissue infection; instead, they uniformly endorse urgent operative debridement, hemodynamic support, and broad‑spectrum antibiotics, with adjuncts like hyperbaric oxygen remaining controversial and not routine, which further argues against an off‑label role for acetazolamide here [^1161PQHd] [^112aMeRh] [^113GSnmq] [^1171YDpW].

> But wait, what if isolated case reports suggest a role I am overlooking? I should double‑check. A scan of reviews and case literature around necrotizing infections, including pediatric and anatomic variants, consistently focuses on surgery, appropriate antimicrobials, and critical care measures; there are no reports of acetazolamide being deployed as an antimicrobial, antitoxin, perfusion‑modifying, or wound‑healing agent in necrotizing fasciitis, which aligns with its mechanistic profile lacking antibacterial or immunomodulatory properties relevant to NSTI pathophysiology [^113GSnmq] [^114WtF2a] [^111Gm1BN].

> I need to ensure safety considerations do not create additional harm in this setting. Acetazolamide can precipitate metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia, and carries rare but severe sulfonamide hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens‑Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis; in a patient with sepsis and tissue hypoxia from necrotizing fasciitis, further acidosis or dermatologic toxicity would be undesirable, reinforcing that risks outweigh any hypothetical, unproven benefits [^111M1fFu] [^112KSmyx] [^117YTjgC] [^111fBK7f].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered whether carbonic anhydrase inhibition and induced acidosis might theoretically impair bacterial growth by altering pH or reduce edema via diuresis; hold on, I should verify the clinical relevance. There is no evidence that acetazolamide's systemic acid‑base effects translate into antimicrobial or tissue‑sparing benefit in necrotizing infections, and in fact its diuretic effect is modest and paradoxically decreases with higher dosing, while metabolic acidosis and electrolyte shifts can complicate critical illness — so I need to correct that initial line of thought as unsupported and potentially harmful [^114PMQwU] [^111M1fFu] [^111fBK7f].

> Next, I should review potential confounders that might cause drug confusion. SGLT2 inhibitors have postmarketing warnings for Fournier's gangrene, emphasizing that some drugs are associated with necrotizing infections as adverse events rather than treatments; when suspected, the recommended actions are to stop the SGLT2 inhibitor, start broad‑spectrum antibiotics, and proceed to surgical debridement, again with no role for acetazolamide in management [^115ANtpe] [^111A3Uya] [^111adEkF].

> Let me reconsider adjuncts briefly so I do not overlook a niche. Hyperbaric oxygen may be used selectively but remains controversial for survival benefit and is not a substitute for early surgery, and no adjunctive therapy lists carbonic anhydrase inhibitors among options, which is consistent with the pathophysiology of NSTIs driven by bacterial proliferation, toxins, ischemia, and rapid fascial spread that require mechanical source control and targeted antimicrobials rather than carbonic anhydrase modulation [^113VwLst] [^113GSnmq] [^1161PQHd].

> I should confirm the practical recommendation. Acetazolamide has no therapeutic role in necrotizing fasciitis, and its use would be inappropriate; management should prioritize immediate surgical exploration and serial debridement, hemodynamic and organ support, and empiric broad‑spectrum antibiotics such as piperacillin‑tazobactam or a carbapenem plus MRSA coverage, with consideration of clindamycin for toxin suppression in streptococcal or clostridial disease, followed by de‑escalation when cultures return [^112aMeRh] [^113GSnmq] [^1161PQHd] [^1113mh5p] [^111uc3NL] [^116Ctuot].

---

Acetazolamide is **not indicated** for necrotizing fasciitis and should not be used as part of its management [^1161PQHd]. The standard of care is **early surgical debridement** [^112aMeRh] and **broad-spectrum antibiotics** with supportive care [^113GSnmq]. Acetazolamide has no antimicrobial or antitoxin activity [^114PMQwU] and may cause metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbances, and severe hypersensitivity reactions, which can worsen outcomes in critically ill patients [^111M1fFu] [^117YTjgC]. There is **no clinical evidence** or guideline support for its use in necrotizing fasciitis [^1171YDpW] [^112VJ38B].

---

## Pharmacological properties of acetazolamide

Acetazolamide is a **carbonic anhydrase inhibitor** [^114PMQwU] that reduces bicarbonate reabsorption, leading to metabolic acidosis and diuresis. It is used for glaucoma, altitude sickness, and some epilepsies [^111fBK7f] but has **no antimicrobial activity** or antitoxin effects relevant to necrotizing fasciitis.

---

## Current standard of care for necrotizing fasciitis

Necrotizing fasciitis requires **immediate surgical debridement** within 12 hours [^112aMeRh]; **broad-spectrum antibiotics** covering MRSA, gram-negatives, and anaerobes [^111uc3NL]; and aggressive supportive care [^113GSnmq]. Delays in surgery or antibiotics increase mortality [^112VJ38B].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding acetazolamide in necrotizing fasciitis

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting acetazolamide for necrotizing fasciitis [^1171YDpW]. No trials, case reports, or guidelines recommend its use, and it lacks antimicrobial or antitoxin effects [^1161PQHd] [^114PMQwU].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of acetazolamide in necrotizing fasciitis

Acetazolamide can cause metabolic acidosis [^111M1fFu], electrolyte disturbances, and severe hypersensitivity reactions [^117YTjgC], which are **dangerous in critically ill patients** with necrotizing fasciitis [^112KSmyx].

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Worsens shock and organ dysfunction [^111M1fFu].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia and hyponatremia can cause arrhythmias and neuromuscular issues [^111M1fFu].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Severe sulfonamide reactions (SJS, TEN, anaphylaxis) can be fatal [^117YTjgC].
- **Drug interactions**: Risky with aspirin, phenytoin, and others [^111M1fFu] [^115bBNev] [^115VKPCL].

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Acetazolamide is **inferior to standard care** (early surgery, broad-spectrum antibiotics, supportive care) and offers no proven benefit in necrotizing fasciitis [^113GSnmq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

No guidelines or expert recommendations support acetazolamide for necrotizing fasciitis [^1161PQHd] [^111Gm1BN]. It is **not recommended** by IDSA, WSES, or EAST [^112aMeRh].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Acetazolamide is **not indicated** for necrotizing fasciitis and should not be used [^1161PQHd]. Management should focus on **early surgical debridement**, **broad-spectrum antibiotics**, and supportive care [^113GSnmq].

### Acetazolamide [^111M1fFu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Increasing the dose of acetazolamide does not increase diuresis and may increase the incidence of drowsiness and/or paresthesia. In fact, increasing the dose often results in a decrease in diuresis. However, under certain circumstances, very large doses have been administered in conjunction with other diuretics to secure diuresis in cases of complete refractory failure.

- **Information for patients**: Adverse reactions common to all sulfonamide derivatives may occur, including anaphylaxis, fever, rash (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), crystalluria, renal calculus, bone marrow depression, thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Early detection of such reactions is crucial, and if they occur, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted.

Acetazolamide should be used with caution in patients with pulmonary obstruction or emphysema, where alveolar ventilation may be impaired, as it may precipitate or aggravate acidosis.

Caution is also advised for patients receiving concomitant high-dose aspirin and acetazolamide, as anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, coma, and death have been reported [see WARNINGS].

Both increases and decreases in blood glucose levels have been described in patients treated with acetazolamide. This should be taken into consideration in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus.

Acetazolamide treatment may cause electrolyte imbalances, including hyponatremia and hypokalemia, as well as metabolic acidosis. Therefore, periodic monitoring of serum electrolyte levels is recommended.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111Gm1BN]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are potentially life-threatening infections of any layer of the soft tissue compartment, associated with widespread necrosis and systemic toxicity. Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, resuscitation, and appropriate antibiotic therapy. A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidence-based guidelines for the management of soft tissue infections.

The multifaceted nature of these infections has led to a collaboration among surgeons, intensive care, and infectious diseases specialists, who have shared these guidelines, implementing clinical practice recommendations.

### Necrotizing soft tissue infections: A review [^113GSnmq]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are severe, life- and limb-threatening infections characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates. Unfortunately, there has been minimal improvement in outcomes over time.

- **Observations**: NSTIs are noted for their heterogeneity in microbiology, risk factors, and anatomical involvement. They often present with nonspecific symptoms, leading to a high rate of delayed diagnosis. Laboratory values and imaging can increase suspicion for NSTI, though ultimately, the diagnosis is clinical. Surgical exploration is warranted when there is a high suspicion for NSTI, even if the diagnosis is uncertain. Thus, it is acceptable to have a certain rate of negative exploration.

Immediate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are further tailored based on tissue culture results, are essential and should be continued at least until surgical debridement is complete and the patient shows signs of clinical improvement. Additional research is needed to determine the optimal antibiotic duration.

Early surgical debridement is crucial for improved outcomes and should be performed as soon as possible, ideally within 6 hours of presentation. Subsequent debridements should occur every 12 to 24 hours until the patient shows signs of clinical improvement and there is no additional necrotic tissue within the wound.

There are insufficient data to support the routine use of adjunct treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin. However, clinicians should be aware of multiple ongoing efforts to develop more robust diagnostic approaches.

Despite advances in antibiotic and surgical management, as well as supportive care for necrotizing soft tissue infections, morbidity and mortality remain substantial. Although clinical practice guidelines are in place, there is still considerable variability in the choice and duration of antibiotic therapy, the timing of initial surgical debridement, and the use of adjuvant medical therapies. This article provides an overview of necrotizing soft tissue infections, focusing on diagnostic and treatment modalities.

### Necrotizing fasciitis after high-dose rate brachytherapy and external beam radiation for prostate cancer: A case report [^114FUNtZ]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

In recent years, the delayed side effects associated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer have drawn the interest of urologists. Although urosymphyseal fistula is one of these delayed side effects, this serious complication is rarely described in literature and is poorly recognized.

- **Case presentation**: We report our experience in treating a 77-year-old male patient with necrotizing fasciitis after high-dose rate brachytherapy plus external beam radiation for prostate cancer. The patient was referred to our hospital with complaints of inguinal swelling and fever. He had a past history of radiotherapy for prostate cancer and subsequent transurethral operation for a stricture of the urethra. Computed tomography showed extensive gas within the femoral and retroperitoneal tissues and pubic bone fracture. Surgical exploration suggested that necrotizing fasciitis was caused by urosymphyseal fistula.

- **Conclusion**: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of necrotizing fasciitis caused by urosymphyseal fistula after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. There is a strong association between urosymphyseal fistula and prostate radiotherapy with subsequent surgical intervention for bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture. Therefore, surgical treatment for bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture after radiotherapy for prostate cancer should be performed with care. The present case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of urosymphyseal fistula. Immediate removal of necrotic tissues and subsequent urinary diversion in the present case may.

### Is it necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis after varicella zoster infection? Two case reports [^111ZkVUT]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis and necrotizing cellulitis are serious cutaneous complications in varicella patients. Differentiating necrotizing cellulitis from necrotizing fasciitis can initially be challenging due to the indistinct clinical course at the onset of infection and the lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. This paper reports two children with necrotizing cellulitis that developed after varicella infection. It aims to draw the attention of healthcare providers to necrotizing cellulitis, which showed a slower clinical course than necrotizing fasciitis and recovered with conservative treatment approaches without aggressive surgical intervention.

### Are there any reasons to change our behavior in necrotizing fasciitis with the advent of new antibiotics [^116gdhTz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The treatment of necrotizing fasciitis requires a multifaceted approach, consisting of surgical source control with immediate surgical debridement, life support, clinical monitoring, and antimicrobial therapy. Many drugs are now available for the treatment of this life-threatening infectious disease, and the purpose of this review is to provide the reader with an updated overview of the newest therapeutic options.

- **Recent findings**: Because most necrotizing soft tissue infections are polymicrobial, broad-spectrum coverage is advisable. Acceptable monotherapy regimens include piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem. However, drugs such as ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam, in association with an antianaerobic agent (metronidazole or clindamycin), are currently available as valuable alternatives. The new cephalosporins active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), ceftaroline, and ceftobiprole share similar antibacterial activity against Gram-positive cocci, and they might be considered as an alternative to non-beta-lactam anti-MRSA agents for necrotizing fasciitis management. Two new long-acting lipoglycopeptides, oritavancin and dalbavancin, are indicated for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and have similar activity against Gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and streptococci.

- **Summary**: Carbapenem-sparing agents are particularly suitable for antimicrobial stewardship strategy. The new long-acting lipoglycopeptides are very effective in treating necrotizing fasciitis and are paramount attractants for updated treatment strategies.

### Necrotizing fasciitis [^114bmiX6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but life-threatening soft-tissue infection characterized by rapidly spreading inflammation and subsequent necrosis of the fascial planes and surrounding tissue. Infection typically follows trauma, although the inciting insult may be as minor as a scrape or an insect bite. Often caused by toxin-producing, virulent bacteria such as group A streptococcus and associated with severe systemic toxicity, necrotizing fasciitis is rapidly fatal unless diagnosed promptly and treated aggressively.

Necrotizing fasciitis is often initially misdiagnosed as a more benign soft-tissue infection. The single most important variable influencing mortality is time to surgical débridement. Thus, a high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary to avert potentially disastrous consequences. Orthopaedic surgeons are often the first to evaluate patients with necrotizing fasciitis, and as such, must be aware of the presentation and management of this disease. Timely diagnosis, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and aggressive surgical débridement of affected tissue are keys to the treatment of this serious, often life-threatening infection.

### Acetazolamide [^117GY37s]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Increasing the dose of acetazolamide does not enhance diuresis and may increase the incidence of drowsiness and/or paresthesia. Often, increasing the dose results in a decreased diuretic effect. However, in certain cases, very large doses have been administered in conjunction with other diuretics to ensure diuresis in cases of complete refractory failure.

Choroidal effusion and choroidal detachment have been reported following acetazolamide use in the post-operative period after ophthalmic surgery. Acetazolamide should be discontinued if choroidal effusion and/or choroidal detachment is suspected.

- **Information for patients**: Adverse reactions common to all sulfonamide derivatives may occur, including anaphylaxis, fever, rash (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), crystalluria, renal calculus, bone marrow depression, thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Early detection of such reactions is crucial, and the drug should be discontinued with appropriate therapy instituted if they occur.

In patients with pulmonary obstruction or emphysema where alveolar ventilation may be impaired, acetazolamide may precipitate or aggravate acidosis and should be used with caution.

Gradual ascent is preferable to avoid acute mountain sickness. If rapid ascent is undertaken and acetazolamide is used, it is important to note that such use does not eliminate the need for prompt descent if severe forms of high altitude sickness occur, such as high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Strategies for diagnosis and management [^116QmLg2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is uncommon and difficult to diagnose, causing progressive morbidity until the infectious process is identified and treated both medically and surgically. The literature addressing NF contains confusing information, inaccurate bacteriologic data, and outdated antibiotic therapy. A delay in diagnosis is associated with a grave prognosis and increased mortality. The clinician's primary goal must be to establish the diagnosis and initiate treatment that meets the standard of care. This review is intended as a guide for clinicians to make an early diagnosis of NF and to begin effective medical and surgical therapy.

### Acetazolamide [^115bBNev]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

To monitor for hematologic reactions common to all sulfonamides, it is recommended that a baseline CBC and platelet count be obtained on patients prior to initiating acetazolamide therapy and at regular intervals during therapy. If significant changes occur, early discontinuance and institution of appropriate therapy are important. Periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes is recommended.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- **Aspirin**: See warnings.

	- Acetazolamide modifies phenytoin metabolism, leading to increased serum levels of phenytoin. This may enhance the occurrence of osteomalacia in patients receiving chronic phenytoin therapy. Caution is advised in patients on chronic concomitant therapy.

	- By decreasing gastrointestinal absorption of primidone, acetazolamide may reduce serum concentrations of primidone and its metabolites, potentially decreasing the anticonvulsant effect. Caution is advised when beginning, discontinuing, or changing the dose of acetazolamide in patients on primidone.

	- Concomitant use with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not advisable due to possible additive effects.

	- Acetazolamide may increase the effects of other folic acid antagonists.

	- Acetazolamide may increase or decrease blood glucose levels. Consideration should be given to patients treated with antidiabetic agents.

	- Acetazolamide decreases urinary excretion of amphetamines, enhancing their effect.

	- It reduces urinary excretion of quinidine, potentially enhancing its effect.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Strategies for diagnosis and management [^114Fjoqz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare soft tissue infection that primarily involves the superficial fascia and results in extensive undermining of surrounding tissues. If untreated, NF is invariably fatal, necessitating a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. Despite the use of modern, powerful antimicrobial drug regimens and advances in the care of critically ill patients, mortality in NF remains high. Published literature indicates that overall mortality ranges from 25% to 73%. The disease's manifestation can vary, ranging from a fulminant presentation to a subtle and insidious development.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^115SfjDj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Today, the generally agreed-upon algorithm for care is as follows:

- **Resuscitate**: Resuscitate the patient in shock.
- **Antibiotics**: Begin with broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover polymicrobial infection.
- **Surgery**: Take the patient to the operating room for early comprehensive debridement of all dead tissue. Doubt as to the diagnosis can be settled using frozen section histologic analysis. Obtain a gram stain and culture from the wound.
- **Repeat debridement**: Further debridements should be repeated every 24 to 48 hours until the infection is controlled.
- **Adjust antibiotics**: Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted to adequately cover organisms obtained on initial culture.
- **HBO therapy**: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) can be considered in the hemodynamically stable patient, if available.

A combination of antibiotics is key to successful adjuvant therapy, with most of our patients having been treated with empirical antimicrobial therapy before we established the early diagnosis of necrotizing infection. In the majority of our cases, wound cultures were collected at the time of initial surgery. Unfortunately, antibiotic therapy alone has little value because tissue hypoxia and ischemia do not permit adequate delivery of antibiotics to the target tissue. The polymicrobial infection identified by wound cultures was the dominant cause of necrotizing fasciitis in our study. For that purpose, we used a combination of antibiotics that cover a broad spectrum of anaerobes (Clindamycin) and aerobes, gram-positive (Penicillin G or extended spectrum Penicillin, Imipenem, and Teicoplanin) and gram-negative organisms (Aminoglycosides, Cephalosporins, or Carbapenems).

### The diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis [^1168y8wi]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

A delay in the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of necrotizing fasciitis has clearly been demonstrated to increase mortality. However, the paucity of specific cutaneous signs makes early recognition extremely difficult. This review highlights recent developments in the approaches to the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.

- **Recent findings**: A clinical staging of necrotizing fasciitis is proposed to better define the progression of the disease. Several clinical subtypes of necrotizing fasciitis have been described recently, including hyperacute and sub-acute variants. Imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging and frozen section biopsies, have been reported to be of value in the early recognition of necrotizing fasciitis; however, availability and cost limit the routine use of these tests. Several diagnostic adjuncts have been developed recently to aid in early recognition. These include the fasciitis LRINEC (laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis) score and transcutaneous tissue oxygen saturation monitoring. Some of these methods may have the potential for widespread application in the assessment of severe soft tissue infections.

- **Summary**: Delayed recognition, with consequent massive soft tissue loss and sepsis, remains a deadly pitfall in the management of necrotizing fasciitis. With a better understanding of the clinical manifestations and the potential use and limitations of various diagnostic adjuncts available for the assessment of equivocal cases of soft tissue infections, it is hoped that a clear and logical approach will be achieved.

### Cervicofacial necrotizing fasciitis and drugs [^114rvNuK]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a devastating disease that typically affects immunocompromised patients, chronically debilitated individuals, or drug users, but can also affect healthy individuals. It can rapidly produce septic shock and requires immediate surgical management of the necrotic tissue. This bacterial infection progresses swiftly and has a high mortality rate, generally caused by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

The patient in the study was immunocompromised and a drug user. During treatment, a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole was employed. Additionally, an activated charcoal dressing was used, composed of carbonized fabric impregnated with 0.15% silver nitrate and enveloped by a layer of fabric without activated carbon. Chemical-mechanical debridement involved hydrogen peroxide, 0.9% saline, and povidone iodine.

The findings suggest that for the treatment of NF, there is a need for broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy paired with surgical debridement, the use of activated charcoal for antiseptic compression, and general intensive care.

### Skin-sparing débridement for necrotizing fasciitis in children [^111sNLpa]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious soft-tissue infection associated with sepsis and tissue destruction. Surgical management usually requires extensive débridement of necrotic fascia and overlying skin, with significant aesthetic and functional consequences. The authors review the outcome of all recent cases of necrotizing fasciitis treated with skin-sparing débridement at their institution.

- **Methods**: The authors conducted a retrospective review of all of their cases of necrotizing fasciitis treated with skin-sparing débridement. Medical records were evaluated with a standard form gathering relevant demographic and clinical data. All cases were confirmed as necrotizing fasciitis histologically.

- **Results**: Ten patients were admitted with a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. The median age of the patients was 4.9 years (range, 1.7 to 15.1 years). The majority of initial lesions were caused by chickenpox, mostly on the trunk. Interval from admission to surgery was 6 hours (range, 1 to 27.5 hours), with a median hospital stay of 11 days (range, 5 to 43 days). Median fasciectomy was 2.5 percent (range, 1 to 15 percent) of total body surface area, with a median skin excision of 0.25 percent of total body surface area (range, 0.1 to 3 percent). All patients received intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plus clindamycin. Delayed direct closure was possible for all patients. Median follow-up was 17 months (range, 3 to 79 months). There was no death in this series.

This approach to surgical management restricts skin excision to areas of definite skin necrosis, limiting unnecessary removal of unaffected tissue.

### Necrotizing fasciitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus: the emergence of methicillin-resistant strains [^1171LdEW]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is an uncommon causative agent of monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis; however, several cases have been noted over the years. The medical records of patients treated for necrotizing fasciitis at our institution between January 1998 and December 2008 were reviewed. Of the 105 necrotizing fasciitis cases during the study period, 18 (17%) were caused by monomicrobial S. aureus infection. The median age was 62 years, with a range of 12 to 81 years. Among this cohort, 10 patients had coexisting medical conditions or risk factors, including diabetes and hypertension. The lower and upper limbs were the most commonly involved sites. Among the bacterial isolates, 8 were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), and 10 were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). One patient in the MSSA group and five patients in the MRSA group died. Although the mortality rate and other clinical characteristics showed no significant differences between the two groups, all MRSA necrotizing fasciitis cases developed after the year 2000. This is significantly different from the MSSA cases, which predominantly occurred before the year 2000. In conclusion, S. aureus has emerged as an important pathogen of monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis, with MRSA becoming the predominant causative agent in recent years. Consequently, MRSA-directed antibiotic therapy should be considered when treating patients suspected of having necrotizing fasciitis in endemic areas.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: Torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^114BaRTb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

During surgical intervention, the following signs are of greatest importance for the necrotizing fasciitis (NF) diagnosis: grayish necrotic deep fascia, a lack of resistance of normally adherent muscular fascia to blunt finger dissection ("finger test"), lack of bleeding from the fascia, and the presence of dish-water pus. Based on our surgical practice, we also recommend an early and very aggressive debridement of all involved tissue that can be easily elevated off the fascia with gentle pressure or finger spreading. The surgical intervention in which we removed all infected tissue in a single operation rapidly improved the clinical course of the infection. All deep fascia and muscle should be inspected for potential involvement with streptococcal myositis or clostridium infection. We believe that the mass and the extension of soft tissue that must be initially excised depend on the body region in which the infection appeared. Nevertheless, the extent of debridement should not be needlessly limited because novel plastic surgical techniques can cover every wound defect size.

Special attention should be paid to the upper and lower extremities, abdominal wall with intra-abdominal infection such as secondary peritonitis, and the chest wall with persisting sternum infection and mediastinitis. The extent of debridement is very important on the extremities. In cases with compromised viability and compartment syndrome, additional fasciotomies of all fascio-cutaneous spaces should be performed. A suspected case of clostridial myonecrosis requires early surgical exploration and extensive debridement of all involved tissue.

### Approaches to surgical debridement in necrotizing soft tissue infections: Outcomes of an animated, interactive survey [^112HnqFa]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) are severe bacterial infections characterized by rapid tissue destruction and systemic toxicity. These infections include subtypes based on tissue layers, such as necrotizing fasciitis, necrotizing myositis, and necrotizing cellulitis, as well as subtypes based on anatomic region, like Fournier gangrene and Ludwig's angina. Due to improved disease management, the mortality rate has decreased from 28.5% on average in the late nineteenth century to 19.7% more recently. Consequently, there is a need to focus more on the long-term effects of this disease. The previously described decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in survivors of NSTI is expected to be at least partially explained by scars and scar-related issues, such as pain or itch, contractures, and aesthetic concerns. Therefore, limiting scar size and improving scar quality are anticipated to enhance long-term outcomes.

One factor that may influence final scar size is the approach used for the surgical debridement of NSTI in the acute phase. Historically, en bloc debridement has been used, where all skin above the affected fascia is resected, providing effective source control but leading to extensive skin defects. More recently, a skin-sparing approach to debridement has been proposed, where all potentially viable skin above the affected fascia is preserved to decrease final scar size and scar-related problems, such as contractures, pain, and appearance. Although there is currently no convincing evidence for the superiority of either of these approaches, the skin-sparing approach has been adapted as the preferred method in practice.

### Current diagnosis and management of necrotizing soft tissue infections: What you need to know [^112qNg37]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections are rare bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues with a high morbidity and mortality rate, requiring prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention. These represent a spectrum of disease resulting in tissue necrosis that is rapidly progressive; however, they remain a diagnostic challenge because the average surgeon or emergency medicine provider may only see one or two over the course of their career. Diagnosis is largely clinical and based on subtle physical examination findings, physiologic instability, and laboratory derangements.

Aids to diagnosis, such as scoring systems and cross-sectional imaging, may be used; however, the findings are not specific, so management should not be based on these alone. The most common cause of necrotizing soft tissue infection is polymicrobial infection; however, specific bacteria such as clostridial species, group A streptococcal, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and aquatic bacteria may also be causative.

Initial management includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation for severe sepsis, and early aggressive surgical debridement. Often, these patients require multiple operative debridements to achieve source control, and a low threshold for repeat debridement should be maintained because these infections can progress rapidly. Once source control is achieved, patients may be left with extensive wounds requiring multidisciplinary care and wound management. Necrotizing infections have long been viewed based on mortality outcomes alone because of their rarity and severity.

### Bexagliflozin [^115ANtpe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene)**: Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Cases have been reported in both females and males, with serious outcomes including hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with bexagliflozin tablets who are presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal areas, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, immediately start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, perform surgical debridement. Discontinue bexagliflozin tablets, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

- **Genital mycotic infections**: Bexagliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections or who are uncircumcised are more likely to develop these infections. Monitor and treat appropriately.

### Acetazolamide [^111fBK7f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Increasing the dose of acetazolamide does not enhance diuresis and may increase the incidence of drowsiness and/or paresthesia. Often, increasing the dose results in a decrease in diuresis. Under certain circumstances, very large doses have been administered with other diuretics to achieve diuresis in cases of complete refractory failure.

- **Information for patients**: Adverse reactions common to all sulfonamide derivatives may occur, including anaphylaxis, fever, and rash (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis). Other reactions include crystalluria, renal calculus, bone marrow depression, thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Early detection of these reactions is crucial, after which the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

	- In patients with pulmonary obstruction or emphysema, where alveolar ventilation may be impaired, acetazolamide should be used cautiously as it may precipitate or aggravate acidosis.

	- Gradual ascent is preferable to avoid acute mountain sickness. In cases of rapid ascent using acetazolamide tablets, it should be noted that this does not eliminate the need for prompt descent if severe forms of high altitude sickness occur, such as high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema.

	- Caution is advised for patients receiving concomitant high-dose aspirin and acetazolamide, as anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, coma, and death have been reported [see WARNINGS].

Both increases and decreases in blood glucose have been reported in patients using acetazolamide.

### Necrotizing soft-tissue infection: Diagnosis and management [^112BLXFw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) are highly lethal. They are frequent enough that general and specialty physicians will likely have to manage at least one patient with NSTI during their practice. However, they are infrequent enough that familiarity with the disease will seldom be achieved. Establishing the diagnosis of NSTI can be the main challenge in treating patients with NSTI, and knowledge of all available tools is key for early and accurate diagnosis. The laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis score can be helpful for distinguishing between cases of cellulitis, which should respond to medical management alone, and NSTI, which requires operative debridement in addition to antimicrobial therapy.

Imaging studies are less helpful. The mainstay of treatment is early and complete surgical debridement, combined with antimicrobial therapy, close monitoring, and physiologic support. Novel therapeutic strategies, including hyperbaric oxygen and intravenous immunoglobulin, have been described, but their effect is controversial. Identification of patients at high risk of mortality is essential for the selection of patients that may benefit from future novel treatments and for the development and comparison of future trials.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^112vEQE9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are potentially life-threatening infections of any layer of the soft tissue compartment, associated with widespread necrosis and systemic toxicity. Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, resuscitation, and appropriate antibiotic therapy. A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidence-based guidelines for the management of soft tissue infections. The multifaceted nature of these infections has led to a collaboration among surgeons, intensive care, and infectious diseases specialists, who have shared these guidelines, implementing clinical practice recommendations.

### Steglatro [^111A3Uya]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Reports have identified cases of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, known as Fournier's gangrene, in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Steglatro. This rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requires urgent surgical intervention. Cases have been reported in both females and males and have led to serious outcomes, including hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with Steglatro who present with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, alongside symptoms such as fever or malaise, should be evaluated for necrotizing fasciitis. If this condition is suspected, it is crucial to begin broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment immediately and consider surgical debridement if necessary. Discontinue Steglatro, monitor blood glucose levels closely, and provide an appropriate alternative for glycemic control.

Steglatro also increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections or those who are uncircumcised have a higher likelihood of developing these infections. It is important to monitor for these infections and treat them appropriately [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Successful use of posaconazole in a pediatric case of fungal necrotizing fasciitis [^111yTLCL]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

To report a pediatric case of posttraumatic fungal fasciitis treated successfully with a combination including posaconazole, a case report was conducted in the pediatric critical care unit at Antwerp University Hospital.

The patient was a 12-year-old female polytrauma patient with extensive skin and muscle injuries who developed fasciitis. Two fungi, Mucor and Trichosporon species, were isolated. The necrotic tissues were aggressively excised, hyperbaric oxygen therapy was applied, and oral posaconazole was added to the initial amphotericin B treatment. The patient made an excellent recovery.

A combination of a high index of suspicion, early aggressive surgery, hyperbaric oxygen, and the association of amphotericin B and posaconazole led to a successful outcome in a case of fungal necrotizing fasciitis. After decades of disappointing amphotericin B treatment in spite of acceptable in vitro activity, the combination with the new triazole posaconazole seems promising.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Strategies for diagnosis and management [^117Notgj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The following is a list of recommendations to prevent necrotizing fasciitis, as reported by the CDC:

- **Good hand washing**: Effective in preventing the spread of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection, especially after coughing, sneezing, and before preparing food or eating.
- **Consultation for sore throats**: Patients with sore throats should be seen by a doctor.
- **Isolation for strep throat**: Patients diagnosed with strep throat should remain at home until 24 hours after their last antibiotic dose.
- **Skin care**: Keeping the skin intact is crucial. Wounds should be cleaned and monitored for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, drainage, and pain.
- **Medical care for infected wounds**: Patients with an infected wound and fever should seek medical care.

### Periocular necrotizing fasciitis following retrobulbar injection [^116CK6Jg]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Management of periorbital necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is centered on early recognition of clinical signs and symptoms. This necessitates aggressive multidisciplinary treatment to avoid severe and permanent disfigurement, loss of vision, and mortality, which is linked to misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis. If prompt diagnosis is established, treatment by extensive surgical debridement and systemic antibiotics (with or without the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy) can prevent a fulminant course with a fatal outcome.

- **Antibiotic regimen**: An optimal antibiotic regimen for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus skin and soft tissue infection is a higher dose of oxacillin (1–2 g intravenously, every 4 hours) with clindamycin (600 mg/kg intravenously, every 8 hours or 300–450 mg orally three times daily) due to oxacillin's excellent diffusion in soft tissue and its antitoxin properties. Our patient was given cloxacillin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole because oxacillin and clindamycin were not available.

- **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy**: The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy can reduce the extent of hypoxic leukocyte dysfunction occurring within an area of hypoxia and infection, providing oxygenation to otherwise ischemic areas. This can block the progression of NF and perhaps save more of the eyelid and orbital tissue.

Some survivors may need extensive surgical intervention like orbital exenteration, as reported by Lazzeri et al. in their review of the published literature. Our patient also developed deep orbital tissue necrosis with eye involvement; exenteration was planned, but the patient declined, self-discharged against medical advice, and did not return for follow-up.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^112HBfr5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Because of the progress of systemic signs of soft tissue bacterial infections with septicemia and SIRS, early fluid resuscitation was initiated in the emergency department. Metabolic changes, such as hyperglycemia and keto-acidosis, were also treated, and intravenous antimicrobial therapy (Penicillin G, Clindamycin, Imipenem, Teicoplanin) was administered. Surgical treatment was performed shortly after admittance to the ICU. Immediate and aggressive surgical debridement was conducted on the posterior chest wall, right shoulder, and right arm, with extensive fasciotomy on the arm. All infected and necrotic skin and subcutaneous tissue were radically excised up to the bleeding healthy edges.

Tissue cultures and fluid aspirate were sent for immediate gram-stain and culture. All opened wounds were copiously irrigated with hydrogen peroxide and saline, and an antibiotic dressing of 1% povidone-iodine solution was applied. Exploration was performed after 24 hours, and all ongoing infected tissue was excised. Wounds were monitored during the next 72 hours with twice-daily dressing changes. During the following five days, adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy in a hyperbaric chamber was applied. On the first day, the patient received two treatments of HBO therapy, and subsequently, one treatment daily over the next four days. HBO was administered at 2.8 atmospheres absolute pressure (ATA) for 90 minutes per day. Two additional debridements and one necrectomy were performed for wound stabilization. After four days, microbiological analysis indicated a necrotizing infection.

### Acetazolamide [^114PMQwU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Acetazolamide is a potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, effective in controlling fluid secretion, such as in some types of glaucoma. It is used in the treatment of certain convulsive disorders, for example, epilepsy, and promotes diuresis in instances of abnormal fluid retention, such as cardiac edema.

Acetazolamide is a nonbacteriostatic sulfonamide and not a mercurial diuretic. It possesses a chemical structure and pharmacological activity distinctly different from bacteriostatic sulfonamides. It specifically inhibits carbonic anhydrase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In the eye, this inhibition decreases the secretion of aqueous humor, resulting in a drop in intraocular pressure, which is desirable in cases of glaucoma and certain nonglaucomatous conditions.

Evidence suggests that acetazolamide has utility as an adjuvant in treating certain dysfunctions of the central nervous system, such as epilepsy. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in this area appears to retard abnormal, paroxysmal, excessive discharge from central nervous system neurons. The diuretic effect of acetazolamide is due to its action in the kidney on the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and dehydration of carbonic acid. This effect results in renal loss of bicarbonate ions, carrying out sodium, water, and potassium, leading to urine alkalinization and promotion of diuresis.

### Interventions for necrotizing soft tissue infections in adults [^1171YDpW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are severe and rapidly spreading infections of the subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle, predominantly caused by bacteria. The associated rates of mortality and morbidity are high, with mortality estimated at around 23% and disability, sequelae, and limb loss occurring in 15% of patients. Standard management includes intravenous empiric antimicrobial therapy, early surgical debridement of necrotic tissues, intensive care support, and adjuvant therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of medical and surgical treatments for necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) in adults in hospital settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to April 2018: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, pharmaceutical company trial results databases, and the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency websites. We checked the reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs conducted in hospital settings that evaluated any medical or surgical treatment for adults with NSTI were eligible for inclusion. Eligible medical treatments included 1) comparisons between different antimicrobials or with placebo; and 2) adjuvant therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV) therapy compared with placebo, no treatment, or other adjuvant therapies.

### Inpefa [^111adEkF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's Gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with Inpefa who present with pain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, treatment should be started immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue Inpefa, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for heart failure.

- **Genital mycotic infections**: Inpefa increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of these infections are more likely to develop them again. Monitor and treat appropriately.

- **Positive urine glucose test**: Monitoring glucose levels with urine glucose tests is not recommended, as SGLT2 inhibition increases urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive results. Use alternative methods to monitor glucose levels.

- **Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay**: Monitoring glucose levels with the 1,5-AG assay is not recommended, as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116tptRu]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) involving the fascial planes overlying the muscle. Due to the tenuous blood and lymphatic supply of the fascia and the potential planes on either surface, infectious processes can spread rapidly and relatively unimpeded once initiated. Thus, necrotizing fasciitis comprises a spectrum of diseases characterized by extensive, rapidly progressive necrosis involving the fascia and peri-fascial planes and may secondarily involve the surrounding subcutaneous tissue, skin, and muscle.

Necrotizing fasciitis is most often polymicrobial and synergistic in nature, with the specific bacteria involved being related to the etiologic source or body region of origin. This condition can involve any part of the body but primarily affects the extremities, abdomen, or perineum. In a study of 150 cases of necrotizing fasciitis, Anaya et al. reported that the extremities were the most common site of infection (58%), followed by the abdomen and perineum.

Usually, necrotizing fasciitis is precipitated by some form of injury or local pathological condition. Blunt or penetrating trauma, surgical site infection, burns, ulcers, abscess, and even childbirth have been documented as precipitating factors for necrotizing fasciitis. Improperly treated superficial infections can progress to necrotizing fasciitis. Body piercing procedures and tattooing, very minor trauma such as abrasions, and insect bites have also been found to initiate necrotizing fasciitis. In some situations, necrotizing fasciitis has arisen without an identifiable previous trauma or pathological condition.

The mortality associated with the disease is high and has been reported to range from 6% onwards.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116Ctuot]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections should be carefully considered and tailored based on individual patient needs and clinical presentations.

- **Early appropriate empiric coverage**: Initiate treatment against suspected pathogens based on the clinical setting for patients with NSTI.
- **Treatment for exotoxin-producing Gram-positive infections**: For patients whose clinical setting or gram stain suggests a rapidly progressive infection potentiated by exotoxins from Gram-positive pathogens (such as S. pyogenes, CA-MRSA, Clostridial species), treatment with antimicrobial agents should be combined with antiribosomal agents like clindamycin or linezolid.
- **Treatment for Gram-negative pathogens**: Patients with rapidly progressive infections and gram stains indicating Gram-negative pathogens (including Aeromonas sp. Eikenella, Vibrio sp.) should be treated with antiribosomal agents targeting Gram-negative pathogens, such as tetracyclines.
- **MRSA coverage**: Appropriate empiric coverage against MRSA should be immediately initiated in patients with NSTI.
- **Broad-spectrum coverage**: Given the difficulty in excluding a polymicrobial necrotizing infection with certainty, an aggressive broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms until culture-specific results and sensitivities are available.
- **De-escalation of therapy**: An appropriate de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy is suggested once culture results come back.

Supportive treatment in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections must be early and aggressive to halt the progression of the inflammatory process.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111FPM45]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) include necrotizing cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, Fournier's gangrene, and necrotizing myositis. These are life-threatening, invasive soft tissue infections caused by aggressive, usually gas-forming bacteria. Delays in diagnosing and treating these infections increase the risk of mortality.

NSTIs may involve dermal and subcutaneous components (necrotizing cellulitis), fascial components (necrotizing fasciitis), and muscular components (necrotizing myositis), either singularly or in combination. They may also be classified into three types:

- **Type 1 – Poly-microbial**: Infections caused by multiple bacterial pathogens.
- **Type 2 – Mono-microbial**: Infections typically initiated by pathogenic β-haemolytic Streptococci or CA-MRSA.
- **Type 3 – Mono-microbial**: Infections secondary to a variety of pathogenic bacilli.

In the early phases, necrotizing soft tissue infections cause localized inflammatory reactions in the involved tissues. Necrosis occurs because of direct cellular injury from bacterial endo/exotoxins, significant inflammatory edema within a closed tissue compartment, thrombosis of local blood vessels, and tissue ischemia. Circulating toxins may cause systemic illness, which can progress to septic shock, multisystem organ dysfunction, and death.

Patients with NSTIs due to either Staphylococcus aureus or group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) may develop toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is a toxin-mediated, acute, life-threatening illness wherein systemically absorbed toxins act as super antigens, massively activating the immune system.

### Outcome of necrotizing fasciitis and Fournier's gangrene with and without hyperbaric oxygen therapy: a retrospective analysis over 10 years [^113VwLst]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) are rare, life-threatening diseases associated with a severe systemic inflammatory cascade triggered by bacterial toxins and carry a high risk of mortality. Two major types are necrotizing fasciitis (NF) and Fournier's gangrene (FG), which occur in mono- and polymicrobial variants. Irrespective of the etiology and pathogen spectrum, NSTI require immediate and extensive surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and intense supportive care.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) constitutes an adjunct treatment. The beneficial effects of HBOT are attributable to high oxygen gradients in the tissues as a result of breathing 100% oxygen under 1.5–3 times the atmospheric pressure. Hyperoxygenation decelerates the infectious progress by improving the function of neutrophilic granulocytes and reduces tissue oedema. Reactive oxygen species exert bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on aerobes and anaerobes. Furthermore, high oxygen levels ameliorate tissue regeneration and improve the efficacy of antibiotics, especially in biofilm-forming microbes. However, evidence for the benefits of HBOT in terms of survival and clinical outcome for patients with NF and FG is still limited.

The aim of our study was to assess in-hospital mortality and outcomes of patients with NF and FG treated in our center over the last decade. We analyzed the effects of patient, disease, and treatment-related factors, particularly HBOT, on these parameters. For this purpose, patients were stratified into three groups: one without the requirement of HBOT, one tr

### Cellulitis and soft tissue infections [^114WtF2a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Cellulitis and soft tissue infections are a diverse group of diseases that range from uncomplicated cellulitis to necrotizing fasciitis. Management of predisposing conditions is the primary means of prevention. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on history and physical examination. Imaging may help characterize purulent soft tissue infections and associated osteomyelitis. Treatment varies according to the type of infection, with the foundations of treatment being drainage of purulence and antibiotics targeted at the infection's most likely cause.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: Torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^1162uXWo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is a rare but potentially fatal infection involving the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle. It is usually accompanied by the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and requires prolonged intensive care treatment. Necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by widespread necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue and fasciae. However, as a soft tissue infection "per se", necrotizing fasciitis typically does not cause myonecrosis but does invade the deep fascia and muscle. Its rapid and destructive clinical course is assumed to be caused by polymicrobial symbiosis and synergy. Monomicrobial infection is usually associated with immunocompromised patients, such as those with cancer, diabetes mellitus, vascular insufficiencies, organ transplantation, or alcohol abuse.

Many aerobic and anaerobic pathogens may be involved, including Bacteroides, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella. However, group A hemolytic streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus, either alone or in synergy, are the initiating infecting bacteria. Typical sites of infection are the extremities (primarily the lower extremities), abdomen, and perineum. In most NSTI cases, anaerobic bacteria are present, usually in combination with aerobic gram-negative organisms. They proliferate in an environment of local tissue hypoxia. Due to lower oxidation-reduction potential, they produce gases such as hydrogen, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and methane, which accumulate in soft tissue spaces due to reduced solubility in water. Establishing the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is crucial.

### Photobiomodulation to treat necrotizing fasciitis [^115vwAjt]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The spread of odontogenic infections associated with comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, can result in a potentially lethal complication with rapid necrosis of the superficial fascia, known as necrotizing fasciitis. In this case report, a 52-year-old female patient with a fasting blood glucose level of 303 mg/dL and necrotizing fasciitis associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the left cervical-thoracic region was treated. She received antibiotics, cervicotomy, and abscess drainage, and underwent 10 photobiomodulation sessions with two weekly applications of the red wavelength laser to correct tissue loss in the left cervical region. With the development of tissue healing, there was increased formation of granulation tissue, an absence of necrotic areas, contraction of the edges, and total wound repair. This case emphasizes the effectiveness of photobiomodulation in optimizing healing and modulating the inflammatory pattern in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis sequelae.

### Necrotizing soft tissue infections in the intensive care unit [^112WnwWn]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infection is a severe illness associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is often caused by a wide spectrum of pathogens and is most frequently polymicrobial. Care for patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection requires a team approach with expertise from critical care, surgery, reconstructive surgery, and rehabilitation specialists. The early diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infection is challenging, but the keys to successful management of patients with this condition are early recognition and complete surgical debridement. Early initiation of appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy must take into consideration the potential pathogens.

Critical care management components such as initial fluid resuscitation, end-organ support, pain management, nutrition support, and wound care are all important aspects of the care of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection. Soft tissue reconstruction should consider both functional and cosmetic outcomes.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: Torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^114TSoaU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Early clinical status during the first 24 hours usually includes minor trauma, skin infection like folliculitis or abscess, gangrene on the extremities, pressure sore(s), or a complicated surgical incision like hernia repair. The external signs on the skin may be erythema or induration. The patient usually feels pain at the site of the injury, and there is a disproportion between the character of the injury and the intensity of the pain. Pain out of proportion with the apparent lesion severity should suggest a possible NF diagnosis.

During the next 2–4 days, the pain becomes more intense. In the clinical status, we find many symptoms of general toxicity such as fever, dehydration, confusion, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, weakness, and malaise. If the patient is not admitted to an ICU or if the diagnosis is established late in its course, more serious clinical symptoms ensue. The limbs and the area of the body where the patient felt pain begin to swell and may show a purplish rash or blisters with "dish-wash" purulent or hemorrhagic fluid. Cutaneous changes may be minimal or may progress to blisters and bullae, and then to circumscribed necrosis of the skin. Also, emphysema and gas formation with crepitations in the overlying skin may appear. The pain grows, but remains disproportionate to the clinical picture.

### The effect of NPWT on odontogenic cervical necrotizing fasciitis [^1118s5f4]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The methods employed in this study included several steps:

- **Preoperative preparation**: The preoperative preparation involved anti-infection measures, maintaining water-electrolyte balance and internal environment stability, correcting hypoalbuminemia, improving the overall nutritional status, and actively controlling blood glucose for effective perioperative management.

- **Emergency debridement operation**: This procedure included incision of the deep fascia and infection space, excision of liquefied and necrotic fat, removal of the yellow and white "bean curd dregs" necrotic fascia tissue, incision stimulation of non-contraction necrotic muscle, and thorough clearance. The surgical area was expanded and explored up to 2 cm above the normal fascia. A large amount of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, saline, and 0.1% iodophor solution was used repeatedly to wash the wound.

- **Treatment after debridement: The observation group** used negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). The negative pressure suction material (15×10 cm, Wuhan Weisdi Medical Science and Technology Co. Ltd.) was applied to fill the infected space without leaving any dead space. The suction material covered the closed wound surface and was sealed with a semipermeable membrane to form a closed wound surface. The closed wound surface was checked for air leakage after connecting the negative pressure device to ensure smooth drainage. Continuous suction with negative pressure ranging from 20 to 40 KPA was maintained, along with continuous drip of normal saline to keep the wound in a wet environment and to avoid blockage of the drainage tube, thus ensuring adequate drainage. Based on the wound surface and drainage fluid, replacement of the negative pressure system was considered necessary every 7 to 12 days.

### Necrotizing fasciitis after high-dose rate brachytherapy and external beam radiation for prostate cancer: a case report [^111j419B]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

In recent years, the delayed side effects associated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer have drawn the interest of urologists. Although urosymphyseal fistula is one of these delayed side effects, this serious complication is rarely described in literature and is poorly recognized.

- **Case presentation**: We report our experience in treating a 77-year-old male patient with necrotizing fasciitis after high-dose rate brachytherapy plus external beam radiation for prostate cancer. The patient was referred to our hospital with complaints of inguinal swelling and fever. He had a past history of radiotherapy for prostate cancer and subsequent transurethral operation for a stricture of the urethra. Computed tomography showed extensive gas within the femoral and retroperitoneal tissues and a pubic bone fracture. Surgical exploration suggested that necrotizing fasciitis was caused by urosymphyseal fistula.

- **Conclusion**: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of necrotizing fasciitis caused by urosymphyseal fistula after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. There is a strong association between urosymphyseal fistula and prostate radiotherapy with subsequent surgical intervention for bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture. Therefore, surgical treatment for bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture after radiotherapy for prostate cancer should be performed with care. The present case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of urosymphyseal fistula. Immediate removal of necrotic tissues and subsequent urinary diversion in the present case may highlight the need for prompt intervention.

### Acetazolamide [^115VKPCL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Aspirin**: See warnings.
	- Acetazolamide modifies phenytoin metabolism with increased serum levels of phenytoin, which may enhance the occurrence of osteomalacia in some patients receiving chronic phenytoin therapy. Caution is advised in patients receiving chronic concomitant therapy.
	- By decreasing the gastrointestinal absorption of primidone, acetazolamide may decrease serum concentrations of primidone and its metabolites, with a consequent possible decrease in anticonvulsant effect. Caution is advised when beginning, discontinuing, or changing the dose of acetazolamide in patients receiving primidone.
	- Concomitant use with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not advisable due to possible additive effects.
	- Acetazolamide may increase the effects of other folic acid antagonists and may increase or decrease blood glucose levels. Consideration should be taken in patients being treated with antidiabetic agents.
	- Acetazolamide decreases urinary excretion of amphetamine and may enhance the magnitude and duration of their effect, as well as reduce urinary excretion of quinidine and enhance its effect.
	- Acetazolamide may prevent the urinary antiseptic effect of methenamine and increases lithium excretion, which may decrease lithium levels.
	- Concurrent use of acetazolamide and sodium bicarbonate increases the risk of renal calculus formation.
	- Acetazolamide may elevate cyclosporine levels.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**:
	- Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetazolamide have not been completed.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: eight-year experience and literature review [^113JhHTD]. The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). High credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe disease that can present with a variety of symptoms and conditions. These include peripheral artery disease (PAD), diarrhea, skin blisters, pain, and skin ulceration. Patients may experience renal failure, purplish skin discoloration, inflammation, and specific necrotizing fasciitis findings. Skin puncture or injury, increased blood glucose levels, decreased serum sodium, increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and altered levels of consciousness are also noted.

Additional symptoms include nausea, an increased Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score, decreased body temperature, and the presence of diabetes mellitus. Patients may display skin discharge, crepitus, erythema, and fever. Other conditions that may occur are cancer, skin warmth, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization, exposure to salt water, and immunocompromised status.

Dizziness, an increased white blood cell (WBC) count, liver cirrhosis, increased serum creatine kinase (CK), skin tenderness, fatigue, induration, and shock may also be seen. The skin can become hypersensitive, and hemorrhagic bullae might appear, contributing to the complexity of the clinical presentation.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: Literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: Torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^115qnEfK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

After admittance to the emergency department, treatment was initiated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, correction of laboratory parameters, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. An empirical combination of antibiotics was administered, including Penicillin G, Gentamycin, and Clindamycin. The first debridement was performed on the perineum area and continued to the scrotum, inguinal regions, and the lower abdominal wall (AW). We also performed an endoscopic lavage of the knee joint and fasciotomy, with radical debridement, of the anterior compartment of the left thigh. The anterior compartment was opened from the inguinal ligament to just above the knee joint. All opened wounds were copiously irrigated with hydrogen peroxide, 0.9% physiologic solution, and dressed with 1% povidone iodine solution.

After the initial debridement, the wounds were carefully monitored over the next 24 to 72 hours, with dressing changes occurring twice daily. Adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy was applied over the course of the next seven days. On the first day, the patient received two treatments of HBO therapy, followed by one treatment daily thereafter. HBO was administered at 2.8 ATA for 90 minutes per session. Three additional debridement and necrectomy procedures were performed to stabilize the wound. Fecal incontinence was managed with a diverting colostomy. The results of microbiological analysis of the perineum and thigh cultures revealed a polymicrobial infection with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, and the presence of mixed anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis.

### Life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis [^113pxG5Z]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by a rapidly progressing necrosis of subcutaneous fat and fascia, which can be life-threatening without prompt recognition, surgical intervention, and immediate antibiotic therapy. Necrotizing fasciitis has been subdivided into type 1, or polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis, and type 2, or group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, synonyms such as streptococcal gangrene and "flesh-eating bacteria syndrome" have been used in the literature.

### Management of necrotizing fasciitis in diabetic patients [^112vW9SR]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening condition in diabetic patients; its management and salvage of the patient is a formidable challenge. Diabetes mellitus is one of the serious conditions associated with necrotizing fasciitis. It is a disorder that primarily affects the microvascular circulation. We review our experience and present our approach to necrotizing fasciitis in patients with diabetes mellitus.

All cases of necrotizing fasciitis treated at Inonu University, Turgut Ozal Medical Center, from January 1997 to December 2003 were reviewed. A review of 59 charts identified 11 cases that met the study criteria. Cases with necrosis due to other obvious causes were excluded. Three patients had spread of infection with no fatality. An average of 42 hospital days (22–64 days), 17 intensive care unit days (7–28 days), and three surgical procedures (2–7) per patient was required.

Necrotizing fasciitis is an extremely serious exceptional infectious process affecting subcutaneous soft tissue with skin gangrene and vascular thromboses. Clearly, the mortality and morbidity associated with necrotizing fasciitis even in diabetes can be decreased with clinical awareness, early diagnosis, effective surgical debridement, and intensive supportive care.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: strategies for diagnosis and management [^1168TAvg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is uncommon and difficult to diagnose. It causes progressive morbidity until the infectious process is identified and treated both medically and surgically. The literature on NF contains confusing information, inaccurate bacteriological data, and outdated antibiotic therapies. A delay in diagnosis is associated with a grave prognosis and increased mortality. The clinician's main goal must be to establish the diagnosis and initially treat the patient within the standard of care. This review serves as a guide for clinicians in making an early diagnosis of NF and initiating effective medical and surgical therapy.

### Necrotizing fasciitis [^11721fja]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare, rapidly progressive bacterial soft tissue infection with a high risk for morbidity and mortality. Although more common in adults, NF also affects the pediatric population. Many bacterial organisms can cause NF, but group A Streptococcus is the most common monomicrobial cause of the disease. Necrotizing fasciitis remains principally a clinical diagnosis, and it is often missed early in its presentation because of the difficulty in differentiating it from more common soft tissue infections. The criterion standard for diagnosis and the mainstay of therapy is surgical debridement. Time to initiation and completion of therapy remains the most important factor in patient outcomes, highlighting the importance of early recognition and intervention in this potentially devastating disease.

### Interventions for treating gas gangrene [^114VY8GX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Gas gangrene is a rapidly progressive and severe disease that results from bacterial infection, usually as the result of an injury; it has a high incidence of amputation and a poor prognosis. It requires early diagnosis and comprehensive treatments, which may involve immediate wound debridement, antibiotic treatment, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, Chinese herbal medicine, systemic support, and other interventions. The efficacy and safety of many of the available therapies have not been confirmed.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential interventions in the treatment of gas gangrene compared with alternative interventions or no interventions.

- **Search methods**: In March 2015, we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialized Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL, Science Citation Index, the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM-disc), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese scientific periodical database of VIP INFORMATION (VIP) for relevant trials. We also searched reference lists of all identified trials and relevant reviews and four trials registries for eligible research. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared one treatment for gas gangrene with another treatment, or with no treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Independently, two review authors selected potential studies.

### Acetazolamide [^116pNdfP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

To monitor for hematologic reactions common to all sulfonamides, it is recommended that a baseline CBC and platelet count be obtained on patients prior to initiating acetazolamide tablet therapy and at regular intervals during therapy. If significant changes occur, early discontinuance and institution of appropriate therapy are important. Periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes is also recommended.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- Aspirin (see warnings and precautions).
	- Acetazolamide modifies phenytoin metabolism, increasing serum levels of phenytoin. This may increase or enhance the occurrence of osteomalacia in some patients receiving chronic phenytoin therapy. Caution is advised in patients receiving chronic concomitant therapy.
	- By decreasing the gastrointestinal absorption of primidone, acetazolamide may decrease serum concentrations of primidone and its metabolites, potentially decreasing its anticonvulsant effect. Caution is advised when beginning, discontinuing, or changing the dose of acetazolamide in patients receiving primidone.
	- Because of possible additive effects with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, concomitant use is not advisable.
	- Acetazolamide may increase the effects of other folic acid antagonists.
	- Acetazolamide may alter blood glucose levels. Consideration should be given to patients being treated with antidiabetic agents.
	- Acetazolamide decreases urinary excretion of amphetamine and may enhance the magnitude and duration of their effect.
	- Acetazolamide reduces urinary excretion of quinidine and may enhance its effect.

### Modern concepts of the diagnosis and treatment of necrotizing fasciitis [^115kSUPV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a potentially fatal infection involving rapidly progressive, widespread necrosis of the superficial fascia. The purpose of this collective review is to discuss modern concepts of the treatment and diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.

- **Discussion**: Necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by widespread necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue and the fascia. Although the pathogenesis of necrotizing fasciitis is still open to speculation, the rapid and destructive clinical course is thought to be due to multibacterial symbiosis. Over the last two decades, scientists have found that the pathogenesis of necrotizing fasciitis is usually polymicrobial, rather than monomicrobial. Although there has been no published well-controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacies of various diagnostic imaging modalities in the diagnosis of necrotizing infections, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred technique to detect soft tissue infection. MRI provides unsurpassed soft tissue contrast and spatial resolution, has high sensitivity in detecting soft tissue fluid, and has multiplanar capabilities. Percutaneous needle aspiration followed by prompt Gram's staining and culture for a rapid bacteriologic diagnosis in soft tissue infections is recommended. Surgery complemented by antibiotics is the primary treatment of necrotizing fasciitis.

- **Conclusion**: Wide, extensive debridement of all tissues that can be easily elevated off the fascia with gentle pressure should be undertaken. Successful use of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy has been reported in conjunction with antibiotics and surgery in some cases.
