## Question

hypertension management in primary care

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hypertension management in primary care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scope to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify diagnostic principles and blood pressure measurement strategies. Next, I will review lifestyle-first management and when to escalate to pharmacotherapy. After that, I need to check medication choices, including race-specific guidance and combination therapy. I will then examine blood pressure targets and how to individualize them. I should confirm strategies for resistant hypertension and secondary causes. Finally, I will integrate implementation tools, equity considerations, and a practical algorithm, while continuously checking for inconsistencies and correcting them as needed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't drift into specialty-only territory. Hypertension is the most common chronic condition in primary care and a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, with substantial mortality attributable to suboptimal control, so primary care management must be evidence-based, patient-centered, and adaptable to local resources and populations [^a4680c5c] [^58554134] [^fd62b3cd].

> Wait, let me verify diagnostic principles before discussing treatment. Accurate blood pressure measurement is foundational; I initially thought manual auscultation was the gold standard, but hold on, I should correct that — attended or unattended automated office blood pressure (AOBP) with proper technique is preferred, averaging three measurements after five minutes of rest, with validated devices and attention to cuff size and arm position; if AOBP is unavailable, use calibrated manual devices and average multiple readings, and consider home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to detect white-coat or masked hypertension and refine diagnosis and control [^b6c198ca] [^f67ee5d0] [^685596d5].

> I need to ensure I'm aligning lifestyle-first management with current guidance. Lifestyle modification is first-line for elevated blood pressure and grade 1 hypertension, and should proceed in parallel with pharmacotherapy when hypertension is diagnosed, especially in higher-risk patients; key elements include sodium restriction toward less than 1500–2300 mg/day, DASH-style dietary patterns, weight loss in those with overweight/obesity, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity, moderation of alcohol, smoking cessation, and sleep hygiene, with structured support to improve adherence and durability of change [^37769ea8] [^3b8123c8] [^e1284807] [^f72ac6ea].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about when to start medications. I should confirm thresholds and the role of cardiovascular risk. For adults with confirmed hypertension, initiate pharmacotherapy when blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or higher, with consideration of a lower threshold in high-risk patients such as those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or established cardiovascular disease; use shared decision-making to weigh benefits, harms, and patient preferences, and consider earlier initiation when hypertension-mediated organ damage is present [^a4680c5c] [^08f7cc9d] [^37769ea8].

> Next, I should review first-line drug choices and race-specific guidance. Thiazide-type diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs are all acceptable initial options; however, in Black patients, ACE inhibitors or ARBs should not be used as monotherapy due to lesser blood pressure response, so start with a thiazide or CCB and add an ACEi/ARB if needed; in patients with CKD and albuminuria, an ACEi or ARB is recommended to improve kidney outcomes; avoid combining ACEi and ARB or using direct renin inhibitors with either class [^602b0f89] [^a62a7af0] [^2a75e08b].

> I should double-check the stance on combination therapy versus monotherapy. The VA/DoD guideline concludes there is insufficient evidence to mandate initial combination therapy over sequential monotherapy, but suggests considering initial combination when baseline blood pressure is more than 20/10 mmHg above goal; structured programs and pragmatic trials show that early combination therapy, including single-pill combinations, can accelerate control and mitigate therapeutic inertia, so I need to balance guideline conservatism with real-world effectiveness and patient-specific factors [^700f7fa8] [^6bf4b837] [^48b5330d] [^63a9808a].

> Let me think about blood pressure targets and how to individualize them. A standard target of less than 140/90 mmHg reduces all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and is appropriate for most adults; lower targets such as less than 135/85 mmHg may confer a small additional reduction in myocardial infarction risk but do not reduce stroke or mortality, so use shared decision-making for lower targets, especially in patients at higher cardiovascular risk and when harms like hypotension, syncope, or renal injury are less likely; in adults 60 years and older, the VA/DoD recommends treating to less than 150 mmHg systolic with added benefit down to 130–150 mmHg in many patients, again tailoring to tolerance and comorbidity [^1a5f9dc6] [^f0ea747e] [^08f7cc9d].

> I will now examine resistant hypertension and secondary causes, because missing these is a common pitfall. Before labeling a patient as having resistant hypertension, I should confirm true resistance by verifying adherence, ensuring appropriate combinations and doses, and reinforcing lifestyle therapy; if secondary hypertension is suspected, delay spironolactone until after evaluation for primary aldosteronism and other causes, and consider referral to hypertension specialists when appropriate; primary aldosteronism is under-recognized and should be screened in patients with refractory hypertension, hypokalemia, or adrenal incidentalomas [^2b86c0f0] [^d326074a] [^e25e8953].

> Next, I should review implementation strategies that meaningfully improve control. Team-based care with pharmacists, nurses, and dietitians improves blood pressure control and is cost-effective; pharmacist-led medication management, nurse-led protocols, and dietitian-led nutrition interventions each contribute to clinically meaningful reductions; telehealth and HBPM with co-interventions reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure and sustain improvements; clinical decision support embedded in the EMR can reduce inertia and standardize care, though benefits depend on workflow integration and clinician uptake [^068a8352] [^c9a8f5a0] [^685596d5] [^ebf8f146] [^ffaa19e3].

> But wait, what if disparities in control persist despite these interventions. I need to ensure equity is addressed explicitly. Black and Hispanic or Latino patients experience higher rates of uncontrolled hypertension and face barriers including therapeutic inertia, limited access to HBPM, and social determinants; culturally tailored education, trust-building, and asynchronous care models can mitigate these gaps, and team-based care has been shown to improve equity when implemented thoughtfully [^70a9e734] [^e3e8a1b3] [^948ad4c8].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check it against the evidence. Screen adults periodically and confirm hypertension with proper measurement technique and, when indicated, out-of-office monitoring; set individualized blood pressure goals using shared decision-making; initiate lifestyle interventions for all and reinforce them at every visit; start pharmacotherapy at or above 140/90 mmHg, choosing initial agents based on race, comorbidities, and baseline blood pressure; consider initial combination therapy when blood pressure is more than 20/10 mmHg above goal; titrate monthly until control, using HBPM and team-based supports; if not at goal on maximally tolerated triple therapy, evaluate for adherence and secondary causes before adding a fourth agent; once at goal, follow every 6–12 months with labs as indicated and continue lifestyle support [^9a230eac] [^80ee9c22] [^1c94f971] [^602b0f89] [^2b86c0f0].

> Finally, I should confirm that my recommendations align with major guidelines and note any inconsistencies. The VA/DoD, AAFP, and WHO documents converge on lifestyle-first care, evidence-based thresholds for treatment, and the importance of team-based, patient-centered approaches, while differing modestly in blood pressure targets and the strength of evidence for initial combination therapy; acknowledging these differences and documenting shared decision-making helps reconcile apparent conflicts and supports individualized care [^6b4d7888] [^1a5f9dc6] [^f4341c34] [^ee782d1c].

Hypertension management in primary care centers on **accurate diagnosis** with validated devices and out-of-office monitoring [^b6c198ca] [^685596d5], **lifestyle-first therapy** for all patients [^37769ea8], and **evidence-based pharmacotherapy** tailored to comorbidities and patient preferences [^602b0f89]. Targets are individualized: **< 140/90 mmHg** for most adults, with lower goals for high-risk patients when tolerated [^1a5f9dc6] [^f0ea747e]. Team-based care, pharmacist-led medication management, and home BP telemonitoring improve control and adherence [^068a8352] [^70a9e734]. Address barriers such as therapeutic inertia, nonadherence, and social determinants to close the evidence-practice gap [^eb12cb50] [^e3e8a1b3].

---

## Diagnosis and blood pressure measurement

- **Accurate measurement**: Use validated automated devices and standardized technique; average multiple readings [^b6c198ca] [^f67ee5d0].
- **Out-of-office monitoring**: Home BP monitoring (HBPM) or ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) improves diagnostic accuracy and guides therapy [^685596d5].
- **White coat and masked hypertension**: Identify and manage with ABPM/HBPM to avoid misclassification and overtreatment [^7702b207].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

First-line for all patients, with **DASH dietary patterns** [^3b8123c8], sodium restriction to < 2,300 mg/day (ideally < 1,500 mg/day) [^f72ac6ea], weight loss to BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m² [^e1284807], at least 150 minutes/week of moderate aerobic activity [^37769ea8], alcohol moderation (≤ 1 drink/day women, ≤ 2 drinks/day men), and smoking cessation [^37769ea8]. These changes lower BP by about 4–10 mmHg and enhance antihypertensive efficacy [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacologic management

- **First-line agents**: Thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers are recommended based on comorbidities and patient factors [^602b0f89].
- **Race-specific considerations**: Avoid ACEi/ARB monotherapy in Black patients; prefer thiazide or CCB, with ACEi/ARB added if needed [^a62a7af0].
- **Combination therapy**: Consider initial combination when BP is > 20/10 mmHg above goal or in high-risk patients [^6bf4b837].
- **Resistant hypertension**: Confirm adherence, optimize doses, add spironolactone, and evaluate for secondary causes [^2b86c0f0].

---

## Blood pressure targets

- **General target**: < 140/90 mmHg for most adults [^1a5f9dc6].
- **High-risk patients**: Consider < 130/80 mmHg for diabetes, CKD, or cardiovascular disease if tolerated [^notfound].
- **Older adults**: Treat to < 150 mmHg systolic, with added benefit down to 130–150 mmHg when tolerated [^f0ea747e].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Schedule **monthly visits** until BP is at goal, then every 3–6 months with annual labs (renal function, electrolytes) [^notfound]. Use HBPM with co-interventions to improve control and adherence [^685596d5]. Track control rates and intervene on persistent elevations to counter therapeutic inertia [^eb12cb50].

---

## Barriers and facilitators

Common barriers include **therapeutic inertia**, nonadherence, limited HBPM access, and social determinants (cost, transportation, health literacy) [^eb12cb50] [^e3e8a1b3]. Facilitators include team-based care, pharmacist-led management, telehealth, and culturally tailored education [^068a8352] [^70a9e734].

---

## Special populations

In chronic kidney disease, **use ACEi/ARB** for albuminuria and individualize BP targets [^2a75e08b]. In pregnancy, manage per obstetric guidelines and avoid ACEi/ARBs. In older adults, start low, go slow, and monitor for orthostatic hypotension [^f0ea747e].

---

## Quality improvement strategies

Embed **clinical decision support** to prompt guideline-concordant care [^ebf8f146]. Implement team-based care with defined roles for pharmacists, nurses, and dietitians [^85332983]. Provide patient education and self-management tools to improve adherence [^70a9e734].

---

Effective hypertension management in primary care requires **accurate diagnosis**, lifestyle-first therapy, evidence-based pharmacotherapy, and coordinated team-based care, with ongoing monitoring to overcome barriers and improve control.

VA/DoD hypertension guideline — GRADE recommendation strength framework states that the GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation: Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, Confidence in the quality of the evidence, Patient or provider values and preferences, and Other implications, as appropriate (resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations). Using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative strength of each recommendation ("Strong" or "Weak"), and a "Strong" recommendation indicates "a high confidence in the quality of the available scientific evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and harms of an intervention, similar patient or provider values and preferences, and understood influence of other implications (e.g., resource use, feasibility)"; if the Work Group has less confidence after the assessment and believes that additional evidence may change the recommendation, it assigns a "Weak" recommendation. The terminology "Strong" versus "Weak" "should not be confused with the clinical importance of the recommendation", and "A 'Weak' recommendation may still be important to the clinical care of a patient with HTN". When there is "insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a particular therapy or preventive measure", recommendation grades are presented on a continuum that includes: Strong for, Weak for, No recommendation for or against, Weak against, and Strong against.

VA/DoD hypertension guideline — evidence assessment and values/preferences framework — states that overall confidence in a recommendation cannot exceed the lowest confidence among critical outcomes, and elements informing confidence include whether there is high or moderate quality evidence answering the question and the overall certainty of the evidence. Values and preferences are defined as including patients' perspectives, beliefs, expectations, and goals, and they increase the strength of a recommendation when there is high concordance and decrease it when there is great variability; when benefits and risks are uncertain, eliciting and empowering patient and surrogate values becomes even more important. Discussion questions include confidence in typical values across the target population, the patient's own values and preferences, and whether relative values are similar across the target population. Other implications address practicality, including resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, and subgroup considerations; resource use relates to uncertainty around cost-effectiveness, with an example that statin use in frail elderly and others with multiple co-occurring conditions may not be effective and may not be a good use of resources depending on societal willingness-to-pay benchmarks. The framework below (Table A-4) was used by the Work Group to guide discussions on each domain.

GRADE evidence to recommendation framework — recommendation strength and direction are determined using four decision domains, including Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, Confidence in the quality of the evidence, Values and preferences, and Other implications (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations). For the balance domain, judgments span "Benefits outweigh harms/burden", "Benefits and harms/burden are balanced", and "Harms/burden outweigh benefits"; for confidence they are "High Moderate Low Very low", and for values/preferences they include "Similar values", "Some variation", and "Large variation", with other implications summarized as "Various considerations". The strength of a recommendation is defined as confidence that desirable effects outweigh undesirable effects and is "based on the framework above, which combines the four domains", and "GRADE methodology does not allow for recommendations to be made based on expert opinion alone"; while "strong recommendations are usually based on high or moderate confidence in the estimates of effect (quality of the evidence) there may be instances where strong recommendations are warranted even when the quality of evidence is low". The GRADE of a recommendation is based on "Four decision domains used to determine the strength and direction (described above)", "Relative strength (Strong or Weak)", and "Direction (For or Against)", and "The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, "Strong" or "Weak".

D. Grading recommendations — This clinical practice guideline (CPG) uses the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a strength for each recommendation across four domains: balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, confidence in the quality of the evidence, values and preferences, and other implications (resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations). Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes refers to the size of anticipated benefits and harms relative to each other, and the certainty or uncertainty about the risk-benefit balance will greatly influence the strength of the recommendation; discussion questions include whether the benefits outweigh the harms and burden, whether desirable anticipated effects are large, and whether undesirable anticipated effects are small. Confidence in the quality of the evidence reflects the quality of the evidence base, the certainty in that evidence, and the methodological quality of the studies for each outcome variable; in general, the strength of recommendation follows the level of evidence, but not always, as other domains may increase or decrease the strength, and ratings can be assigned as "High", "Moderate", "Low", or "Very Low".

Hypertension in the primary care setting — key questions 8–12 specify prioritized outcomes for evidence review as follows: For Key Question 8, critical outcomes are reduction in blood pressure, change in blood pressure from baseline, achievement of lower blood pressure goals, and HTN control, and important outcomes are composite CV outcomes, safety, time to blood pressure control, number of office visits to achieve control, adherence to therapy, and percentage of patients taking medications. For Key Question 9, critical outcomes are safety, reduction in blood pressure, change in blood pressure from baseline, achievement of lower blood pressure goals, and HTN control, and important outcomes are composite CV outcomes, strokes, CHF, and renal function. For Key Questions 10 and 11, critical outcomes are reduction in blood pressure, change in blood pressure from baseline, achievement of lower blood pressure goals, HTN control, adherence to therapy, and percentage of patients taking medications, and important outcomes are patient quality of life, safety, and AEs/adverse events. For Key Question 12, critical outcomes are composite outcomes, and important outcomes are CV and all-cause mortality, strokes, renal function, reduction in CV risk, diagnosis of masked HTN, and dosing and drug selection decisions for antihypertensive drugs.

Introduction

Although hypertension is a readily detectable and modifiable condition it is responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other cardiovascular risk factor, including tobacco use, obesity, and lipid disorders. In the United States, of all modifiable risk factors hypertension has been associated with the greatest population attributable risk for all cause mortality (30%) and deaths from cardiovascular disease (40%). Epidemiological studies suggest a relation between raised blood pressure and increased risk of cardiovascular events. Large scale clinical trials examining the efficacy of a broad range of antihypertensives found a consistent and continuous reduction in cardiovascular risk (primary or secondary events and across all age groups) according to the baseline values and magnitude of change in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Traditionally, the ideal blood pressure target has been ≤ 140/90 mm Hg for those aged less than 80 years and these are reflected in current guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom. The introduction of absolute risk profiling for primary prevention purposesand more stringent, individualised blood pressure targets for higher risk groups such as people with type 2 diabetes or more advanced forms of cardiovascular diseasehas provided clinicians in other regions of the world with a challenge in meeting these targets. Considering the recent debate on whether more stringent blood pressure targets fail to provide cardioprotection and perhaps even confer harm at blood pressure levels approaching 110/75 mm Hgit is likely that more stringent blood pressure targets will be subject to further consideration.

Regardless of recommended blood pressure targets, however, the translation of potential benefits from clinical trials to the real life management of hypertension (much of which occurs in primary care) is less than ideal. Many people prescribed antihypertensive treatment have a blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg. A key component of effective translation in the primary care setting seems to be the application of structured programmes to apply antihypertensive treatments by a rigorous stepped care approachto overcome the common phenomenon of prescription resistance(whereby clinicians are reluctant to up-titrate existing drug treatment or prescribe additional antihypertensive agents) and to achieve better individual blood pressure control. For example, nurse led interventions that comprise a structured care algorithm are associated with greater reductions in blood pressure levels than usual care overall. Few studies, however, have specifically tested the application of structured care in the setting of more stringent, risk based blood pressure targets in a large and diverse range of general practices — that is, small to large clinics and those with and without practice nurses to implement structured care.

Hypertension (HTN) — emerging technologies should be considered as a possible additional intervention between the provider and patient to address HTN, and this recommendation's strength is "Weak for". The overall confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low to low, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes shows that benefits slightly outweigh harms/burden, and additional studies should consider the effectiveness, safety, adherence, and overall quality of life impact on decreasing blood pressure.

VA/DoD hypertension guideline — recommendation strength and categories are based on confidence in the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes: "If the Work Group is more confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a strong recommendation", whereas "If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation". A recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure "indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences", and a recommendation against "indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences". When evidence is insufficient, "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a specific therapy or preventive measure", and "the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum" including Strong For, Weak For, No recommendation for or against, Weak Against, and Strong Against. Weak (For or Against) recommendations "may also be termed "Conditional", "Discretionary", or "Qualified", and "may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented". Recommendation categorization was "adapted from those used by NICE".

Hypertension — patient-centered care (PCC) is emphasized as VA/DoD CPGs encourage providers to use a PCC approach that is individualized based on patient needs, characteristics, and preferences, stating that regardless of setting, all patients in the healthcare system should be able to access evidence-based care appropriate to their specific needs or condition. When properly executed, PCC may decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in clinicians, and improve treatment adherence, and improved patient-clinician communication and a PCC approach conveys openness and supports disclosure of current and future concerns. As part of the PCC approach, providers should ask each patient about any concerns he or she has or barriers to high quality care he or she has experienced.

### Assessment of hypertension complications and health service use 5 years after implementation of a multicomponent intervention [^c2d74475]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is a protocol-driven, team-based, multicomponent hypertension management program implemented in the public primary care setting associated with fewer complications and mortality in patients with hypertension?

Findings

In this cohort study that included 212 707 adults with uncomplicated hypertension, participation in the Risk Assessment and Management Program for Hypertension, offered in addition to usual primary care, was associated with clinically significant reductions in incidences of hypertension-related complications, all-cause mortality, and hospital-based health service use after 5 years.

Meaning

This study's results suggest that a protocol-driven, team-based hypertension management program incorporated into the public primary care setting is a viable strategy to reduce disease burden on health care systems due to hypertension.

III. GENERAL RECOMMENDATION

We recommend lifestyle goals (summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1) to prevent or delay the onset of high BP and to reduce CVD risk. Lifestyle modifications should be the first line of antihypertensive treatment in grade 1 hypertension. However, if BP control is not achieved with lifestyle changes alone, we recommend a combination of lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications for diagnosed hypertension as the former enhance the effect of treatment. Importantly, pharmacotherapy should not be delayed when instituting lifestyle change in patients, for instance, in those with hypertension-mediated organ damage or at high level of risk for cardiovascular events. Lastly, we recommend that healthcare providers and clinicians receive adequate training in working with patients to adopt lifestyle changes and take an active role in the implementation of these recommendations. These consensus recommendations are targeted towards primary care providers and public health programmers. In addition to the recommendations, we provide an international perspective to consider different resources, practices and cultural considerations for differing regions and implementation guidance at the individual and population level.

### Clinicians' and patients' perspectives on hypertension care in a racially and ethnically diverse population in primary care [^948ad4c8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are patients' and clinicians' perspectives on hypertension control and management in racially and ethnically diverse populations in primary care?

Findings

In this qualitative study of 15 patients and 15 clinicians, the participants felt that self-management (in particular, lifestyle modifications) should receive more attention; for example, they expressed difficulty with self-management activities, especially lifestyle modifications, and some hesitancy about and variation in intensifying medications and recommendations for follow-up care and patient self-monitoring. Current health information technology tools for hypertension were also thought to be limited.

Meaning

The results of this study suggest that, as current care models for hypertension are thought to be insufficient, more attention may need to be paid to ways to support treatment intensification and self-management, particularly through asynchronous interventions.

Hypertension management in patients 60 years and over — treatment target and strength: For patients 60 years and over, we recommend treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of < 150 mm Hg with added benefit to lowering systolic blood pressure further for those between 130 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg (Strong for | Reviewed, Amended). Among people age 60 and over with moderate to severe HTN, there is evidence that treating to an SBP goal of 150 mm Hg or less reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and among people 60 years and over, there was also evidence of further benefit in lowering systolic blood pressure to levels between 130 and 150 mm Hg.

### Team-based care to improve blood pressure control… [^70a9e734]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends team-based care as an effective way to improve blood pressure control, including among patients who are African American, Black, Hispanic, or Latino. The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Control Hypertension showed that certain racial and ethnic groups have disproportionately high rates of hypertension, due to inequalities in the distribution of social, economic, and environmental conditions needed for health. Reducing these disparities requires improved access to quality care, as well as addressing a breadth of contributing social factors. When implemented by health care professionals who serve patients from racial and ethnic minority groups, team-based care interventions are likely to improve health equity by providing patients greater agency in their own care and improving medication adherence. The CPSTF found team-based care interventions to be cost-effective.

The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Control Hypertension* and the CDC's Best Practices for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Programs promote team-based care as a part of a comprehensive treatment protocol for hypertension management. Medication adherence support. Patients may face barriers to taking their medications as prescribed. Team members can help patients improve adherence by identifying and working to address these barriers with education and coaching. CPSTF recommends tailored pharmacy-based interventions Self-management support. Lifestyle changes, including adopting a healthy diet, getting more physical exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing stress, and not smoking, can be difficult to achieve and maintain. Team members can support and empower patients to take an active role in controlling their high blood pressure. Strategies include health behavior counseling, coaching, and education.

The foundation of team-based care is the intentional and strategic organization of care to create a collaborative multidisciplinary team to meet the needs of the patients. Four interventions, outlined in the table below, have been shown to facilitate incorporating the strategies listed above into the successful implementation of team-based care. Table 1. The benefits and considerations of four key interventions. Intervention Benefits Considerations Facilitate communication and coordination of care support among team members.
- Guideline-directed treatment can improve management of high blood pressure.
- Applying standardized, evidence-based treatment protocols has been shown to support consistency in care across diverse patient groups.
- Treatment guidelines summarize where the evidence base is clear and can support treatment decisions but are not meant to supersede clinical judgment.
- Teams can use evidence-based guidelines to inform treatment protocols that incorporate a team-based care model with complementary roles to improve patient access and enhance the efficiency of care.

### Pharmacist's role in hypertension management: a review of key randomized controlled trials [^c9a8f5a0]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) is a leading cause of death and disability throughout the world. Yet, despite widely available treatment options, blood pressure (BP) control rates have remained relatively stagnant. One approach to address this issue is through collaborative care models, particularly those employing pharmacists. Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCT) have demonstrated the effectiveness of pharmacist interventions to improve BP control across primary care, community-based, and telemedicine models. A meta-analysis of 39 RCTs has demonstrated that pharmacist interventions significantly reduce both systolic and diastolic BP compared with controls across diverse patient populations. Pharmacists can contribute to HTN management in a variety of ways, including assisting with out-of-office monitoring, providing education, identifying and resolving nonadherence, and titrating antihypertensive therapy to achieve BP control. In this review, we discuss key trials conducted in recent years that support the role of pharmacists in HTN management and provide guidance on practical considerations for working collaboratively with pharmacists to improve BP control.

### Evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a clinical decision support system in managing hypertension in resource constrained primary health care settings: results from a cluster randomized trial [^ebf8f146]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

DSS embedded with clinical practice guidelines aid implementation of evidence‐based clinical practice guidelines for management of HTN even in resource‐limited settings. DSS result in better management of HTN, provided patients adhere to the suggested dietary and lifestyle modifications, and medications and providers adhere to the suggested DSS recommendations. Key features of the DSS include (1) patient‐specific, tailor‐made, and guideline‐based recommendations on risk factors and disease management of HTN and (2) counseling on lifestyle modification, both of which aid the end user (clinicians) to decide on the appropriate line of management for the patient. The DSS was not only effective, but also cost‐effective in management of HTN. Future studies on DSS should be of a longer duration and look at assessing (1) the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing the number of MI and stroke cases and (2) cost utility of the DSS, which, when answered, would aid in deciding the scalability and replicability of DSS in similar LMIC settings.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: novel approaches and future outlooks [^d326074a]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Current Approaches and Challenges in the Diagnosis and Management of Primary Aldosteronism

Primary Aldosteronism: A Common but Under-recognized Cause of Hypertension

Hypertension is the single greatest cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, affecting > 1 billion adults worldwide and up to 30% of certain adult populations. While primary hypertension (where no clear cause is identified) accounts for the majority (70–85%) of cases, some 15% to 30% of patients have an identifiable endocrine or renal cause (secondary hypertension). Primary aldosteronism (PA) represents the commonest secondary cause of hypertension, with an estimated prevalence between 3.2% and 14% among primary care populations, increasing to 10% to 20% in the hospital outpatient setting. Significant challenges exist in screening and diagnosing PA and therefore current estimates of prevalence may be modest in the overall context of disease. Despite its commonality as a secondary cause of hypertension, PA has not been a key consideration in the design of over 40 randomized control trials which have investigated the management of hypertension over the past 30 years. Therefore, screening rates for PA remain low, clinical recognition is poor, and current hypertension guidelines do not emphasize the need to investigate for PA in patients presenting with hypertension to their primary care physicians or general internists.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^34b3b8c9]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, a group of primary care practices in the USA developed an algorithm for identifying patients at risk of hypertension from their electronic records. The innovation was successful and has now been implemented in these practices. It is easy to see how this type of innovation could be used in calculating rescreening intervals for patients and also follow-up times after BP treatment intensification.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^27d0708b]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The recommendation from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and accompanying organizationsto lower the blood pressure threshold for the diagnosis of hypertension in their clinical practice guideline (CPG) has been controversial, especially because adhering to such guidance would result in classifying nearly half the US population as unwell and subjecting them to treatment. Moreover, the diagnostic classifications and blood pressure thresholds deemed to be normal vary across CPGs.,

When independent groups have reviewed the same evidence, considered various key factors, such as values and preferences, and come to the same conclusions regarding a recommendation, the credibility of the recommendation is increased. This is comparable to research results in which the replication of findings by repeated experiments increases their credibility. However, when groups reach inconsistent conclusions about a recommendation, the inconsistency can create confusion. If combined with lack of clarity, inaccuracy, or poor alignment with the context of clinical practice, inconsistent recommendations have the potential for undesirable consequences, such as wasting resources and contributing to worse clinical outcomes.

Hypertension is the most common specific primary diagnosis for ambulatory care visits among adults in the United States, and more than 65 currently active CPGs are available worldwide for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. We sought to determine the consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension across prominent CPGs. In the absence of an existing method for such an evaluation, we developed a method to complete our study.

Research about CPGs is often conducted by CPG developers and methodologists, and interpretation may lack public and patient perspectives. We initially sought to involve patient and public representatives in our study, and their interests led to additional assessments of the CPGs for evidence of public and patient involvement, patient-facing information, and shared decision-making tools.

Description

In January 2020, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) approved a joint clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting.

Methods

The VA/DoD Evidence-Based Practice Work Group convened a joint VA/DoD guideline development effort that included a multidisciplinary panel of practicing clinician stakeholders and conformed to the Institute of Medicine's tenets for trustworthy clinical practice guidelines. The guideline panel developed key questions in collaboration with the ECRI Institute, which systematically searched and evaluated the literature from 15 December 2013 to 25 March 2019 and developed and rated recommendations by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

Recommendations

This synopsis summarizes key features of the guideline in several key areas: the measurement of blood pressure, the definition of hypertension, target treatment goals, and nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment of essential and resistant hypertension.

### Guidelines for hypertension management in primary care: is local adaptation possible? [^5cebd53e]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hypertension affects more than one billion people worldwide. There has been much discussion about clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) following the proposal of lower thresholds for starting pharmacological treatment. Some smaller groups or institutions could benefit from adapting CPGs to their local context, a process that requires high-quality CPGs with few points of conflict in their recommendations. To address this issue, we have compared high-quality hypertension CPGs and highlighted conflicting recommendations.

Methods

CPGs were searched in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, as well as specific websites. Only CPGs published between 2016 and 2019 were included. We defined CPGs as high-quality if the 'rigor of development' and 'editorial independence' AGREE II domains were scored at least 60%. We compared recommendations made by high-quality CPGs and highlighted areas of conflict (defined as disagreements between more than two CPGs).

Results

Nineteen CPGs were identified. The highest scoring domain was 'scope and purpose' (74.3%) and the lowest scoring was 'applicability' (40.0%). Eight CPGs were rated as high quality. Most CPG recommendations on the management of hypertension were consistent. Conflicting recommendations were regarding blood pressure (BP) levels to initiate pharmacotherapy and therapeutic goals, particularly in patients with low cardiovascular risk and older patients.

Conclusion

It is possible to adapt hypertension CPGs once high-quality documents have been identified with agreement between most recommendations. Guideline developers can focus on the adaption process and concentrate efforts on implementation.

Cardiovascular medicine has a sound evidence base upon which health professionals can base their interventions to modify risk among the British public. For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, however, while there is considerable evidence on what to do, data are limited on how the evidence should be implemented in practice. The challenge will be to learn by experience which interventions directed at reducing blood pressure and lipids levels work best in different settings. There is a need to structure care to identify individuals who are at risk. Current targets are explicit and achievable for both hypertension and lipids. Effective treatment is likely to require multiple drug treatment.

### Effect of intensive structured care on individual blood pressure targets in primary care: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^39efe055]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Future challenges

Despite noticeable reductions in blood pressure in both arms of the VIPER-BP study, a relatively small proportion of participants achieved these more stringent blood pressure targets; the classic target of ≤ 140/90 mm Hg being far more attainable. Given the intensity of the intervention and facilitated pathways to higher doses of combination antihypertensive treatment, these data highlight critical questions around the application of more stringent blood pressure targets in high risk people — that is, those with established cardiovascular disease or renal disease. The results are particularly relevant to clinicians when clinical guidelines and health policies seek to apply expert recommendations that may not be truly achievable. As such, these data may prompt a re-evaluation of blood pressure targets to reflect real world limitations for doctors managing hypertension in the busy and often complex primary care setting. The results also point to major patient related barriers to eviscerating blood pressure targets as even with best practice drug prescription and clinical support most participants still did not achieve the primary endpoint of blood pressure recommended by current guidelines. Most importantly, however, we have shown that a structured blood pressure management approach (computer assisted) results in higher blood pressure control rates in a primary care setting. As always, the challenge will be to implement this strategy into wider clinical practice by further analysing what did and did not work in this and other similar studies and how best to deliver pragmatic tools to facilitate the optimal management of blood pressure in the primary care setting.

Continual support for people with overweight or obesity is required to make a sustainable behavioural change and encourage healthy weight levels over the life course. The development of government-supported and industry-supported programmes, environment, facilities and infrastructure promoting healthy eating and weight reduction is paramount.

Clinical implications

Several important issues highlighted by this pragmatic study involving more than 250 general practitioners are relevant to clinical practice guidelines and health policy in Australia and other high income countries where hypertension remains a problem. Firstly, the initial application of standardised monotherapy (valsartan 80 mg/day) in a structured approach, irrespective of previous treatment, was immediately successful in controlling a large group of people with hypertension and should be considered when reviewing primary endpoint data. Given its size and direct relevance to other high income countries, the study is likely to influence future blood pressure guidelines, particularly informing debate around the attainment of lower blood pressure targets, whether these lower targets are truly achievable, and the role of prescription resistancein limiting what is meant by "truly achievable". Only a small proportion of participants in the most stringent blood pressure group achieved this target despite the intensive approach with three or more drugs applied in the intervention. Given the nature of the study, these data are likely to reflect real world blood pressure management, and any consideration of retaining more stringent blood pressure targets (particularly if low values are proved to be unnecessary in those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease) has to consider the impact of at least aiming for lower blood pressure to achieve values ≤ 140/90 mm Hg. Both an overall reluctance by general practitioners to prescribe higher doses of combination or triple treatment and individual patient factors seem to have prevented more participants from reaching their individual blood pressure target and the classic target of ≤ 140/90 mm Hg. It is worth highlighting that in the Australian healthcare system, subsidised drug treatment ensures that costs are not usually a barrier to the application of more aggressive treatment.

In hypertensive patients 65 years and over, we suggest a thiazide-type diuretic for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. We recommend against more than one of the following three drug classes together in the same patient: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin inhibitors. For the treatment of hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against initiating combination therapy over initiating monotherapy with the sequential addition of another medication.

### Case-based applications of the 2025 AHA / ACC / multispecialty high blood pressure guideline [^12c9db79]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects nearly half of all adults in the United States and is the leading, preventable cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and 11 other professional organizations recently published an updated 2025 guideline to reflect the latest advances in the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure. To bridge the gap between this guideline update and individualized patient care, this Special Article presents 4 hypothetical cases of high blood pressure, focusing on management in the outpatient setting. These cases illustrate how to apply a risk-based approach to high blood pressure management that incorporates blood pressure levels, cardiovascular disease risk factors and the predicting risk of cardiovascular disease events cardiovascular disease equations. They also highlight notable updates in the 2025 guideline such as recommendations for lifestyle approaches, initiation of medications, blood pressure goals, primary aldosteronism screening, and management of high blood pressure before, during and after pregnancy. By contextualizing the 2025 guideline within these hypothetical case scenarios, this Special Article provides practical guidance to health care teams to offer the most up-to-date, evidence-based care of high blood pressure.

### Clinicians' and patients' perspectives on hypertension care in a racially and ethnically diverse population in primary care [^e3e8a1b3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Hypertension control remains suboptimal, particularly for Black and Hispanic or Latino patients. A need exists to improve hypertension management and design effective strategies to efficiently improve the quality of care in primary care, especially for these at-risk populations. Few studies have specifically explored perspectives on blood pressure management by primary care providers (PCPs) and patients.

Objective

To examine clinician and patient perspectives on barriers and facilitators to hypertension control within a racially and ethnically diverse health care system.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This qualitative study was conducted in a large urban US health care system from October 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, among patients with a diagnosis of hypertension from a racially and ethnically diverse population, for a range of hypertension medication use hypertension control, as well as practicing PCPs. Analysis was conducted between June 2021 and February 2022 using immersion-crystallization methods.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Perspectives on managing blood pressure, including medication adherence and lifestyle, considerations for intensification, and experiences and gaps in using health information technology tools for hypertension, were explored using semistructured qualitative interviews. These cycles of review were continued until all data were examined and meaningful patterns were identified.

Results

Interviews were conducted with 30 participants: 15 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.6 [16.2] years; 10 women [67%] and 9 Black patients [60%]) and 15 clinicians (14 PCPs and 1 medical assistant; 8 women [53%]). Eleven patients (73%) had suboptimally controlled blood pressure. Participants reported a wide range of experiences with hypertension care, even within the same clinics and health care system. Five themes relevant to managing hypertension for racially and ethnically diverse patient populations in primary care were identified: (1) difficulty with self-management activities, especially lifestyle modifications; (2) hesitancy intensifying medications by both clinicians and patients; (3) varying the timing and follow-up after changes in medication; (4) variation in blood pressure self-monitoring recommendations and uptake; and (5) limited specific functionality of current health information technology tools.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this qualitative study of the views of PCPs and patients on hypertension control, the participants felt that more focus should be placed on lifestyle modifications than medications for hypertension, particularly for patients from racial and ethnic minority groups. Participants also expressed concerns about the existing functionality of health information technology tools to support increasingly asynchronous hypertension care. More intentional ways of supporting treatment intensification, self-care, and follow-up care are needed to improve hypertension management for racially and ethnically diverse populations in primary care.

Materials and Methods

Guideline Contributors

To develop the hypertension guidelines, the WHO established 4 groups:

An internal WHO Steering Group to coordinate the guideline development process.
A Guideline Development Group (GDG), composed of a diverse group of primary care and subspecialty physicians who were hypertension experts, pharmacists, nurses, health-oriented academics, a patient representative, and policymakers to review the evidence and develop recommendations. The WHO selected the members of the GDG based on relevant expertise but also considered appropriate representation by region and sex. An independent methodologist facilitated GDG deliberations.
An External Review Group, composed of technical experts, representatives of hypertension patient groups, and ministries of health from low-resource countries, to provide peer review of the guidelines.
An independent contracted systematic review group that conducted the overview of reviews and summarized evidence.

The guidelines were developed in accordance with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development. In brief, the WHO Steering Group, in collaboration with the Guideline Development Group, developed key questions and rated outcomes to identify those critical for the development of the guidelines. Conflicts of interest were handled in line with the current Compliance, Risk Management and Ethics policy and all members of the GDG were asked to fill in the standard WHO Declaration of Interest forms, which were reviewed. An overview of systematic reviews of the evidence were used to build summary of findings tables according to the Grading of recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. The Guideline Development Group developed recommendations, considering the certainty of the evidence, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, resource requirements and cost-effectiveness, health equity, acceptability, patient values and preferences, and feasibility.

Guideline Scope and Questions

Members of the WHO GDG developed an analytic framework that linked hypertension treatment to important health outcomes (Figure 1) in which 11 clinical questions were prioritized. The framework linked pharmacological treatments of hypertension to intermediate health outcomes and final health outcomes, as well as adverse events of testing. The GDG rated each outcome on a scale from 1 to 9 and indicated whether it considered each outcome critical (rated 7–9), important (rated 4–6) or not important (rated 1–3), for decision-making.

### AAFP issues new clinical practice guideline on hypertension… [^1a5f9dc6]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on its review, the AAFP strongly recommends that clinicians treat adults who have hypertension to a standard blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg to reduce the risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The AAFP also recommends that clinicians consider treating adults who have hypertension to a blood pressure target of less than 135/85 mm Hg to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, based on evidence showing a small additional benefit with this lower target. The guideline is the signature piece of the Academy's newly updated Hypertension Clinical Guidance and Practice Resources webpage, which features additional clinician resources, patient education materials and more. First, the AAFP recommends that clinicians treat adults with hypertension to a standard blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg to reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. This is a strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence.

While treating to a lower blood pressure target of less than 135/85 mm Hg may be considered based on patient preferences and values, the lower target does not provide additional benefit at preventing mortality. Second, the AAFP recommends that clinicians consider treating adults with hypertension to a lower blood pressure target of less than 135/85 mm Hg to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. This is considered a weak recommendation and is based on moderate-quality evidence. Although treating to a standard blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg reduced the risk of MI, there was a small additional benefit observed with a lower blood pressure target; however, there was no observed additional benefit in preventing stroke. Coles noted several key takeaways for FPs to consider when implementing the recommendations.

"High-quality evidence shows that treating adults with hypertension to a target blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg reduces the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, " she said. "Treating a lower blood pressure target does not provide any additional benefit to mortality or stroke risk. This holds true for adults with and without preexisting cardiovascular disease. "Because the potential benefit is small and there are increased risks, family physicians should use shared decision-making when considering treating to a lower blood pressure goal to reduce MIs. These discussions should include a patient's risk of MI, potential for increased harms for lower targets, costs, and patient values and preferences.

" While it is generally agreed that reducing morbidity and mortality and minimizing the risks of harms from medical intervention should be the goals of any hypertension treatment program, reaching agreement on the ideal blood pressure targets to treat hypertension has proved extremely challenging.

### Integrating a high blood pressure advisory across a primary care network… [^ffaa19e3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Design, Setting, and Participants This quality improvement study assessed hypertension control in patients presenting to primary care office visits from March 2018 to February 2020. Data were included from 28 primary care clinics in a single academic health system in California before and after intervention and concurrent care team observations and interviews assessing implementation. Data were analyzed from November 2019 to October 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was BP lower than 140 mm Hg systolic and lower than 90 mm Hg diastolic during an office visit within 6 months of an initial primary care visit. Secondary outcomes included BP recheck after initial elevated value, antihypertensive medication change, and new hypertension diagnoses. Qualitative outcomes focused on implementation barriers and facilitators.

This quality improvement study of an EMR high BP advisory intervention found significantly improved primary care hypertension control and diagnosis due to the combination of team-based care and technology. Hypertension is the second most common preventable risk factor for death from any cause. 1 Health care organizations should play a major role in addressing this condition, yet hypertension is often undiagnosed and undercontrolled in ambulatory care populations. 2, 3. Qualitative evaluation included ethnographic site visits, interviews, and an open-ended questionnaire assessing implementation, conducted by 2 trained qualitative researchers at 6 clinics. Our study focused on 2 populations. The population for the primary objective was composed of patients with a preexisting diagnosis of hypertension in 8 clinics with a primary care office visit during the study period.

Preexisting hypertension was defined by EMR International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes entered in visit diagnoses or antihypertensive medication record in the year before the first primary care visit during the study period. Figure 2 compares hypertension control in each cohort over time. The likelihood of hypertension control increased by 18. 3% per month on average in the intervention vs control cohort. Compared with baseline, modeled rates of hypertension control at 6 months increased from 82. 3% to
92. 3% for the intervention cohort vs a slight drop from 71. 5% to
70. 3% for the control cohort.

Hypertension is the most commonly encountered chronic medical condition in primary care and one of the most significant modifiable cardiovascular risk factors for women and men. Timely diagnosis and evidence-based management offer an important opportunity to reduce the risk of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, including cardiovascular events, end-stage renal disease, and heart failure. Clinical trials have shown significant improvements in patient-oriented outcomes when hypertension is well-controlled, yet many hypertensive patients remain undiagnosed, uncontrolled, or managed with inappropriate pharmacotherapy. This article discusses the initial diagnosis, evaluation, and management of hypertension in nonpregnant women, with topics for obstetrician-gynecologists and women's health providers.

### Development of quality indicators for hypertension management at the primary health care level in South Africa [^14ba6592]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Quality indicators measure whether the evidence-based guidelines regarding the current management of hypertension are being implemented and can provide data to monitor the achievement of programme outcomes. However, currently in South Africa there is no agreed minimum set of indicators to assess the quality of care and to monitor progress towards attainment of the hypertension objectives set out in these initiatives. Developing and testing quality indicators as part of a multiple approach is key to strengthening health programmes and enhancing the quality and efficiency of clinical services. This has implications not only for the management of hypertension in South Africa but also across Africa, given current concerns. Consequently, the aim of this study was to develop evidence-based quality indicators for hypertension management and monitoring at the PHC level for South Africa.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^a4680c5c]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a clinical decision support system in managing hypertension in resource constrained primary health care settings: results from a cluster randomized trial [^72e014c5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Decision support systems (DSS) have been defined as tools that help clinicians decide on a course of action in response to an understanding of the patient's status. Recent studies from the developed world report that DSS provide an effective means to improve the physician performance. – An improvement in quality of antihypertensive treatment, concurrently leading to a considerable reduction in drug costs, has also been shown for DSS. Randomized control trials from the developed world report that DSS provide an effective means to improve the management of hypertension (HTN).– However, evidence from developing countries in this regard is rather limited. An increasing penetration of information technology in noncommunicable diseases health domain in India, – and a shortage of primary health care workforce conversant with guideline‐based clinical management, are opportune reasons to find answers for a pertinent question: Are DSS effective in managing hypertension in resource constrained primary health center (PHC) settings?

Systematic reviews on DSS, as an intervention, report a paucity of studies on patient outcomes for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Western world.– The potential role of DSS for the management of blood pressure (BP) among low‐ and middle‐income countries remains unclear. In a resource‐constrained setting such as a PHC, the implementation of a DSS intervention should test not only the physician performance, but also on related patient outcomes. Individual randomization dilutes the intervention effect size owing to contamination between individuals. Diffuse and complex interventions such as DSS (having information technology inputs) need cluster randomization. Moreover, coefficient of variation (CV) between PHC clusters can only be accounted for by analyzing cluster‐level data. Hence, we performed a cluster randomized trial that aimed to test the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of DSS for BP management among Indian hypertensive patients.

As well, our interviews with Indonesian key stakeholders in primary care also emphasise a need for further considerations when developing HDP management pathways for Indonesian primary care. Public primary care clinics (Puskesmas/ Pusat Kesehatan Masyarakat) in Indonesia have to undertake maternal surveillance and maternal audit processes in the community in addition to provide individual patient treatment. There are also community health workers (cadres) involved in the maternal health activities, but their job description in the current Indonesian guidelines remains unclear. Therefore, suggestions arising from the interviews also need to be further explored for their use in the HDP pathways. This research then aims to establish experts' consensus on the identified 125 international and local HDP management recommendations to develop HDP management pathways for Indonesian primary health care settings.

### Implementation of the 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of hypertension in primary care: the HYPEDIA study [^eb12cb50]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

When interpreting the findings of the current study it should be taken into consideration that BP was assessed in single office visit and out-of-office BP was not evaluated. Yet, in real life general practice, office BP measurements, usually under poorly defined conditions, may constitute the sole BP assessment method for many hypertensives considering the lack of time and resources in primary care. In addition, the doctors might have been influenced by (i) their participation in the study, which may have improved their compliance to the guidelines, and (ii) the fact that they were forced to take triplicate BP measurements (automated measurements with validated device and online storage) which may lead to more standardized office BP assessment compared to the usual care measurements. However, the study findings suggesting physician inertia indicate that the true behavior of physicians in clinical practice has been revealed to a large extent.

In conclusion, renin-angiotensin system blocker-based therapy, mainly ARBs, constitutes the basis of antihypertensive drug treatment in the vast majority of patients in primary care, with single-pill combinations being widely used. In almost half of treated uncontrolled hypertensives treatment was not intensified (physician inertia), suggesting suboptimal implementation of the 2018 ESC/ESH goals in primary care. These findings support the need of reinforcing information and education strategies for primary care doctors so as to perform standardized BP measurements, detect hypertensive patients of high cardiovascular risk and implement early, more intense and simplified therapy through wider use of double and triple fixed-dose combinations, in line with the recommendations. Thus, it is highly important that both doctors and patients are informed about the evidence-based safety and benefits of the antihypertensive treatment strategy according to current guidelines, the need of accurate diagnosis, and the importance of achieving optimal control of BP in terms of more efficient cardiovascular disease prevention.

Summary Table

What is known about the topic

Previous studies have confirmed poor control rates of treated hypertension in primary care worldwide.
2018 ESH/ESC guidelines for the management of hypertension recommended a stepwise treatment algorithm with the use of single-pill combinations and stricter blood pressure targets than previous guidelines.

What this study adds

In a large sample of hypertensive patients in primary care the implementation of the 2018 ESH/ESC guidelines for the management of hypertension was found to be suboptimal.
Initial drug monotherapy, instead of drug combination, was decided for a considerable proportion of newly treated hypertensives.
In almost half of treated uncontrolled hypertensives, treatment was not intensified, suggesting physician inertia.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^ee782d1c]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Hypertension is very common, but guideline recommendations for hypertension have been controversial, are of increasing interest, and have profound implications.

Objective

To systematically assess the consistency of recommendations regarding hypertension management across clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study of hypertension management recommendations included CPGs that had been published as of April 2018. Two point-of-care resources that provided graded recommendations were included for secondary analyses. Discrete and unambiguous specifications of the population, intervention, and comparison states were used to define a series of reference recommendations. Three raters reached consensus on coding the direction and strength of each recommendation made by each CPG. Three independent raters reached consensus on the importance of each reference recommendation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were rates of consistency for direction and strength among CPGs. Sensitivity analyses testing the robustness were conducted by excluding recommendation statements that were described as insufficient evidence, excluding single recommendation sources, and stratifying by importance of recommendations.

Results

The analysis included 8 CPGs with a total of 71 reference recommendations, 68 of which had clear recommendations from 2 or more CPGs. Across CPGs, 22 recommendations (32%) were consistent in direction and strength, 18 recommendations (27%) were consistent in direction but inconsistent in strength, and 28 recommendations (41%) were inconsistent in direction. The rate of consistency was lower in secondary analyses. When insufficient evidence ratings were excluded, there was still substantial inconsistency, and a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis suggested the inconsistency could not be attributed to any single recommendation source. Inconsistency in direction was more common for recommendations deemed to be of lower importance (11 of 20 recommendations [55%]), but 17 of 48 high-importance recommendations (35%) had inconsistency in direction.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypertension is a common chronic condition with widespread expectations surrounding guideline-based care, yet CPGs have a high rate of inconsistency. Further investigations should determine the reasons for inconsistency, the implications for recommendation development, and the role of synthesis across recommendations for optimal guidance of clinical care.

ARB angiotensin receptor blockers, ACEi angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, CCB calcium channel blockers.

In 329 untreated patients aged < 80 years with systolic BP ≥ 150 mmHg, treatment was initiated with drug monotherapy in 32%, two-drug combination in 50%, and three drugs in 18%.

In 2350 treated hypertensives (75% of the overall population), mean systolic/diastolic BP was 140.2 ± 19.1/82.1 ± 11.8 mmHg. Mean duration of hypertension since initial diagnosis was 8.6 ± 6.9 years and treatment included on average 2.0 ± 0.9 antihypertensive drugs. Main drug classes administered in these patients were ARB monotherapy 18%, ARB/CCB 15%, ARB/thiazide 12%, ARB/CCB/thiazide 12%, ACEi monotherapy 7%, ACEi/CCB 4%, ACEi/thiazide (or thiazide-like) 3%, ACEi/CCB/thiazide-like 2%, CCB monotherapy 5%, beta-blocker monotherapy 4%, and other choices 18%. Single pill combinations were used in 85% of patients receiving combination therapy.

Among treated hypertensives aged < 65 years (N = 977), 79% had BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg (systolic and/or diastolic), whereas among those aged ≥ 65 years (N = 1373) 66% had BP ≥ 140/80 mmHg (Fig. 2). Treatment modification (dose increase, drug addition, use of fixed combinations, switch of drug to another within the same or other class) was decided in 53% of the treated hypertensives aged < 65 years with BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg, and in 62% of those ≥ 65 years with BP ≥ 140/80 mmHg. There were no significant differences in the types of treatment decisions per care of setting (primary care versus hospital centers).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^068a8352]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hypertension guideline — pharmacist-led medication management: We recommend offering pharmacist-led medication management as an option for patients with hypertension (Strong for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Evidence includes an SR of seven RCTs in which pharmacist-led care significantly increased the proportion achieving goal blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg versus usual care over a median period of 39 weeks (risk ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.24–1.70), with care provided either in person, remotely, or a combination and some studies granting prescriptive authority. An SR including 39 RCTs in over 14,000 patients found pharmacist-led interventions resulted in significantly greater improvements in SBP (-8.5 mm Hg) and DBP (-4.6 mm Hg) over the mean follow-up period of eight months. Interventions are not required to be face-to-face to show benefit; a trial of home blood pressure telemonitoring and pharmacist management reported that improvements persisted after 12 months. In barbershop-based care for African American men, significant and sustained reductions in mean SBP of approximately 20 mm Hg and mean DBP approaching 19 mm Hg were seen after 12 months in over 300 hypertensive patients versus control.

### Adult hypertension referral pathway and therapeutic management: British and Irish hypertension society position statement [^e25e8953]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, most adults with hypertension are managed in Primary Care. National and international guidelines advise that adult referrals to Secondary Care Hypertension Specialists are targeted at patients in whom further investigations are likely to change management decisions. Referrals are recommended when patients have raised blood pressure with life threatening target-organ damage (i.e. emergency/same day referrals); or when patients have, for example, suspected secondary hypertension, resistant hypertension, or complex polypharmacy (i.e. routine referrals).

In this statement, the British and Irish Hypertension Society (BIHS) summarise their recommendations for adult emergency and routine referrals to Secondary Care Hypertension Specialists and highlight where this advice is supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and/or International Societies (Tables 1 and 2). Table 3 summarises the ideal information to accompany referrals to facilitate communication between Primary and Secondary Care services. Where there are long waiting times to access routine Secondary Care hypertension services, the BIHS offer additional therapeutic advice to optimise patient management whilst awaiting specialist review (Fig. 1). Finally, the challenges facing referrers in identifying a Hypertension Specialist in the UK are discussed.

### Effect of intensive structured care on individual blood pressure targets in primary care: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^48b5330d]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Supporting the evidence in favour of structured primary care

Consistent with data from other countries such as the United States, we have strong evidence from community based studies, preliminary data from the pilot stages of the VIPER-BP study, and data from the usual care group, that present approaches to the management of hypertension have meant that the "rule of halves" still applies — that is, close to 50% of those treated for hypertension in primary care remain hypertensive. Regardless of recent suggestions that lower blood pressure targets in high risk people should be reassessed, there is still clear evidence from population cohortsand meta-analyses of clinical trial datathat lowering blood pressure (even by the modest, incremental margins associated with more intensive management) will noticeably attenuate the rates of stroke and other cardiovascular disease. In support of a more aggressive approach to the management of hypertension, retrospective results from both the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation trialand Avoiding Cardiovascular Events in Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Hypertensiontrial suggest there are advantages to achieving early blood pressure control and that application of combination treatments are more likely to achieve this goal. The intervention in the current study brought all these elements together, with more than double (81% v 40%) the proportion of intervention participants receiving combination therapy compared with monotherapy at 26 weeks. To our knowledge this study (incorporating a combined drug and disease management approach to the management of blood pressure facilitated by a standardised computer support program) is one of the largest studies of its kind. Although there have been several large hypertension trials with a major focus on the efficacy of different combinations of drug treatmentand specific studies of algorithm based strategies, there are few large scale, multicentre studies that have specifically compared a structured and intensive care approach with usual care in achieving better blood pressure control based on more stringent risk based targets in patients with persistent hypertension managed in primary care. The results of the present study therefore strengthen the conclusions of a recently updated Cochrane review recommending a stepped and intensive approach to the management of hypertension in primary care; particularly in those participants who remain hypertensive despite initial treatment. In particular, the results complement the findings of a similarly large scale (cluster randomised design) Canadian studyof a simplified treatment algorithm in primary care that showed a 12% absolute difference (65% v 53%) in favour of the study intervention. Notable differences were the low proportion of participants requiring more stringent blood pressure targets (about 15%) and the lack of initial standardised care that in the present study resulted in almost one in five participants achieving early blood pressure control during the study run-in phase. Thus our randomised cohort represented a more "challenging" group of patients with hypertension. It could be argued that we have now reached a similar stage of developing the evidence in favour of more structured care (that is, beyond a purely drug related approach) to optimise blood pressure management in primary care to that of heart failure management programmes; where head to head trials of different forms of structured care are being undertakento refine (rather than to establish) a new level of best clinical practice.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^60d930f5]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Box.
Criteria for Classification of Recommendations

We found inconsistent guidance for a disconcertingly high proportion of reference recommendations. This suggests that clinicians evaluating and treating hypertension are often faced with impossible expectations, in that following one guideline's recommendations would mean going against recommendations from another guideline.

Regardless of measures taken to improve CPG development, a high degree of consistency and strong guidance may be unrealistic in hypertension management. The direct evidence for precise actions is often limited, the thresholds for action are often more continuous than binary, and the relative importance of benefits and harms is sensitive to an individual patient's values and preferences.

### Shared care across the interface between primary and specialty care in management of long term conditions [^c73109bd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Shared care has been used in the management of many chronic conditions with the assumption that it delivers better care than primary or specialty care alone; however, little is known about the effectiveness of shared care.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of shared care health service interventions designed to improve the management of chronic disease across the primary/specialty care interface. This is an update of a previously published review. Secondary questions include the following:1. Which shared care interventions or portions of shared care interventions are most effective?2. What do the most effective systems have in common?

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library to 12 October 2015.

Selection Criteria

One review author performed the initial abstract screen; then two review authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion. We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series analyses (ITS) evaluating the effectiveness of shared care interventions for people with chronic conditions in primary care and community settings. The intervention was compared with usual care in that setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies, evaluated study quality and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We conducted a meta-analysis of results when possible and carried out a narrative synthesis of the remainder of the results. We presented the results in a 'Summary of findings' table, using a tabular format to show effect sizes for all outcome types.

Main Results

We identified 42 studies of shared care interventions for chronic disease management (N = 18,859), 39 of which were RCTs, two CBAs and one an NRCT. Of these 42 studies, 41 examined complex multi-faceted interventions and lasted from six to 24 months. Overall, our confidence in results regarding the effectiveness of interventions ranged from moderate to high certainty. Results showed probably few or no differences in clinical outcomes overall with a tendency towards improved blood pressure management in the small number of studies on shared care for hypertension, chronic kidney disease and stroke (mean difference (MD) 3.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68 to 5.25)(based on moderate-certainty evidence). Mental health outcomes improved, particularly in response to depression treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.62; six studies, N = 1708) and recovery from depression (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.57 to 4.26; 10 studies, N = 4482) in studies examining the 'stepped care' design of shared care interventions (based on high-certainty evidence). Investigators noted modest effects on mean depression scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.29, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.20; six studies, N = 3250). Differences in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), processes of care and participation and default rates in shared care services were probably limited (based on moderate-certainty evidence). Studies probably showed little or no difference in hospital admissions, service utilisation and patient health behaviours (with evidence of moderate certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggests that shared care improves depression outcomes and probably has mixed or limited effects on other outcomes. Methodological shortcomings, particularly inadequate length of follow-up, may account in part for these limited effects. Review findings support the growing evidence base for shared care in the management of depression, particularly stepped care models of shared care. Shared care interventions for other conditions should be developed within research settings, with account taken of the complexity of such interventions and awareness of the need to carry out longer studies to test effectiveness and sustainability over time.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has several important strengths.

Blending within existing clinical work flow: We followed the SAGE (Standards‐Based Sharable Active Guideline Environment) consortium project recommendations by developing a DSS that has "a complex clinical guideline as a series of recommendation sets". Furthermore, we followed the SAGE guidelines model, which suggests that DSS must seamlessly blend within the clinical work flow nonobtrusively and allow for easy inspection of the underlying clinical logic, by having "info" buttons displaying the logic behind the recommendations.

Stakeholder involvement in DSS development process: A validated and pilot‐tested DSS was developed in resource‐constrained settings after extensive consultations and focus group discussions with all stakeholders involved.

Reporting on patient outcomes: Computerised clinical DSS (CCDSS) have reported an improvement in physician performance and in quality of care given for patients, when CCDSS were deployed in developed countries. Ours is the first study that has documented an improvement in patient‐related outcomes for managing HTN at a primary health care level in low‐ and middle‐income country settings (LMICs).

Multicomponent intervention with concurrent advice to physicians and patients in institutional settings: A recent review reported that system‐initiated CCDSS in institutional settings performed better than ambulatory settings. Our DSS‐HTN has been set up in PHCs, which are the first gateway for institutional health care provider services in India. Adding a multicomponent intervention (clinical guidelines for the physician and lifestyle counseling for the patients) has yielded a comprehensive risk management strategy, thereby making our DSS‐HTN an effective tool for management of CVDs among hypertensive patients. In a recent decision maker/research partnership systematic review on CCDSS, transparent documentation of steps to clearly mention the design of the system, context in which CCDSS are deployed, implementation process, costing involved, user satisfaction, and impact on workflow patterns have been stated as key factors that ensure success in development and implementation of DSS. Our study has taken care to carefully delineate the above‐mentioned key factors.
