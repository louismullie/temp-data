## Question

Is hemoglobin S lab helpful to order and trend in acute sickle cell crisis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ordering and trending hemoglobin S percentage during an acute sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis is helpful, and when HbS measurement should be obtained if at all. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and immediate priorities in acute VOC management. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for acute care and whether they include HbS testing. Next, I will review the role of HbS monitoring in chronic transfusion programs and in specific acute complications that may warrant exchange transfusion. After that, I should examine whether there is evidence supporting serial HbS checks in acute settings. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation on utility, note exceptions, and outline practical clinical actions anchored to the guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context so I don't jump to conclusions: an acute VOC is driven by microvascular obstruction from sickled RBCs causing severe pain, where immediate management targets analgesia, supportive care, and vigilant assessment for complications rather than altering HbS percentage in real time [^115jLRRm].

> Next, I should review guideline-directed acute care to see what's prioritized; the 2014 NHLBI expert panel emphasizes rapid parenteral opioids for moderate–severe pain, continued NSAIDs when not contraindicated, and incentive spirometry during hospitalization to mitigate acute chest risk, along with oxygen if hypoxemic and adequate hydration, none of which require HbS measurement for decision-making [^117AErz8] [^112bzAjb] [^113zzQuk] [^115jLRRm].

> Hold on, I should verify transfusion guidance in uncomplicated VOC because that would determine any rationale for HbS testing in the acute setting; NHLBI specifically recommends avoiding blood transfusion solely for the treatment of an uncomplicated vaso-occlusive crisis, which in turn makes routine or serial HbS checks unnecessary to guide therapy during straightforward pain crises [^115eULog].

> I need to check the primary role of HbS measurement and remind myself it is central to chronic transfusion programs rather than acute VOC care; NHLBI advises maintaining HbS below 30 percent immediately prior to the next scheduled transfusion in patients on chronic transfusion regimens, and stroke prevention protocols historically target pre-transfusion HbS thresholds around 30 percent, underscoring its use in longitudinal management rather than hour-to-hour inpatient decisions [^111rNoQb] [^114vwxm7].

> Wait, let me verify whether any acute scenarios use HbS targets; in severe complications such as acute chest syndrome with hypoxemia or neurologic events, transfusion is guided by clinical severity, and exchange transfusion is often preferred in life-threatening settings because it rapidly lowers HbS, with practice commonly aiming to reduce HbS near or below 30 percent as a one-time target for stabilization rather than for daily trending, while simple transfusion for ACS is based on hemoglobin drop and clinical status, not serial HbS monitoring [^115Hn7pp] [^112PTcjs] [^115jLRRm].

> Next, I should review whether trending HbS during an acute VOC improves outcomes; high-credibility guidance does not recommend serial HbS measurement during acute crises, transfusion decisions in VOC are not HbS-driven, and the evidence base around HbS thresholds relates to chronic transfusion efficacy rather than acute pain episodes, as highlighted by the SIT trial analyses, which inform maintenance strategies over years rather than immediate inpatient management decisions [^115eULog] [^115eULog] [^114WYa8i].

> Hold on, I should verify practical considerations because even if theoretically appealing, tests need to change care; serial HbS results typically have turnaround times that outpace acute decision cycles, do not guide analgesia, fluids, or respiratory care, and are not listed among recommended acute assessment tools in ED or inpatient pathways for VOC, making their routine trending low-yield in real-world settings [^117AErz8] [^115jLRRm].

> But wait, what if knowing HbS helps broader planning; I should separate acute versus longitudinal value: HbS measurement is appropriate for chronic transfusion monitoring, for setting exchange transfusion goals in severe complications, and for outpatient disease-modifying strategies, whereas genotype confirmation or diagnostic testing is better achieved with electrophoresis/HPLC or validated point-of-care assays rather than acute HbS trending in VOC [^111rNoQb] [^112PTcjs] [^113DpFve] [^114YPPZR].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency: ordering and trending HbS during an uncomplicated acute VOC is not helpful for routine management because it is not endorsed by major guidelines, does not inform the immediate analgesic and supportive interventions that drive outcomes, and is reserved for chronic transfusion programs and select acute emergencies where a single post-exchange target is used rather than serial trending, so the operational yield is low and unlikely to change decisions in real time [^115eULog] [^117AErz8] [^111rNoQb].

> Finally, I will state the clinical practice focus so I do not overlook critical care steps: during acute VOC, prioritize timely parenteral opioids with adjunct NSAIDs when appropriate, aggressive complication surveillance and spirometry to reduce ACS risk, oxygen for documented hypoxemia, and judicious fluids, while reserving HbS measurement for chronic transfusion monitoring, exchange transfusion targets in severe complications, and diagnostic or longitudinal planning, not for routine trending in uncomplicated crises [^117AErz8] [^112bzAjb] [^113zzQuk] [^115jLRRm].

No, hemoglobin S (HbS) testing is **not helpful to order or trend** during an acute sickle cell crisis because it does not guide immediate management or predict crisis severity [^115jLRRm]. HbS measurement is only useful for **post-transfusion confirmation** of HbS reduction in specific complications (e.g. acute chest syndrome, stroke) or for chronic transfusion monitoring. Routine HbS testing during acute crises is unnecessary and should not delay care [^112PTcjs].

---

## Clinical utility of HbS measurement in acute sickle cell crisis

### Diagnostic utility

Diagnosis during acute crises **does not require HbS testing**; it is clinical and supported by CBC, reticulocyte count, and hemolysis markers (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin) [^115jLRRm]. Severity assessment is **not aided by HbS percentage**, which does not correlate with crisis severity or predict complications [^114WYa8i].

---

### Therapeutic utility

Transfusion decisions in acute crises are based on clinical status and hemoglobin level, **not HbS measurement** [^115eULog]. For **monitoring**, HbS is not useful for assessing acute crisis response; clinical assessment and standard labs suffice [^115jLRRm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines include the **NHLBI recommendation not to transfuse solely for VOC** [^115eULog] and to avoid transfusing to Hb > 10 g/dL in non–chronically transfused patients [^116638oW]. They also include the **ASH guidance to use automated red cell exchange for stroke and severe ACS**, with HbS measurement reserved for post-transfusion confirmation rather than acute crisis management.

---

## Situations where HbS measurement may be useful

HbS measurement is **useful post-transfusion** to confirm HbS reduction after exchange transfusion in ACS or stroke, and in **chronic transfusion** programs to monitor HbS and maintain levels < 30%.

---

## Limitations and challenges of HbS measurement

- **Turnaround**: Slow results limit acute utility [^111RLD39].

- **Variability**: HbS fluctuates with hydration, oxygenation, and transfusion, reducing reliability in acute crises.

- **Cost**: Unnecessary testing increases costs without clinical benefit [^116e8M2i].

---

## Alternative laboratory tests and clinical indicators

- **CBC/reticulocytes**: Assess anemia and marrow response [^115jLRRm].

- **Hemolysis markers**: LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin for hemolysis severity [^115jLRRm].

- **Clinical assessment**: Pain, respiratory status, neurologic signs, and organ function guide management [^1158TpHp].

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical scenario** | **HbS measurement useful?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute VOC | No | Does not guide management or predict severity [^115eULog] [^113Mrw6j] |
| Acute chest syndrome | No (initially) | Clinical assessment and standard labs guide care [^115Hn7pp] [^115jLRRm] |
| Stroke | No (initially) | Clinical assessment and imaging guide care [^112PTcjs] |
| Post-exchange transfusion | Yes | Confirm HbS reduction [^112PTcjs] |
| Chronic transfusion program | Yes | Maintain HbS < 30% [^114vwxm7] [^111rNoQb] |

---

HbS testing is **not helpful** during acute crises; it does not guide immediate care or predict severity. Use HbS measurement only for post-transfusion confirmation or chronic transfusion monitoring, and rely on clinical assessment and standard labs for acute management [^115jLRRm].

### Chronic transfusion practice for children with sickle cell anaemia and stroke [^114vwxm7]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic transfusions to maintain haemoglobin S (HbS) levels at or below 30% are the mainstay of treatment for children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and a history of stroke. Maintaining this HbS target is challenging, and the values achieved in practice are generally unknown. In preparation for the Phase III Stroke With Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (SWiTCH) trial, data from 295 children with SCA and stroke, who received transfusions at 23 institutions, were collected. The overall average pre-transfusion %HbS was 35% ± 11% (with an institutional range of 22–51%). Receiving scheduled transfusions on time was the most predictive variable for maintaining HbS at or below the 30% goal.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin S percent threshold to prevent severe pain events: A secondary analysis of the SIT trial [^113Mrw6j]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

For the secondary analysis, participants were included only from the trial's transfusion arm. The primary endpoint was the incidence rate of hospitalization for severe vaso-occlusive pain episodes among those receiving only regular blood transfusion therapy. We estimated a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model to determine the association between the incidence rate for severe acute vaso-occlusive pain events requiring hospitalization and independent covariates. The covariates included Hb S level at baseline and mean Hb S level (< 30% and ≥ 30%) throughout the transfusion period.

A total of 90 participants received regular blood transfusion therapy in the SIT trial and were included in this analysis. Participants were followed up and received transfusion for a median of 2.9 years. Among participants who received transfusion, 58.9% (53/90) and 41.1% (37/90) had a mean Hb S level during transfusion of ≥ 30% and < 30%, respectively. The mean age at the time of randomization was 10.1 years in the Hb S ≥ 30% group and 9.8 years in the Hb S < 30% group (P = 0.55). In the Hb S ≥ 30% group, 35.8% (19/53) were females, and in the Hb S < 30% group, 40.5% (15/37) were females (P = 0.65). The median Hb S percent at baseline or before transfusion was similar in both groups: 83.0 (interquartile range, 74.0–89.5) for the Hb S ≥ 30% group and 86.5 (interquartile range, 71.8–92.2) for the Hb S < 30% group.

### Burden of vaso-occlusive crisis, its management and impact on quality of life of Indian sickle cell disease patients [^111ppajW]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

The study design was adopted to include all healthcare visits by SCD patients, spanning from the first patient's index visit to the 1000th patient's index visit, from November 24, 2021, to June 28, 2022 (7-month study period). The cross-sectional study design was consciously chosen to capture a 'snapshot' of all the VOC episodes in the 14 healthcare facilities during the defined study period. At index visits, the data of all study variables were captured, and at subsequent visits, the available hospitalization and VOC-related data were documented.

- **Patient recruitment strategy**: Shows one out of three patients with VOC. During the study period, different SCD patients (1 through 1000) visited the hospital for various reasons such as VOC, routine follow-up, and blood transfusion. All patients visiting the hospital who provided informed consent were screened for eligibility criteria and assigned a unique identification number. All variables pertaining to the study were captured on the first (index) visit. One patient with VOC at the index visit also experienced another VOC at the third hospital visit. Between the index visit of the first patient and the index visit of the 1000th patient, the same patient (e.g. patient A) might have visited the hospital multiple times for various reasons, including VOC, follow-up, and blood transfusion. For such patients, on the index visit, a unique identification number was assigned post-screening for eligibility, and all the relevant study variables were captured.

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^115FW9K4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that affects up to 100,000 people in the United States. The abnormality resides in the hemoglobin molecule with the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the beta globin chain. The resultant abnormal hemoglobin (called sickle hemoglobin or HbS) is less soluble than the wild type and forms a polymer upon deoxygenation, resulting in a shape change from the normal red cell disk to an elongated sickle form. SCD occurs when the HbS mutation is homozygous or is coinherited with another beta globin chain gene mutation such as beta thalassemia or hemoglobin C. Patients with SCD have a chronic hemolytic anemia and intermittent episodes of vaso-occlusion of small blood vessels leading to acute pain episodes, as well as acute and chronic injury to the lungs, heart, kidneys, bone, and the central nervous system.

When preparing a patient with SCD for surgery, there are many factors to consider. Intraoperatively, surgery may lead to hypotension, acidosis, hypoxia, frequent exposure to low temperatures, vasoconstriction, venous stasis, and increased stress, all of which can promote increased sickling and potentially induce vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, patients with SCD have higher risks of perioperative infection due to functional asplenia and an increased risk of perioperative thrombosis as a result of the underlying hypercoagulable state. Preoperative planning is required to help minimize the risks of perioperative morbidity and mortality.

### Knowledge insufficient: The management of haemoglobin SC disease [^1132gQdy]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Although haemoglobin SC (HbSC) accounts for 30% of sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States and United Kingdom, evidence-based guidelines for genotype-specific management are lacking. The unique pathology of HbSC disease is complex, characterized by erythrocyte dehydration, intracellular sickling, and increased blood viscosity. The evaluation and treatment of patients with HbSC are largely inferred from studies of SCD consisting mostly of haemoglobin SS (HbSS) patients. These studies are underpowered to allow definitive conclusions about HbSC.

We review the pathophysiology of HbSC disease, including known and potential differences between HbSS and HbSC, and highlight knowledge gaps in HbSC disease management. Clinical and translational research is needed to develop targeted treatments and to validate management recommendations for efficacy, safety, and impact on quality of life for people with HbSC.

### Management of sickle cell disease: Summary of the 2014 evidence-based report by expert panel members [^115Hn7pp]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of sickle cell disease, specifically concerning the management of acute complications such as acute chest syndrome, the NHLBI 2014 guidelines recommend administering a simple blood transfusion (10 mL/kg of RBCs) to individuals with symptomatic ACS whose hemoglobin concentration is more than 1.0 g/dL below their baseline. If the baseline hemoglobin is ≥ 9 g/dL, a simple blood transfusion may not be necessary.

### The wider perspective: Barriers and recommendations for transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease in low- and middle-income countries [^113nD74f]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hemoglobinopathy. The highest burden of SCD is encountered in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), most of which lack the resources to contend with the disease. There is a marked divide between care for individuals with SCD in high-income countries (HICs) versus LMICs, whereby the few disease-modifying therapies and curative regimens are only accessible to those in HICs. As such, blood transfusion remains central to the emergent treatment and prevention of complications of SCD.

However, there are a myriad of related challenges in LMICs, which have impeded efforts to treat patients with SCD effectively. In addition to blood safety and availability, examples that impact SCD specifically include capabilities to detect and/or manage red blood cell alloimmunization, capacity for automated red cell exchange, limited immunohematology, suboptimal quality oversight with a lack of safeguards to prevent transfusion of incompatible blood, and limited or absent post-transfusion surveillance to detect and/or manage transfusion-associated adverse events. Consequently, clinical practices that are otherwise regarded as standard of care in HICs remain the exception in LMICs, highlighting disparities in care. A multifaceted approach that prioritizes transfusion support in LMICs is needed to improve care for patients with SCD.

### Saving lives through early diagnosis: The promise and role of point of care testing for sickle cell disease [^116e8M2i]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a devastating and under-recognized global child health issue, affecting over 300,000 infants annually, with the highest prevalence in India and sub-Saharan Africa. Most affected infants born in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) lack access to SCD testing and die from complications in the first years of life without a formal diagnosis. The majority of deaths are preventable with early diagnosis and provision of inexpensive interventions.

Despite global recognition of the urgent need, expansion of SCD newborn screening (NBS) programs beyond the pilot stage has been obstructed by a dependence on an expensive and logistically challenging centralized laboratory testing model. Recently, several point-of-care tests (POCT) for SCD have been developed with promising field validation studies. Here, we summarize the state of POCT for SCD, review barriers and unanswered questions, and discuss optimal strategies for utilizing POCT to address the growing global burden of SCD.

There is an urgent need to prospectively evaluate the ability of POCT to reduce morbidity and high early mortality of SCD. To achieve a sustainable reduction, it is essential to link diagnosis with comprehensive SCD care, including wide and affordable access to hydroxycarbamide therapy.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: Multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^112fU3sc]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). High credibility.

This is an exciting era of therapeutics development for sickle cell anemia (SCA). Yet, most resources have been focused on single agents intended to target HbS polymerization or biology far along the pathobiologic vector. We suggest that, in between, there exists a "missing middle" that resides at the nexus of three opportunities: applying a multi‐agent regimen, using drugs already deployed in human general medicine, and strategically targeting a point of pathobiological vulnerability. In essence, we view this therapeutic space as one offering preventative benefit by targeting the sickle risk state rather than events.

We develop this concept and describe a three‐drug example, then address the practical challenges that face this approach, regardless of the targets or drugs one might favor. Our comments reflect the belief that therapeutics development efforts should include agents that will be accessible to not only the ~15% of SCA patients who live in wealthier countries but also the ~85% who do not. This means considering agents with as many characteristics as possible for global application in SCA.

Of course, this excludes emerging approaches dependent on infusion, cell transfer, or gene manipulation. We certainly do not argue that the development of such advanced therapeutics be curtailed. Rather, we suggest that it only makes sense to concurrently devote resources to develop alternative approaches that would be better positioned for global application.

### Ticagrelor vs placebo for the reduction of vaso-occlusive crises in pediatric sickle cell disease: the HESTIA3 study [^115xTDhS]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

Four disease-modifying medications are approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). Hydroxyurea induces beneficial myelosuppression and γ globin (and thereby fetal hemoglobin) stimulation to reduce the frequency of SCD complications. L-glutamine, an amino acid with antioxidant properties, can reduce acute SCD complications. Crizanlizumab, a P-selectin inhibitor, reduces the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises by reducing the intercellular adhesion between blood cells and endothelium. Finally, voxelotor shifts the HbS–oxygen dissociation curve, reduces HbS polymerization, and improves hemolytic anemia. Although these treatments have shown benefits in SCD, most patients continue to experience SCD complications.

Platelet activation is increased at baseline in patients with SCD, and platelets are further activated during vaso-occlusive events, thus making antiplatelet therapy a potential therapeutic option. High circulating levels of monocyte–platelet and neutrophil–platelet aggregates indicate platelet activation in patients with SCD and thus suggest a potential role for antiplatelet therapy. Adherent platelets interact with neutrophils via platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) in a fibrinogen-dependent manner. However, the activation and role of platelets in SCD pathophysiology are complex due to ongoing inflammation, hypoxia, free hemoglobin, fibrinogen receptor activation, and decreased nitric oxide bioavailability. Inflammation and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-associated platelet activation and aggregation in individuals with SCD contribute to the vaso-occlusive processes.

### 2015 clinical trials update in sickle cell anemia [^11296n8n]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Polymerization of HbS and cell sickling are the prime pathophysiological events in sickle cell disease (SCD). Over the last 30 years, a substantial understanding at the molecular level has been acquired on how a single amino acid change in the structure of the beta chain of hemoglobin leads to the explosive growth of the HbS polymer and the associated changes in red cell morphology. O2 tension and intracellular HbS concentration are the primary molecular drivers of this process and are obvious targets for developing new therapies. However, polymerization and sickling drive a complex network of associated cellular changes inside and outside of the erythrocyte, which become essential components of the inflammatory vasculopathy and result in a large range of potential acute and chronic organ damages. In these areas, a multitude of new targets for therapeutic developments have emerged, with several ongoing or planned new therapeutic interventions. This review outlines the key points of SCD pathophysiology as they relate to the development of new therapies, both at the pre-clinical and clinical levels.

### Trends in blood transfusion among hospitalized children with sickle cell disease [^111dYitK]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Blood transfusions represent a major therapeutic option in the acute management of sickle cell disease (SCD). Few data exist documenting trends in transfusion among children with SCD, particularly during hospitalization.

- **Procedure**: This was an analysis of cross-sectional data of hospital discharges within the Kid's Inpatient Database (years 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009). Hospitalizations for children (0–18 years) with a primary or secondary SCD-related diagnosis were examined. The primary outcome was blood transfusion. Trends in transfusion were assessed using weighted multivariate logistic regression in a merged dataset, with year as the primary independent variable. Co-variables consisted of child and hospital characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted for 2009 data to assess child and hospital-level factors associated with transfusion.

- **Results**: From 1997 to 2009, the percentage of SCD-related hospitalizations with transfusion increased from 14.2% to 28.8% (P < 0.0001). Among all SCD-related hospitalizations, the odds of transfusion increased over 20% for each successive study interval. Hospitalizations with vaso-occlusive pain crisis (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.27–1.43) or acute chest syndrome/pneumonia (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13–1.35) as the primary diagnoses had the highest odds of transfusion for each consecutive study interval. Older age and male gender were associated with higher odds of transfusion.

- **Conclusions**: Blood transfusion is increasing over time among hospitalized children with SCD. Further study is warranted to identify indications contributing to this trend.

### New horizons in emergency department management of pediatric sickle cell disease [^1158TpHp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an important topic for emergency medicine audiences because complications of the disease account for a large proportion of hematologic emergencies seen in the emergency department each year. Early recognition and aggressive management of emergency complications of SCD can help reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Although some treatment recommendations for complications of SCD are based on expert opinion, there have been advancements in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and evidence regarding available treatment options for managing acute complications. This continuing medical education article provides a summary of the clinical manifestation and management of the most common acute complications of SCD: infection, vaso-occlusive episode, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, stroke, and priapism.

### Management of sickle cell disease: Summary of the 2014 evidence-based report by expert panel members [^1154zrVW]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

When it comes to medical management for sickle cell disease, particularly in handling acute complications like vaso-occlusive crises, the NHLBI 2014 guidelines advise the continued use of NSAIDs. This is recommended for both adults and children experiencing a vaso-occlusive crisis with mild-to-moderate pain, provided that the patients have previously reported relief with NSAIDs and there are no contraindications present.

### Beyond hydroxyurea: New and old drugs in the pipeline for sickle cell disease [^111h2tJj]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Despite Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of hydroxyurea to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive episodes, sickle cell disease (SCD) has continued to be treated primarily with analgesics for pain relief. However, elucidation of the multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to vaso-occlusion and tissue injury in SCD has now resulted in a burgeoning effort to identify new treatment modalities to prevent or ameliorate the consequences of the disease. The development of new drugs, as well as the investigation of drugs previously used in other settings, has targeted cell adhesion, inflammatory pathways, upregulation of hemoglobin F, hemoglobin polymerization and sickling, coagulation, and platelet activation. Although these efforts have not yet yielded drugs ready for FDA approval, several early studies have been extremely encouraging. Moreover, the marked increase in clinical pharmaceutical research addressing SCD and the new and old drugs in the pipeline make it reasonable to expect that we will soon have new treatments for SCD.

### Interventions for patients and caregivers to improve knowledge of sickle cell disease and recognition of its related complications [^115gDH73]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is a group of genetic diseases that are especially prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. However, forced migration and ongoing population movement have spread it throughout the world, with estimated birth rates reaching 0.49 per 1000 in the Americas, 0.07 per 1000 in Europe, 0.68 per 1000 in South and Southeast Asia, and 10.68 per 1000 in Africa. Life for individuals with sickle cell disease can be affected by repeated acute complications and compounded by progressive organ damage. Studies reveal that when people with chronic illness learn self-management, their clinical outcomes and quality of life improve; they show lower dependence on healthcare services. There are, however, no reviews identifying which interventions improve knowledge, and little is known about the impact of patient or caregiver knowledge on clinical and psychosocial outcomes in people with sickle cell disease.

- **Objectives**:
	1. To determine the effectiveness of patient- and caregiver-centered educational interventions for changing the knowledge and understanding of sickle cell disease among patients as well as caregivers of people with the disease.
	2. To assess the effectiveness and safety of patient- and caregiver-centered educational interventions and programs for the recognition of signs and symptoms of disease-related morbidity, adherence to treatment, and healthcare utilization in patients with sickle cell disease.

- **Search methods**: The authors searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic sources and bibliographic databases.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin S percent threshold to prevent severe pain events: a secondary analysis of the SIT trial [^114WYa8i]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

As a secondary analysis of the SIT trial with a sample size of 90 participants, our results need confirming in a prospective trial to determine the optimal maximum Hb S level to prevent severe vaso-occlusive pain. However, our results provide preliminary evidence that the maximum Hb S percent threshold for primary and secondary prevention of strokes may not be the same as for preventing acute pain episodes requiring hospitalization. A significant limitation is that 83% of the participants did not have any serious vaso-occlusive pain events requiring hospitalization, indicating that pain events occur at relatively low frequency in children receiving regular transfusions.

In this secondary analysis of the SIT trial, we demonstrate, to our knowledge, for the first time that regular RBC transfusions to achieve a mean Hb S level < 30% were as effective as a mean Hb S level ≥ 30% in decreasing the incidence rate of severe acute vaso-occlusive pain events requiring hospitalization. The 95% confidence intervals are wide for the pain incidence, suggesting that the lower threshold of < 30% may be beneficial or the higher threshold < 50% may be of no benefit (supplemental material). Given the broad confidence intervals, the Hb S < 30% may be beneficial in decreasing severe acute vaso-occlusive pain event incidence rate. Thus, for patients started on regular blood transfusions to decrease their severe vaso-occlusive pain incidence rate, we would start with a goal of a maximum Hb S level of < 50%. If the participant has a beneficial effect with a concomitant decrease in the severe.

### Increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein at baseline are associated with childhood sickle cell vasocclusive crises [^111gA21n]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Many studies have documented altered pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the plasma of SCD patients during both steady-state and acute vaso-occlusive crisis, but no consistent pattern of cytokine involvement in SCD has emerged that correlates with specific clinical outcomes. However, these cytokines, in turn, could be responsible for driving the low-grade or chronic inflammatory response, evidenced by the presence of mild-moderate, baseline elevations of acute phase reactants such as CRP. Two paediatric studies found increases in baseline hs-CRP levels that correlate with increased resting energy expenditure or the 'hypermetabolic' state in SCD (n = 12), and oxidant stress (n = 35). Clinical data from adult SCD patients also document baseline CRP elevations.

In one study, baseline elevations in CRP in adult HbSS/Sβ 0 Thalassemia patients were correlated with a 'sickle severity index' compared to heterozygous sickle beta thalassemia patients. Taken together, these studies documenting steady-state CRP elevations suggest the presence of an ongoing inflammatory response during symptom-free 'steady state' periods. To our knowledge, no data is available with respect to the association of chronic inflammation with specific clinical outcomes in paediatric SCD.

In this context, our retrospective study, involving a moderate-sized paediatric SCD cohort and covering the age spectrum of 2–20 years, provides strong support for the association of chronic inflammation with acute VOC/pain episodes. In the study cohort, baseline median hs-CRP levels were increased compared to previous assessments.

### Increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein at baseline are associated with childhood sickle cell vasocclusive crises [^111spiGw]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Microvessel occlusion, the main pathological process underlying the cardinal clinical manifestation of sickle cell disease (SCD), is frequently termed vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or pain crisis. Since the description of SCD as a clinical entity nearly a century ago, investigations into the pathophysiology of VOC have been dynamic and manifold. This has led to the delineation of a complex process, encompassing interactions between sickle red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), endothelium, plasma proteins, and several other factors. Additionally, robust laboratory and animal data have further delineated the roles of hemolysis-related decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and endothelial activation in exacerbating the microvessel occlusive events of SCD.

Several lines of evidence suggest that SCD is associated with a chronic inflammatory state. In recent years, there has been great interest in the role of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as a stable plasma biomarker of low-grade, chronic, systemic inflammation in predicting risk for cardiovascular disease in adults. In this study, we evaluate a panel of biomarkers, including hs-CRP, which are representative of previously proposed mechanisms of microvessel occlusion-related clinical events in SCD, for their associations with painful episodes in childhood SCD.

We have studied a cohort of children and adolescents with SCD at baseline, to ascertain if biomarker assessments done during the clinically silent 'steady state' condition correlate with hospitalization.

### Sickle cell disease: Current activities, public health implications, and future directions [^113zoPsX]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder caused by abnormal hemoglobin that damages and deforms red blood cells (RBCs). The abnormal red cells break down, causing anemia and obstruct blood vessels, leading to episodes of severe pain and multiorgan ischemic damage. SCD affects millions of people throughout the world and is particularly common among people whose ancestors come from sub-Saharan Africa.

Sickle cell trait (SCT) is an inherited condition in which both normal hemoglobin and sickle hemoglobin are produced in the RBCs. SCT is not a type of sickle cell disease, and people with SCT are generally healthy. In SCD, clinical severity varies, ranging from mild and sometimes asymptomatic states to severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. Symptomatic treatments exist, but there is no cure for SCD.

Although there has been extensive clinical and basic science research in SCD, many public health issues remain unaddressed. These issues include blood safety surveillance, compliance with immunizations, follow-up of newborns with positive screening tests, stroke prevention, pregnancy complications, pain prevention, quality of life, and thrombosis in people with SCT.

Currently, efforts are underway to strengthen SCD-related activities within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). At the time of writing, several activities are being or have been conducted by centers within CDC, including quality assurance of newborn screening tests for SCD, morbidity and mortality studies, genetic studies, and studies focusing on the protective effects of SCT for malaria.

### An accurate and affordable test for the rapid diagnosis of sickle cell disease could revolutionize the outlook for affected children born in resource-limited settings [^111RLD39]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Key to tackling the early mortality of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) is prompt diagnosis. This allows for the education of parents about how best to look after their affected children, recognize important danger signs, and prevent complications through the targeted use of vaccinations, antibiotics, and anti-malarial drugs. Such measures, which could be easily afforded by many countries within the region, have been successful in reducing the high early mortality previously seen in other parts of the world. There is no reason to suspect that the same should not be true if widely implemented in resource-limited settings. However, at the time of writing, diagnostic facilities for SCD remain poor throughout many such regions, often limited to private facilities and beyond the reach of the majority who would benefit.

A number of different methods can be used to diagnose SCD, the most common of which are haemoglobin electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), isoelectric focusing, and molecular approaches such as PCR. However, all require well-trained staff working with well-maintained equipment in reasonable laboratory facilities, a reliable supply of power, and systems for the delivery and storage of reagents, the commercial costs of which typically run to $5–10 per test. Moreover, laboratory-based approaches require functional systems for sample transport and the return of results. Although pilot newborn screening studies in a number of resource-limited countries have used such approaches…

### Quality assessment of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of pregnant women with sickle cell disease using the AGREE II instrument: a systematic review [^114cuFRz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that causes a vaso-occlusive phenomenon and hemolysis, along with a myriad of other major complications that could be life-threatening. It is one of the most common inherited diseases worldwide and is inherited as an autosomal recessive disease due to the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the sixth amino acid of the beta-globin chain. This substitution leads to the production of a hemoglobin variant that is poorly soluble when deoxygenated. The clinical features, which include a vaso-occlusive crisis, are the result of the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S. SCD is associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. The recognized complications include maternal mortality, preeclampsia, eclampsia, venous thromboembolism, cesarean delivery, intrauterine fetal death, and fetal growth restriction.

The prevalence of SCD varies among countries. For example, data from the United States showed that the overall prevalence is roughly about 4.83 per 10,000 deliveries; 28.5% of women with SCD develop a crisis at the time of delivery. The maternal mortality rate was reported to be 1.6 per 1,000 deliveries in women with SCD compared to 0.1 per 1,000 deliveries in those without SCD.

Information about the prevalence of SCD in Saudi Arabia is limited and differs among the various provinces, with the highest prevalence reported in the Eastern province followed by the Southwest province. SCD in pregnancy tends to cause higher episodes of painful crises and a higher frequency of blo.

### Oxygen gradient ektacytometry-derived biomarkers are associated with acute complications in sickle cell disease [^113XJGHw]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenetic disorder characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs), and progressive organ failure. The mutation in HBB coding for the β-globin gene results in the formation of hemoglobin S (HbS) that polymerizes under deoxygenation, leading to red blood cell (RBC) sickling. Sickled RBCs are poorly deformable, causing occlusion of the microvasculature and initiating a cascade of other immunogenic and inflammatory factors, leading to painful ischemic events and progressive organ damage. Acute complications that require immediate care include acute chest syndrome (ACS), VOEs, and cerebral infarction.

The rapidly evolving therapeutic options that are now in development for SCD require objective and clinically relevant endpoints for clinical trials. Hydroxyurea, as part of standard of care therapy, induces fetal Hb (HbF) production. Together with Hb concentration and mean cell volume (MCV), HbF levels are often used to monitor hydroxyurea efficacy, because HbF is a well-known modifier of SCD clinical severity. On a population level, higher HbF levels correlate with fewer complications, although some individuals with HbF concentration > 20% still report clinical complications. This may be due to the heterocellular distribution of HbF, which is not accurately reflected by the percentage of HbF measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Methods to measure F cells, or the amount of HbF in RBCs, are currently under investigation to determine the level at which a VOE is likely to be prevented.

### Oxygen gradient ektacytometry-derived biomarkers are associated with vaso-occlusive crises and correlate with treatment response in sickle cell disease [^116k1MZL]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Low credibility.

A total of 126 patients were enrolled at participating sites in the Netherlands, France, or the United States (US). Peripheral blood samples from patients with no VOC in the past two years (VOC‐ group) were compared to patients who experienced one or more VOC (VOC+ group) in the past two years. The VOC was defined as an acute pain event attributed to SCD requiring hospital admission, emergency room evaluation, or an unplanned visit to the outpatient clinic. The European cohort comprised adult patients (n = 46), and the United States cohort consisted of pediatric patients (n = 80) aged 3‐18 years with HbSS, HbSβ o, or HbSβ +. Characteristics of VOC+ and VOC‐ cohorts are shown in Table S1.

Oxygen gradient ektacytometry was performed as described in detail elsewhere. Overall, patient demographics and laboratory parameters were comparable between the two cohorts, with differences regarding age, percentage of patients on HU treatment, and percentage of patients on HU and chronic transfusion (CTf).

In the adult cohort, PoS differed significantly between the VOC‐ group (median 41.6 mm Hg) and the VOC+ group (median 53.7 mm Hg, P = 0.001, Figure 1A). The same observation was made in the pediatric cohort (P = 0.0495, Figure 1C), which indicates that RBCs of patients without VOC can tolerate lower oxygen tensions before sickling occurs. EI min in both cohorts was significantly lower in the VOC+ group (adult cohort P = 0.0178, pediatric cohort P = 0.022, Figure 1B, D), highlighting that RBCs of patients in the VOC+ group are less deformable after deoxygenation. The EI max was not defined in the text provided.

### Hemoglobin level and macular thinning in sickle cell disease [^114bTZVH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Some of the observations made in our study may explain the differences in the pathophysiology of sickle retinopathy between SS and SC genotypes. A lower Hb, as well as higher Plt count and MCV in SS genotype, could contribute to acute occlusive episodes such as PAMM, which might explain why macular thinning is more commonly seen in SS than SC genotype. This may also explain why PSR is less common in SS compared to SC, as complete vaso-occlusion in SS results in anoxia, as opposed to hypoxia in SC, and therefore no release of vasoproliferative factors.

These findings are consistent with the pathophysiological model of sickle retinopathy put forth by Fox et al. in 1990, which divides sickle cell patients into low, moderate, and severe risk categories based on vaso-occlusive tendency. Based on this model, SC patients experience low-to-moderate ischemia resulting in hypoxia, release of vasoproliferative factors, and proliferative disease, which is mainly seen in the SC genotype. On the other hand, SS patients undergo severe vascular closure resulting in anoxia and possibly occlusion of new proliferative vessels also, resulting in higher retinal thinning but lower PSR rates.

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^112qCppk]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that results in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, pain, and end organ damage. Surgery in the SCD population requires careful planning, as perioperative stressors can lead to increased sickling and the risk of inducing or further exacerbating vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, the underlying hypercoagulability and immunocompromised state due to SCD places patients at increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and infection.

Judicious fluid administration, temperature regulation, thorough preoperative and postoperative analgesic planning, and preoperative transfusion are all crucial components of decreasing risks of surgery in patients with SCD.

### The ASH Research Collaborative Sickle Cell Disease Research Network: Past, present and future [^116eYxLF]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Historically, Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) has been overshadowed by progress in other hematologic disorders, but recent advances are reshaping its clinical and research landscape. Despite SCD reducing life expectancy by more than 20 years, even with optimal care, transformative initiatives are fostering hope for improved outcomes. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) established the ASH Research Collaborative Sickle Cell Disease Research Network as a comprehensive program to revolutionize SCD research in the United States. This network comprises a collection of innovative, research-focused cooperative sites and a robust Data Hub that aggregates extensive real-world datasets to enhance clinical insights and streamline research designs. Community Advisory Boards at both local and national levels ensure that the perspectives of individuals living with SCD guide research priorities. This report includes an overview of the initial demographics, including the number of records, encounters, laboratory data, prescriptions, years of follow-up, and co-morbidities per patient, within the context of the ASH Research Collaborative Sickle Cell Disease Research Network. These coordinated efforts are poised to significantly transform the landscape of SCD care, and this report details the initiative's mission, history, achievements at the time of writing, and its promising trajectory toward improving the lives of individuals affected by this chronic condition.

### Trends and hospital practice variation for analgesia for children with sickle cell disease with vaso-occlusive pain episodes: An 11-year analysis [^114ztfTH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

This cross-sectional analysis of 86,111 visits for sickle cell disease and vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) in U.S. pediatric emergency departments between 2013 and 2023 shows increased use of NSAIDs, ketamine, and acetaminophen, with unchanged opioid use. Hospitals with a higher volume of VOE visits more frequently administered opioids.

- **Background**: Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) are a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD), leading to frequent emergency department (ED) visits. Effective pain management is crucial, with guidelines recommending routine use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with opioids, and emerging evidence supporting ketamine use. However, these recommendations are based on low-certainty evidence, and the impact of these guidelines on analgesia use over time remains unclear.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to analyze trends in analgesia use over an 11-year period in pediatric SCD patients presenting to U.S. EDs with VOE and assess variations in treatment across hospitals.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Pediatric Health Information System covering 34 U.S. children's hospitals from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2023. The primary outcomes were the proportions of visits where opioids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and/or ketamine were administered on the first calendar day of the initial visit. Secondary outcomes included the co-administration of NSAIDs with opioids. Logistic and linear regression models were used to assess trends and hospital-level variations.

- **Results**: A total of 86,111 ED visits for VOE were analyzed.

### Evolving treatment paradigms in sickle cell disease [^115avhwL]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology, Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inheritable hemoglobinopathy characterized by the polymerization of hemoglobin S in red blood cells, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive painful crisis, and multiorgan damage. In SCD, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation occurs both inside the red blood cells and the vascular lumen, which augments hemolysis and cellular adhesion. This review discusses the evolving body of literature concerning the role of ROS in the pathophysiology of SCD. It also covers some emerging therapeutic approaches to SCD with a focus on the reduction of ROS.

### Newborn sickle cell screening in a region of western New York state [^115uTuqX]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

To assess local trends in the incidence of sickle cell disease (SCD) and hemoglobin (Hb) S trait, hemoglobinopathy clinic follow-up and cohort mortality rates were evaluated. A longstanding newborn hemoglobinopathy screening program was reviewed. Incidence rates were computed using information from a confidential database, specialty clinic/hospital data, and local birth statistics.

Over 27 years, the incidence of Hb SS in live black births was 0.163% or 1 in 615. Over 18 years, the incidence of Hb AS was 8.5% or 1 in 11.8. No significant differences in the incidence of Hb SS, Hb AS, and the S allele were found over time. Specialty clinic follow-up improved, and death before age 18 years was documented for 6 SCD cases (2.8%; mortality rate of 0.23 per 100 patient years).

Local screening activities may have had an impact on participation in specialized SCD care and the disease-associated mortality rate. The incidence of Hb SS has remained unchanged over 27 years, and that of Hb S trait and the S allele has been unaffected in the last 18 years. Trait notification goals and approaches should be reevaluated.

### Validation of a novel point of care testing device for sickle cell disease [^114YPPZR]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited blood disorders in the world. SCD is caused by the inheritance of two copies of the gene encoding hemoglobin S, a protein that results from a missense mutation in the β-globin subunit of hemoglobin A, or the co-inheritance of the gene for hemoglobin S and another abnormal or nonfunctional hemoglobin gene. Resulting erythrocytes are both unstable, leading to excessive hemolysis, and abnormal, leading to inflammation and vascular occlusion. Patients with SCD face a multitude of complications, including pain, infections, stroke, acute chest syndrome (sickling and occlusion within the pulmonary vasculature), and multi-organ damage. However, improvements in early diagnosis and enhanced preventive care treatment in high-resource countries have led to a dramatic improvement in childhood survival and an increase in the average lifespan of affected individuals.

Many improvements in the treatment of persons with SCD are the direct result of newborn screening, which became universal in the United States 15 years ago. Early diagnosis allows for the initiation of prophylactic antibiotics and the education of affected families on the importance of immediate evaluation for children with symptoms of complications. However, many low-resource countries where SCD is far more prevalent remain unable to provide universal newborn screening, and affected children may not be diagnosed until they present with symptoms. In addition to the financial limitations, some countries with relatively high prevalence are further challenged by these constraints.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in sickle cell disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112uxBAa]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Normal hemoglobin (Hb) is responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. It is composed of heme plus four polypeptide globin chains whose chemical structure is genetically controlled. The normal adult hemoglobin molecule (Hb A) consists of a pair of α chains and a pair of β chains. The symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD) were first described in 1670 in Africa. In 1910, James Herrick noted "peculiar, elongated sickle-shaped red blood cells (RBCs)" in the blood of an anemic medical student. The sickling phenomenon was demonstrated in vitro by Emeel, who was able to show the sickling cells in the deoxygenated RBCs in family members with sickle cell anemia. In 1949, Pauling and his team, using electrophoresis techniques, found that hemoglobin from sickle-shaped RBCs had abnormal electrophoretic movement in comparison with other Hb when deoxygenated.

The sickle cell mutation of the β-globin gene (HbS) is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When present in the homozygous state (HbSS), the problems of sickle cell anemia (SCA) manifest. In the heterozygous state, known as sickle cell trait, there are few, if any, clinical consequences under normal physiologic conditions, and patients are normally asymptomatic. SCD can also result from a compound heterozygous state of HbS in combination with other abnormal Hb such as β thalassemia, hemoglobin C, and others. Such patients have variable phenotypes that can be as severe as the homozygous HbSS state. HbS is caused by a single mutation in the β-globin gene, substituting a valine amino acid for glutamic acid at position 6.

### An accurate and affordable test for the rapid diagnosis of sickle cell disease could revolutionize the outlook for affected children born in resource-limited settings [^112pHKa5]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a neglected, chronic, multi-system disorder that is increasingly significant in the global health context. SCD is caused by the inheritance of a mutation in the HBB gene, resulting in the production of a structurally abnormal form of β-globin. This variant form of hemoglobin, known as sickle hemoglobin or HbS, polymerizes reversibly under low oxygen tension, altering the shape and rheological properties of red blood cells — a phenomenon central to the pathophysiology of SCD. Although SCD is most commonly caused by the homozygous inheritance of HbS (HbSS), it can also result from the coinheritance of HbS with other mutations of the HBB gene. Most notable among them is a second structural hemoglobin variant, HbC, and β-thalassemia, a condition characterized by the reduced production of normal β-globin chains.

- **SCD in resource-limited settings**: The sickle mutation has risen to high allele frequencies in many parts of Africa, India, and the Middle East because carriers (with HbAS) are strongly protected against death from Plasmodium falciparum malaria. As a consequence, more than 90% of global SCD births — at least 280,000 births each year — occur in resource-limited regions of the world. Nevertheless, compared to the minority of affected subjects born in resource-rich regions, the outlook for these children is stark. Since the introduction of newborn screening throughout much of Europe and North America, the majority of children born with SCD in these regions are diagnosed early and placed on lifelong care.

### Recommendations regarding splenectomy in hereditary hemolytic anemias [^1153Kvic]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy with a worldwide distribution: projected numbers of births in 2010 were 237,381 in Africa, 11,143 in the United States, and 1,939 in Europe. SCD is caused by a point mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in the synthesis of a pathological hemoglobin, HbS. Cyclic polymerization/depolymerization of deoxy-HbS generates dense, dehydrated red cells that play a central role in the acute and chronic clinical manifestations of SCD, where intravascular sickling leads to vaso-occlusion and impaired blood flow with ischemic/reperfusion injury. Some organs, such as the spleen, have been shown to be more vulnerable to damage from HbS polymerization than others due to their peculiar anatomic organization, mainly characterized by sluggish circulation, low pH, and a locally high pro-oxidant environment.

- **Splenectomy**: An acute splenic sequestration crisis is defined as acute abdominal pain and distension associated with spleen enlargement, a decrease in hemoglobin levels of at least 2 g/dL, and a stable or high reticulocyte count compared to the patient in a steady state. Even though the mortality rate of patients with SCD has declined since the introduction of neonatal screening for the disease, vaccination programs, and parental education, acute splenic sequestration crisis remains a life-threatening complication. The clinical management of such crises, with acute splenic sickling and spleen blood entrapment, is based on the rapid correction of hypovolemic shock by infusion of crystalloids and packed red cells.

### Changes in platelet count as a predictive tool in sickle cell acute vaso-occlusive crises: A pediatric study [^114tSoSr]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Studies have shown that platelets play an important role in the pathophysiology of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) in sickle cell disease. This study investigates whether changes in platelet indices from baseline can predict complications during acute pain crisis.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from pediatric sickle cell patients in a well-clinic setting and compared with data gathered during VOC (n = 67). The primary outcome was a complicated course (admission, acute chest syndrome, transfusion, etc) versus an uncomplicated course (discharge from the emergency department without subsequent return).

- **Results**: Patients with uncomplicated courses had larger platelet declines (53.7) than those with complicated courses (14.8, P = 0.005).

- **Conclusions**: The study suggests that patients with uncomplicated VOC are more likely to experience a larger decline in platelets. The predictive value is limited by the need to have pre-existing steady-state data and a relatively small decline. Ongoing studies are needed to identify useful laboratory data to help predict the severity of VOC.

### Drugs for preventing red blood cell dehydration in people with sickle cell disease [^11683xd3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin, resulting in abnormal red blood cells. These cells are rigid and may block blood vessels, leading to acute painful crises and other complications. Recent research has focused on therapies to rehydrate the sickled cells by reducing the loss of water and ions from them. Little is known about the effectiveness and safety of such drugs.

- **Objectives**: To assess the relative risks and benefits of drugs to rehydrate sickled red blood cells.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. The last search of the Group's Trials Register was conducted on 25 October 2011.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of drugs to rehydrate sickled red blood cells compared to placebo or an alternative treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed study quality, and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Of the 51 studies identified, three met the inclusion criteria. The first study tested the effectiveness of zinc sulphate to prevent sickle cell-related crises in a total of 145 participants and showed a significant reduction in painful crises over one and a half years, with a mean difference of -2.83 (95% confidence interval -3.51 to -2.15). However, analysis was restricted due to limited statistical data. Changes to red cell parameters and blood counts were inconsistent. No serious adverse events were noted in the study. The second study was a Phase II dose-finding study of senicapoc (a Gardos channel blocker).

### Effect of hydroxyurea on the frequency of painful crises in sickle cell anemia. Investigators of the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia [^112ZKxCY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1995). High credibility.

The Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH), published by Charache S and colleagues in 1995 in The New England Journal of Medicine, is related to sickle cell disease. The study posed the question: What is the role of hydroxyurea in adult patients with sickle cell anemia? It utilized a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, involving 299 patients (151 female, 148 male). Adult patients with sickle cell anemia were included, while key exclusion criteria were sickle cell-beta(+)-thalassemia, sickle cell-beta(0)-thalassemia, pregnancy, narcotic addiction, regular use of more than 30 oxycodone capsules (or equivalent) every two weeks, signs of marrow depression, or prior hydroxyurea therapy.

The interventions were as follows:

- **Hydroxyurea group (n = 152)**: Initial dose of 15 mg/kg body weight, adjusted according to marrow depression, platelet count, and hemoglobin level.
- **Placebo group (n = 147)**: Starch 1500, with similar dose adjustments.

The primary outcome was a significant decrease in painful crises (2.5% vs. 4.5%; relative risk [RR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23 to 0.89). Secondary outcomes included:

- **Chest syndrome**: Significant decrease (25 vs. 51; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.78).
- **Transfusions**: Significant decrease (48 vs. 73; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.05).

In conclusion, among adult patients with sickle cell anemia, hydroxyurea was superior to placebo regarding painful crises.

### Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease [^1142kRuE]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

The rationale behind the haemoglobin 100 g/l limit with red blood cell transfusion

Case reports of patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA; HbSS and HbSβ 0 genotypes), who developed complications after RBC transfusions, have contributed to recommendations for avoiding Hb increases beyond 100 g/l. Patients in these reports developed adverse neurological outcomes, ranging from headaches to seizures and fatal cerebral bleeds, within days of receiving RBC transfusions. As such, the rate of Hb increase, in addition to the final Hb value, may be an important factor that engenders complications — e.g. an increase in Hb concentration over hours to days versus over weeks to months. Moreover, excessive increases in viscosity have raised concerns about impaired oxygen delivery to tissues due to reduced blood flow.

While hyperviscosity has also been considered a risk factor for increased vaso‐occlusive crises (VOCs) in some patients with SCA, those with haemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) generally have higher Hb and viscosity levels but lower rates of VOCs. Given the lack of clinical and observational studies evaluating adverse events associated with increasing Hb beyond 100 g/l, the true incidence of viscosity‐related complications in SCD is difficult to assess. As such, SCD transfusion guidelines recommend not increasing Hb beyond 100 g/l in patients with acute complications related to SCD. However, with long‐term transfusions, where the rise in Hb occurs more slowly and is accompanied by a parallel decline in sickle Hb (HbS), patients who are able to maintain a lower percentage of HbS (< 30%).

### End points for sickle cell disease clinical trials: Renal and cardiopulmonary, cure, and low-resource settings [^114MXUDq]. Blood Advances (2019). Low credibility.

To address the global burden of sickle cell disease and the need for novel therapies, the American Society of Hematology partnered with the US Food and Drug Administration. They engaged seven panels of clinicians, investigators, and patients to develop consensus recommendations for clinical trial end points. The panels conducted their work through literature reviews, assessment of available evidence, and expert judgment. They focused on end points related to patient-reported outcomes, pain (non-patient-reported outcomes), the brain, end-organ considerations, biomarkers, measurement of cure, and low-resource settings. This article presents the findings and recommendations from the panels on end-organ considerations, measurement of cure, and low-resource settings, as well as relevant findings and recommendations from the biomarkers panel.

### Emergency medicine management of sickle cell disease complications: An evidence-based update [^115jLRRm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States. Due to alterations in the structural conformation of hemoglobin molecules under deoxygenated conditions, patients with SCD are predisposed to numerous sequelae, many of which require acute intervention.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an evidence-based update regarding the diagnosis and management of SCD complications.

- **Discussion**: SCD patients experience significant morbidity and mortality secondary to cerebrovascular accident, acute chest syndrome, acute vaso-occlusive pain crises, SCD-related multi-organ failure, cholecystitis, acute intrahepatic cholestasis, acute sickle hepatic crisis, acute hepatic sequestration, priapism, and renal disease. Emergency physicians must recognize acute manifestations of SCD in order to deliver timely management and determine patient disposition.

- **Conclusions**: A comprehensive review of the emergency department management of acute SCD complications is provided. Comprehensive understanding of these aspects of SCD can assist physicians in expediting patient evaluation and treatment, thus decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with this hemoglobinopathy.

### The wider perspective: Barriers and recommendations for transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease in low- and middle-income countries [^112PTcjs]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) recommends automated red cell exchange (RCE) for stroke and severe acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease (SCD). Automated RCE reduces the hemoglobin S (HbS) level more rapidly and predictably compared to simple transfusion. It is also euvolemic, with modern instrumentation allowing the patient's red blood cells (RBCs) to be removed and donor RBCs returned continuously, minimizing the risk of fluid overload. Patients with SCD are at risk of renal impairment and cardiorespiratory failure. Furthermore, iron accumulation and hyperviscosity can be controlled by adjusting target parameters.

Nonetheless, automated RCE remains the exception in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Barriers to its wider adoption include the need for specialized equipment, skilled personnel (with training in apheresis), adequate vascular access (potentially requiring central venous access), and a greater number of RBCs compared to other modalities (e.g. 4–10 units of RBCs for RCE versus 1–3 units for simple transfusion). As such, the British Society of Haematology recommends that all hospitals treating patients with SCD should have the capability to perform manual exchange, asserting that this may be life-saving in emergencies. However, automated RCE remains the preferred approach.

Manual exchange is enormously labor-intensive, inefficient, and arguably not suitable for high throughput treatment of large numbers of SCD patients. Furthermore, acceptance of suboptimal practices impedes progress towards the standard of care.

### The wider perspective: Barriers and recommendations for transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease in low- and middle-income countries [^112iVx3k]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Transfusion management of patients with SCD in LMICs is subsumed by broader considerations surrounding global blood transfusion safety and sufficiency. Despite ongoing challenges, there are examples where progress in blood transfusion is occurring. These include projects and health programs aimed at improving the safety of blood products through quality assurance and regulatory initiatives, haemovigilance/post-transfusion surveillance programs, and the development of formal education in haematology and transfusion medicine, particularly focusing on immunohaematology.

To improve the care of patients with SCD, increasing the capacity of blood banking and laboratory medicine must be prioritized. Specific areas of need span the quality system of laboratory practice and the procurement of reagents and equipment (e.g. analyzers) for pre-transfusion testing, to health management information systems that enable documentation and tracking of patients with alloantibodies or a history of transfusion reactions. There are few examples of success in this domain. Leveraging partnerships with societies such as ASH, the International Society of Blood Transfusion, the Association for the Advancement of Blood and Biotherapies, the Asian Association of Transfusion Medicine, and the Africa Society for Blood Transfusion could be instrumental in developing and reforming immunohaematology capabilities and transfusion support for patients with SCD. This could include individual grants for dedicated technical training.

### Optimal disease management and health monitoring in adults with sickle cell disease [^113aVDFZ]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

In countries with access to organized health care, survival of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has greatly improved, resulting in a growing population of adults with SCD. Transition from pediatric to adult care presents many challenges for the patient, who now faces the reality of emerging complications in many organs that are cumulative, adding to other age-related nonsickle conditions that interact and add to the disease morbidity. We recommend regular comprehensive annual assessments, monitoring for early signs of organ damage, and joint clinics with relevant specialists, if applicable. While maintaining a low threshold for intervention with disease-modifying therapies, we should always keep in mind that there is no single complication that is pathognomonic of SCD, and nonsickle comorbidities should always be excluded and treated if present.

We need to reevaluate our approach to managing adults with SCD by putting a greater emphasis on multidisciplinary care while proactively considering curative options — such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy — and experimental pharmacological agents for adults with SCD of all ages before complications render the patients ineligible for these treatments.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sickle cell disease, specifically concerning technical considerations for transfusion, the NHLBI 2014 guidelines recommend avoiding transfusions to a target hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dL in patients with sickle cell anemia who do not receive transfusions long-term and who are therefore at risk for hyperviscosity due to high percentages of circulating HbS-containing erythrocytes.

### Genetic modifiers of fetal hemoglobin affect the course of sickle cell disease in patients treated with hydroxyurea [^112eoHdx]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

The correlation between HbF levels and complications of sickle cell disease was assessed using Poisson regression. The number of patients available for analysis were as follows: 193 for hospitalization, 194 for pain crises, and for red blood cell transfusion. Thick lines in the analysis represent the predicted values, while thin lines indicate the 95% confidence interval.

The association of genetic traits with HbF does not correlate with the association of genetic traits and the rate of hemolysis or the frequency of complications of sickle cell disease. While decreased LDH levels in patients with BCL11A rs1427407 and HMIP rs66650371 were concordant with increased HbF, BCL11A rs7606173 was not correlated with HbF levels but with increased LDH. The HBG2- polymorphism rs7482144, which was clearly associated with high HbF, was not significantly associated with changes in any parameters informative of hemolysis. Without having any detectable effect on HbF levels, BCL11A rs7606173 showed a trend towards higher LDH and more frequent hospitalizations and acute chest syndrome. Although there was no association between increased HbF and a reduced frequency of acute chest syndrome, patients carrying BCL11A rs1427407 T showed a significant reduction in the frequency of acute chest syndrome, suggesting an HbF-independent modulation of the sickle cell disease phenotype.

We conclude that the induction of HbF expression is only one of several effects that modify the clinical phenotype of sickle cell disease in patients treated with hydroxyurea. As BCL11A, a key player that is influenced by polymorphisms in HMIP and BCL11A itself, is a pleiotropic transcription factor.

### The wider perspective: Barriers and recommendations for transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease in low- and middle-income countries [^117LBzaL]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Challenges to blood transfusion support for patients with SCD in LMICs are numerous and impact both safety and availability. Despite recognizing the importance of blood transfusion therapy in sickle cell disease (SCD), these challenges impede effective treatment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). One major issue is the availability of blood when needed. Most LMICs, including regions where SCD is prevalent, such as parts of Africa and India, do not have sufficient blood supplies to meet population needs. Furthermore, the required amount of blood to support these populations has not yet been quantified, hindering efforts to optimize the blood supply.

Even when blood is available, the risks associated with blood transfusion are exacerbated in low-resource settings, regardless of the administration mode (simple vs. automated). The transfusion-associated infectious risk in many LMICs is particularly high due to numerous challenges. These include a high background prevalence of major transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs), suboptimal blood donor selection – specifically the collection of blood from first-time, family replacement, and paid donors – and variable testing practices, such as inconsistent use of quality-controlled assays and lack of standardized algorithms for repeat and confirmatory testing. Furthermore, post-transfusion surveillance is largely absent in these settings. Individuals with SCD often require chronic transfusions, either prophylactically or for treating SCD-associated complications, which increases the cumulative risk.

### Validation of a novel point of care testing device for sickle cell disease [^113DpFve]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is one of the most common inherited blood disorders. Universal screening and early intervention have significantly helped to reduce childhood mortality in high-resource countries. However, individuals in low-resource settings are often not diagnosed until late childhood when they present with clinical symptoms. Furthermore, confirmation of the disease in affected individuals in the urgent care setting is limited in both high- and low-resource areas, often leading to delays in treatment. Diagnostic methods rely on advanced laboratory systems and are often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming in low-resource settings. To address this need, the Sickle SCAN™ test has been developed to diagnose sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait at the point of care without the need for electricity or advanced equipment.

- **Methods**: This study was conducted to evaluate and validate the diagnostic accuracy of the Sickle SCAN™ test, a novel point of care test for sickle cell disease. It describes the laboratory testing and clinical validation of the Sickle SCAN™ test in individuals over one year of age using capillary blood. The Sickle SCAN™ test was created using advanced, qualitative lateral flow technology with capillary blood to identify the presence of hemoglobin A, S, and C, allowing for detection of results with the naked eye.

- **Results**: Laboratory testing using venous blood demonstrated 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity for the diagnosis of HbSS, HbAS, HbSC, HbAC, and HbAA. Seventy-one subjects underwent capillary blood sampling at the point…

### Thromboinflammatory mechanisms in sickle cell disease - challenging the hemostatic balance [^116G4iAz]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy caused by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS) in red blood cells, leading to alterations in red cell properties and shape as a result of HbS deoxygenation and subsequent polymerization. SCD pathophysiology is characterized by chronic inflammatory processes triggered by hemolytic and vaso-occlusive events, which lead to the varied complications, organ damage, and elevated mortality seen in individuals with the disease.

In association with the activation of the endothelium and leukocytes, hemostatic alterations and thrombotic events are well-documented in SCD. Here we discuss the role of inflammatory pathways in modulating coagulation and inducing platelet activation in SCD due to tissue factor activation, adhesion molecule expression, inflammatory mediator production, and the induction of innate immune responses, amongst other mechanisms. Thromboinflammatory pathways may play a significant role in some of the major complications of SCD, such as stroke, venous thromboembolism, and possibly acute chest syndrome. These pathways can also exacerbate the chronic inflammation and cellular interactions that trigger vaso-occlusion, ischemia-reperfusion processes, and eventually organ damage.

### Pharmacological interventions for painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults [^1112qYdj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders of haemoglobin (Hb) structure in individuals who have inherited two mutant globin genes, one from each parent, with at least one always being the sickle mutation. It is estimated that between 5% and 7% of the world's population are carriers of the mutant Hb gene, making SCD the most commonly inherited blood disorder. The disease is characterized by distorted sickle-shaped red blood cells. Manifestations of SCD are attributed to either haemolysis (premature red cell destruction) or vaso-occlusion (obstruction of blood flow), with the latter being the most common manifestation. Shortened lifespans are associated with serious comorbidities such as renal failure, acute cholecystitis, pulmonary hypertension, aplastic crisis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and sepsis.

Vaso-occlusion can lead to an acute, painful crisis known as a sickle cell crisis, vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), or vaso-occlusive episode. Pain is most often reported in the joints, extremities, back, or chest, although it can occur anywhere and can last for several days or weeks. The bone and muscle pain experienced during a sickle cell crisis is both acute and recurrent. Key pharmacological treatments for VOC include opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, and combinations of drugs. Non-pharmacological approaches such as relaxation, hypnosis, heat, ice, and acupuncture have been used in conjunction to rehydrate the patient and reduce the sickling process.

- **Objectives**: To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of pharmacological interventions.

### Burden of vaso-occlusive crisis, its management and impact on quality of life of Indian sickle cell disease patients [^114LwVpD]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Additionally, we retrospectively collected data on the VOC burden from the year prior to each patient's enrolment, allowing us to include historical data on healthcare resource utilization and home management of VOC in a defined time period for all the patients. This strategy ensured a comprehensive view of VOC occurrences within the study cohort. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

- **Participants**: Adult and pediatric patients with an established SCD diagnosis at least 12 months before the index visit were included. These patients, numbering 1,000, came from various healthcare centers in high SCD-prevalent states across India. Patients receiving crizanlizumab or any other investigational product for managing VOC during the previous 12 months from the day of study enrollment were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.

- **Objectives and endpoints**: We evaluated two primary endpoints during the study period: the proportion of SCD patients with at least one VOC episode out of the total study sample, and the total number of VOC episodes leading to healthcare visits as a ratio to the total number of healthcare visits by all the patients. The secondary endpoints include the severity of VOCs, assessed using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale for individuals aged 7 years and older, and the Faces Pain Scale for children aged 3–7 years. The study also evaluated the proportion of patients with complicated and uncomplicated VOCs.
