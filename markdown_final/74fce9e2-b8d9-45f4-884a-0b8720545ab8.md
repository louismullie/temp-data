## Question

How is pyoderma gangranosum treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how pyoderma gangrenosum is treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging severity. Then, I should select first-line therapy based on extent and speed of progression. Next, I need to consider escalation to adjuvant or second-line agents, followed by biologics for refractory disease. After that, I will evaluate surgical and advanced wound-care options under immunosuppression. Finally, I must address special situations (IBD-associated disease, peristomal disease, pregnancy) and set up monitoring, safety, and relapse prevention plans, all while cross-checking the evidence base and highlighting uncertainties where they exist.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and avoid a major pitfall: PG is a diagnosis of exclusion, so I need to rule out infection (including atypical organisms), vasculitis, occlusive vascular disease, malignancy, and exogenous/drug-induced injury; misdiagnosis is not rare and exposes patients to harmful immunosuppression, so I should obtain biopsy for H&E and appropriate cultures while recognizing histology is not pathognomonic, and I should document pathergy if present, as expert consensus for trial eligibility also stresses exclusion of infection and biopsy confirmation, which aligns with the Japanese guideline emphasizing careful diagnostic workup [^113ZkKzs] [^112heRBc] [^1156z9yb] [^117X3E3x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before I stage the disease: I should assess number, size, depth, edge morphology, pain intensity, speed of progression, and clinical variant (ulcerative, bullous, vegetative, pustular, peristomal), and screen for associated systemic disease (IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, hematologic malignancy, autoinflammatory syndromes), because comorbid conditions and lesion burden influence both therapy selection and prognosis; baseline photographs and precise measurements are essential for subsequent response assessment and tapering decisions [^1125ezzo] [^113Auyvc].

> Next, I will set universal management principles, and I need to ensure meticulous wound care from the start: gentle cleansing, non-adherent dressings, exudate control, off-loading/pressure redistribution, moisture balance per the TIME concept, and pain control; I should minimize mechanical trauma due to pathergy, and if surgical procedures are contemplated, they should occur only after adequate systemic immunosuppression is established to reduce the risk of worsening, as emphasized by perioperative reviews and wound-care frameworks [^116AL4Ge] [^1129SYxM] [^1144Cnse] [^114p3eGr].

> For limited, localized disease, I should start with high-potency topical corticosteroids, and wait, let me verify the evidence: clobetasol 0.05% achieved about 42% complete healing at six months in a prospective cohort with a median healing time near 4.5 months, and topical tacrolimus has case-level support as an adjunct or alternative when corticosteroids are inadequate; I should avoid aggressive occlusion or friction at the margins to mitigate pathergy risk and titrate frequency based on pain and edge inflammation [^112uWtET] [^116SEsBu].

> For rapidly progressive, multi-lesional, or deep ulcers, I should confirm first-line systemic therapy: prednisolone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day versus ciclosporin around 4 mg/kg/day are equivalent in the pragmatic STOP-GAP RCT in terms of six-month healing and speed of response, though adverse event profiles differ, with more serious infections on prednisolone and more renal toxicity on ciclosporin; tapering should be individualized over weeks to months once inflammation is controlled, and pulse IV methylprednisolone may hasten initial control in severe flares, but I should double-check ceiling doses and safety labs before escalation [^115XjVET] [^113XDmu6] [^116oUjJs] [^114eb8ne].

> I will now examine IBD-associated PG, where treating the bowel disease often improves the skin: anti-TNF agents such as infliximab and adalimumab are reasonable early options, with infliximab demonstrating complete healing in a multicenter IBD cohort and adalimumab supported by case series; I should coordinate with gastroenterology for synchronized induction regimens and steroid-sparing, recognizing that some patients still require adjunct systemic steroids or calcineurin inhibitors while biologic effect takes hold [^1123qKFT] [^111gJHJx] [^111X4U4H].

> But wait, what about pregnancy and the postpartum setting where risks and benefits must be balanced carefully: systemic corticosteroids remain the most commonly used agents, with cyclosporine as a frequent alternative, and IVIG can be considered as a steroid-sparing rescue when standard therapies fail or are contraindicated, as case-based evidence suggests rapid responses in postpartum surgical-wound PG; I need to coordinate maternal-fetal monitoring and use the lowest effective doses with close surveillance for hypertension, hyperglycemia, and infections [^111u5wc1] [^112b1neV] [^1115tTnm].

> I should also review peristomal PG, because management nuances differ: meticulous ostomy care to reduce leakage and friction, intralesional steroids for edge inflammation, and systemic steroids are standard, with anti-TNF therapy providing additional benefit especially with active IBD; in select cases, stoma relocation or closure is effective when coordinated with disease control and specialized stoma therapy teams [^115X4uib] [^112ZTzGU].

> Now, let me consider when to escalate beyond first-line therapy: if after roughly 6–8 weeks of adequate-dose systemic therapy there is less than 50% reduction in ulcer area, persistent severe pain, or new lesions, I should add or switch to steroid-sparing agents; options with supportive series include mycophenolate mofetil, systemic tacrolimus, dapsone, azathioprine or methotrexate, and thalidomide for highly refractory cases with strict risk mitigation; I need to confirm G6PD status before dapsone and monitor renal function and blood pressure with calcineurin inhibitors, while counseling on teratogenicity and neuropathy risks with thalidomide [^115mBDUi] [^115W1yvV] [^113ovaPV] [^1129SYxM] [^113jcsAJ].

> Next, I should review biologic and targeted therapies for refractory or steroid-dependent disease, keeping in mind the overall low-level evidence: anti-TNF agents are the most established with multiple positive series, IL-1 blockade with anakinra or canakinumab can help when IL-1–driven features are suspected, IL-17 inhibition with ixekizumab or secukinumab has yielded complete responses in small case series, and IL-23 inhibition with guselkumab has shown durable remissions in recalcitrant cases; rituximab and JAK inhibitors have emerging case-level support in selected contexts, but I need to screen for latent infections and align choices with comorbidities and prior biologic exposure [^1123qKFT] [^112k2Kso] [^116LL9bL] [^113aKYTE] [^112KokTD] [^1113HBKz] [^116uttQq] [^1129Grud].

> Hmm, wait a minute — at first I thought there was a robust randomized trial for infliximab in PG, but let me verify: within the provided references, infliximab support here is predominantly retrospective and case-based for IBD-associated PG rather than randomized, so I should be transparent about the evidence level while acknowledging clinical effectiveness in series and aligning with pathophysiologic plausibility related to TNF-driven neutrophilic inflammation [^1123qKFT] [^112TTVVB] [^113aKYTE].

> I will now examine the role of surgery and advanced wound technologies, but I need to ensure disease is immunosuppressed first to mitigate pathergy: negative pressure wound therapy combined with split-thickness skin grafting can be effective once inflammation is controlled, with high rates of success reported across aggregated case series; perioperative reviews suggest that with proper immunosuppression, postoperative worsening is not the rule, and reconstructive options including free flaps have been reported, while specialized debridement approaches such as maggot therapy can be considered for bio-burden reduction in selected cases [^114p3eGr] [^1144Cnse] [^113XzjpQ] [^111xZ1XZ] [^113ZyQ2M].

> Let me think about safety monitoring and relapse prevention, because this often determines long-term outcomes: on prednisolone I should watch for infections, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and mood changes, and on ciclosporin I must track creatinine, blood pressure, and electrolytes; biologics require TB and hepatitis screening and vigilant infection surveillance, as combined immunosuppression can predispose to opportunistic pathogens as illustrated by angioinvasive fungal complications; relapse after taper is common, so a slow taper with transition to a maintenance-sparing agent can reduce recurrence while minimizing toxicity [^116oUjJs] [^114eb8ne] [^1134zY7L].

> Hold on, I should verify that my pathophysiology framing supports targeted choices: PG lesions exhibit neutrophil-dominant inflammation with elevated TNF-α, IL-1, IL-17, and IL-23 signaling, and T cell–macrophage activity at wound edges, which provides a mechanistic rationale for anti-TNF, IL-1 blockade, IL-17/23 axis inhibitors, and even JAK pathway agents in refractory cases, though evidence quality varies and personalized selection should reflect comorbidity and prior response patterns [^113Auyvc] [^112TTVVB] [^111srFg3] [^112cPpUq].

> To close the loop, I should ensure a structured follow-up plan: reassess ulcer size, pain, and edge inflammation at 2–4 week intervals early on, document with serial photos, titrate steroids based on clinical response, and escalate promptly if the trajectory stalls; align multidisciplinary care with dermatology, wound care, gastroenterology, surgery, and obstetrics as appropriate, and educate patients to avoid trauma at sites of minor injury to limit pathergy and to seek early review for signs of infection or flare, as timely adjustments can prevent deterioration and reduce cumulative morbidity [^116AL4Ge] [^1129SYxM] [^1144Cnse].

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is best managed with a **stepwise approach**, starting with **topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors** for mild/localized disease, and escalating to **systemic corticosteroids or cyclosporine** for moderate-to-severe or rapidly progressive cases [^114eb8ne] [^113Auyvc] [^112heRBc]. For refractory disease, escalate to **biologics (infliximab, adalimumab)** or other immunosuppressants (mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, dapsone) [^1123qKFT] [^115mBDUi] [^114eb8ne]. Wound care should avoid trauma by using **gentle cleansing**, **nonadherent dressings**, and **compression** when appropriate [^116AL4Ge]. Surgery is reserved for stable disease under immunosuppression, and a **multidisciplinary team** is essential to optimize outcomes and minimize recurrence [^114p3eGr] [^1144Cnse] [^1129SYxM].

---

## Topical therapies

Topical therapies are indicated for mild or localized PG lesions and are generally well tolerated; they control inflammation and promote healing [^112heRBc]. High-potency topical corticosteroids (e.g. clobetasol propionate 0.05%) are effective for **localized PG** [^114eb8ne], with 42.6% of patients achieving complete healing at 6 months and a median healing time of 136 days [^112uWtET]. Tacrolimus ointment (0.03% or 0.1%) has demonstrated efficacy in **localized PG** [^114eb8ne], with complete response rates reported in small case series.

---

## Systemic therapies

Systemic therapies are indicated for **moderate-to-severe PG**, rapidly progressive disease, or lesions **refractory to topical treatments** [^113Auyvc].

---

### First-line systemic therapies

Prednisone (0.5–1 mg/kg/day) is a **first-line therapy** that induces clinical response in approximately 40–50% of cases; pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day for 3–5 days) may be used for rapid control [^114eb8ne] [^113Auyvc]. Cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor dosed at 4–5 mg/kg/day, is effective as **first-line therapy** — particularly when corticosteroids are contraindicated — with the STOP GAP trial demonstrating efficacy comparable to prednisolone [^114eb8ne] [^115XjVET] [^113XDmu6].

---

### Second-line systemic therapies

- **Mycophenolate mofetil**: Effective as a steroid-sparing agent, with clinical improvement reported in 84.6% of patients in a retrospective study [^115mBDUi].

- **Methotrexate**: Used as an alternative immunosuppressant, particularly in patients with contraindications to other therapies [^113Auyvc].

- **Dapsone**: An anti-inflammatory antibiotic effective in partial or complete healing in approximately 96.9% of treatment episodes in a retrospective review [^113ovaPV].

---

### Biologic therapies

Biologic agents targeting specific cytokines have emerged as effective treatments for refractory PG [^113aKYTE]. TNF-α inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab) achieve **complete response rates of approximately 67%** [^114eb8ne] [^1123qKFT]. Interleukin pathway agents such as **ustekinumab** (IL-12/23 inhibitor) and **anakinra** (IL-1 receptor antagonist) have also demonstrated efficacy in refractory cases [^112k2Kso] [^114g56Dc].

---

## Wound care and supportive measures

Effective **wound care** is essential in PG management. The TIME (Tissue, Infection/Inflammation, Moisture, Edge) model guides wound care strategies [^116AL4Ge]:

- **Gentle cleansing**: Avoid sharp debridement due to pathergy risk.

- **Nonadherent dressings**: Silicone or foam dressings to minimize trauma.

- **Compression therapy**: Useful for lower extremity ulcers to reduce edema and promote healing.

- **Pain management**: Topical lidocaine or systemic analgesics as needed [^114eb8ne].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgical interventions are generally avoided due to the **risk of pathergy** [^113Auyvc]. However, in selected cases with stable disease under immunosuppression, surgical debridement, skin grafting, or negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) may be considered [^114p3eGr] [^1144Cnse].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

A **multidisciplinary approach** involving dermatologists, rheumatologists, gastroenterologists, wound care specialists, and plastic surgeons is essential for optimal management of PG. It ensures comprehensive care by addressing underlying systemic diseases, optimizing wound care, and minimizing recurrence [^1129SYxM] [^113Auyvc].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies under investigation include:

- **Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors**: Tofacitinib and upadacitinib have shown promise in refractory PG cases [^113He9tG] [^116uttQq] [^111L9Y7p].

- **Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors**: Apremilast has been reported effective in case reports [^1144iftK].

- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: Effective as adjunct therapy in refractory cases [^1115tTnm] [^114eb8ne].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment choice is influenced by **disease severity** and extent (localized versus widespread), patient **comorbidities** (e.g. renal insufficiency, malignancy, obesity, diabetes), and previous treatment responses, including **refractory** or relapsing disease. Patient preferences — such as tolerability, convenience, and cost considerations — also play a key role [^114eb8ne] [^112heRBc] [^113Auyvc].

---

## Recurrence and long-term management

Recurrence is **common in PG**, with relapse rates of approximately 30% reported in the STOP GAP trial [^115XjVET]. Long-term management includes maintenance immunosuppression, regular follow-up, and patient education to recognize early signs of recurrence [^114eb8ne].

---

Pyoderma gangrenosum treatment involves a **stepwise approach**, starting with topical therapies for mild cases and escalating to systemic immunosuppressants and biologics for severe or refractory disease [^113Auyvc]. Effective wound care, supportive measures, and a multidisciplinary approach are essential for optimal outcomes [^116AL4Ge]. Emerging therapies such as JAK inhibitors and IVIG offer promising options for refractory cases [^116uttQq] [^1115tTnm].

### Therapy insight: Pyoderma gangrenosum-old disease, new management [^1129SYxM]. Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Well-designed studies that help guide physicians to apply the optimal therapeutic strategy for the management of pyoderma gangrenosum are lacking in the literature. A multidisciplinary approach is paramount for the effective management of this condition, with close involvement of a wound-care specialist and a microbiologist. Treatment should be stepwise in nature. Local wound care, avoidance of trauma, and the application of local steroid or tacrolimus ointment are the first-line treatments. Steroid therapy is the most widely published effective therapy for achieving resolution of pyoderma gangrenosum, although there is growing evidence for the efficacy of infliximab in refractory cases. Other therapies, such as dapsone and clofazamine, should be left as third-line agents for refractory pyoderma gangrenosum, while novel treatments such as granulocyte apheresis should only be used under trial conditions to gain an objective evaluation of their efficacy. This article reviews the published treatment strategies in use and aims to guide the effective management of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Surgical treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with negative pressure wound therapy and skin grafting, including xenografts: Personal experience and comprehensive review on 161 cases [^114p3eGr]. Advances in Wound Care (2020). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, debilitating autoinflammatory ulcerative skin disease. No gold standard has been established for its treatment. The role of surgical interventions and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was discussed controversially until recently, as these procedures might potentially aggravate the condition.

Recent advances confirm a paradigm shift, suggesting that a surgical approach to PG with split thickness skin grafting (STSG) secured by NPWT is a safe and effective treatment when performed under adequate immunosuppression. Our findings are based on a broad literature search of 101 relevant articles describing 138 patients, complemented by our personal experience with 23 patients, including 2 treated with a porcine xenodressing.

A wide range of surgical approaches have been reported, including xenografts. Treatment was successful in 86% of cases, including those involving xenotransplants. Ten percent showed improvement, while failures were mainly reported without immunosuppression. Although NPWT alone can halt the inflammatory process, it does not significantly accelerate healing time without skin grafting. The best surgical approach appears to be STSG fixed with NPWT, as it leads to better skin graft take.

Nevertheless, the chronic nature of PG and the possibility of recurrence after reducing immunosuppression or trauma remain problematic; thus, sustained immunosuppressive treatment is suggested. While surgical treatment is supported by existing data, the precise immunosuppressive regimen requires further investigation.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^114eb8ne]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

The anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids (CS) is attributed to their transcription-altering effects, particularly the inhibition of NF-κB, which leads to the downregulation of many proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules. The rapid onset of action has established systemic CS as a first-line option in treating pyoderma gangrenosum (PG).

Treatment with systemic CS at a dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg/day induces a clinical response in about 40–50% of cases. Complete response rates vary widely depending on associated systemic diseases and the severity of PG. Once healing is achieved, the CS dose can be tapered over a period ranging from 4–6 weeks to 12–24 weeks, according to the clinical course, comorbidities, and the risk of relapse. Pulse therapy with 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone for 3–5 consecutive days, followed by oral CS, may result in a faster onset of action and aid in tapering oral CS.

As complete remission is achieved in only 40% and relapse prevention in just 20% of those with multi-lesional PG, it is recommended to combine systemic CS with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory adjuvants in severe cases. The most common agent used in combination is cyclosporine.

### Topical tacrolimus therapy for pyoderma gangrenosum [^116SEsBu]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a type of neutrophilic disorder characterized by a chronic clinical course. Immunosuppressive agents have been used for its management, with corticosteroids known to be the most effective. However, for patients with PG who are refractory to systemic steroids, other immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine A, have been considered. Herein, we report a case of PG resistant to systemic steroids, which was successfully treated with topical tacrolimus.

A fifty-four-year-old male presented with a 14-year history of PG. In 2002, necrotic ulcers appeared on his right leg and were refractory to oral prednisolone (30 mg/day). The application of topical tacrolimus to the border of the ulcers hastened the epithelization of the ulcers and allowed for the reduction of oral prednisolone. Topical tacrolimus therapy may be an effective alternative for PG when the lesion is poorly controlled by corticosteroid therapy.

### Targeted therapy with ixekizumab in pyoderma gangrenosum: A case series and a literature overview [^111gJHJx]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: As the underlying pathology of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is due to immune dysregulation, immunosuppression is the mainstay of treatment. Topical or intralesional corticosteroids are used to treat small, localized lesions. Systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine are first-line agents for rapidly progressive lesions. However, one multicenter randomized clinical trial of 121 patients showed less than 50% achieved remission at six months with either prednisolone or cyclosporine. The majority experienced at least one therapy-induced adverse reaction, with 66% and 68% in the prednisolone and cyclosporine groups, respectively.

Sulfasalazine, tacrolimus, thalidomide, azathioprine, minocycline, methotrexate, clofazimine, mycophenolate mofetil, and dapsone have also been used as monotherapy for the treatment of PG. Intravenous immunoglobulin is an efficacious non-pharmacologic option with an attractive safety profile in the context of active infection or malignancy. Due to concerns about cost with repeated infusions, intravenous immunoglobulin is generally used early and subsequently transitioned to another medication.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^1125ezzo]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, debilitating inflammatory skin disease clinically characterized by painful, rapidly evolving cutaneous ulcers with undermined, irregular, erythematous-violaceous edges. First described by Brocq and Simon in 1908 as "phagédénisme géométrique" and subsequently renamed by Brunsting et al. in 1930, PG represents the prototype of neutrophilic dermatoses and is currently classified within deep/hypodermal neutrophilic dermatoses, with a worldwide estimated incidence of 3–10 cases per million people per year.

Several clinical variants have been described, including classic ulcerative, bullous, pustular, vegetative, peristomal, and postoperative:

- **Classic ulcerative**: Characterized by typical ulcerations.
- **Bullous**: Hallmarked by blisters that are present at onset and later evolve into ulcerative lesions.
- **Vegetative**: Lesions usually develop on the surface of a previously classic ulcerative PG, often during treatment.
- **Pustular**: Lesions usually precede or are concomitant to PG ulcers.

PG lesions mostly affect the lower limbs. PG may be idiopathic or associated with systemic conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), rheumatological disorders, hematological malignancies, or present in the setting of autoinflammatory syndromes. Examples include PAPA (Pyogenic Arthritis, PG, and Acne), PASH (PG, Acne, and Suppurative Hidradenitis), PAPASH (Pyogenic Arthritis, PG, Acne, and Suppurative Hidradenitis), and in a small proportion of SAPHO (Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis, and Osteitis) cases.

### Guselkumab as a treatment option for recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum [^112KokTD]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Sixteen months later, a relapse occurred while the patient still received ustekinumab, with ulceration and associated pain. Assuming the development of neutralizing autoantibodies against ustekinumab, the patient was placed on, and subsequently failed both adalimumab and infliximab sequentially. The ulcer expanded to approximately 60% of her left lower leg circumference, with re-exposure of tendon and muscle (Fig 1). The patient was then administered intravenous immunoglobulin by her oncologist for potential management of both the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Additionally, prednisone was instituted, which arrested disease progression.

- **Figure 1**: Severe PG involving the left lower extremity with muscle and tendon exposure in May 2019 when ustekinumab was initiated.

Given the previous response to an IL-12/23 antagonist and failure of two tumor necrosis factor alfa inhibitors, we speculated that inhibiting IL-23 with guselkumab might halt and even reverse disease progression. Within weeks of starting guselkumab at 100 mg monthly dosing, the ulcer bed began retreating from underlying exposed muscles and tendons. Within three months, the ulcer was virtually non-existent. Re-epithelialization was notable over 95% of the original ulcer. The response was found to be durable, with continued remission of her PG after 15 months (Fig 2).

### Skin ulcers misdiagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum [^113ZkKzs]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a diagnosis of exclusion, and misdiagnosis can lead to substantial complications in patients with other causes of severe cutaneous ulceration.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the charts of 240 patients diagnosed with pyoderma gangrenosum at our institution from 1975 through 2000, including 157 consecutive patients treated from 1984 through 1992. We also reviewed the English-language literature.

- **Results**: Ninety-five patients (49 from our institution and 46 from the literature) had skin ulcers clinically resembling pyoderma gangrenosum. The final diagnoses included vascular occlusive or venous disease, vasculitis, cancer, primary infection, drug-induced or exogenous tissue injury, and other inflammatory disorders. Of the 95 patients studied, 64 had been treated for pyoderma gangrenosum for a median of 10 months (range, 3 to 180). These 64 included 15 of the 157 consecutive patients treated at our institution (10 percent). Of the ulcers in the 64 patients treated, it was evident that those in 23 patients (36 percent) did not respond to treatment directed at pyoderma gangrenosum, those in 8 (12 percent) worsened with such treatment, and those in 15 (23 percent) improved with such treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Misdiagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is not uncommon and exposes patients to risks associated with its treatment. A thorough evaluation is necessary for all patients suspected of having pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Pathophysiology of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG): an updated review [^117X3E3x]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a challenging skin condition to identify and treat because of its multifactorial pathogenesis. It is a rare cutaneous manifestation diagnosed clinically by exclusion of infection, neoplasia, thrombophilia, and other inflammatory conditions. Pathogenetic and treatment studies are scarce. Abnormalities in the function of inflammatory cytokines, the immune system, and neutrophils, combined with specific genetic mutations, predispose patients to develop this complex disease process. Early recognition of patients at risk for pyoderma gangrenosum, the necessity to improve its early diagnosis, and the future outlook of targeted and personalized therapies rely on the improved comprehension of the complex pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Surgical management of pyoderma gangrenosum: case report and review [^116ucBwn]. Dermatologic Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum are medical, with immunosuppressive agents employed most often.

- **Objective**: To report a case and discuss the indications for radical surgical treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.

- **Methods**: Analysis of a case of Crohn's disease-associated pyoderma gangrenosum treated with immunosuppression followed by amputation, and a review of the literature on surgical management of pyoderma gangrenosum.

- **Results**: In unstable patients with intractable multiple medical problems, surgical treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum may be indicated by the existence of these life-threatening comorbidities. The recent literature suggests that surgical management of pyoderma gangrenosum may also be appropriate in other special circumstances.

- **Conclusions**: Surgical management, including amputation, may have a role in the management of pyoderma gangrenosum. Further research is needed to delineate precisely the circumstances and patient factors that are appropriate indications for such surgery.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^112sgQmt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cyclosporine also proved effective in a case series of 26 patients with classical ulcerative PG. The study utilized the term episodes, defined from the appearance of lesion(s) until complete skin healing. Twenty-two patients had 51 episodes of PG, and they received a mean dose of 4.9 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine with a mean treatment duration of 14 weeks. Forty-nine episodes achieved complete healing, and the remaining two episodes achieved a partial response. Monotherapy was utilized in 22 of the 51 episodes, and the cyclosporine with prednisone combination was used in 13 episodes. Although most episodes resulted in complete healing, 14 patients experienced relapse when cyclosporine was tapered or discontinued.

A study of 21 patients highlighted the benefits of combining cyclosporine and prednisone in treating multi-lesional PG. Four patients with multi-lesional PG, refractory to systemic corticosteroid monotherapy, healed and achieved remission after the addition of cyclosporine. Three patients with disseminated PG achieved a complete response, with two remaining in remission at the time of follow-up.

Overall, and also in our experience, cyclosporine is highly effective in treating classical ulcerative PG and should also be considered a first-line option for PG.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum in pregnancy: A systematic review of clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes, and maternofetal implications [^111u5wc1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Although cases of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) during pregnancy have been reported, comprehensive data are limited. This review aims to analyze the demographic and clinical characteristics of PG in pregnant and postpartum patients, assess the frequency and effectiveness of treatments, and explore the maternal and fetal implications of PG.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, with searches in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to September 27, 2023. Studies were included if they reported PG during pregnancy or within six weeks postpartum. Data extraction and screening were independently performed by two reviewers using Covidence.

- **Results**: Sixty-two studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 63 patient cases. Most cases (N = 55, 87.3%) occurred without inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatologic disease. PG was frequently misdiagnosed (N = 45), resulting in treatment delays and inappropriate interventions. Fifty-six cases (88.9%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids, while 21 (33.3%) were treated with cyclosporine. Emergency Cesarean section was the most common pregnancy complication (N = 19).

- **Discussion**: Increased awareness of PG in pregnant or postpartum patients could reduce misdiagnosis and improve outcomes. Immunological changes during pregnancy may trigger PG in susceptible patients, yet the safety and efficacy of treatment options are not well-established in this population, underscoring the need for research to guide management.

### Guselkumab as a treatment option for recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum [^1129Grud]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

This case demonstrates a common conundrum among providers treating patients with recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Case reports have identified IL-1/IL-6 antagonists, Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription inhibitors, and phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors; however, none have evaluated guselkumab despite the significance of IL-23 expression. PG can be a severely debilitating disease, and the need for evidence-based treatment is crucial. A larger trial analyzing the effect of IL-23 targeting biologics for the treatment of PG would be helpful in further defining the role of this medication within the existing treatment algorithm.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: A review for the gastroenterologist [^111X4U4H]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare ulcerative skin disease of unknown etiology often associated with systemic inflammatory conditions, most commonly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The most common presentation of PG is the spontaneous rapid formation of an extremely painful ulcer on the extremities, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Rarely, PG can also occur as a chronic peristomal complication or as an acute postoperative complication of a surgical wound. The clinical course is unpredictable. It may not correlate with IBD activity and may even precede a diagnosis of IBD. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment is challenging, often involving a variety of immunosuppressive therapies. This review aims to provide an update for the gastroenterologist on the pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and management of PG, a rare complication of IBD.

### Clinical guidance of pyoderma gangrenosum 2022 [^112heRBc]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic skin disease. To ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of PG, the Japanese clinical practice guidance for PG, developed by the Japanese Dermatological Association, was published in 2022. This guidance covers clinical aspects, pathogenesis, therapies, and clinical questions on PG from the perspectives of knowledge and evidence-based medicine. The English version of these guidelines is presented here and is intended to be widely used in the clinical examination and treatment of PG.

### New treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum and hidradenitis suppurativa: A review [^111srFg3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) are stubborn inflammatory skin diseases categorized as neutrophilic hypodermal dermatoses. These conditions exhibit connections with other autoinflammatory disorders driven by immune responses. Their pathogenesis is complex, rooted in significant imbalances in both innate and adaptive immune systems, particularly featuring elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8, IL-17, and IL-23. Studies involving skin tissue pathology and serology have indicated that targeting specific cytokines can bring therapeutic benefits. Indeed, many patients in clinical settings have responded positively to such interventions.

Given the diverse cytokines in play, focusing on a single one with antibody therapy might not always be effective. When resistance to biologics emerges, a combined approach targeting multiple overactive cytokines with immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine and Janus kinase inhibitors, could be an option. In the review, we explore recent therapeutic developments for PG and HS.

### Two cases of maggot debridement therapy in pyoderma gangrenosum [^111xZ1XZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by cutaneous ulceration. PG primarily affects young and middle-aged adults, with a preference for women, and is often associated with an underlying systemic disease. Although its etiology is unclear, neutrophilic dysfunction, genetic risk factors, and chronic inflammation are thought to contribute to its pathogenesis. Patients with classic PG often present with single or multiple ulcers, commonly on the lower extremities or trunk. In addition to medical treatment, wound care to combat the accumulation of necrotic tissue debris and biofilm formation is required for optimal management.

Wound debridement often presents a challenge in PG because of its feature of pathergy, or exacerbation in response to incidental or iatrogenic trauma, which has been reported in up to 31% of cases. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT), a centuries-old tradition in medical history involving the placement of larvae over a wound to digest necrotic tissue, has seen a recent resurgence in popularity. The technology behind this technique has evolved with controlled therapeutic myiasis, in which the live larvae are enclosed within a nylon mesh bag so they are obscured from view and cannot escape. In this case series, we review two cases of longstanding PG that were successfully debrided with MDT.

### Eligibility criteria for active ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum in clinical trials: A Delphi consensus on behalf of the UPGRADE (Understanding Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Review and Assessment of Disease Effects) group [^1156z9yb]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

At present, there are no standardized guidelines for determining patient eligibility for pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) clinical trials. Thus, we aim to determine which clinical features, histopathological features, or laboratory features should be included in active ulcerative PG clinical trial eligibility criteria for treatment-naïve patients and patients already treated with immunomodulating medications (treatment-exposed patients).

This study employed four rounds of the Delphi technique. Electronic surveys were administered to 21 international board-certified dermatologists and plastic surgeon PG experts from June 2022 to December 2022. Our results demonstrated that for a patient to be eligible for a PG trial, they must meet the following criteria:

- **Ulcer characteristics**: Presence of ulcer(s) with erythematous/violaceous undermining wound borders and a painful or tender ulcer.
- **Disease history**: History or presence of rapidly progressing disease.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Exclusion of infection and other causes of cutaneous ulceration.
- **Biopsy requirement**: Biopsy for H&E staining.
- **Pathergy**: Presence or history of pathergy.

These criteria vary in importance for treatment-naïve versus treatment-exposed patients. Given the international cohort, we were unable to facilitate live discussions between rounds. This Delphi consensus study provides a set of specific, standardized eligibility criteria for PG clinical trials, thus addressing one of the main issues hampering progress toward Food and Drug Administration approval of medications for PG.

### Targeted therapy with ixekizumab in pyoderma gangrenosum: A case series and a literature overview [^113aKYTE]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Biologics targeting specific cytokine mediators are reported to be safe alternative treatments. Inhibition of the tumor necrosis factor-α pathway through infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab is an effective measure. Skin biopsies of pyoderma gangrenosum borders have shown elevated expression of IL-23A in multiple cases. Ustekinumab, an agent used for plaque psoriasis, has yielded multiple successful outcomes in pyoderma gangrenosum cases without adverse effects. In addition, IL-1 antagonists may be effective in treating recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum. O'Connor et al. reported 100% healing with anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist that blocks the activity of IL-1α and IL-1β, in 2 patients with multiple comorbidities.

Here, we have described four cases of pyoderma gangrenosum that resolved with IL-17 inhibition from ixekizumab without reported adverse effects. Other immunomodulating agents such as brodalumab (anti–IL-17R) and secukinumab (anti–IL-17A) are being proposed as available alternatives. The predominance of neutrophils in pyoderma gangrenosum makes inhibiting neutrophil migration through IL-17 a promising target. Secukinumab, a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting IL-17A, was used in a 50-year-old woman with pyoderma gangrenosum. Complete response was observed within three months and with no recurrence after an additional two months of maintenance therapy. Brodalumab, an IL-17A receptor antagonist, has also yielded rapid resolution. In a 23-year-old man with acne conglobata, hidradenitis suppurativa, and a two-year history of pyoderma gangrenosum (pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa syndrome) refractory to systemic corticosteroids, adalimumab, and adjuvant methotrexate, an effective treatment was observed.

### Genital pyoderma gangrenosum: Report of two cases and published work review of Japanese cases [^112dPcE6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an ulcerative skin disorder characterized by non-infectious ulcers, affecting the lower extremities in approximately 70% of cases. It is commonly associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hematological malignancies. In this report, we describe two cases of Japanese patients diagnosed with genital pyoderma gangrenosum.

- **Case 1**: A 74-year-old woman with no associated systemic complications. Her skin lesion, limited to the vulva, resembled squamous cell carcinoma.

- **Case 2**: An 89-year-old man suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, presented with penile and leg ulcers mimicking pressure sores.

Both cases responded well to systemic steroids. We review 13 cases of genital pyoderma gangrenosum (76.9% male; aged 30–89 years) from 1996 to 2012 in Japan, which include 11 previously reported cases and the two cases from this study. Four of these 13 cases had associated systemic diseases, and their skin lesions spread to the extragenital areas. Among the remaining nine cases localized to genitalia, eight had no associated systemic diseases.

In conclusion, genital pyoderma gangrenosum is rare and often misdiagnosed. It should be considered in cases of refractory genital ulcers. Additionally, genitalia-localized pyoderma gangrenosum typically lacks systemic complications.

### Recalcitrant and severe pyoderma gangrenosum attributable to levamisole-adulterated cocaine and treated successfully with oral tofacitinib [^113He9tG]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, inflammatory, neutrophilic dermatosis that is diagnosed by exclusion. We present a unique case of recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum attributable to levamisole-adulterated cocaine, with variable and nonsustained responses to several systemic immunosuppressants, ultimately achieving remission with oral tofacitinib.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^113jcsAJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Thalidomide has been shown to be effective in treating refractory pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) in many case reports. It may modulate NF-κB-related proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and reduce CD8+ T cells. Thalidomide can also selectively inhibit TNF-α production from monocytes. Case reports indicate that it can be used in cases of primary or idiopathic PG when traditional treatments fail. It has been proposed as monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids (CS) or immunomodulatory agents, such as dapsone. Reported dosages of thalidomide range from 100 to 400 mg/day. It is important to keep in mind the teratogenicity of thalidomide and the rare side effect of peripheral neuropathy.

### PG-TIME: A practical approach to the clinical management of pyoderma gangrenosum [^116AL4Ge]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis that may progress rapidly. Standard guidelines for local treatment are lacking. Through our experience, we suggested a local treatment algorithm based on the tissue, infection, moisture balance, and epithelization (TIME) concept. The clinical and histopathological features of 52 patients with PG, the duration, and the evolution of the lesions were retrospectively evaluated. Systemic therapies, local treatments, and standard wound treatments were reported.

We observed ulcerative PG in the majority of the patients (82.6%), followed by the pustular form (9.6%), peristomal type (3.8%), vegetative form (1.9%), and bullous type (1.9%). The lower leg was the most commonly affected area (90.4% of cases). Pathergy was reported in 15.3% of cases. The first-line treatment was the use of oral glucocorticosteroids (GCSs). Healing was observed after 3 weeks of GCS in 17.3% of cases. In 25% of cases, complete healing was obtained with long-term low doses (< 0.5 mg/kg) of GCS over 2 to 6 months. Second-line treatments were used in 57.6% of patients.

Local and systemic treatment, combined with proper wound management, can be associated with better clinical results. We suggest a new local therapeutic algorithm applicable in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory healing phases.

### Management of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum [^115X4uib]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

This study was designed to evaluate the presentation, management, and outcome of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum at a specialist colorectal unit and to develop a strategy for therapy.

- **Methods**: Patients with peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum were identified from a prospectively accrued Institutional Review Board-approved stoma database. Data were collected regarding demographics, disease status, history of illness, time to healing, and treatments used from the database and by chart review.

- **Results**: Sixteen patients presented between 1997 and 2002 with peristomal ulceration consistent with a diagnosis of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum. Diagnosis was predominantly clinically based on a classic presentation of painful, undermined peristomal ulceration. The underlying diagnosis was Crohn's disease in 11 patients, ulcerative colitis in 3, indeterminate colitis in 1, and posterior urethral valves in 1. At the time of development of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum, the underlying disease was active in 69 percent of patients. Stoma care, ulcer debridement with unroofing of undermined edges, and intralesional corticosteroid injection were associated with a 40 percent complete response rate and a further 40 percent partial response rate. Of five patients who received infliximab, four (80 percent) responded to therapy. Complete response after all forms of therapy, including stoma relocation in seven patients, was 87 percent.

- **Conclusions**: Local wound management and enterostomal therapy are extremely important for patients with peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum. Infliximab may provide additional therapeutic benefit.

### Role of inflammatory cells, cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in neutrophil-mediated skin diseases [^111AfJkT]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease presenting with painful ulcers with undermined edges. Less commonly, bullous and vegetative variants exist. Histology consists of a neutrophil-rich dermal infiltrate. We characterized immunohistochemically the infiltrate in different variants of PG and in another neutrophilic dermatosis such as Sweet's syndrome. We studied 21 patients with PG, eight with Sweet's syndrome, and 20 controls, evaluating skin immunoreactivity for inflammatory cell markers (CD3, CD163, and myeloperoxidase), cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-8, and IL-17], metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Immunoreactivities of CD3, CD163, myeloperoxidase, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-17, MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF were significantly higher in both PG and Sweet's syndrome than in controls (P = 0.0001). Myeloperoxidase (neutrophil marker), IL-8 (cytokine chemotactic for neutrophils), and MMP-9 (proteinase-mediating tissue damage) were expressed more significantly in both ulcerative and bullous PG than in vegetative PG as well as in Sweet's syndrome (P = 0.008–P = 0.0001). In ulcerative PG, the expression of CD3 (pan T-cell marker) and CD163 (macrophage marker) were significantly higher in the wound edge than in the wound bed (P = 0.0001). In contrast, the neutrophil marker myeloperoxidase was expressed more significantly in the wound bed than in the wound edge (P = 0.0001).

Our study identifies PG as a paradigm of neutrophil-mediated inflammation, with proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and MMPs acting as important factors.

### Successful treatment of severe refractory post-cesarean pyoderma gangrenosum with intravenous immunoglobulin [^112b1neV]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by rapidly progressing necrolytic ulceration of the skin. Proper treatment is crucial since it can result in devastating consequences. First-line treatments include systemic corticosteroids or cyclosporine. However, no standardized treatment regimens for refractory cases exist, and treatment outcomes are affected by underlying conditions. PG after cesarean section, which is believed to occur in association with underlying pregnancy- and parturition-related immune changes, is extremely rare. All reported cases in the literature have been successfully treated with systemic or topical corticosteroids.

We report a case of a 32-year-old patient with severe PG occurring on her cesarean scar 3 days after the cesarean delivery. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids and first-line immunomodulatory agents resulted in insufficient response and serious complications. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was then initiated, and a rapid clinical response was seen. The corticosteroid dose was gradually decreased and ceased. IVIG infusion was continued for 3 months until complete recovery. Reactivation was not observed in a 1-year follow-up period.

Due to its cost, IVIG infusion is less suitable as a first-line agent. However, IVIG may be an important therapeutic option in resistant postpartum PG, in which first-line agents have failed or led to complications.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: A misdiagnosis [^116n9NsW]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, commonly mistaken for an infection. Here, we report the case of a 55-year-old woman with an infectious process that was initially misdiagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum and treated accordingly. We also discuss the criteria and the methods available to diagnose infections and pyoderma gangrenosum correctly.

### Resolution of therapy-resistant pyoderma gangrenosum with upadacitinib [^116uttQq]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, administered orally or topically, represent a relatively new therapeutic option for several immune-driven dermatologic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, alopecia areata, and vitiligo. In the future, we may be able to expand the indications to include therapy-resistant pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). PG is often challenging to treat due to therapy resistance, frequent relapses, and the varying effectiveness of sparse (and mostly off-label) treatment options, highlighting a clear need for additional therapeutic approaches.

### Refractory postsurgical pyoderma gangrenosum in a patient with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome: response to multimodal therapy [^1116KbCz]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis that may be difficult to diagnose and treat. We presented a 41-year-old woman who required skin grafting following third-degree burns to her left breast. She suffered recurrent graft dehiscence and infections over many years, prompting elective bilateral reduction mammoplasty. She subsequently developed suture margin ulcerations unresponsive to topical therapies and antibiotics. Skin biopsies were non-specific, and a clinical diagnosis of PG was established. Although initially responsive to corticosteroids, wounds promptly recurred following steroid taper. She was treated unsuccessfully with various immunomodulatory agents and underwent elective bilateral mastectomy. Following the mastectomy, she developed progressive deep chest wall ulcerations. She failed numerous immunomodulatory treatments, surgical wound closure, and negative pressure wound therapy. Ultimately, treatment with adalimumab, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone, in addition to hyperbaric oxygen therapy, facilitated progressive healing. Our case highlights the role of collaborative multimodal therapy for the treatment of refractory PG.

### Genetic mutations in pyoderma gangrenosum, hidradenitis suppurativa, and associated autoinflammatory syndromes: Insights into pathogenic mechanisms and shared pathways [^111g5FT5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), and the associated autoinflammatory syndromes, including pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome; PSTPIP1-associated myeloid-related proteinemia inflammatory (PAMI) syndrome; pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa (PASH) syndrome; and pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and suppurative hidradenitis (PAPASH) syndrome, are dermatological conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Recent advances in genetic research have identified specific mutations associated with these disorders, shedding light on their underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This review aims to summarize the knowledge of identified mutations and presumed pathophysiology in PG, HS, and the associated autoinflammatory syndromes.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum [^113Auyvc]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2020). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by rapidly developing, painful skin ulcers with undermined borders and peripheral erythema. Epidemiological studies show that the average age of PG onset is in the mid-40s, with an incidence of a few cases per million person-years. PG is often associated with various immune-mediated diseases, most commonly inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

The exact cause of PG is not well understood; however, it is generally regarded as an autoinflammatory disorder. Studies have highlighted the role of T cells, particularly at the wound margin, which may support the destructive autoinflammatory response of the innate immune system. Diagnosing PG can be challenging due to possible differential diagnoses. It requires both clinical examination and laboratory tests on biopsied wound tissue for accuracy. New validated diagnostic criteria aim to facilitate this process.

Treatment of PG usually begins with fast-acting immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids and/or cyclosporine to reduce inflammation. This is often followed by more slowly acting immunosuppressive drugs with better adverse event profiles, including biologics — in particular, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. Appropriate wound care is also essential. Future research should focus on PG-specific outcome measures and quality-of-life studies related to PG.

### Guselkumab as a treatment option for recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum [^113iVquG]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic cutaneous disorder characterized by single or multiple inflammatory nodules, papules, or pustules that rapidly ulcerate with undermined borders, tenderness, and cribriform scarring upon healing. It is a challenging condition to identify, given initial misdiagnosis and mismanagement with physical debridement, propensity for superinfection, and rarity. Furthermore, once the correct diagnosis is recognized, therapeutic challenges include promptly implementing an effective treatment to prevent rapid progression with concomitant morbidity and distress to the patient. Treatment options include topical and intralesional steroids, systemic glucocorticoids, conventional immunosuppressants, biologics, and intravenous immunoglobulin.

We present the novel use of guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL)-23, as an effective and safe treatment option for severe and recalcitrant PG.

### Infliximab for treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum associated with inflammatory bowel disease [^1123qKFT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an immune-mediated inflammatory condition characterized by ulcerative skin lesions affecting 1–2% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Treatment includes wound care, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators. However, response to therapy varies, and many patients with pyoderma gangrenosum have disease that is refractory to these agents. The aim of this study was to assess the response of medically refractory pyoderma gangrenosum to infliximab.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter retrospective study of patients with IBD and medically refractory pyoderma gangrenosum treated with infliximab. Data collected included baseline demographics; duration of IBD; history of bowel resection; duration of skin lesions; number, size, and location of pyoderma gangrenosum lesions; prior medications; dose and number of infliximab infusions; bowel activity before and after infliximab; pyoderma gangrenosum activity before and after infliximab therapy; time to response and time to healing of pyoderma gangrenosum lesions; recurrence of pyoderma gangrenosum after infliximab; corticosteroid taper; and adverse reactions to infliximab.

- **Results**: There were 13 patients with moderate to severe pyoderma gangrenosum and IBD treated with infliximab. All patients demonstrated complete healing of the skin lesions. Three patients had a complete response to induction infliximab therapy and did not require additional treatment. Ten patients responded to induction infliximab and have maintained pyoderma gangrenosum healing with infusions.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^1115tTnm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin, categorized as level of evidence 3A, has been utilized as an adjunct steroid-sparing agent and has shown success in treating refractory pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). In particular, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used as a second-line systemic therapy for disseminated or moderate-to-severe PG. Intravenous immunoglobulin is an appealing option because PG comorbidities may underlie contraindications to other, more commonly used systemic therapies.

- **Anti-inflammatory actions of IVIG**: The actions include hampering immune complex-mediated activation of FcγRs, reducing the half-life of circulating antibodies through neonatal Fc receptor binding, blocking complement activation, disrupting auto-reactive T-cell/antigen-presenting cell interactions, restoring the balance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and downregulating antibody production.

In a retrospective case series, 88% of patients responded to IVIG as adjunct therapy, with 53% achieving a complete response after an average treatment length of 5.9 months. The mean time to initial response was 3.5 weeks. The most common concurrent therapy was systemic corticosteroids. Notably, the time to initial response was reduced with increasing IVIG dose (> 2 g/kg), although the dosage did not have the same beneficial effect on overall treatment length. A retrospective study sought to determine the effects of IVIG incorporation in patients with treatment-resistant PG. A statistically significant improvement in complete healing with the addition of IVIG to treatment regimens was found in patients who had one resistant ulcer and no comorbidities.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^112uWtET]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

**Topical treatment and wound care**: Topical corticosteroids (Level of Evidence 2B) can be effective for the treatment of mild or localized/unilesional pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Typically, high-potency corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, are used. However, other corticosteroids have also been reported to be beneficial. In a prospective cohort study, 49 patients were treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream monotherapy, resulting in a median healing time of 136 days. Overall, 42.6% of patients healed completely at 6 months; however, 21.1% of these patients experienced subsequent recurrences. The size of the lesion at presentation was noted to be a significant predictor of time to healing.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^115W1yvV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Systemic tacrolimus (Level of Evidence 4) reduces the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines by binding to the FK-binding proteins in the cytoplasm. This process associates with calcium-dependent calcineurin/calmodulin complexes to interfere with lymphocyte signal transduction. Tacrolimus has also been found to be more potent than dexamethasone and cyclosporine A, common first-line options, in inhibiting T-cell activation-induced TNF-α and IL-1β production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

In a study of four patients, the efficacy of systemic tacrolimus was evaluated for classic ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum resistant to conventional therapy. All patients experienced a dramatic reduction in pain, erythema, and drainage within one week of treatment initiation. Three of the four patients achieved complete healing within 4–8 weeks.

In another report, two patients diagnosed with refractory pyoderma gangrenosum were successfully treated with systemic tacrolimus. Both patients started a treatment regimen of 30 mg/day of prednisolone combined with 2 mg/day of tacrolimus. The first patient healed in three months, and the second patient's ulcer decreased to a negligible size in six months.

Potential adverse effects of tacrolimus include hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, elevation in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and arterial hypertension. It is crucial to monitor blood concentrations and blood pressure, adjusting the dosage as needed.

### A rationale for adjuvant surgical intervention in pyoderma gangrenosum [^113ZyQ2M]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Medical specialists caring for patients with pyoderma gangrenosum have traditionally been reluctant to consult plastic surgeons. This reluctance stems from previous negative experiences with debridement and skin grafting. However, a new understanding of the disease's pathophysiology and better therapeutic options for control have emerged. Few studies report the results of surgical therapy for this disease, with even fewer documenting successful outcomes. The authors present their limited experience at the American University of Beirut, managing four patients who were medically controlled before undergoing skin grafting for their large wounds, thus decreasing morbidity and hospital stay. A review of the literature, together with insights on the rationale and timing of surgery for this specific small group of patients, is discussed.

### Anakinra for recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum [^112k2Kso]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an autoinflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by rapidly enlarging, painful ulcers. Anakinra is a recombinant interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist that blocks the activity of IL-1α and IL-1β by competitively inhibiting IL-1 binding to the IL-1 type 1 receptor.

We present a series of two patients with recalcitrant PG who had limited therapeutic options and multiple comorbidities, along with multiple previous treatment failures. These patients obtained 100% healing with anakinra. Compared with conventional first-line therapies for PG, the safety profile of anakinra may be preferable for patients with multiple comorbidities. Further research is needed to assess the safety and efficacy of anakinra for PG.

### Diagnosis and management of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum: A systematic review [^112ZTzGU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum (PPG) is an uncommon subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum, posing challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to the absence of evidence-based guidelines.

- **Objective**: We sought to identify important clinical features of PPG and effective treatments available for its management.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature review of PPG was performed using PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases.

- **Results**: We describe 335 patients with PPG from 79 studies. Clinical features include a painful, rapidly progressing ulcer with undermined, violaceous borders, often associated with a history of ostomy leakage and local skin irritation or trauma. Systemic steroids are first-line therapy; infliximab and adalimumab provide concomitant control of active inflammatory bowel disease. Combination local and systemic therapy was commonly used. Wound dressings, vehicle selection, and appropriate ostomy devices to minimize leakage, irritation, and pressure-induced ischemia can improve healing. Distinct from classic ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum, surgical approaches, such as stoma closure and resection of active inflammatory bowel disease, have an effective role in PPG management.

- **Limitations**: PPG is a rare disease lacking randomized trials or diagnostic guidelines. Treatment duration and follow-up time among studies are variable.

- **Conclusions**: Key clinical characteristics of PPG are highlighted. Several treatments, including a more prominent role for surgical intervention, may be effective for PPG treatment.

### Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with apremilast monotherapy [^1144iftK]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by rapidly developing painful ulcers with overhanging borders and peripheral erythema. It is typically treated with local and systemic immunomodulatory agents such as corticosteroids, cyclosporin, dapsone, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors, but many lesions exhibit treatment resistance or relapse following a successful therapeutic response.

Additionally, as there is currently a paucity of clinical data to guide the treatment of PG, management often revolves around guidelines set forth by case reports or small clinical trials, highlighting the need to identify novel therapeutic strategies for this disease. Here, we report a case of PG treated with apremilast monotherapy, which is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor.

### The role of interleukin-1β in pyoderma gangrenosum [^116LL9bL]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, inflammatory, and necrotizing disease that belongs to the group of neutrophilic dermatoses. The pathogenesis of PG remains unknown. In the last two years, some researchers have found a significant increase in interleukin (IL)-1β and in the IL-1β receptor in skin samples of PG patients.

Most PG cases respond to immunomodulators and immunosuppressants. However, there are no clear gold standards for PG treatment. Systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine are considered first-line treatments. Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate are considered second-line therapies.

Biologic agents, such as anti–tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) agents, show efficacy for a wide range of inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. Several studies report PG being successfully treated with infliximab (including one randomized, controlled trial), etanercept, and adalimumab. Infliximab is a chimeric IgG monoclonal antibody that blocks the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody IgG1 against TNF-α. Etanercept is a human TNF receptor fusion protein that inhibits the binding of TNF-α to TNF receptors on cells' surfaces.

Because a significant contribution of IL-1 to the pathogenesis of PG has been confirmed, biologic agents that inhibit IL-1 represent a therapeutic option in PG.

Our patient had ulcerative PG for 24 years. Her disease was refractory to systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, infliximab, and adalimumab. After treatment with canakinumab, she…

### Comparison of the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: Results of the STOP GAP randomised controlled trial [^115XjVET]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

Participants received oral prednisolone (brand chosen according to local practice) at 0.75 mg/kg/day in a single dose or ciclosporin (Neoral; Novartis) at 4 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. As this was a pragmatic trial, the dose could be adjusted according to normal practice, to a maximum of 1 mg/kg/day for prednisolone and 5 mg/kg/day for ciclosporin. Topical treatment was prohibited during the trial. A change to the protocol was made in August 2011 (after 82 participants had been enrolled), as bowel perforation was experienced by a participant receiving prednisolone 110 mg/day. As a result, we implemented ceiling doses of 75 mg/day for prednisolone and 400 mg/day for ciclosporin.

Participants were randomized (1:1) to treatment allocation using a web-based randomization system hosted by Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, employing a computer-generated pseudorandom list, with permuted blocks of randomly varying size between two and six (RALLOC add-on for Stata, TX). Randomization was stratified by target lesion size (< 20 cm²; ≥ 20 cm²) and presence or absence of underlying systemic disease. It was not possible to blind clinicians and participants to treatment allocation due to resource limitations and the complexities of different dosing regimens and safety testing of the two drugs. As a result, clinicians and participants were informed of their treatment allocation once data had been irrevocably entered into the randomization database. Treatment allocation was concealed from the statistician and blinded assessors of the digital images until the final analysis.

### Efficacy of systemic dapsone treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum: A retrospective review [^113ovaPV]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis commonly treated with steroid immunosuppression. The utility of dapsone as a non-immunosuppressive treatment for PG has been reported in case reports and series. We sought to evaluate the response and tolerability of continuous systemic dapsone therapy for treating PG.

- **Methods**: We reviewed PG patients treated with systemic dapsone at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital from 2000 to 2015. A treatment episode was defined as a minimum of 4 weeks of dapsone therapy with a documented response of complete, partial, or no improvement in wound healing.

- **Results**: 27 patients treated with systemic dapsone met inclusion criteria. 15.6% of treatment episodes demonstrated a response of complete healing, 81.3% of treatment episodes demonstrated a response of partial improvement, and 1 patient (3.1%) demonstrated no response. Additionally, 9 patients (33.3%) had documented side effects of varying severity, with one (3.7%) requiring cessation of dapsone therapy.

- **Discussion**: Systemic dapsone therapy may represent an effective and tolerable non-immunosuppressive adjuvant treatment for PG wound healing.

### Use of dermal injection of activated protein C for treatment of large chronic wounds secondary to pyoderma gangrenosum [^114Pa3Ue]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a systemic disease that presents with cutaneous necrotizing ulceration, producing deep necrotic ulcers, usually with a raised, undermined, violaceous border. Treatment typically involves high-dose immunosuppressive drugs, but more recently anti-tumor necrosis factor and monoclonal antibodies have been used. Activated protein C (APC) stimulates wound healing in patients with treatment-refractory skin ulcers, possibly by stimulating angiogenesis and re-epithelialization and preventing inflammation.

- **Aim**: To investigate whether APC may be beneficial as a treatment for ulcers related to cutaneous PG.

- **Methods**: Two patients were recruited with a clinical history and physical and histopathological evidence of acute PG. A total of 400 μg (1.0 mL) of APC was injected subcutaneously into the dermal edge of necrotic PG ulcers weekly for a total treatment period of 6 weeks. Photographs were taken, and clinical progress, ulcer size, and pain score were monitored during this period and after the cessation of treatment, at weeks 8 and 12.

- **Results**: Over the 12 weeks of the trial, APC led to a reduction in wound size from 3.8 cm² to 0.8 cm² in patient 1 (a 78.9% decrease) and from 41 cm² to 16 cm² in patient 2 (a 70.0% decrease), and a reduction in pain scores from 10 to 0 (a 100% decrease) in both patients.

- **Conclusion**: Although this study is limited by its small sample size and lack of a true placebo group, it indicates that APC has potential as a therapeutic option for patients with chronic skin ulcers from PG.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: A review and update on new therapies [^111z39Db]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare and often painful skin disease that can be unpredictable in its response to treatment. There is currently no gold standard of treatment or published algorithm for choosing therapy. The majority of data comes from case studies that lack a standard protocol not only for treatment administration but also for the objective assessment of lesion response to a specific therapy. This review provides an update on the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum, with a particular focus on new systemic therapies.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^112TTVVB]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare inflammatory skin disease classified within the group of neutrophilic dermatoses and is clinically characterized by painful, rapidly evolving cutaneous ulcers with undermined, irregular, erythematous-violaceous edges. The pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum is complex and involves a profound dysregulation of components of both innate and adaptive immunity in genetically predisposed individuals, with the follicular unit increasingly recognized as the putative initial target. T helper 17/T helper 1-skewed inflammation and exaggerated inflammasome activation lead to a dysregulated neutrophil-dominant milieu with high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1α, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-23, and IL-36. Low-evidence studies and a lack of validated diagnostic and response criteria have hindered the discovery and validation of new effective treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum. We review established and emerging treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum, providing a therapeutic algorithm based on available evidence. For emerging treatments, we review target molecules and their role in the pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Perioperative management of pyoderma gangrenosum [^1144Cnse]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) classically presents with an acute inflammatory stage, characterized by the rapid evolution of painful ulcerations. The pathergy associated with PG lesions complicates disease management. Although PG is commonly treated with immunosuppression, some patients have refractory noninflammatory ulcers. In this subpopulation, there are case reports of successful surgical treatment. However, there is no consensus on optimal perioperative treatment for patients with PG undergoing surgery of any kind, whether PG-related or otherwise.

Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review describing perioperative management practices and risk factors that may predict response to surgical intervention. We identified 126 cases of surgical intervention in patients with active PG; among these, only 16.7% experienced postoperative disease progression. No perioperative treatments or clinical risk factors were identified as statistically significant predictors of disease recurrence. Although limited by the case series design and publication bias, this study is a valuable means of hypothesis generation for this rare condition.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum induced by secukinumab in a patient with psoriasis successfully treated with ustekinumab [^112BprQM]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an inflammatory condition characterized by the presence of painful and necrotic ulcerations with a neutrophil-rich infiltrate. Although its pathogenesis is not completely understood, pyoderma gangrenosum has been associated with autoimmune disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Drug-induced pyoderma gangrenosum has also been reported in the literature, particularly in relation to new targeted therapies, including infliximab, adalimumab, and rituximab. Herein, we present a novel case of pyoderma gangrenosum induced by secukinumab, an anti-interleukin (IL) 17A antibody, in a patient with psoriasis.

### Reconstructive microsurgical approach for the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum [^113XzjpQ]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare type of autoimmune disease that results in progressive ulcers with or without previous trauma. However, PG is not well understood at the time of writing, and its treatment therefore remains a challenge. Because of the disease's systemic characteristic and the unpredictability of the clinical course, no gold standard treatment is available, especially concerning the surgical procedures to treat pyodermic lesions. Often, PG is not recognized during routine clinical practice, and standard ulcer treatment (conservative wound care, debridement, skin grafting, and local flap coverage) is initiated; this induces an autoinflammatory response, resulting in disastrous ulcers, thereby making free flap coverage necessary. The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome of microvascular free-tissue transfer as a treatment option for extended soft-tissue defects resulting from PG.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively evaluated 8 cases in 5 patients suffering from PG of the lower extremity who received defect closure with a microvascular free-tissue transfer under immunosuppressive and corticosteroid therapy.

- **Results**: The average patient age was 60 years; three were male, and two were female. Seven defects were covered with a free gracilis muscle flap. One patient received an anterolateral thigh flap. The average defect size was 93 cm². No flap loss was observed during follow-up. All patients received broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and corticosteroids. Two patients also received infliximab.

- **Discussion and conclusion**: PG, once diagnosed, is…

### Recalcitrant cutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum with pulmonary involvement resolved with treatment of underlying plasma cell dyscrasia [^116Qy53c]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory ulcerative disease with unknown pathophysiology and etiology. It is associated with many systemic inflammatory, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases. The clinical presentation varies widely but commonly manifests as painful, progressive, and well-demarcated ulcers with blue/gray serpiginous borders. The histopathology of PG is non-specific but typically includes dense neutrophilic infiltration with necrosis and hemorrhage.

These variations and inherent uncertainties of PG can make definitive diagnosis challenging, and more common processes such as infections, vasculitides, and malignancies must first be excluded. Suggested criteria for PG are as follows: progression of the ulcer(s), ruling out more common ulcerative diseases and atypical infections, confirmation of associated systemic diseases, and response to treatments. Therapy typically includes immunosuppression and wound care, but treatment of underlying systemic diseases, as seen in this case report, has been shown to be successful.

### Progression of pyoderma gangrenosum with angioinvasive fungus [^1134zY7L]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Use of anakinra for pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) has been reported but remains rare in the literature. This treatment showed promising results in our patient with a severely recalcitrant ulcer persisting for more than a year. However, a significant complication arose in the management of PG requiring immunosuppression. Our patient was being treated with two immunosuppressants, cyclosporine and anakinra, which reduced her ability to mount an immune response. We were transitioning the patient to anakinra, and her complication occurred at a particularly vulnerable point in her care. Due to numerous previous flares, we were reluctant to switch rapidly to monomodal anakinra and instead planned to taper her cyclosporine over time.

Repeat biopsy of her worsening plaque revealed angioinvasive fungus (AIF) and necessitated an immediate change in treatment. This finding underscores the necessity of broadly considering any sudden changes in clinical course in a patient whose condition is improving. Patients with complicated PG are often iatrogenically immunosuppressed and have a disrupted skin barrier, making them especially susceptible to infections. Due to the exuberant inflammatory dysregulation, potent immunosuppressants, often in combination as described in our case, are required to attenuate the severely abnormal immune response. Therefore, patients with PG treated with anakinra, especially those on multimodal immunosuppression, require special attention, frequent surveillance, and a low threshold for biopsy in cases of unexplained disease worsening.

### Insights into the pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum [^112cPpUq]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis of unclear etiology. Numerous theories of its underlying pathogenesis have been proposed, including external triggers, neutrophilic dysfunction, complement activation, and autoimmunity, as well as a possible component of underlying genetic susceptibility. This review seeks to synthesize understanding of the pathogenesis of PG and integrate interactions between the multitude of implicated host immune pathways to guide and inform future directions into the treatment of PG.

### New treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum and hidradenitis suppurativa: A review [^113mzQk4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024).

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) are stubborn inflammatory skin diseases categorized as neutrophilic hypodermal dermatoses. These conditions exhibit connections with other autoinflammatory disorders driven by immune responses. Their pathogenesis is complex, rooted in significant imbalances in both innate and adaptive immune systems, particularly featuring elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin (IL)‐1, IL‐8, IL‐17, and IL‐23. Studies involving skin tissue pathology and serology have indicated that targeting specific cytokines can bring therapeutic benefits. Indeed, many patients in clinical settings have responded positively to such interventions. Yet, given the diverse cytokines in play, focusing on a single one with antibody therapy might not always be effective. When resistance to biologics emerges, a combined approach targeting multiple overactive cytokines with immunosuppressants, for example, cyclosporine and Janus kinase inhibitors, could be an option. In this review, we explore recent therapeutic developments for PG and HS.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum controlled with rituximab [^1113HBKz]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory cutaneous disease. Much of the underlying pathophysiology and etiology remain poorly understood, but PG is often associated with autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory or neoplastic diseases. The disease can be extremely variable in presentation, with either single or multiple lesions appearing on various parts of the body.

PG is often difficult to diagnose due to the variability of presentation, nonspecific laboratory findings, and indeterminate histology. Other conditions associated with cutaneous ulcerations must be considered in the differential diagnosis, such as infections, vasculitis, and malignancies. No official protocol exists for the treatment of PG, but therapy usually involves immunosuppression in conjunction with wound care. We present a case of recalcitrant PG with widespread involvement that resolved with rituximab.

### Genetic mutations in pyoderma gangrenosum, hidradenitis suppurativa, and associated autoinflammatory syndromes: Insights into pathogenic mechanisms and shared pathways [^117785p3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), and the associated autoinflammatory syndromes, including pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome, PSTPIP1‐associated myeloid‐related proteinemia inflammatory (PAMI) syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa (PASH) syndrome, and pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and suppurative hidradenitis (PAPASH) syndrome, are dermatological conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and tissue damage.

Recent advances in genetic research have identified specific mutations associated with these disorders, shedding light on their underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This review aims to summarize the knowledge of identified mutations and presumed pathophysiology in PG, HS, and the associated autoinflammatory syndromes.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum treated with oral abrocitinib in a 54-year-old woman: A case report [^111L9Y7p]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The suggested pathophysiology of pyoderma gangrenosum involves the interaction of innate and adaptive immunities and a state of neutrophil-driven autoinflammation. Since there are no international pyoderma gangrenosum guidelines of care, therapeutic options consist of wound care, topical and oral corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and intralesional corticosteroids. Tan and Tolkachjov (2024) reported that pyoderma gangrenosum lesions exhibit elevated levels of proinflammatory molecules, including various cytokines, interleukins, JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, and interferon gamma. JAK inhibitors, classified under level 4 evidence, target these pathways and have shown promise in treatment. As more case reports document successful outcomes, the use of JAK inhibitors for this condition is expected to increase, potentially strengthening the level of evidence over time.

Chen et al. (2024) published a case report of a patient with painful ulcerative lesions on the perianal area, diagnosed with pyoderma gangrenosum, and initially unresponsive to doxycycline, isotretinoin, glucocorticoids, and cyclosporine. Oral abrocitinib given at 100 mg daily resulted in improvement of the redness and symptoms following a week, with near-complete resolution of the pain, swelling, and reduced depth and area of the ulcer after 4 weeks. This study, along with the drug's ready availability, led to the selection of abrocitinib over prednisone as the patient preferred a fast response and improvement before returning home.

### Comparison of the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: Results of the STOP GAP randomised controlled trial [^113XDmu6]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

This trial is four times larger than the only other randomised controlled trial conducted in pyoderma gangrenosum, and it required national collaboration through the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network. Patient recruitment from 39 UK hospitals ensured representative sampling. The protocol reflected normal clinical practice, with dosing adjusted according to clinical need, and outcomes included clinician-assessed, patient-assessed, and independent assessment of digital images.

Every effort was made to capture the primary outcome in a blinded fashion. All secondary analyses supported the main analysis, although power to explore the impact on quality of life was limited due to missing data from postal questionnaires.

Given the lack of a placebo or no-treatment third arm in this study, it is possible that neither drug is effective in treating pyoderma gangrenosum. However, it was considered unethical to leave patients with a serious, potentially fatal disease without treatment.

The obtained sample size was slightly smaller than planned, but the narrow confidence intervals for between-group comparisons suggest that clinically important differences were not missed. The trial was stopped after achieving 86% of target recruitment due to time and financial limitations. This decision was made before the database was locked and data analysed.

Patients who require systemic treatment are likely to respond similarly to prednisolone or ciclosporin in the short term. Neither treatment is especially effective when healing at six months is considered.

### Comparison of the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: Results of the STOP GAP randomised controlled trial [^116oUjJs]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, no difference was found between the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum, ciclosporin and prednisolone, across a range of outcome measures. Contrary to the anecdotally derived belief that these drugs are efficacious in pyoderma gangrenosum, we found that fewer than half of the ulcers healed, even after prolonged treatment, and the speed of onset of response did not differ between the two treatments. Approximately two-thirds of participants reported adverse reactions, 12% of whom experienced a serious event. The side effects observed were in line with the known side effect profiles of these drugs. More serious adverse reactions, especially serious infections, were reported in the prednisolone group, although patients receiving ciclosporin were at increased risk of renal toxicity.

A recent expert consensus paper considering safety, efficacy, and cost placed prednisolone as the preferred treatment and ciclosporin as the second-ranked treatment among the many suggested interventions for pyoderma gangrenosum. Nonetheless, previous studies have reported large proportions of people with pyoderma gangrenosum achieving complete response with ciclosporin, which led the researchers of the STOP GAP (Study of Treatments fOr Pyoderma GAngrenosum Patients) randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that ciclosporin was superior to prednisolone for the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.

Healing responses at six weeks in our study were broadly similar to those observed for the randomised controlled trial.

### High frequency ultrasound for pyoderma gangrenosum: A case series [^112yJ8fF]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis that presents with chronic, painful, inflammatory lesions. The most common subtype, ulcerative PG, is characterized by pustules that rapidly expand into skin ulcers with raised, violaceous, and undermined borders. PG is difficult to diagnose due to overlapping clinical features with other ulcerative skin conditions and nonspecific histologic findings. Despite the development of validated scoring criteria, such as PARCELSUS (a diagnostic framework for PG that stands for progression of disease, assessment of relevant differential diagnoses, reddish-violaceous wound border, amelioration by immunosuppressive drugs, characteristically irregular ulcer shape, extreme pain, localization of lesion at site of trauma, suppurative inflammation on histopathology, undermined wound border, systemic disease associated), Delphi, and Su, it still remains a diagnostic challenge. Misdiagnosis is not uncommon, leading to delays in treatment, unnecessary intravenous antibiotics, surgical procedures, and even amputations. Recently, noninvasive diagnostic tools have gained traction when assessing patients with ulcerations. High frequency ultrasound (HFUS) is a rapidly expanding modality in dermatology due to its high-resolution imaging capabilities that discern subtle differences in tissues. HFUS can dynamically characterize lesion extent, depth, and vascularity; however, few studies have investigated its utility in skin ulcers. In this report, we highlight the use of HFUS using a GE Linear 6–24 MHz transducer to distinguish phases of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### A case of genital pyoderma gangrenosum successfully treated with cyclosporine without relapse of established follicular lymphoma [^114Da8ft]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Management of pyoderma gangrenosum in the presence of established malignancy poses significant challenges. When vital structures are threatened by ulceration, aggressive treatment is necessary; however, there is a concern that immunosuppressive therapy may adversely affect the prognosis of the underlying malignancy. The optimal approach to managing pyoderma gangrenosum under these conditions remains uncertain. We present the case of a 64-year-old woman with follicular lymphoma in partial remission who developed severe genital pyoderma gangrenosum. Following a multidisciplinary evaluation, she was treated with corticosteroids and cyclosporine, resulting in complete healing with scarring over a 7-week period. She has required ongoing low-dose cyclosporine for 3 years to maintain remission of her genital ulceration; nonetheless, she remains well with no relapse of her lymphoma as confirmed by serial imaging.

### Ustekinumab for pyoderma gangrenosum-like skin ulcerations in late-onset leukocyte adhesion deficiency [^114g56Dc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2024). Low credibility.

Therapeutic options for PG-like wounds in patients with LAD-1 are still under discussion. TNF-α blockade has been reported in three patients, with variable response. Other options include systemic steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, immunomodulating drugs (e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil), or IL-1β antagonists (e.g. anakinra).

Ustekinumab, a mAb against IL-12 and IL-23, was successfully used in a patient with LAD-1. As depicted in Fig 3, not only did ustekinumab lead to reduced levels of IL-12 and IL-23, but IL-1ß level was equally reduced. Ustekinumab thus curbs hyperinflammation and facilitates healing of the ulcers.

The only causative treatment, however, is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), which in a retrospective analysis of 84 patients with LAD resulted in a 3-year overall survival of 84%.

We conclude that ustekinumab is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with LAD-1 with PGLUs, and it can be useful in bridging the time until HSCT.

### Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with mycophenolate mofetil as a steroid-sparing agent [^115mBDUi]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has gained increasing popularity as an emerging immunosuppressant treatment for various autoimmune dermatologic conditions, including pyoderma gangrenosum (PG).

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of MMF as used in PG.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients with PG treated with MMF at our institution in Victoria, Australia, over 11 years (2001–2012).

- **Results**: We identified 26 patients, 14 female and 12 male. Nine patients (34.6%) had associated systemic conditions. All patients received prednisolone. MMF was used as a first-line steroid-sparing agent in 11 patients (42.3%), second-line in 14 (53.8%), and third-line in 1 (3.85%). The average duration of treatment was 12.1 months. Fourteen patients experienced side effects (53.8%), although most were mild (26.9%). One patient died following a sigmoid colon perforation (3.85%). Overall, 22 patients demonstrated clinical improvement during MMF treatment (84.6%). Thirteen patients achieved complete ulcer healing (50%), 10 while taking MMF and 3 after ceasing it.

- **Limitations**: This is a retrospective study based on a single-center cohort.

- **Conclusion**: Our experience suggests that MMF is highly efficacious in PG together with prednisolone or as part of combination therapy with other immunosuppressants.
