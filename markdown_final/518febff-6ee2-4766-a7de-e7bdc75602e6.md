## Question

What is the recommended duration of denosumab therapy for osteoporosis treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long denosumab therapy should be continued for osteoporosis treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing and whether any fixed duration is specified. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about treatment duration and reassessment intervals. Next, I will review long-term efficacy and safety data to understand how far the evidence extends. After that, I need to examine the risks of stopping denosumab and the requirement for sequential therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note special populations and uncertainties beyond 10 years.

> Let me first confirm the labeled regimen and whether duration is mandated. The FDA labeling for Prolia specifies denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months for osteoporosis across postmenopausal women, men, and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, but it does not specify a maximum treatment duration, which implies duration should be guided by clinical judgment rather than a fixed endpoint [^112jy9mE] [^112sd3En] [^11734R1d].

> Next, I should review guideline positions on duration and reassessment. The Endocrine Society recommends denosumab as an alternative initial therapy and advises reassessing fracture risk after 5 to 10 years; if the patient remains at high risk, therapy should be continued or switched to another agent, and importantly, denosumab should not be delayed or stopped without subsequent antiresorptive therapy to prevent rebound bone loss and vertebral fractures [^115Qpq3m] [^1142tzRz] [^111s4wqV]. The North American Menopause Society similarly states there is no limit to denosumab duration and emphasizes that administration should not be delayed beyond 7 months without follow-on therapy, with a strong recommendation to switch to a bisphosphonate if denosumab is discontinued [^113ApLw8] [^113t9bVB]. ACOG likewise recommends initiating denosumab in appropriate postmenopausal patients and switching to another antiresorptive if denosumab is stopped [^111mjdPo] [^111aHAUU].

> I will now examine the long-term efficacy and safety evidence. The FREEDOM trial and its 7-year extension demonstrate sustained increases in BMD and low fracture rates with up to 10 years of denosumab exposure, with no plateau in BMD gains and no new safety signals emerging over that horizon, although data beyond 10 years are not yet available [^117PrGEj] [^113kYiLD]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of benefit: over 10 years, lumbar spine BMD increased by about 21.7% and total hip by about 9.2%, with vertebral fracture incidence remaining low, supporting continued efficacy with long-term therapy [^117PrGEj].

> Now, I need to check the consequences of stopping denosumab and the requirement for sequential therapy. Discontinuation leads to rapid reversal of effect, with bone turnover markers rising above baseline and BMD losses of roughly 6.6% at the lumbar spine and 5.3% at the total hip within 12 months, accompanied by an increased risk of multiple vertebral fractures, particularly 3 to 18 months after stopping, which is why guidelines uniformly recommend transition to a bisphosphonate if denosumab is stopped [^113jvZRc] [^113ApLw8] [^116ebHBx]. Wait, let me verify the timing of sequential therapy: most expert guidance favors zoledronic acid at 6 months after the last denosumab dose, with BTM monitoring to guide whether additional bisphosphonate is needed, acknowledging that a single infusion may be insufficient after longer denosumab exposure [^116ebHBx] [^112cvFho] [^114CviQ4].

> Let me consider how to synthesize this into a practical recommendation. For patients who remain at high fracture risk, denosumab can be continued indefinitely, with reassessment at 5 to 10 years and continuation as long as risk remains high, given the sustained benefits observed up to 10 years and the lack of a predefined maximum duration in labeling or guidelines [^115Qpq3m] [^117PrGEj] [^113ApLw8]. For patients who become low to moderate risk, discontinuation can be considered, but only with planned sequential antiresorptive therapy, typically zoledronic acid at 6 months with BTM-guided redosing, recognizing that longer prior denosumab exposure increases rebound risk and may necessitate more intensive bisphosphonate strategies [^116ebHBx] [^112cvFho] [^114CviQ4]. I should double-check that this aligns with primary care guidance: contemporary primary care reviews similarly advise that once started, denosumab is often continued long term and that any cessation requires a planned transition to mitigate rebound fractures [^115nZfX6].

> But wait, what about special populations and edge cases. In men with osteoporosis, the same 60 mg every 6 months regimen applies and the same principles for duration and discontinuation hold, with no fixed maximum duration specified in labeling or guidelines [^11734R1d] [^115Qpq3m]. In glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, denosumab is appropriate and duration is individualized to ongoing glucocorticoid exposure and fracture risk, again with attention to sequential therapy if stopped [^112sd3En] [^116ebHBx]. For oncology-related bone loss, denosumab is often used to offset therapy-induced bone loss and duration commonly mirrors the cancer therapy course; if denosumab is stopped, transition planning is essential to avoid rebound, though oncology-specific guidance is less standardized and often extrapolates from osteoporosis guidance [^113FcK2G] [^111cxQmu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about indefinite therapy meaning forever for everyone. I should confirm the uncertainty beyond 10 years. Evidence is robust to 10 years, but there are no published randomized data beyond that horizon; therefore, for patients approaching or beyond a decade of therapy, individualized risk–benefit reassessment is prudent, with shared decision-making about continuation versus carefully planned discontinuation with potent sequential antiresorptive therapy and close monitoring [^117PrGEj] [^113kYiLD] [^116ebHBx]. Let me reconsider the bottom line: there is no fixed maximum duration for denosumab; continue as long as fracture risk remains high, reassess at 5 to 10 years, and if stopping, implement a bisphosphonate-based exit strategy to mitigate rebound bone loss and vertebral fracture risk [^115Qpq3m] [^113ApLw8] [^116ebHBx].

---

Denosumab is administered as a **60 mg subcutaneous injection every 6 months** [^112jy9mE] for osteoporosis, with no fixed maximum duration [^113ApLw8]; therapy is continued as long as fracture risk remains high and benefits outweigh risks [^115Qpq3m]. Reassess fracture risk at 5–10 years [^1142tzRz]; if risk remains high, continue denosumab or switch to another antiresorptive [^114u4gTz]. If discontinued, **initiate a bisphosphonate** (typically zoledronic acid 6 months after the last denosumab dose) [^116ebHBx] to prevent rebound bone loss and vertebral fractures [^113ApLw8]. There is no evidence of increased harm with long-term use up to 10 years [^117PrGEj], but rare adverse events (ONJ, AFF) may occur with prolonged therapy [^1177CTT8].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

- **Standard dose**: 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months [^112jy9mE].
- **Administration**: Healthcare professional injection; ensure calcium and vitamin D adequacy [^116tFCwR].
- **Consistency**: Strict 6-month intervals to avoid rebound bone loss and fractures [^115Qpq3m].

---

## Duration of denosumab therapy

- **No fixed maximum**: Continue as long as fracture risk remains high and benefits outweigh risks [^113ApLw8].
- **Long-term efficacy**: Sustained BMD gains and fracture risk reduction up to 10 years [^117PrGEj] [^113kYiLD].
- **Reassessment**: At 5–10 years, continue or switch if high risk; if low risk, consider discontinuation with bisphosphonate transition [^114u4gTz] [^113ApMNc].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting long-term use

The **FREEDOM extension** showed sustained BMD gains and low fracture rates over 10 years [^117PrGEj], and the **safety profile** revealed no increase in adverse events over 10 years, including low rates of ONJ and AFF [^117PrGEj] [^1177CTT8].

---

## Risks associated with prolonged denosumab therapy

- **ONJ**: Rare; risk increases with duration and invasive dental procedures [^113RxZTF].
- **AFF**: Rare; monitor for thigh/groin pain and radiographic changes [^1177CTT8].
- **Infections**: Slightly higher risk of skin and respiratory infections [^111E7Gpr].

---

## Consequences of discontinuation

Discontinuation leads to **rapid bone loss** — BMD declines and bone turnover markers rise within months — and increases **vertebral fracture risk**, particularly multiple vertebral fractures, especially after prolonged therapy [^116ebHBx] [^111QdxpW].

---

## Recommended strategies for discontinuation

- **Sequential therapy**: Start a bisphosphonate (usually zoledronic acid) 6 months after the last denosumab dose [^113ApMNc].
- **Monitoring**: Use bone turnover markers to guide timing and need for additional bisphosphonate doses [^112cvFho].
- **Alternative agents**: Oral bisphosphonates or SERMs if zoledronic acid is contraindicated or unavailable [^115VUqVM].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **Endocrine Society**: Reassess at 5–10 years; continue or switch if high risk; do not stop without subsequent antiresorptive therapy [^1142tzRz] [^115Qpq3m].
- **AACE/ACE**: Transition to another antiresorptive if discontinuing denosumab [^114mwKS2].
- **NAMS**: No fixed duration; continue as long as needed, with planned transition if stopped [^113ApLw8].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing duration

- **Fracture risk**: High-risk patients benefit from continued therapy [^1142tzRz].
- **Age**: Older patients may require longer therapy [^116xzJUB].
- **Comorbidities**: Renal impairment, glucocorticoid use, and malignancy influence duration [^notfound].
- **Adverse effects**: ONJ, AFF, or infections may necessitate discontinuation [^1177CTT8].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Management strategy** |
|-|-|-|
| High fracture risk | Continue indefinitely | Ongoing therapy [^113ApLw8] |
| Moderate risk | 3–5 years, then reassess | Continue or transition to bisphosphonate [^114u4gTz] |
| Low risk | 1–2 years, then reassess | Transition to bisphosphonate [^113ApMNc] |
| Discontinuation | N/A | Bisphosphonate transition (zoledronic acid) [^111GnkFc] |

---

Denosumab is given every 6 months with no fixed maximum duration; continue as long as fracture risk remains high, reassess at 5–10 years, and if stopped, **transition to a bisphosphonate** to prevent rebound bone loss and fractures [^117PrGEj] [^113ApLw8].

ECTS 2020

The ECTS have updated their guidance in a position paper published in October 2020. They reference the "treat to target" approach to osteoporosis treatment, BMD being the sole discussed marker of fracture risk. It is acknowledged that a BMD-only based concept has not been universally accepted and it is prudent to consider other risk factors such as prevalent fractures and continued glucocorticoid or aromatase inhibitor use. The ECTS thus state that in patients with high fracture risk, long-term treatment is supported by safety and efficacy data up to 10 years. The Society advise that pending longer term data the decision to extend denosumab treatment beyond 10 years should be decided in individual cases (for example those with limited life expectancy, significant renal impairment or an explicit patient wish). Mindful of the increased risk of unscheduled treatment cessation with longer treatment duration they recommend to thoroughly assess the indication to start denosumab before commencing, particularly in younger patients where the longer duration may predispose to unscheduled discontinuation. The guidelines also comment on the issue of dentist-initiated treatment interruption, advising that it is preferable to wait for 5 months after last administration before undergoing a procedure and to withhold further treatment until the lesion is healed. Regarding treatment cessation and sequential therapy after denosumab, the ECTS recommend that denosumab may be ceased once the patient is no longer considered at high risk of fragility fracture but that it is then necessary to prescribe a potent antiresorptive, particularly a bisphosphonate. Oral bisphosphonate can be considered in patients reaching this threshold prior to exceeding 2.5 years of denosumab therapy, but if opting for an oral bisphosphonate the advice is to perform a DXA at the time the next denosumab dose is due and to measure bone turnover markers 3 months later to monitor efficacy and adherence, aiming for a level below the mean found in healthy premenopausal women. If there is an adequate response, then they recommend to continue for 1–2 years and reassess with repeat DXA and decide about continuation or discontinuation of bisphosphonate as per the guidance of Kanis et al. Intravenous zoledronate is recommended when there is gastric intolerance of oral bisphosphonate, inadequate response to therapy, or in patients with a long duration of denosumab exposure (longer than 2.5 years). As discussed, the optimal timing of the infusion is yet to be clarified but the ECTS recommend the pragmatic approach of beginning treatment 6 months after the last denosumab injection, and monitoring the bone turnover markers at 3 and 6 months; if bone remodelling is increased, then a second infusion could be considered. The subsequent duration of zoledronate treatment is also yet to be optimally assessed. For patients who have received denosumab for over 2.5 years, the option is also provided to continue denosumab up to 10 years. Despite these guidelines the evidence behind the sequential therapy recommendations is limited and summarized below.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^111ADEbR]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The optimal duration of denosumab is unknown. Although there is a lack of published evidence for benefit in denosumab use beyond 10 years, the continued benefit seen and low risk of adverse events in FREEDOM and the Extension study at 10 years is reassuring. Denosumab has a good safety profile. The potential deleterious effects of prolonged denosumab use have perhaps been overstated. ONJ and AFF are rare; the relationship with duration of denosumab treatment is unclear, but the number of cases thus far is too low to estimate the risk associated with prolonged treatment. Though the risk remains low it is not negligible, and the lack of data past the 10 years point still leaves prescribers uncertain regarding the harm:benefit ratio of more prolonged administration. Though denosumab has an established and progressive benefit in terms of increasing BMD and maintaining a reduced fracture risk, even long-term use cannot restore normal trabecular bone architecture. Thus for the moment at least, some form of treatment of osteoporosis is required life-long. Perhaps in light of the low risk of these and other adverse events coupled with the limited evidence to support sequential therapies, the best advice is to continue denosumab indefinitely, especially in high fracture risk patients, at least whilst longer term data on the safety and efficacy of administration beyond 10 years is gathered.

The Swiss Association against Osteoporosis released a position statement in 2017. The position statement recommended continuing denosumab up to 10 years in patients at high fracture risk, defined as: hip, spine or multiple fractures before or during therapy; femoral neck T-score < −2.5 if age < 65 years, < −2.0 SD if age > 65 years and/or frequent falls; continuing hormone ablative therapy (e.g. aromatase inhibition, androgen deprivation therapy); secondary osteoporosis; and continuing glucocorticoid therapy. In patients with good treatment response (low fracture risk, increase of BMD to within age-adjusted range, cessation of aromatase inhibition) they advised mandatory sequential treatment with bisphosphonates (or SERM if bisphosphonate intolerant) for 12–24 months post discontinuation of denosumab. They emphasized the importance of this particularly in older women with prevalent VFs and in women without a history of long-term bisphosphonate use prior to denosumab.

The Endocrine Society 2019 suggests that in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are prescribed denosumab the fracture risk should be reassessed after 5–10 years. The guidance is that women who remain at high risk of fracture should continue denosumab or receive other osteoporosis treatment. The high-risk group is defined as patients who have a prior spine or hip fracture, or a BMD T-score of −2.5 or below at either the hip or spine, or a 10-year hip fracture risk > 3%, or a risk of major osteoporotic fracture > 20%. According to the guideline, denosumab could then be stopped in low to moderate risk patients (i.e. those who do not meet these criteria) but they recommend against delaying or stopping denosumab without subsequent antiresorptive (bisphosphonate, hormone therapy or SERM) administered in order to prevent rebound increase in bone turnover, rapid BMD loss and increased risk of fracture. The advice for follow-up of these patients is a reassessment of fracture risk every 1–3 years. If bone loss is noted, fracture occurs or the patient becomes high risk, then the guideline recommends consideration of restarting therapy.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115Qpq3m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Denosumab — initial treatment, dosing, monitoring, and discontinuation precautions: In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at high risk for osteoporotic fractures, we recommend using denosumab as an alternative initial treatment. The recommended dosage is 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months, and the effects reverse after 6 months if the drug is not taken on schedule; thus, a drug holiday or treatment interruption is not recommended with this agent. In women taking denosumab, we suggest that the fracture risk be reassessed after 5 to 10 years, and those who remain at high risk should either continue denosumab or be treated with other osteoporosis therapies; administration of denosumab should not be delayed or stopped without subsequent antiresorptive or other therapy to prevent a rebound in bone turnover and to decrease the risk of rapid bone mineral density loss and an increased risk of fracture.

### Delayed denosumab injections and fracture risk among patients with osteoporosis: a population-based cohort study [^111LkN8v]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Denosumab is effective for osteoporosis, but discontinuation leads to rapid reversal of its therapeutic effect.

Objective

To estimate the risk for fracture among users of denosumab who delayed subsequent doses compared with users who received doses on time.

Design

Population-based cohort study.

Setting

The Health Improvement Network U.K. primary care database, 2010 to 2019.

Patients

Persons aged 45 years or older who initiated denosumab therapy for osteoporosis.

Measurements

Observational data were used to emulate an analysis of a hypothetical trial with 3 dosing intervals: subsequent denosumab injection given within 4 weeks after the recommended date ("on time"), delay by 4 to 16 weeks ("short delay"), and delay by more than 16 weeks ("long delay"). The primary outcome was a composite of all fracture types at 6 months after the recommended date. Secondary outcomes were major osteoporotic fracture, vertebral fracture, hip fracture, and nonvertebral fracture.

Results

Investigators identified 2594 patients initiating denosumab therapy. The risk for composite fracture over 6 months was 27.3 in 1000 for on-time dosing, 32.2 in 1000 for short delay, and 42.4 in 1000 for long delay. Compared with on-time injections, short delay had a hazard ratio (HR) for composite fracture of 1.03 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.69) and long delay an HR of 1.44 (CI, 0.96 to 2.17) (P for trend = 0.093). For vertebral fractures, short delay had an HR of 1.48 (CI, 0.58 to 3.79) and long delay an HR of 3.91 (CI, 1.62 to 9.45).

Limitation

Dosing schedules were not randomly assigned.

Conclusion

Although delayed administration of subsequent denosumab doses by more than 16 weeks is associated with increased risk for vertebral fracture compared with on-time dosing, evidence is insufficient to conclude that fracture risk is increased at other anatomical sites with long delay.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^116kQzRZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Notwithstanding the lack of evidence beyond 10 years of use, there are very few clinical reasons to stop denosumab. Denosumab is an effective antiresorptive with clear benefits in reduced risk of fracture for patients whilst on treatment, and there evidently is an increased risk of multiple VF and perhaps other major osteoporotic fracturesfollowing its discontinuation. In studies of denosumab-discontinuers, patient factors predominate. Physicians have a duty to educate their patients on the possible risk of discontinuing denosumab and measures to prevent unscheduled breaks should be instituted, such as automatic call back. In addition specialty prescribers must communicate such information to primary care teams, who may not be as up-to-date as physicians who specialize in treating bone disease. Delayed denosumab administration is very common in patients on long-term therapy; up to 50% of such patients experience at least one significant delay (> 4 months) in their therapy. This is important because the risk of VF appears to increase steeply when delays exceed 12 weeks. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many aspects of healthcare, not least osteoporosis care, delays to denosumab administration, and the strategies advised by major organisations involved may shed more light on the optimal sequential therapy following denosumab discontinuation.

Denosumab — recommendations for postmenopausal osteoporosis specify that in women at high risk for osteoporotic fractures, we recommend using denosumab as an alternative initial treatment (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕); the recommended dosage is 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months, the effects on bone remodeling reverse after 6 months if not taken on schedule, and drug holiday or treatment interruption are not recommended with this agent; in women taking denosumab, we suggest that fracture risk be reassessed after 5 to 10 years and that those who remain at high risk should either continue denosumab or be treated with other osteoporosis therapies (2|⊕⊕OO); administration should not be delayed or stopped without subsequent antiresorptive or other therapy to prevent rebound in bone turnover and rapid BMD loss (Ungraded Good Practice Statement).

Why stop denosumab?

There are very few clinical reasons to stop denosumab therapy. Potential reasons include:

Achieving a treatment goal "treat-to-target approach";
Treatment failure as evidenced by fracture or inadequate response on BMD re-assessment;
A drug related adverse event such as hypersensitivity or hypocalcaemia;
Concerns about potential long-term risks (ONJ and AFF);
Cost or lack of government/insurance coverage;
Patient factors.

Treat-to-target

Some physicians advocate for a treat-to-target approach to management of osteoporosis. Usually this target is a particular BMD which when reached indicates that the patient is at an acceptably low risk of fracture. There are multiple facets to this approach: selecting the therapy most likely to bring about improvement in BMD towards the target within a particular time-line; stopping the therapy when the target is reached; maintaining this target BMD. Whilst this approach is discussed by the Endocrine Society in its guidance from 2019, they caution that current therapies may not be potent enough to achieve or maintain the gains in BMD required. The treat-to-target approach is advocated in the more recent position statement from the ECTS; however, they acknowledge that the assignment of fracture risk based on BMD alone is limited. Furthermore, as discussed below the evidence base supporting the guidance for sequential therapy to maintain BMD and reduce rebound fracture risk following denosumab cessation is weak. Nonetheless, even without consensus denosumab reimbursement parameters differ across healthcare jurisdictions, in some cases mandating cessation of denosumab once target BMD is reached.

Mitigating the risk of discontinuing denosumab

Regardless of the underlying reason for denosumab discontinuation, whether it is a clinical decision or a patient factor, it is clear that many patients will ultimately discontinue therapy. It is important that evidence-based guidance is developed in order to minimize the risk of harm when discontinuing denosumab. An evidence gap exists regarding subsequent management; to date the potential strategies to reduce the rebound effect of stopping denosumab have not been conclusively adjudicated but suggested therapies include oral or intravenous bisphosphonates before or after denosumab with or without reference to bone turnover markers, or SERM after denosumab.

Introduction

Denosumab was first approved by the European and US Regulatory authorities in 2010. The first approved monoclonal antibody for osteoporosis, it binds to and inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κβ ligand (RANKL) leading to reduced bone resorption. Denosumab is recommended by the Endocrine Society and others as a first line treatment option for post-menopausal women at high risk for osteoporotic fractures. – Denosumab is also recommended for treatment of osteoporosis in men and in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Denosumab is used for several oncological indications including bone metastases, women with low bone mass receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer and men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer. It is also employed in the treatment of Paget's disease of the bone and fibrous dysplasia. The current paper presents an overview of the safety concerns regarding prolonged exposure to denosumab for the treatment of osteoporosis, the consequences of cessation and the putative harm-reducing strategy of sequential osteoporosis therapy for patients in whom cessation is medically indicated or patient determined. Six-monthly subcutaneous administration of denosumab increased bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, total hip and distal third radius site compared with both placebo and alendronate. During the initial 36 month FREEDOM trial, it was also shown to reduce the risk of new radiographic vertebral fracture, hip fracture and non-vertebral fracture when compared with placebo. At the time of its approval there was no pre-specified treatment duration and the deleterious rebound effect of denosumab withdrawal on fracture incidence was not fully anticipated.

### Long-term treatment strategies for postmenopausal osteoporosis [^117T3XHx]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Osteoporosis guidelines do not usually provide specific recommendations regarding what medication is most appropriate for individual patients. Generic oral bisphosphonates are often considered first-line treatment for osteoporosis, but treatment duration is limited, based on potential long-term safety concerns, and there is no consensus about what to do after 5 years. There are no recommendations concerning long-term management of osteoporosis over 30 or more years of postmenopausal life.

Recent Findings

This review attempts to specify medication choices and provide the best clinical management strategies for women at different stages of life and with different underlying disease severity. Because there is no evidence that considers the entire postmenopausal lifespan, much of the discussion here will be based on expert opinion. The review considers a role for estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators, oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, denosumab and the anabolic agents, teriparatide and abaloparatide.

Summary

Optimal sequential monotherapy, over an average of 30 postmenopausal years, should be able to minimize exposure to pharmacology while maximizing benefits on bone strength and minimizing imminent and long-term risk of fracture.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^112i2kmH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Denosumab was approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 2010, based on the FREEDOM study, which indicated a benefit in terms of increased bone mineral density and reduced risk of major osteoporotic fracture. In the initial clinical studies it was noted that discontinuation of denosumab can lead to a rebound of bone turnover markers and loss of accrued bone mineral density. An increased risk of fractures (multiple vertebral fractures in particular) associated with discontinuation was noted after approval and marketing of denosumab. For many patients experiencing gain in bone mineral density and fracture prevention while taking denosumab, there is no reason to stop therapy. However, discontinuation of denosumab may happen due to non-adherence; potential lack of efficacy in an individual; where reimbursement for therapy is limited to those with bone mineral density in the osteoporosis range, when assessment reveals this has been exceeded; or patient or physician concern regarding side effects. This review paper aims to discuss these concerns and to summarize the data available to date regarding sequential osteoporosis therapy following denosumab cessation to reduce the risk of multiple vertebral fracture.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^116q9bme]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

If denosumab must be discontinued for clinical reasons, the guidance for most indicates a course of bisphosphonate or SERM for consolidation. Bisphosphonates are the preferred option based on available evidence. Evidence for use of SERMs is lacking (the evidence presented by Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al.and Ebina et al.argues against SERM as an alternative), although further randomized controlled studies including SERMs are ongoing. The studies discussed in this review indicate that bisphosphonate treatment after denosumab is at least partially effective for maintaining BMD, in particular spinal BMD. Furthermore bisphosphonates appear to protect against the development of multiple VFs. There remain limitations in the evidence governing the optimum timing, route and duration of sequential bisphosphonate in addition to the potential role of bone turnover markers and how best to monitor individual patient response. For now, the strongest evidence, with which the current authors concur, is from Sølling et al.who recommend an infusion of zoledronate at 6 months after cessation of denosumab, followed by serial monitoring of bone turnover markers and advising a second infusion even within the next 6 months if bone resorption marker increases. The current authors argue that osteoporosis is a chronic condition requiring chronic treatment and that denosumab represents a viable safe and effective treatment indefinitely for most patients.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^112cvFho]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) provided guidance on managing the discontinuation of denosumab to mitigate the rebound effect. The ECTS strongly recommended initiating an alternative antiresorptive treatment at the time the patient is due for the next denosumab injection. Moreover, in patients who have been taking denosumab for only one year, switching to alendronate has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing rebound bone loss. The most commonly recommended approach is to administer a potent bisphosphonate such as zoledronate six months after the final dose of denosumab. This timing is crucial because it coincides with the period when denosumab's effects start to wane and the risk of rebound increases. The exact timing of bisphosphonate administration following denosumab discontinuation is still an open question. For example, if bisphosphonates are administered too late (ie, more than nine months after the last denosumab injection), the maximum rebound in bone turnover might have already occurred, reducing the efficacy of bisphosphonates in preventing BMD loss and fractures. Administration of a pulsatile bisphosphonate too early also might not be maximally effective. Indeed, six months after the last dose of denosumab, many patients still have a closed remodeling phase with less exposed bone available for binding by a bisphosphonate. In patients with prolonged denosumab use, the rebound effect is more pronounced, and a single dose of bisphosphonate might not be sufficient, potentially necessitating additional doses or alternative strategies.

If clinically available, monitoring of BTMs after denosumab discontinuation can help tailor subsequent therapy more effectively. For patients showing significant increases in these markers, rapid BMD loss or not responding to a single dose of zoledronic acid, additional doses may be required. If BTMs are not available, then redosing as soon as three months or as late as six months after the first zoledronic acid dose is prudent. Moreover, the ECTS guidance on denosumab discontinuation may present challenges for implementation in the United States and other health systems due to payment concerns. Specifically, the recommendation for BMD assessment at six months after discontinuation, followed by a zoledronic acid infusion at the same time, is often not covered or reimbursed by some health plans. As an alternative approach, if BTMs remain elevated at 6 months, clinicians could consider adding alendronate for 6 months before administering a second dose of zoledronic acid 12 months after denosumab discontinuation.

Covid-19-related disruption to denosumab

The coronavirus pandemic and associated social distancing requirements has led to significant curtailing of outpatient services and also hesitancy amongst some patients to attend health care centres. Several organizations in the field of osteoporosis have issued guidance on fracture risk mitigation strategies for patients who are unable or are unwilling to attend for their denosumab injections as planned. The recommendation for most is to transition to an oral bisphosphonate when delays of > 4 weeks cannot be avoided. Patients have been offered training in self-administration of the injection.

### Probability of achieving bone mineral density treatment goals with denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^115dqxHy]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research and the United States Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation Task Force on Goal-Directed Osteoporosis Treatment suggest that minimum T-score targets for patients with osteoporosis should be > −2.5. The task force further suggests that treatment decisions should be individualized in part based on starting T-scores at different skeletal sites and on the probability of achieving BMD treatment targets within 3 yr of treatment. Based on this approach, denosumab treatment would be a logical choice to achieve minimal treatment targets at TH with a baseline TH T-score as low as −2.8 and LS T-score as low as −3.1. A longer course of therapy will allow the treatment targets to be achieved with slightly lower starting TH T-scores and substantially lower starting LS T-scores. After achieving a treatment target with short-term denosumab (< 3 yr), if a decision is made to discontinue denosumab, transition to bisphosphonates (oral or intravenous) is recommended to maintain BMD gains and mitigate the risk of multiple vertebral fractures. After long-term denosumab treatment, transition to intravenous zoledronic acid is usually recommended though the optimal timing, frequency, and duration have not yet been determined. Treatment decisions should consider baseline regional skeletal site differences, specific individualized treatment targets, and proposed duration of therapy.

Bisphosphonates after denosumab

Although it is currently recommended to transition to another antiresorptive after discontinuing denosumab, there is a lack of robust evidence supporting this recommendation. Several groups have recently completed studies in an attempt to build the evidence base to support the current consensus guidelines. These groups have sought to clarify optimal timing, route of administration and duration of efficacy.

In their 2017 study of women completing the Denosumab and Teriparatide Administration (DATA) study and its extension DATA-Switch, Leder et al.reported maintenance of the teriparatide and denosumab-induced gains in BMD in patients who received prompt antiresorptive therapy (denosumab, oral bisphosphonates or intravenous zoledronate) but not in those who were untreated.

Lehmann and Aeberliin 2017 reported 22 cases of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who were commenced on denosumab, all receiving five injections before discontinuing denosumab and receiving a single dose of zoledronate 6 months later. Thirteen of the participants had prior bisphosphonate exposure whereas nine did not. None of the patients experienced a new VF (up to 24 months after discontinuation of denosumab). The authors reported prominent loss of BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck (change BMD % of −3.8, −1.7 and −0.6). There was no difference in BMD loss between the participants with prior bisphosphonate exposure and those without.

Reid et al.in 2017 reported a case series of six patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis who participated in FREEDOM receiving continuous denosumab for 7 years followed by a single infusion of zoledronate 6 months after the last dose of denosumab. BMD increased significantly at the spine and hip following denosumab compared with baseline. BMD was re-measured at 18–23 months post zoledronate infusion and had decreased significantly at the spine and hip. Spine but not hip BMD remained significantly above the pre-denosumab baseline, indicating that this single infusion provided partial protection at the spine only.

Sølling et al.in 2020 reported the findings of a 2-year randomized controlled trial of denosumab discontinuation followed by zoledronate infusion in a group with a history of denosumab use longer than 2 years and with most recent BMD indicating osteopenia. The participants were randomized into three groups based on the timing of zoledronate infusion: the first received an infusion of zoledronic acid 6 months after the last denosumab injection; the second group received an infusion at 9 months; and the third when CTX increased above 1.26 μg/L. There was a significant decrease in lumbar spine and total hip BMD across all groups at 6 or 12 months after zoledronate infusion but there was no significant between-group difference. Two patients in the 9-month group had a VF. They concluded that treatment with single dose zoledronate did not fully prevent loss of BMD in patients discontinuing denosumab and that timing of the infusion did not influence loss of BMD. They recommended that the best option was to administer zoledronate at 6 months after cessation of denosumab and that repeat zoledronate at about 3–6 months would be needed in those with a subsequent increase in CTX, pending outcomes from future trials.

Denosumab initiation and cessation

Patients discontinuing denosumab have an increased risk of multiple vertebral fractures, on average, 3–6 months since the last denosumab injection is due, which is attributable to a rapid increase in bone turnover and accelerated bone loss. Hence NOGG strongly emphasises that denosumab doses must not delayed, nor should denosumab be stopped without considering an alternative therapy; intravenous zoledronate is recommended 6 months after the last denosumab injection with serum CTX monitoring to guide timing of further treatment, or a further infusion of zoledronate 6 months later. In older people with impaired renal function, zoledronate may be contraindicated and there is little evidence to support an alternative approach. Therefore, before starting denosumab, it is crucial that a long-term osteoporosis management plan is agreed with the patient and GP. Trial data show denosumab continues to increase BMD and reduces fracture risk up to 10 years if not stopped, However, even when initiating denosumab in patients thought to be in the last decade of life, a long-term osteoporosis management plan is needed in case unplanned cessation becomes necessary.

Denosumab is appropriate for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, including those at high risk of fractures, with no limit to duration; administration should not be delayed or stopped beyond 7 months without subsequent therapy to prevent bone loss and vertebral fractures.

Guidance to date

In 2017 the ECTS published a systematic review of the literature regarding discontinuation of denosumab and offered advice on how to manage such patients. They recommended a re-evaluation of denosumab prescription after 5 years and that those considered high risk for fracture (e.g. who still have low BMD as defined by T-score worse than −2.0 or with multiple VFs or a high fracture risk score) could continue on denosumab up to 10 years. In patients considered at low risk of fracture at 5 years, the authors endorsed discontinuation of denosumab as an option but with need to consider follow-up treatment with bisphosphonate. At the time of publishing this guidance, and indeed now, the optimum regimen of bisphosphonate treatment following discontinuation of denosumab remains unclear. The guidance offered by the ECTS included the option of continuing denosumab up to 10 years even in the low risk group pending the outcome of trials to ascertain optimum bisphosphonate prescription following discontinuation. The alternative of post-discontinuation treatment with SERM was also included for patients with previous bisphosphonate intolerance. It is worth noting that the antiresorptive efficacy of SERMs is lower than that of bisphosphonates. Since the publication of this guidance, Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al.concluded that raloxifene had no efficacy for reducing risk of spontaneous VF following denosumab discontinuation. Teriparatide was also included in the discussion section of the guideline as a further potential alternative; but the DATA-Switch study demonstrated that teriparatide therapy after denosumab is associated with decreases in BMD, particularly at cortical sites, and is not recommended. Furthermore, the ECTS guidance states that should a dentist or dental surgeon wish to alter or halt denosumab treatment due to invasive procedure that this should be discussed with the patient's physician and interdisciplinary consultation may be required.

ECTS recommendations regarding denosumab use following diagnosis of AFF include:

Follow with a short course of bisphosphonate or selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for surgically treated bilateral AFF or unilateral AFF without sign of contralateral incomplete AFF.
Denosumab could be continued or initiated in patients at high risk of fragility fracture with bilateral surgically managed AFFs.
Denosumab could be stopped without follow-up therapy in patients at low risk of fragility fractures without history of vertebral fractures (VFs), particularly in those who have only had one or two six-monthly injections of 60 mg.
Consider a SERM or teriparatide in patients at high risk of fragility fracture, with the caveat of accelerated loss of BMD when switching from denosumab to teriparatide.

Further evidence of the low risk of both AFF and ONJ is presented by Ferrari et al.who published an estimate of fractures prevented relative to skeletal adverse events observed with up to 10 years of denosumab use. The group modelled a hypothetical placebo group and calculated the fractures prevented with denosumab treatment and related these to the number of cases of AFF and ONJ observed in the FREEDOM trial and its extension study (five per 100,000 subject-years and 35 per 100,000 subject-years respectively). The skeletal benefit/harm ratio was 281 for AFF and 40 for ONJ, indicating a favourable outcome of denosumab use long-term.

Early detection of incomplete atypical AFF using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) systems is a means to early identification of AFF because default length of the femur field visualizes the sub-trochanteric region. Focal thickening of the periosteal surface and endosteal surface of the lateral femur cortex can be identified. The default length of the femur image at the time of DXA can be extended to view the entire length of the femur. DXA manufacturers have added a feature to DXA protocols that allows rapid imaging of the entire femur length, with low radiation exposure and near X-ray quality imaging. The Official Positions of the International Society of Clinical Densitometry recommends: consider bilateral full length femur imaging for detecting abnormalities in the spectrum of AFF in patients who are receiving bisphosphonates or denosumab therapy or discontinued it within the last year, with a cumulative exposure of 3 or more years, especially those on glucocorticoid therapy.

### Prevention of skeletal-related events with extended-interval denosumab: a review of the literature [^115GArAb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review published clinical trial data related to efficacy and safety of administering denosumab at extended dosing intervals for prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in cancer patients.

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed was performed (January 2006 to February 2023) using the following search terms: denosumab, bone metastasis, bone lesions, and lytic lesions. Abstracts from conferences, article bibliographies, and product monographs were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant English-language studies were considered.

Data Synthesis

Early phase II denosumab trials included treatment arms that utilized extended-interval denosumab, and various retrospective reviews, meta-analyses, and prospective trials have included extended-interval regimens. Most recently, the ongoing randomized REDUSE trial is comparing the efficacy and safety of extended-interval denosumab to standard dosing. At this time, the best available data are restricted to small, randomized trials not designed to compare efficacy and safety of extended-interval denosumab to conventional dosing and did not use consistent endpoints. Furthermore, primary endpoints of available trials largely consisted of surrogate markers of efficacy that may not be reflective of clinical outcomes.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Historically, denosumab has been dosed at 4-week intervals for prevention of SREs. If efficacy is maintained, extending the dosing interval could potentially reduce toxicity, drug cost, and clinic visits compared to every 4-week dosing.

Conclusions

At this time, data demonstrating efficacy and safety of extended-interval denosumab remain limited, and the results of the REDUSE trial are eagerly anticipated to help answer remaining questions.

Treatment failure

There is uncertainty as to what defines treatment failure in osteoporosis. No currently available therapy completely eliminates the risk of sustaining a fracture, thus deciding to cease or switch away from denosumab due to the occurrence of an on-treatment fracture may not always be justified. A 2018 study by Kendler et al.assessed this issue based on the incidence rate of subsequent fracture in participants who sustained an "on-treatment fracture" whilst receiving either denosumab or placebo in FREEDOM or the extension study. The adjusted hazard ratio for subsequent fracture for the participants receiving denosumab compared with placebo was 0.59 (95% CI 0.43–0.81). This study offers evidence that sustaining a single fracture on denosumab is not necessarily indicative of treatment failure or inadequate response. The Endocrine Society suggests that treatment failure may be indicated by two or more on-treatment fractures, or BMD loss greater than the least significant change over 2 years or bone turnover marker suppression less than the least significant change.

Concerns regarding adverse events

Given the concern about possible association of denosumab with ONJ and AFF, some physicians are keen to minimize the time younger patients, in particular, are exposed to denosumab in an attempt to optimize the harm:benefit ratio. In the early days following approval of denosumab, the risk of abruptly stopping denosumab may not have been completely understood and there was a lack of advice on duration of treatment, likely leading to inappropriate cessation of treatment. Tripto-Shkolnik et al.published a case series of nine patients who discontinued denosumab and subsequently developed VF; the reasons for discontinuation included "drug holiday". In 2017 McClung et al.published the results of a small observational study assessing osteoporosis management strategies adopted at the discretion of a patient's personal physician following participation in a phase II clinical trial involving up to 8 years of denosumab treatment. Of the 82 patients who enrolled in the study, most (79%) were not prescribed further osteoporosis medication following completion of the trial phase. The most common reason, noted in 52% of these patients, was a decision by a physician that medication was no longer required.

Some physicians had stopped denosumab therapy citing attainment of a BMD above the osteoporosis range, concern re side effects or perceived lack of efficacy for these decisions. The "drug holiday" guidance used for patients on bisphosphonate therapy appears to have been applied erroneously to patients on denosumab in some cases. Other groups of patients delayed or ceased administration upon the advice of their dentist or of their own volition. In 2015, case reports indicated an increased rate of new VFs upon discontinuation of denosumab. Aubrey-Rozier et al. in 2016 published a case series of three patients who experienced VF within 10–16 months of stopping denosumab therapy, each patient having received 5–6 doses of denosumab. In two of the cases the patient's general practitioner stopped denosumab because the patient's BMD had increased significantly to within the osteopenic range. The third patient stopped denosumab herself without consulting a physician. These three cases and six new cases were reported in 2017 by Lamy et al. All patients were managed in general practice, seven commenced denosumab for a diagnosis of osteoporosis with two patients included who commenced denosumab for bone preservation during aromatase inhibitor treatment. The patients had received 2–8 doses of denosumab and the time from last dose to fracture was 9–16 months. Anastasilakis et al. in 2017reported a systematic review of 24 reported patients with VF following denosumab discontinuation (including the nine cases discussed above), the mean time on denosumab treatment was 2.9 years and mean time from discontinuation to VF was 11.2 months. The most common reasons for discontinuing denosumab were attaining BMD within the osteopenic or normal BMD ranges, treatment duration (rationale for this not explained) or the completion of treatment with aromatase inhibitors. It was unclear from these case reports whether these patients who stopped denosumab had merely reverted to their baseline risk of a VF, or whether the cessation of denosumab itself had conferred an excess risk.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^112vkq7e]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The effect of delayed denosumab injections rather than discontinuation on fracture risk was reported by Lyu et al. The authors used observational data in a hypothetical trial format, analysing the effect of on-time (within 4 weeks of date due), short delay (4–16 weeks overdue) and long delay > 16 weeks on fracture incidence. The incidence of fracture at any site over the 6 months following the missed dose was 27.3 per 1000 patients for on-time delivery, 32.2 in 1000 for short delay, and 42.4 for long delay. Patients who delayed their dose of denosumab by more than 4 months had a 3.91-fold increased risk of VF.

There is an emerging body of evidence that the duration of denosumab treatment may be an important determinant of the extent of rebound phenomenon, and time to VF following discontinuation. Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al.in 2020 reported a case series of 15 patients who sustained VF following withdrawal of denosumab and aromatase inhibitors for early stage breast cancer finding that VF developed earlier in patients with longer exposure or osteoporosis prior to commencing denosumab. Longer duration of treatment was also identified as being associated with a higher number of VFs in another study. Duration of denosumab exposure may also have an effect on the response to sequential treatment, with shorter duration leading to better preservation of BMD with sequential bisphosphonate therapy, but this is yet to be fully ascertained in large, prospective studies.

Denosumab and osteonecrosis of the jaw

Denosumab has been associated with the development of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), the first case reports of which were published in 2010. ONJ is defined as: (1) exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that does not heal within 8 weeks after identification by a health care provider; (2) with history of exposure to an antiresorptive agent; and (3) no history of radiation therapy to the craniofacial region. Within the world of dentistry the guidance regarding the withholding of antiresorptive treatment (bisphosphonates and denosumab) for invasive dental procedures is unclear; guidelines are contentious and self-admittedly non-evidence based. When denosumab was a new medication guidelines tended to group it together with the advice for bisphosphonates. For example, the 2011 report of the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs advised to continue bisphosphonates/denosumab during elective dentoalveolar surgery and advised against withholding antiresorptives due to a lack of evidence for prevention of antiresorptive-associated ONJ. This is similar to the advice of the International Task Force on ONJ in 2015. The 2014 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons' position paper recommends a 2–3 month antiresorptive drug holiday preceding and following invasive dental procedure in particular for patients with prolonged exposure to antiresorptives. Although this position paper refers to antiresorptives generally it is worth emphasising that the concept of a "drug holiday" within the field of osteoporosis therapies pertains only to bisphosphonates and not to denosumab. The Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme 2017 offers specific guidance for denosumab users advising delaying elective procedures until the month prior to the next scheduled administration, and further delaying the next dose until the extraction socket/soft tissues have healed. Consensus guidelines now emphasize the importance of preventive dentistry, recommending the identification and treatment of dental issues prior to initiation of antiresorptive therapy where possible.

Denosumab — long-term therapy and discontinuation management: The double-blind, placebo-controlled FREEDOM phase lasted 3 years, and in the FREEDOM Extension all patients received denosumab during the 7-year extension with no control group, with years 4 to 10 showing continuing low rates of new radiographic vertebral fractures (0.9% to 1.86% per year), nonvertebral fractures (0.84% to 2.55% per year), and hip fractures (0% to 0.61% per year), supporting a stable level of fracture reduction up to 10 years; there are no published data beyond 10 years. Shorter courses of therapy may be considered depending on the bone mineral density (BMD) response, but BMD gains are rapidly lost with cessation of denosumab and another therapy such as a bisphosphonate should be given after a course of denosumab is ended to maintain the BMD gains.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^115Fnwwi]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic disease, and antiresorptive treatments are often continued for many years. Despite their established efficacy in reducing fracture risk, the most commonly used antiresorptive treatments, bisphosphonates and denosumab, have short- and long-term risks that, coupled with their benefits and other unique characteristics, influence consideration for at least periodic discontinuation. Bisphosphonates retain their effects even after discontinuation due to their prolonged skeletal retention, whereas denosumab discontinuation is associated with a rapid rebound in bone turnover and increased fracture risk. There is controversy about how, when, and why to potentially stop these agents. We discuss both permanent and temporary discontinuation of long-term treatment with bisphosphonates and denosumab. We focus on the reasons and timing for discontinuation as well as strategies to mitigate future fracture risk.

Discontinuing denosumab

It has been recognized for some time that discontinuing therapy with denosumab results in a rapid reversal of its inhibition of bone remodelling, as manifested by an increase in bone turnover markers as soon as the effect of denosumab lapses, that is followed by decline in BMD. This was recognized as early as 2008 when Miller et al.reported on the complete reversibility of BMD gains following cessation of denosumab therapy, but they did not show an increase in fracture risk in these patients, who were followed for 12–24 months post discontinuation. Similarly Bone et al.completed follow-up of patients for up to 30 months after last injection of denosumab or placebo with similar findings to Miller et al.regarding BMD and bone turnover markers; they showed equal frequency of clinical fractures in both placebo and denosumab discontinuers (4%). Despite these findings, concern remained that at least in theory there may be an increase in fracture risk following denosumab discontinuation. Further work by Brown et al.in 2013 attempted to characterize this risk, following the treatment groups from FREEDOM for up to 24 months following cessation, but again concluded that there was no apparent excess of fracture risk. This study assessed both vertebral and non-vertebral major osteoporotic fractures occurring more than 7 months following the last treatment dose in patients who received 2–5 treatment doses. It is worth noting that 28% of the denosumab-discontinuing patients began an alternative osteoporosis treatment (predominantly bisphosphonates), compared with 42% of the patients who discontinued placebo, which may have mitigated the risk of subsequent fracture. The median follow-up from treatment cessation was 8 months (shorter than the known duration of the rebound phenomenon) and importantly the study did not analyse multiple VFs as a separate entity.

Key Points

Question

What is the real-world risk of fracture for patients treated with denosumab compared with those treated with alendronate?

Findings

In this Danish cohort study including 4624 individuals treated with denosumab and 87 731 individuals treated with alendronate, 3-year cumulative incidence of hip fracture was 3.7% and 3.1% among the denosumab and alendronate cohorts, respectively. The 3-year cumulative incidence of any fracture was 9.0% for both cohorts.

Meaning

In routine clinical practice, initiation of denosumab and alendronate treatments were associated with similar risks of hip and any fracture over a 3-year period.

Discussion

As the data on bisphosphonate and denosumab efficacy, adverse effects, and the risks and benefits of stopping indicate, the clinical management of Ms DMS and Ms BPS presents a nuanced challenge. It underscores the importance of individualized osteoporosis therapy, especially concerning long‐term antiresorptive treatments.

For Ms DMS, who has been on denosumab for more than eight years, the primary concern revolves around the potential rebound she will experience on discontinuation. A complete clinical evaluation should also assess for any signs of new fractures, height loss, or kyphosis, which may indicate undiagnosed vertebral fractures. Diagnostic testing should include a current BMD assessment via DXA, with comparisons to previous results to evaluate BMD trends. Additionally, measuring bone turnover makers can provide insights into her bone resorption status and treatment adherence. For many patients, particularly those at a higher risk of future fracture, denosumab discontinuation is not encouraged in patients with long‐term treatment (> 2 years) given the potential for bone loss and the risk of multiple vertebral fractures.

Given her history of vertebral and wrist fractures, and assuming her fracture risk remains high by DXA, the continuation of denosumab may be the most prudent course. If discontinuation is chosen, likely due to her strong preference, transitioning to a potent bisphosphonate such as zoledronic acid is recommended to prevent postdenosumab rebound bone loss. Zoledronic acid should initially be administered at the time she is due for her next dose of denosumab. She should optimally have monitoring of BTMs three to six months after this first dose of zoledronic to guide the timing of the need for additional doses. If her BTMs remain elevated or if BTMs are not clinically available, it is reasonable to administer a second dose of zoledronic acid three to six months after her first dose. However, the effectiveness of even this potent bisphosphonate to fully prevent the rebound phenomenon is variable, and she should be counseled about these residual risks. Lastly, an alternative, but arguably minimally tested, approach might be to reduce the dosage of denosumab to 30 mg every 6 months and continue this dosage indefinitely of further reducing the dose to 15 mg and combining with zoledronic acid and then stopping the treatment within 18 months. However, little is known about potential adverse effects of reduced doses and their ability to control the rebound overshoot.

### When and how to stop denosumab therapy in a patient with osteoporosis [^112LkLHw]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand which regulates osteoclast activity. It is an effective treatment for osteoporosis with a reduced cumulative rate of vertebral fractures, hip and nonvertebral fractures as well as an increase in bone mineral density. The benefits have been shown to be maintained when treatment is continued up to and likely after 10 years of therapy, but the effects are lost rapidly if treatment is discontinued abruptly. There are rare medical indications for discontinuation of treatment. Discontinuation of denosumab is often driven by concern about complications such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fractures and hypocalcaemia, which remain rare events. Further studies are required to confirm safety and efficacy beyond 10 years of treatment, but it is likely that patients will have ongoing benefits from therapy beyond this. We aim to present a personal perspective of why and how denosumab should be discontinued in patients with osteoporosis.

### Relationship between bone mineral density T-Score and nonvertebral fracture risk over 10 years of denosumab treatment [^114Ky3xY]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Investigational and recently approved therapies, either alone or in combination, have led to large and continued gains in BMD, 6, 7, 8, 9 thus a BMD target for osteoporosis treatment is relevant and of increasing interest. In this context, it has been proposed that potential targets for osteoporosis treatment could include achieving a T ‐score associated with acceptable fracture risk, with the caveat that such a T ‐score could vary depending on other risk factors, such as age, prior fracture history, and a propensity for falls. No consensus has been reached regarding what that T ‐score should be or which site — spine or hip — should be the basis for that potential target. 10, 11

Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds RANKL to inhibit osteoclast formation, function, and survival. In the pivotal, 3‐year FREEDOM trial in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, denosumab significantly reduced bone turnover markers, increased lumbar spine and total hip BMD, and reduced new vertebral fractures, nonvertebral fractures, and hip fractures compared with placebo. 12 Importantly, the gains in total hip BMD explained a large proportion of the observed reduction in fracture risk. 13 Over 10 years of continued denosumab administration, long‐term progressive increases in BMD resulted in an improvement of 21.7% at the lumbar spine, 9.2% at the total hip, and 9.0% at the femoral neck (all P < 0.05). 9, 14, 15, 16

The main objective of the current analysis was to determine the relationship between the incidence of nonvertebral fractures and total hip T ‐scores at the time of the fracture (while receiving denosumab treatment). In addition, we evaluated the proportion of patients who reached a given T ‐score at different time points. Ten years of continued denosumab therapy in the FREEDOM trial and its Extension (Extension Study to Evaluate the Long Term Safety and Efficacy of Denosumab in the Treatment of Osteoporosis) provide a unique opportunity to perform this analysis: Subjects with a wide range of total hip baseline T ‐scores were enrolled, and BMD increased in serial measurements obtained over time with continued denosumab treatment, allowing us to study the relationship between different T ‐scores achieved in response to treatment and subsequent 1‐year incidence of nonvertebral fractures. Our findings underscore the importance of total hip T ‐score as a predictor of nonvertebral fracture risk during treatment for osteoporosis and provide additional insights into the use of BMD as a clinically relevant target for osteoporosis treatment.

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, denosumab, ES 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate denosumab as an alternative initial therapy in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis at high risk for osteoporotic fractures. (1, High) Do not delay or discontinue denosumab without subsequent antiresorptive (such as a bisphosphonate, hormone therapy, or selective estrogen receptor modulator) or other therapy to prevent a rebound in bone turnover and to decrease the risk of rapid bone mineral density loss and an increased risk of fracture.

### Femoral and vertebral strength improvements in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis treated with denosumab [^1135Cr4y]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

In summary, denosumab administered subcutaneously at a dose of 60 mg every 6 months substantially improved FEA estimates of hip and spine strength, both compared with baseline and the administration of calcium and vitamin D only over 36 months. These improvements were progressive over time and were influenced by parallel positive estimated strength changes in both the trabecular and "cortical" compartments. These observations highlight the potential benefit of denosumab to improve and reverse the negative consequence of postmenopausal- and aging-induced skeletal decay on strength, and to markedly reduce fracture incidence in subjects at increased or high risk for hip and spine fractures.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — denosumab dosing, efficacy, safety, and discontinuation: For treatment of osteoporosis, the dose is 60 mg by subcutaneous injection every 6 months; denosumab showed "broad-spectrum" antifracture efficacy as early as 12 months after starting therapy, and studies with duration of up to 10 years indicate persistent fracture protection and a good safety profile. Switching from bisphosphonates to denosumab results in additional gains in BMD. Denosumab is contraindicated in patients with hypocalcemia, and intakes of calcium and vitamin D should be adequate upon starting denosumab treatment to minimize the risk of hypocalcemia. In the FREEDOM study, there was an imbalance in some low-frequency events that did not seem causally related to denosumab treatment, did not increase in frequency with long-term therapy, and have not been reported with high-doses denosumab (Xgeva) used to treat patients with advanced cancer. When treatment with denosumab was stopped after 2 or 8 years, BMD decreased rapidly, and BTMs increased to values above baseline by 12 months after discontinuation; protection from vertebral fractures is quickly lost, but the risk does not usually exceed that in untreated patients, and case reports of multiple vertebral fractures upon stopping denosumab therapy have been reported.

### Bone health and denosumab discontinuation in oncology populations [^113FcK2G]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

The literature regarding denosumab cessation specifically in cancer survivors is limited. The only prospective data come from a phase II follow-up study of women with breast cancer. The preliminary results of this study demonstrate that in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, early breast cancer treated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy, those that ceased denosumab after a median of 7 doses had significantly higher risk of developing clinical vertebral fractures over the follow-up period of 36 months compared with those who ceased placebo (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.12–5.32). Risk of MVF was also increased, but this did not reach statistical significance (HR 3.52, 95% CI 0.98–12.64). However, whether the risk of rebound fractures extends to patients with skeletal metastases where denosumab is prescribed at higher doses has not been defined as evidence is currently limited to case reports.

Given the association between denosumab discontinuation and the "rebound phenomenon", the current position from osteoporosis-focused guidelines is that a denosumab drug holiday is not recommended. As there are well-established data demonstrating relatively low rates of adverse effects associated with up to 10 years of denosumab therapy, one option when using denosumab is to continue treatment indefinitely as life-long preventative therapy. Of note, in individuals with cancer where denosumab is administered for the treatment of bone metastases, discontinuation of denosumab is usually only considered in those with good prognostic features (ie, oligometastatic disease, a perceived low risk of bone complications and a durable response to systemic therapy). Therefore, long-term treatment with denosumab may already be implemented in a large proportion of patients with bone metastases. In contrast, among patients where denosumab is prescribed purely to protect against the detrimental impact of cancer therapies on bone loss and fragility fracture risk (ie, ADT, endocrine therapy), the duration of denosumab therapy often corresponds with the duration of the cancer therapy. As the duration of cancer therapy can vary significantly from patient to patient, lifelong denosumab may not always be an appropriate option, and choosing an alternate antiresorptive therapy or plans to support bone health in the setting of discontinuation of denosumab must be considered. Other clinical scenarios where discontinuation of denosumab should be considered include:

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^113jvZRc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Denosumab discontinuation and sequential antiresorptive therapy — bone mineral density (BMD) changes and timing are described as follows: Discontinuation of denosumab is associated with a BMD decrease of 6.6% in the lumbar spine and 5.3% in the total hip within the first 12 months of treatment discontinuation. After 1 year of denosumab, alendronate retained BMD gains for at least 12 months. Case series suggest zoledronic acid after denosumab is most effective for BMD retention when administered 8 months, rather than 6 months, after the last dose, with a second annual infusion needed to continue retention; risedronate showed only a partial retention of benefits. Several studies indicate alendronate after anabolic treatment will retain and perhaps increase BMD gains, and thus alendronate after anabolic therapy is usually given.

Denosumab

In phase III FREEDOM study (Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every Six Months), denosumab was shown to reduce the risk of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures over 3 years in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In this trial, as scheduled denosumab administration was not adjusted following a fracture, this provided an opportunity to evaluate the effect of denosumab on the fracture healing. In a preplanned analysis of the FREEDOM trial, Adami et al. studied the effect of denosumab on fracture healing in patients presenting with nonvertebral fracture. A total of 667 subjects (303 in the denosumab group and 364 in the placebo group) experienced 851 nonvertebral fractures (386 in the denosumab group and 465 in the placebo group). Seven patients experienced delayed healing (two in the denosumab group and five in the placebo group). In this study, delayed healing or non-union was not observed in any subject who received denosumab within 6 weeks preceding or following the fracture. Fracture healing seemed to be unaffected in patients treated with denosumab, even when administered within a day of the fracture.

Anabolic drugs

PTH and analogs

In this section, studies evaluating effect of PTH and its analogs on fracture healing are reviewed (Table 2). PTH (1–34) (teriparatide) and a PTHrP analog (abaloparatide) are the two licensed peptides that are approved currently. PTH (1–84) was used for several years in Europe but is not currently available for this indication.

### Multiple vertebral fractures after denosumab discontinuation: FREEDOM and FREEDOM extension trials additional post hoc analyses [^1156YFPg]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the ECTS has recommended more intensive bisphosphonate treatment after discontinuation of patients who have had exposure beyond 2.5 years, this guidance was not available when we prepared the analysis plan for our study. We chose 3 years as the cutoff point because it was the original length of the FREEDOM trial and is the treatment duration for most of the osteoporosis treatment studies in the literature. However, with our 3‐year cutoff, the majority of women (55.4%) actually received five denosumab injections, not six, because the cutoff was based on the amount of time on DMAb and not on the number of DMAb doses. No patients classified as " ≤ 3 years use" could have had more than six DMAb treatments. Therefore, the 2.5‐year versus 3‐year cutoffs are probably very similar. The analyses here did not have the design or power to conclude that less than 3 years of DMAb is safe regarding the risk of MVF after discontinuation.

### Multiple vertebral fractures after denosumab discontinuation: FREEDOM and FREEDOM extension trials additional post hoc analyses [^111QdxpW]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Discontinuation of denosumab (DMAb) results in a rapid increase in the biochemical indices of bone turnover, which exceed baseline values within 9 months and remain elevated for up to 30 months after the last dose of DMAb. In association, bone mineral density (BMD) is also lost rapidly and returns to baseline or below baseline levels within 1–2 years. The risks of a vertebral fracture (VF) and multiple vertebral fractures (MVFs; defined as ≥ 2 VFs) also increase rapidly over 6–18 months after the last dose of DMAb. A prior post hoc study of the Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM) and FREEDOM Extension trials estimated the risks of new or worsening VF after DMAb discontinuation. In that study, the annualized rate of MVF was higher after discontinuing DMAb (4.2%) compared with discontinuing placebo (Pbo; 3.2%). Furthermore, of the women who had any VF, the proportion who developed MVF was higher in those who discontinued DMAb versus Pbo (61% versus 39%).

Several lines of evidence suggest that a longer DMAb duration is associated with a higher rebound bone turnover and higher bone loss after discontinuation. Longer DMAb treatment duration is associated with greater bone loss even when bisphosphonate treatment is administered at the time of discontinuation. Furthermore, a longer duration of DMAb treatment has been associated with a higher number and earlier development of MVFs. After a comprehensive review of these findings, a recent European position statement recommended a more intensive strategy after DMAb discontinuation in patients who have had DMAb treatment beyond 2.5 years.

The prior post hoc study of the FREEDOM and FREEDOM Extension trials did not find a relationship between DMAb treatment duration and risk of VF or MVF after DMAb discontinuation. A major limitation of this analysis was that follow‐up radiographs were not available for the majority of patients who discontinued DMAb in the extension trial. Most VFs do not produce clearly defined symptoms at the time of the event. In fact, the vast majority of the radiographs (> 97%) taken after discontinuation of medication were obtained at routine scheduled appointments, and not for intercurrent back pain or any other clinical VF symptomatology. In the prior analysis, those women who did not undergo radiographic examination were assumed to have no VF. Therefore, the calculated fracture rates based on the results from this larger group of women without available radiographs are likely to underestimate the risk of VF and MVF.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^112Rnpie]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the largest comparative effectiveness study conducted to date, we found clinically meaningful reductions in the risk of fracture for patients treated with denosumab vs alendronate in a representative cohort of almost half a million treatment-naïve women with PMO in the US. Over a nearly 8-yr follow-up period, we found greater reductions in the risk of fracture with longer duration of use, which provides complimentary evidence to the results from the original registrational clinical trial and its long-term extension. As fractures are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, this study provides clinically meaningful evidence, comparing available osteoporosis medicines to help guide physicians, patients, and policymakers, and may translate into significant improvement in the quality of life of women with PMO.

Other

There is currently a lack of quality evidence for the safety and/or efficacy of raloxifene, teriparatide/abaloparatide, and romosozumab in the use of patients with or without cancer. Therefore, these agents are currently not recommended as transitional regimens post denosumab in cancer populations.

Although the current evidence for the various denosumab transition regimens is limited, the European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) has recently issued guidelines for denosumab discontinuation follow-up therapy in non-cancer patient populations with osteoporosis (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Adapted from the ECTS Guidelines for denosumab discontinuation. ECTS Guidelines for denosumab discontinuation.^High fracture risk is defined as having risk factors linked to prevalent osteoporosis fractures and concomitant comorbidities (eg, continuous use of glucocorticoids or aromatase inhibitors, diabetes, inflammatory diseases, frailty, etc.).*BTM targets post bisphosphonate suggestive of an adequate response include CTX < 280 ng/L or P1NP < 35 μg/L. Bisphosphonate (BP), bone mineral density (BMD), and bone turnover markers (BTMs).

Oncology societies have yet to provide formal guidance regarding denosumab discontinuation. While it would be reasonable to extrapolate many of the ECTS recommendations to oncology populations, it is important to be aware of potential caveats where aspects of the ECTS guidelines may not be appropriate (ie, the BTM targets may not be applicable for individuals with a high burden of skeletal metastases).

In our current practice, we attempt to consider the rebound phenomenon of denosumab discontinuation when making treatment decisions about antiresorptive agents in patients with cancer. In patients who are expected to need a definitive period of treatment to reverse osteoporosis, we generally favor the use of bisphosphonate therapy. However, as denosumab is associated with greater continued and progressive increases in BMD when compared with bisphosphonates, we would consider denosumab in patients with severe osteoporosis, or in those who remain osteoporotic despite treatment with bisphosphonates. Among patients who have been treated with more than 2 doses of denosumab, we attempt to avoid denosumab discontinuation. However, if denosumab cessation is necessary, we generally administer intravenous zoledronate 6–8 months after the last injection of denosumab, followed possibly by a second dose of zoledronate if BTMs are elevated 3–6 months after the initial dose of zoledronate has been administered.

### The good and the bad about the 2017 American College of Physicians osteoporosis guidelines [^116GXSDb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The American College of Physicians (ACP) published a set of guidelines on how to prevent fractures in men and women with low bone density or osteoporosis. As the population ages, the overall risk of fractures increases, thus burdening the health care system. These guidelines review current evidence for osteoporosis management, providing an update to the previous 2008 ACP's guidelines.

Methods

The ACP put forth 6 recommendations addressing the complexities in osteoporosis management based on evidence available through October 2016 with a focus on bisphosphonates, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen. Evidence was graded according to recommended strength by using the ACP standard methods.

Findings

The ACP recommends anti-osteoporosis therapy with 1 of 3 bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronic acid) or denosumab in patients with osteoporosis, while excluding anabolic therapies, and recommends against raloxifene. Although bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment, anabolic therapy and raloxifene may be used in specific situations. Pharmacologic therapy is recommended for 5 years, oversimplifying length of therapy and failing to promote an individualized patient-centered care approach. Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of denosumab is associated with a decline in bone mineral density (BMD), which must be addressed. Routine monitoring of BMD by dual x-ray absorptiometry is not endorsed during treatment, which leads to underrecognition of management issues. Pharmacologic treatment with bisphosphonates for male osteoporosis is recommended, although therapies such as denosumab and teriparatide are excluded. Finally, the ACP recommends treatment for women aged ≥ 65 years at high risk for fracture with osteopenia after a discussion of patient preferences, fracture risk profile, and medications.

Implications

Osteoporosis management is complex. The 2017 ACP guidelines address challenges faced by clinicians but oversimplify more complex issues. These are among a number of guidelines that are available for osteoporosis management, which may be used in combination with other sources to assist clinicians with diagnostic and management strategies.

### Denosumab discontinuation in patients treated for low bone density and osteoporosis [^1169xv3U]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Denosumab (DMAB) is a potent antiresorptive treatment used for treatment of osteoporosis and low bone mineral density (BMD) in those at high risk for fracture. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, DMAB treatment for 10 years has been studied, with results showing continued gains in BMD, sustained fracture risk reduction, and low risk of adverse events. However, upon discontinuation of DMAB, there is a rapid reversal of effect, with increase in bone turnover, loss of BMD, and in a subset of patients, a greater risk for multiple vertebral fractures.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^113ATxSX]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The publication of a post hoc analysis of FREEDOM and the extension trial in 2018 confirmed that the rate of VF following discontinuation of denosumab rapidly increased from a low rate on therapy to the incidence seen in the untreated population. Cummings et al.analysed the data of 1001 participants who received at least two doses of denosumab and subsequently discontinued therapy but stayed in the study for at least 7 months following the last dose of denosumab. They compared the rate of VF, multiple VF and non-vertebral fracture in the denosumab discontinuers with the same data in 470 equivalent participants who had discontinued placebo in the FREEDOM trial. The VF rate increased from 1.2 per 100 participant-years during the on-treatment years to 7.1 in the denosumab discontinuers; this estimate is similar to the rate of 7.0 in the on-placebo years that increased to 8.5 during the post-placebo years. This increase back to baseline (placebo) is in keeping with the loss of protection of an effective therapy that does not have a sustained post-treatment effect. Interestingly, among the cohort with at least one off-treatment VF, the proportion of denosumab discontinuers with multiple VFs was significantly higher at 60.7% compared with 38.7% of placebo discontinuers. The risk of multiple VFs was 3.4% for denosumab discontinuers compared with 2.2% for placebo discontinuers. This increase in risk of multiple VFs beyond that seen in placebo discontinuers appears more in keeping with the concept of a rebound phenomenon rather than purely the loss of an effective therapy. The risk of sustaining multiple VFs was increased in those with a history of prior VF with an odds ratio of 3.9 (95% CI 2.1–7.1). Multiple VFs were also more common in those with greater gain in hip BMD, greater loss of hip BMD off therapy and longer duration off therapy. There was no significant difference in the rate of non-VFs detected. The argument has been made that the duration of follow-up (only a minority were observed beyond 7 months post last denosumab dose) was insufficient to capture all of the VFs because the biological rebound persists longer than this and thus the rate of VF at 16 months of follow-up has been estimated by other investigators as being up to 15%.

### Comparison of risk of osteoporotic fracture in denosumab vs alendronate treatment within 3 years of initiation [^1118WWqX]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Osteoporosis is characterized by progressive deterioration of bone structure and decreased bone mineral density (BMD). Fractures are a common manifestation of osteoporosis, with hip fracture being the most serious. Worldwide, osteoporosis is the most common metabolic skeletal disease, affecting 200 million persons and causing nearly 9 million fractures annually.

Bisphosphonates are a mainstay of prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, with alendronate being the first-line choice, given its effectiveness and low price. Denosumab was approved in the European Union, including Denmark, in May 2010 for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at high fracture risk. Both denosumab and alendronate are antiresorptive drugs and inhibit osteoclasts, albeit via different mechanisms; while denosumab binds the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor–κB ligand and thereby blocks osteoclasts' formation, maturation, activation, and survival, alendronate binds to bone mineral, where it is absorbed by mature osteoclasts, inducing osteoclast apoptosis and suppressing resorption.

Some adverse effects reported among bisphosphonates users, such as gastrointestinal tract effects or acute kidney injury, are rarely seen with denosumab, owing to differences in administration and clearance between the 2 agents. In contrast to weekly oral alendronate treatment, denosumab treatment, administered subcutaneously every 6 months, removes the need for patient adherence for that period. On the other hand, denosumab is promptly cleared after 6 months, while bisphosphonates linger in bone for many years, potentially partially compensating for suboptimal adherence. Denosumab is a cost-effective treatment for osteoporosis with €50 000 to €60 000 (US$56 232-$67 478) per quality-adjusted life-year gainedand is a potential alternative to alendronate in patients 75 years or older, those with renal impairment, and those with low expected adherence.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113t9bVB]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — pharmacotherapy selection, sequencing, and duration: If the treatment goal is not achieved with bisphosphonates, switching to denosumab or an osteoanabolic drug should be considered, and if the treatment target is reached after 3 to 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy, discontinuation for an interval could be considered with plans to restart if bone loss or fractures occur; if raloxifene or denosumab therapy is stopped, switching to a bisphosphonate would be indicated to prevent rapid BMD loss and loss of fracture protection, and osteoanabolic therapy should always be followed by a bisphosphonate or by denosumab; bisphosphonates require caution in significantly impaired renal function, a holiday should be considered only in women at low fracture risk who no longer meet criteria, and for those remaining at high fracture risk after 3 to 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy, continue treatment or switch to another drug; denosumab is appropriate for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis including those at high fracture risk, there is no limit to its duration, and administration should not be delayed or stopped beyond 7 months without subsequent therapy to prevent bone loss and vertebral fractures; osteoanabolic therapies are most appropriately used in women at very high risk of fracture, including very low BMD (T-score below −3.0), and anabolic therapy should be followed by an antiresorptive agent, with bone mineral density gains greater when an anabolic drug is administered before an antiresorptive drug compared with the opposite sequence.

Denosumab — patient preferences and adherence are reported from comparative studies: "Studies have compared adherence (combination of persistence and compliance) and patient preference for denosumab injections every 6 months to oral bisphosphonates (weekly or monthly)", and "regardless of the treatment sequence during 24 months (alendronate for 12 months, followed by denosumab for 12 months or vice versa), trial participants significantly preferred denosumab to alendronate", with "Subject scores for denosumab" showing greater preference and satisfaction. In observational practice, "persistence with treatment was estimated at ∼87% to 95% and adherence at ∼83% to 89% after 12 months".

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^1117A96i]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

At six months after the last denosumab injection, CTX rises rapidly, often exceeding baseline values.BMD typically returns to pretreatment levels within one to two years after stopping denosumab, and in some cases, the BMD can even drop below baseline, especially at the hip. Those who took denosumab for three or more years and then discontinued had a heightened rate of fractures. The incidence of multiple vertebral fractures was as high as 10% to 15% within the first year after stopping denosumab, even in patients who are subsequently treated with oral bisphosphonates. Beyond duration of previous denosumab use, other risk factors for developing vertebral fractures after denosumab discontinuation include a history of prevalent vertebral fractures, a greater gain in BMD during denosumab therapy, and a greater loss of hip BMD after stopping the drug. Patients with chronic kidney disease are also at higher risk. The rebound may be caused by an exaggerated hyperactivation of a pool of dormant preosteoclasts and osteomorphs that accumulate during the treatment. Additional mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including the depletion of osteoprotegerin‐producing osteoblasts and osteocytes, which leaves RANKL activity unopposed on denosumab cessation, leading to excessive osteoclast activation. Furthermore, the mechanostatic reset hypothesis suggests that bone mass accumulated during denosumab treatment exceeds mechanical strain demands, triggering a compensatory loss of bone on discontinuation. Regardless of the risk factors that contribute to the overshoot, a different potent antiresorptive, such as an intravenous bisphosphonate, is recommended after the discontinuation of denosumab. Previous treatment with bisphosphonates also offers some protection against the rebound effect observed on discontinuation of denosumab. As noted, bisphosphonates, which remain embedded into the bone matrix for years, continue to inhibit osteoclast activity and very likely dampen the excessive bone resorption typically seen after stopping denosumab.

### Zoledronate after denosumab discontinuation: is repeated administrations more effective than single infusion? [^112VJuUK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Although it is well known that Dmab discontinuation is followed by the loss of the BMD gained and possible FX occurrence, it is still not completely clear how to prevent this circumstance. The DATA-switch study highlighted how a subsequent therapy with teriparatide does not offer any advantage, whereas romosozumab might further increase the BMD. Nevertheless, so far, most of the studies have focused on the use of a sequential therapy with BPs. In case of Dmab therapy duration < 2.5 years, a sequential therapy with both alendronate and ZOL has been suggested to be sufficient to prevent the BMD loss and to reduce the occurrence of rebound FX after Dmab discontinuation. However, such therapies might not be effective if administered at the standard doses (ie, the doses approved to treat osteoporosis) if Dmab has been administered for longer time. Furthermore, the best timing of ZOL administration is still unknown, as the only randomized clinical trial (ZOLARMAB), which compared 3 different schedules (at 6 months, at 9 months, or on the basis of the CTX levels above the postmenopausal reference range) found a significant decrease in the BMD in all groups after 12 months, with no differences among the schedules.

In keeping with the available data, in 2020 the ECTS released a position statement about the management of Dmab discontinuation, where the authors recommended to always introduce a sequential therapy with BPs after Dmab, starting from 6 months after the last injection. Whereas patients treated for Dmab for < 2.5 years can be either managed with oral BPs or intravenous ZOL, those treated for a longer time must undergo ZOL and subsequently CTX should be monitored 3 and 6 months later. The ECTS based the definition of an adequate response on the presence of CTX levels < 280 ng/L (mean levels found in healthy premenopausal women), since previous data from the ReoLaus cohort showed that patients who retained BMD 12 months after discontinuing Dmab, during follow-up, had CTX close to this threshold (336 ng/mL) and suggested that in case of finding of higher levels, additional ZOL doses should be given.

### Zoledronate after denosumab discontinuation: is repeated administrations more effective than single infusion? [^115JV7tJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has some limitations. First, the retrospective design could have introduced some unknown bias. Second, the lack of a "control" group treated with a single infusion of ZOL prevented us from a direct comparison of the possible advantage of a repeated administration schedule addressed by CTX levels. Furthermore, we tried to administer the first ZOL 6 months after the last Dmab injection, but it was not always possible due to the real-life organization; we did our best not to delay the infusion beyond 1 month. Lastly, we did not monitor CTX levels 3 months after the first ZOL infusion as recommended by the ECTS panel, and this approach could have delayed the second ZOL administration in some patients, preventing those subjects from the possible benefit of an early repeated treatment. Despite its limitations, our study also has strengths in that we report for the first time the outcome of the systematic application of the cut-off suggested by the ECTS for ZOL retreatment in patients discontinuing Dmab. In particular, our study highlights that up to 75% of patients discontinuing Dmab require repeated ZOL administration, and, still, it may not be sufficient in fully prevent rebound FX, which occurred in 9.6% of our patients, and BMD loss, which (on average) was significant in the group with not-suppressed CTX. Indeed, according to our data, the safety CTX levels to aim for might be lower than the cut-off indicated in the ECTS recommendations.

Besides the importance of maintaining bone turnover control, it seems crucial to guarantee BMD stability after Dmab withdrawal. However, the best strategy to achieve this result is still unknown, although it is clear that the use of BPs at standard doses for the treatment of osteoporosis is not enough in the majority of cases, and, as our study shows, even the administration of a second ZOL 6 months apart cannot guarantee the BMD maintenance in patients with persistently high CTX levels. It seems reasonable, therefore, to precisely administer the first ZOL 6 months after the last Dmab injection and to intensively start monitoring CTX levels immediately after in order to consider further ZOL administrations even earlier than 6 months.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114Ziyv4]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Bisphosphonate duration and drug holiday — effects on remodeling and fracture protection wane slowly over 1–5 y when stopped; a temporary "bisphosphonate holiday" can be considered after 3 to 5 years in patients at low or moderate fracture risk who no longer meet criteria for therapy, as fracture risk increases again after 2 years off oral bisphosphonate therapy. Osteoporosis treatment should be restarted with a significant decline in BMD, an intervening fracture, or other factors altering clinical risk; for those remaining at high risk after 3 to 5 years, continuing the bisphosphonate or switching to denosumab or an osteoanabolic agent is recommended. Therapy considerations note bisphosphonates are appropriate to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal osteoporosis, use with caution in significant renal impairment, and consider a bisphosphonate holiday for women at low or moderate fracture risk.

### Probability of achieving bone mineral density treatment goals with denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^111xDxL8]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Goal-directed treatment is critical in managing chronic health conditions and setting achievable treatment targets that guide initial treatment and treatment adjustments. In patients with osteoporosis, reducing the risk of first or recurrent fracture and increasing BMD can be considered the main treatment goals. Studies show that BMD levels achieved after the initiation of osteoporosis medication (denosumab, alendronate, zoledronic acid, or romosozumab) are robust indicators of subsequent fracture risk.BMD levels attained at the TH are the most consistent predictors of the subsequent risk of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures.

For interpreting BMD determinations by DXA, T-score is the established outcome reported since it reduces differences by DXA manufacturer and model and is the most feasible output in clinical practice. Osteoporosis is defined by a T-score of −2.5 or less, at one of the main skeletal sites, and many guidelines suggest initiating treatment for individuals with T-scores in this osteoporosis range. Furthermore, a T-score above the osteoporotic range (ie, > −2.5) has been proposed as a minimum target for osteoporosis treatment; however, higher target T-scores may be required in patients with higher fracture risk, due to prior fracture history, advanced age, or other major clinical risk factors.

The antiresorptive agent denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high specificity to the human RANK ligand, reduces osteoclast number and activity, thereby reducing bone resorption. In the Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM; NCT00089791) study, postmenopausal women randomized to receive denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 mo for 3 yr had improved BMD at TH and LS and a reduced risk of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures compared with those randomized to placebo. In women who entered the extension phase of the study, FREEDOM Extension (NCT00523341), with denosumab treatment for up to an additional 7 yr, the yearly incidence of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures remained low, and BMD continued to increase without plateau (LS, 21.7%; TH, 9.2%; femoral neck, 9.0%). In addition, with continuous denosumab treatment, subsequent fracture risk was predicted by TH T-score achieved at any time throughout the 10 yr of observation.

### Fracture risk and management of discontinuation of denosumab therapy: a systematic review and position statement by ECTS [^116ebHBx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Denosumab discontinuation is characterized by an increase in bone turnover overriding pre-treatment status, a rapid bone loss in the majority and multiple vertebral fractures (VFx) in some patients.

Methods

A working group of the European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) performed an updated systematic review of existing literature on changes of bone turnover, bone mineral density (BMD), and fracture risk after denosumab discontinuation and provided advice on management based on expert opinion.

Results

Important risk factors for multiple VFx following denosumab cessation are prevalent VFx, longer duration off therapy, greater gain in hip BMD during therapy, and greater loss of hip BMD after therapy according to a retrospective analysis of the FREEDOM Extension Study. Case series indicate that prior bisphosphonate therapy mitigates the biochemical rebound phenomenon after denosumab discontinuation, but it is uncertain whether this attenuation prevents BMD loss and fractures. Current evidence indicates partial efficacy of subsequent antiresorptive treatment with results seemingly dependent on duration of denosumab treatment.

Conclusions

A careful assessment of indications to start denosumab treatment is advised, especially for younger patients. A case for long-term treatment with denosumab can be made for patients at high fracture risk already on denosumab treatment given the favorable efficacy and safety profile. In case of denosumab discontinuation, alternative antiresorptive treatment should be initiated 6 months after the final denosumab injection. Assessment of bone turnover markers may help define the optimal regimen, pending results of ongoing RCTs. Patients having sustained VFx should be offered prompt treatment to reduce high bone turnover.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^1177CTT8]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

During the FREEDOM extension study (4550 participants followed over 7–10 years) there were just two atypical subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femoral fractures, one occurring in the long-term denosumab group after 7 years of exposure and one in the crossover group in year 3 of denosumab therapy. A recent systematic review by the European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) on the topic of AFF reported a total of 31 AFFs in 22 patients receiving denosumab based on 14 case reports and the data from two clinical trials. Eleven of these patients were treated with the 60 mg dose for osteoporosis, with the other patients receiving higher oncological doses. Interestingly, AFF occurred in only four bisphosphonate-naive patients receiving treatment with denosumab for osteoporosis. Two of these patients were participants in the FREEDOM trial; one achieved fracture healing within 6 months of stopping denosumab and another continued denosumab but there is no information available regarding fracture healing. Another patient was a participant in a trial assessing denosumab in the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and had received glucocorticoids for over 30 years. Another patient had a medially located fracture not visible on X-ray (only seen on magnetic resonance imaging) that did not meet the criteria for AFF according to the ASBMR Task Force. The ECTS maintain that the absolute risk of AFF associated with denosumab use is low based on the data analysed in the systematic review. Given the limited evidence for AFF associated with denosumab use (in the absence of other risk factors), no conclusion about the relationship between therapy duration (or even treatment itself) and risk of AFF can be made. Therefore there is no evidence that denosumab therapy should be discontinued to avert AFF. Furthermore due to a lack of randomized studies, it is not possible to assess the effect of denosumab on fracture healing after AFF. It is worth noting that in the ECTS systematic review, there were two patients who developed a second complete AFF on denosumab and a third patient with bilateral recurrent incomplete AFFs on denosumab, despite use of teriparatide. Thus the ECTS suggest ceasing denosumab therapy after a unilateral AFF to prevent worsening of the initial fracture and reduce the risk of developing a contralateral fracture. The risk of denosumab rebound effect, rapid decline in BMD, and potential for multiple VFs must be weighed against the risk of contralateral AFF.

In contrast to adding, switching from denosumab to a PTH analog is not recommended. The rebound effect could be amplified by the stimulation of bone remodeling induced by bone anabolic agents, with negative effects on BTMs and BMD. Although switching from denosumab to romosozumab has been shown to partially attenuate the rebound, there have been reports of vertebral fractures after this sequential treatment. However, when the treatment duration with denosumab is limited, switching to romosozumab can increase lumbar spine BMD to a greater extent than continuing denosumab alone and CTX rebound was evident as soon as three months after the transition. Figure 2 proposes an algorithm for osteoporosis management in patients on longer‐term denosumab, adapted from the ECTS guidance.

Approach to considering DMAB discontinuation (adapted from Tsourdi et al). (1) Risk–benefit balance should account for the risk for rebound multiple vertebral fractures on DMAB discontinuation. High fracture risk: defined by older age (70–75 years), other strong risk factors for fracture, or validated fracture risk assessment tool fracture risk score that is above country specific thresholds. Very high or imminent fracture risk: defined by recent (within two years) fracture while taking DMAB. (2) DMAB can be used indefinitely but only has been studied for up to 10 years. (3) Exit strategy: usually a potent intravenous bisphosphonate (eg, zoledronic acid) administered when the next dose of DMAB would have been due. A pulsatile bisphosphonate can be repeated based on bone turnover markers or if there is a high risk of rebound associated vertebral fractures. Other exit strategies include oral bisphosphonates or DMAB dose reduction ± bisphosphonates. Combination could be considered based on the results of the Denosumab and Teriparatide Administration study and other observational studies.DMAB, denosumab; PTH, parathyroid hormone; ROMO, romosozumab.

### Sequential therapy for the long-term treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^112K5AW6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic condition characterized by decreased bone mass, loss of skeletal integrity, and increased susceptibility to fracture. Drugs used to treat osteoporosis can be classified as those that block bone resorption (antiresorptive), stimulate bone formation (anabolic), or do both. While all currently approved medications reduce the risk of fragility fractures in high-risk populations, they are generally unable to fully restore bone strength in most patients with established disease. Thus, the majority of patients require disease management over many years. Unfortunately, the continuous use of a single drug has limitations, both in terms of efficacy and safety, and so sequential therapy is commonly required. Given the expanding list of pharmacological agents currently available, careful consideration needs to be given as to which drugs to use and in what sequence. This review will evaluate the differential effects of antiresorptive, bone-forming, and dual-acting drugs when used in specific sequences and will explore the current evidence favoring the initial use of bone-forming/dual-acting drugs followed by antiresorptive medications. This review will also examine the notion that long-term treatment with an antiresorptive drug may diminish the efficacy of subsequent treatment with a bone-forming/dual-acting drug. Finally, this review will explore the current evidence pertaining to the specific issue of how to best prevent the clinical ramifications of denosumab cessation.

### Bone mineral density after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate [^111tu5PJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a chronic disease associated with age-related declines in bone mass, changes in bone microarchitecture, and skeletal fragility. These changes place postmenopausal women at increased risk of fragility fractures, which are linked to significant morbidity, economic cost, and negative impact on health-related quality of life. Antiresorptive therapies, including bisphosphonates and denosumab, have been demonstrated to reduce fracture incidence and increase bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, although the optimal duration and sequencing of available treatments remain poorly understood. Whereas bisphosphonates bind to bone mineral and become incorporated into bone matrix, denosumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), is a reversible therapy. There is a rebound in bone turnover after treatment cessation, leading to loss of the bone density gained on treatment and loss of vertebral fracture protection. If denosumab is discontinued, follow-on therapy with a bisphosphonate has been recommended to prevent reversible bone loss, although limited data are available on patients transitioning from denosumab to bisphosphonates, such as alendronate.

The Denosumab Adherence Preference Satisfaction (DAPS) study was a 24-month study designed to compare adherence to denosumab with alendronate over 12 months in postmenopausal women with low BMD. Participants were randomized to receive denosumab or alendronate for the first year, after which they crossed over to receive the other treatment for the second year. We previously reported that the primary efficacy endpoints of adherence, preference, and satisfaction favored injectable denosumab over oral alendronate and that alendronate could maintain the gains in BMD achieved with 1 year of denosumab treatment. Here we perform a descriptive subanalysis of participants randomized to the denosumab/alendronate sequence to investigate the effect of transitioning to alendronate.

Although a variety of medications are effective for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, there is concern that long-term use may incur side effects. Consequently, some have proposed discontinuing or temporarily suspending treatment after a defined period of time. As the benefits of fracture risk reduction may recede during this "drug holiday", the clinician may be faced with deciding when to resume therapy (and with which agent) while avoiding the possible cumulative risk of side effects. This article summarizes data regarding length of treatment and the effects of cessation of treatment on bone density, bone turnover markers, and fracture risk.

### Denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis does not interfere with fracture-healing: results from the FREEDOM trial [^1121Nvmh]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Fracture is the major complication of osteoporosis, and it allows the identification of individuals needing medical intervention for osteoporosis. After nonvertebral fracture, patients often do not receive osteoporosis medical treatment despite evidence that this treatment reduces the risk of subsequent fracture. In this pre planned analysis of the results of the three-year, placebo-controlled FREEDOM trial, we evaluated the effect of denosumab administration on fracture-healing to address theoretical concerns related to initiating or continuing denosumab therapy in patients presenting with a nonvertebral fracture.

Methods

Postmenopausal women aged sixty to ninety years with osteoporosis were randomized to receive 60 mg of denosumab (n = 3902) or a placebo (n = 3906) subcutaneously every six months for three years. Investigators reported complications associated with a fracture or its management and with fracture-healing for all nonvertebral fractures that occurred during the study. Delayed healing was defined as incomplete fracture-healing six months after the fracture.

Results

Six hundred and sixty-seven subjects (303 treated with denosumab and 364 who received a placebo) had a total of 851 nonvertebral fractures (386 in the denosumab group and 465 in the placebo group), including 199 fractures (seventy-nine in the denosumab group and 120 in the placebo group) that were treated surgically. Delayed healing was reported in seven subjects (two in the denosumab group and five in the placebo group), including one with subsequent nonunion (in the placebo group). Neither delayed healing nor nonunion was observed in any subject who had received denosumab within six weeks preceding or following the fracture. A complication associated with the fracture or intervention occurred in five subjects (2%) and twenty subjects (5%) in the denosumab and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.009).

Conclusions

Denosumab in a dose of 60 mg every six months does not seem to delay fracture-healing or contribute to other complications, even when it is administered at or near the time of the fracture.

### 10 years of denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: results from the phase 3 randomised FREEDOM trial and open-label extension [^117PrGEj]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term safety and efficacy of osteoporosis treatment are important because of the chronic nature of the disease. We aimed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of denosumab, which is widely used for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

Methods

In the multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 FREEDOM trial, postmenopausal women aged 60–90 years with osteoporosis were enrolled in 214 centres in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Australasia and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 60 mg subcutaneous denosumab or placebo every 6 months for 3 years. All participants who completed the FREEDOM trial without discontinuing treatment or missing more than one dose of investigational product were eligible to enrol in the open-label, 7-year extension, in which all participants received denosumab. The data represent up to 10 years of denosumab exposure for women who received 3 years of denosumab in FREEDOM and continued in the extension (long-term group), and up to 7 years for women who received 3 years of placebo and transitioned to denosumab in the extension (crossover group). The primary outcome was safety monitoring, comprising assessments of adverse event incidence and serious adverse event incidence, changes in safety laboratory analytes (ie, serum chemistry and haematology), and participant incidence of denosumab antibody formation. Secondary outcomes included new vertebral, hip, and non-vertebral fractures as well as bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and one-third radius. Analyses were done according to the randomised FREEDOM treatment assignments. All participants who received at least one dose of investigational product in FREEDOM or the extension were included in the combined safety analyses. All participants who enrolled in the extension with observed data were included in the efficacy analyses. The FREEDOM trial (NCT00089791) and its extension (NCT00523341) are both registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.

Findings

Between Aug 3, 2004, and June 1, 2005, 7808 women were enrolled in the FREEDOM study. 5928 (76%) women were eligible for enrolment in the extension, and of these, 4550 (77%) were enrolled (2343 long-term, 2207 crossover) between Aug 7, 2007, and June 20, 2008. 2626 women (1343 long-term; 1283 crossover) completed the extension. The yearly exposure-adjusted participant incidence of adverse events for all individuals receiving denosumab decreased from 165·3 to 95·9 per 100 participant-years over the course of 10 years. Serious adverse event rates were generally stable over time, varying between 11·5 and 14·4 per 100 participant-years. One atypical femoral fracture occurred in each group during the extension. Seven cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw were reported in the long-term group and six cases in the crossover group. The yearly incidence of new vertebral fractures (ranging from 0·90% to 1·86%) and non-vertebral fractures (ranging from 0·84% to 2·55%) remained low during the extension, similar to rates observed in the denosumab group during the first three years of the FREEDOM study, and lower than rates projected for a virtual long-term placebo cohort. In the long-term group, BMD increased from FREEDOM baseline by 21·7% at the lumbar spine, 9·2% at total hip, 9·0% at femoral neck, and 2·7% at the one-third radius. In the crossover group, BMD increased from extension baseline by 16·5% at the lumbar spine, 7·4% at total hip, 7·1% at femoral neck, and 2·3% at one-third radius.

Interpretation

Denosumab treatment for up to 10 years was associated with low rates of adverse events, low fracture incidence compared with that observed during the original trial, and continued increases in BMD without plateau.

### The effect of three or six years of denosumab exposure in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis: results from the FREEDOM extension [^116bC2v2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the FREEDOM trial, denosumab was shown to increase BMD, reduce BTMs, and decrease the risk of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. The purposes of the study extension are to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of continued denosumab administration (long- term group) in a large number of participants and to assess the consistency of findings from 3 years of denosumab treatment (crossover group) as compared with the parent study.

For the long-term group that continued denosumab for a total of 6 years, BTMs were maintained at lower than pretreatment levels and BMD continued to increase. These distinctive long-term effects on BMD confirm the results of the extended phase 2 study and are consistent with the previously reported effects of denosumab on trabecular and cortical bone structure. Evidently the apparent differences from bisphosphonate effects reflect the differences in biological mechanisms. However, exactly how the differences in drug mechanism of action result in the observed differences in structural effects remains to be fully elucidated. Fracture incidence in the long-term group remained low and below the rates reported in the FREEDOM placebo group. New vertebral and nonvertebral fracture rates were also lower than the fracture rates that would have been expected if extension participants had received placebo, as estimated with a previously reported methodology. As discussed previously, this methodology is improved from a previous osteoporosis study, not only in the sophistication of the model but also in the use of data from the placebo group of the same trial rather than a different population. These observations are consistent with a 6-year maintenance of effect by denosumab to reduce fractures.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^115yYbJ9]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The rapid and profound rebound in bone turnover could lead to such excessive and uncoordinated remodeling that it results in the perforation of trabeculae, in addition to just their thinning. This mechanism could help explain the observation that multiple vertebral fractures can occur within just a few months of the last denosumab dose, even in patients who had previously achieved substantial gains in BMD. The hypothesis that fracture risk is driven more by the quality of bone microarchitecture, specifically, the preservation of trabecular connectivity, rather than by BMD alone, underscores the importance of stabilizing bone turnover after discontinuing potent antiresorptive therapies such as denosumab. Monitoring BTMs may be as or more important than monitoring BMD in predicting and preventing fractures. If the rebound in turnover could be controlled or mitigated, it might be possible to prevent the catastrophic structural failures that lead to fractures, particularly multiple vertebral fractures. Bisphosphonate treatment before or after denosumab does not always reduce the BMD loss over the time, but it strongly reduces the incidence of multiple vertebral fractures by attenuating the rebound in BTMs. Moreover, the Denosumab Adherence Preference Satisfaction trial demonstrated that switching to alendronate after one year of denosumab discontinuation successfully maintained bone mass in 80% to 90% of patients. Furthermore, administering zoledronic acid after two years of denosumab can be effective in mitigating bone loss and maintaining bone density.

### Denosumab discontinuation in the clinic: implications of rebound bone turnover and emerging strategies to prevent bone loss and fractures [^1111UAdx]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The question of optimal sequence after longer-term denosumab (> 5 yr) is yet more challenging. Six women followed up after completing the FREEDOM extension had 1 dose of zoledronic acid after 7 yr denosumab and lost half of LS BMD gains and all of TH BMD gains within the next 2 yr. A real-world study (n = 282) provides a hint in suggesting repeat doses of zoledronic acid in short succession may be required to achieve a similar degree of BMD preservation in patients on longer-term denosumab (mean 7.5 yr) compared to those on short-to-medium-term use.

To summarize, bisphosphonates may prevent VFs in patients ceasing denosumab after medium- and long-term use, although BMD invariably declines with the various bisphosphonate strategies and at best, there is partial retention of BMD effect with repeated infusions of zoledronic acid. Complete preservation of BMD in this group is not a consistent finding and patients seeking to stop denosumab after medium- to long-term use should expect a degree of bone loss. Further details on these studies can be found in Table 4. Strategies to preserve BMD after > 8 yr of denosumab have not been examined by any study at this stage, and this evidence-free zone creates uncertainty, particularly as denosumab safety data do not exceed 10 yr. A greater understanding of the pharmacobiology of RANKL inhibition and novel strategies to address this are urgently needed for this growing group of patients.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^111E7Gpr]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

An alternative preliminarily tested approach to managing denosumab discontinuation involves gradual dose reduction. Tapering the dose of denosumab (to 30 mg and then 15 mg) could prevent the significant bone loss observed after stopping the standard 60‐mg treatment. A combined approach with reduced dose of denosumab paralleled by the administration of a potent antiresorptive such as zoledronic acid could eventually be proven to attenuate rebound.

Beyond ONJ and AFF, denosumab potential adverse events include an increased risk of infections, seen in some but not all denosumab studies and in one metanalysis showing more mostly minor respiratory tract infections. Although some studies have suggested a potential increased risk of infections with denosumab, other evidence provides more reassurance. In one population‐based cohort, denosumab was not associated with higher rates of hospitalized infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving a biologic compared to those treated with zoledronic acid.

There is an argument for continuing denosumab in patients who are responding well to treatment, particularly in terms of maintaining or improving BMD and reducing fracture risk. In contrast to bisphosphonates, there is no compelling evidence that denosumab becomes less effective or more dangerous with extended use. Therefore, continuing treatment can be a reasonable and effective strategy for long‐term management of osteoporosis. The decision to discontinue denosumab can be considered particularly when the patient's clinical status changes. For example, if a patient experiences a new fracture or if their BMD does not improve despite ongoing denosumab therapy, this could indicate that the treatment is no longer effective. For cases in which denosumab is no longer sufficient to prevent fractures, the best strategy might not be discontinuation or switching but rather the addition of another treatment, such as an osteoanabolic medication, on top of denosumab to increase bone strength and reduce fracture risk.

### Relationship between bone mineral density T-Score and nonvertebral fracture risk over 10 years of denosumab treatment [^115HL6ic]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Although treat-to-target strategies are being discussed in osteoporosis, there is little evidence of what the target should be to reduce fracture risk maximally. We investigated the relationship between total hip BMD T-score and the incidence of nonvertebral fracture in women who received up to 10 years of continued denosumab therapy in the FREEDOM (3 years) study and its long-term Extension (up to 7 years) study. We report the percentages of women who achieved a range of T-scores at the total hip or femoral neck over 10 years of denosumab treatment (1343 women completed 10 years of treatment). The incidence of nonvertebral fractures was lower with higher total hip T-score. This relationship plateaued at a T-score between -2.0 and -1.5 and was independent of age and prevalent vertebral fractures, similar to observations in treatment-naïve subjects. Reaching a specific T-score during denosumab treatment was dependent on the baseline T-score, with higher T-scores at baseline more likely to result in higher T-scores at each time point during the study. Our findings highlight the importance of follow-up BMD measurements in patients receiving denosumab therapy because BMD remains a robust indicator of fracture risk. These data support the notion of a specific T-score threshold as a practical target for therapy in osteoporosis. © 2019 The Authors Journal of Bone and Mineral Research published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

### Western osteoporosis alliance clinical practice series: evaluating the balance of benefits and risks of long-term osteoporosis therapies [^114284rA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic disease that requires life-long strategies to reduce fracture risk. Few trials have investigated the balance of benefits and risk with long-term use of osteoporosis therapies, and fewer still have investigated the consequences of treatment discontinuation. The best available evidence suggests that up to 10 years of treatment with an oral bisphosphonate maintains the degree of fracture risk reduction observed in the 3-year registration trials. With denosumab, 10 years of therapy appears to provide fracture risk reduction similar to or better than that observed in the 3-year registration trial. Available data suggest an increasing but low risk of fractures with atypical features with increasing duration of bisphosphonate therapy. Published data linking duration of therapy to osteonecrosis of the jaw are lacking for bisphosphonates and denosumab. Other side effects associated with denosumab or bisphosphonates do not appear to be related to therapy duration. The antifracture benefits of long-term therapy with bisphosphonates and denosumab in appropriately selected patients outweigh the low risk of serious side effects.

### Prevention and management of denosumab discontinuation rebound fractures [^114q9ip1]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Denosumab rebound-associated fractures occur in approximately 1 out of 14 patients who discontinue denosumab therapy without sequential antiresorptive therapy. They occur due to excessive bone resorption after missed or delayed denosumab doses. The fractures are multiple and quality of life altering. This phenomenon occurs in all patient populations that use prolonged denosumab therapy. Average delay in denosumab dosing beyond 7 months or discontinuation of denosumab without sequential therapy is associated with increased mortality in retrospective studies. Multiple medication regimens used after the end of denosumab therapy have been shown to substantially reduce the risk of rebound vertebral fractures.

### The effect of three or six years of denosumab exposure in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis: results from the FREEDOM extension [^1171Mys3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context:

The Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM) extension is evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of denosumab for up to 10 years.

Objective:

The objective of the study was to report results from the first 3 years of the extension, representing up to 6 years of denosumab exposure.

Design, Setting, and Participants:

This was a multicenter, international, open-label study of 4550 women.

Intervention:

Women from the FREEDOM denosumab group received 3 more years of denosumab for a total of 6 years (long-term) and women from the FREEDOM placebo group received 3 years of denosumab (crossover).

Main Outcome Measures:

Bone turnover markers (BTMs), bone mineral density (BMD), fracture, and safety data are reported.

Results:

Reductions in BTMs were maintained (long-term) or achieved rapidly (crossover) after denosumab administration. In the long-term group, BMD further increased for cumulative 6-year gains of 15.2% (lumbar spine) and 7.5% (total hip). During the first 3 years of denosumab treatment, the crossover group had significant gains in lumbar spine (9.4%) and total hip (4.8%) BMD, similar to the long-term group during the 3-year FREEDOM trial. In the long-term group, fracture incidences remained low and below the rates projected for a virtual placebo cohort. In the crossover group, 3-year incidences of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures were similar to those of the FREEDOM denosumab group. Incidence rates of adverse events did not increase over time. Six participants had events of osteonecrosis of the jaw confirmed by adjudication. One participant had a fracture adjudicated as consistent with atypical femoral fracture.

Conclusion:

Denosumab treatment for 6 years remained well tolerated, maintained reduced bone turnover, and continued to increase BMD. Fracture incidence remained low.

### Five years of denosumab exposure in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis: results from the first two years of the FREEDOM extension [^117C374T]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

The 3-year FREEDOM trial assessed the efficacy and safety of 60 mg denosumab every 6 months for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Participants who completed the FREEDOM trial were eligible to enter an extension to continue the evaluation of denosumab efficacy and safety for up to 10 years. For the extension results presented here, women from the FREEDOM denosumab group had 2 more years of denosumab treatment (long-term group) and those from the FREEDOM placebo group had 2 years of denosumab exposure (cross-over group). We report results for bone turnover markers (BTMs), bone mineral density (BMD), fracture rates, and safety. A total of 4550 women enrolled in the extension (2343 long-term; 2207 cross-over). Reductions in BTMs were maintained (long-term group) or occurred rapidly (cross-over group) following denosumab administration. In the long-term group, lumbar spine and total hip BMD increased further, resulting in 5-year gains of 13.7% and 7.0%, respectively. In the cross-over group, BMD increased at the lumbar spine (7.7%) and total hip (4.0%) during the 2-year denosumab treatment. Yearly fracture incidences for both groups were below rates observed in the FREEDOM placebo group and below rates projected for a "virtual untreated twin" cohort. Adverse events did not increase with long-term denosumab administration. Two adverse events in the cross-over group were adjudicated as consistent with osteonecrosis of the jaw. Five-year denosumab treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis maintained BTM reduction and increased BMD, and was associated with low fracture rates and a favorable risk/benefit profile. © 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research

### New national osteoporosis guidance-implications for geriatricians [^114yhHtm]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Parenteral therapies, to reduce very high fracture risk, include antiresorptive (intravenous zoledronate and subcutaneous denosumab) and anabolic agents (subcutaneous teriparatide and biosimilars, and potentially romosozumab). The emphasis on earlier parenteral treatment is new, and reflects (i) well-recognised adherence challenges with oral bisphosphonates, (ii) the unacceptable treatment gap currently evident in the UK (see above), (iii) high clinical and cost effectiveness of zoledronate, (iv) a strong evidence-base to support use of denosumab out to 10 years and, importantly, (v) the increasing range of anabolic anti-osteoporosis treatments which are first-line options in some very high risk individuals, especially those with multiple vertebral fractures.

The recommendation to consider referral when high doses of glucocorticoids are planned reflects the fact that bone is lost rapidly when glucocorticoids are started, hence fracture risk increases sharply. NOGG emphasises that if any delay is anticipated in the referral pathway, an oral bisphosphonate should be started in the meantime.

### Treatment sequence for osteoporosis [^116YbzR7]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a chronic progressive disease that requires lifelong monitoring and treatment. Sequencing from one treatment to another at different ages and stages of disease is an approach that can maximize benefits and avoid potential risks from long-term treatment with a single agent.

Objective

This article reviews clinical trial data in postmenopausal women that evaluate the effects of antiresorptive agents followed by other antiresorptives, osteoanabolic agents followed by antiresorptives, and antiresorptives followed by osteoanabolic medications.

Methods

Literature review and discussion.

Results

When medications are discontinued, in the absence of sequential therapy, bone turnover rates return to baseline or above baseline, and bone loss occurs. The rate of bone loss differs for different treatments, with a very slow decline after stopping bisphosphonates and a particularly rapid decline after stopping denosumab. Careful attention to osteoporosis medication transitions can mitigate bone density loss and its consequences. For women who remain at high risk, switching from bisphosphonates to the more potent antiresorptive, denosumab, will result in further improvement in bone mineral density (BMD). When indicated, stopping denosumab can be accomplished safely by transition to an adequate bisphosphonate regimen. For high- and very-high-risk patients, treating with osteoanabolic agents first, followed by antiresorptive agents, produces substantially larger BMD gains than the reverse treatment sequence, with the biggest differences seen for BMD of the hip.

Conclusion

Awareness of the importance of treatment sequences can help improve osteoporosis care across the postmenopausal lifespan.

### 'Bone health-across a woman's lifespan' [^117Hwivd]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Zoledronic acid has excellent efficacy in fracture risk reduction in post‐menopausal osteoporosis with significantly reduced (70%) rates of vertebral morphometric fractures and 41% reduced hip fracture risk following three infusions of 5 mg zoledronic acid at baseline, 12 and 24 months, compared to placebo. Optimal dosing interval remains an area of ongoing research and ongoing post‐hoc analyses have shown similar improvement in BMD, reductions in bone turnover markers, and decreased vertebral fracture risk persisting beyond 12–18 months following a single dose of zoledronic acid.

Denosumab is a potent antiresorptive, improving mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone. It has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of hip, morphometric vertebral and non‐vertebral fractures by 40%, 68% and 20% respectively. However, unlike bisphosphonates which are sequestered in bone, the effect of denosumab on bone wanes rapidly with strict 6‐monthly administration required. Once started, denosumab therapy should not be interrupted due to an increased risk of rebound fractures (highest in those with previous vertebral fracture) with rapid increase in bone resorption following cessation. Currently, definitive measures to mitigate this rebound fracture risk are unclear but alternative antiresorptive treatment, such as zoledronic acid, should be given 6 months after the final denosumab injection. Following a dose of zoledronic acid, the effect can be monitored with BTMs at 3 and 6 months: in the case of increased BTMs (i.e. above the mean found in age‐ and sex‐matched cohorts), repeated infusion of zoledronate should be considered. As such, the use of denosumab should be carefully considered in those who may require prolonged treatment for osteoporosis and reserved as first‐line only for older patients and in those where bisphosphonate and/or osteoanabolic treatment is inappropriate.

What is the rationale for choosing the minimum target of > −2.5?

In some countries, a T-score < −2.5 represents an indication for pharmacologic treatment regardless of other risk factors. However, since fracture risk is dependent on other factors, notably age and prevalent fracture, a T-score > −2.5 should be considered the minimal target. For countries with different or no T-score intervention thresholds, T-score targets should be adjusted accordingly.

Patients with other important risk factors might warrant higher T-score targets. This is demonstrated very clearly in analyses from the denosumab FREEDOM trial (Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Mo) and its extension. The relationship between attained T-score on denosumab treatment and subsequent fracture risk is maintained in individuals with and without prior fracture, but the risk at all BMD levels is much higher in those with a fracture history (Figure 3). These data support setting higher T-score targets in patients with a history of fracture. Higher T-score targets might also be suggested for patients with advanced age, recent falls history, and poor physical function. In these patients, T-score targets of −2.0 or even −1.5 might be appropriate. In the ARCH trial, where all patients had fractures at entry, progressive lowering of subsequent fracture risk was observed as 1 yr TH T-scores approached −1.5.

Figure 3
Relationship between T-score attained on denosumab and subsequent risk of nonvertebral fracture in full population (A), by age < 75 vs. > 75 yr (B), and by prior history of fracture (C).

A higher T-score target might also be considered in patients for whom a pause in medication is being considered. Anyone who stops osteoporosis medication will lose bone eventually, though the rate of loss is dependent on what medication is being discontinued. Bone loss rates after stopping bisphosphonates are much slower than bone loss rates after stopping all other agents. Therefore, medication pauses should only be considered in patients whose last treatment is a bisphosphonate. Aiming for a higher T-score in those patients being considered for a medication pause might permit maintenance of T-score above −2.5 even after the expected bone loss occurs (see section below on BMD maintenance for further discussion).

Key Points for Practice
- Bisphosphonates, for up to five years orally or three years intravenously, are first-line therapy for osteoporosis.
- Denosumab injections every six months improve bone density more quickly than bisphosphonates, although bone density improvements fade within months after discontinuation unless bisphosphonates are started.
- Parathyroid hormone analog therapy for up to two years dramatically improves bone density and reduces fractures but requires subsequent bisphosphonate use to maintain benefit.
- One year of treatment with romosozumab, a sclerostin-binding analog, followed by one year of alendronate reduces fracture risk more than two years of alendronate therapy alone. PARATHYROID HORMONE ANALOGS In patients with very high risk of fracture due to a history of severe or multiple vertebral fractures, a T-score of −3 or lower, or multiple risk factors, the parathyroid hormone analogs teriparatide and abaloparatide are highly effective.

Parathyroid hormone analogs can also be used in patients whose symptoms do not respond to antiresorptive therapy. Unlike antiresorptive agents, they can restore bone mass that is already lost in patients with advanced osteoporosis. Treatment duration should be limited to two years because of a possible risk of osteosarcoma. Although teriparatide and abaloparatide improve bone density and reduce vertebral and nonvertebral fracture, abaloparatide increases bone density more than teriparatide and more effectively reduces new vertebral fracture. SCLEROSTIN-BINDING ANALOGS Like the parathyroid hormone analogs, the sclerostin-binding analog romosozumab is an anabolic agent for patients at very high risk of fracture. Use of romosozumab is limited to one year based on the limited duration of studies to date. Treating with romosozumab for one year followed by one year of alendronate reduces fracture risk compared with alendronate treatment for 24 months.

Romosozumab use increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death, and there is a U. S. Food and Drug Administration boxed warning against use in patients with myocardial infarction or stroke within one year. Romosozumab is contraindicated in patients with hypocalcemia and rarely can lead to osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fracture.

### What to Do when denosumab is stopped? [^115nZfX6]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

On average, median spine bone mineral density decreased in the longer-term denosumab users, but median hip BMD did not change overall, and median spine BMD was maintained in shorter-term users. However, average is just that — there was BMD loss at the spine and/or hip in shorter- and longer-term denosumab users.
1. In a 3-year placebo-controlled trial, 2 denosumab reduced the risk of vertebral fractures by 68% and the risk of hip fractures by 40%, and in a 7-year extension, 3 the reduction in fracture risk was even better, and mean 10-year BMD gains were more than 20% in the spine and almost 10% in the hip. The BMD gains suggest that more is going on besides a reduction in bone resorption. Denosumab is given by subcutaneous injection every 6 months; it is cleared by the reticuloendothelial system and levels drop to nearly nothing by 7 months after injection.

Once it is gone, bone resorption markers increase rapidly, rebound above pretreatment levels, and take 18 to 24 months to return to baseline. BMD gains are gone within 1 to 2 years. 4 Protection against fracture is rapidly lost, and there may be a window of increased vulnerability for multiple vertebral fracture. Treatment to reduce fracture risk is a long-range project. Denosumab is safe and effective for long-term use, and, once started, likely should be continued indefinitely. The literature provides reassuring data from the 3-year placebo-controlled trial, 2 the 7-year extension3, and 4 trials with higher doses of denosumab in thousands of patients with bone metastases or multiple myeloma who, over 2 years, received the equivalent 24 years of the dose use to treat patients with osteoporosis. It is unlikely that 1 to 2 doses of denosumab will result in major changes in anything after stopping.

The dilemma is what to do with longer-term users who stop, and the real question is not what happens to BMD, but what happens to fracture risk. It is unlikely that the fracture risk question can be answered due to ethical limitations, but finding the best option to minimize bone loss and the rebound increase in bone resorption after stopping long-term denosumab requires larger and longer studies of better design.

### Denosumab and fracture prevention in primary care practice… [^111vJPeH]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Osteoporosis drug treatments, especially antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates, are often prescribed by primary care clinicians. Multiple guidelines endorse use of US Food and Drug Administration –approved oral or parental bisphosphonates as first-line antiresorptive therapy. 1 Some guidelines recommend denosumab, a monoclonal antibody with potent antiresorptive effects administered subcutaneously by a health care professional every 6. months, as an alternative initial therapy to bisphosphonates or for long-term treatment in patients remaining at high fracture risk after 3 to 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy. 2 Denosumab is promoted as a more convenient therapy and has fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects than oral bisphosphonates, which might explain why denosumab prescriptions are increasing while bisphosphonate use remains constant.

3 However, 3-year persistence with denosumab is similar, 4 and intravenous bisphosphonates have no gastrointestinal adverse effects. Additional key considerations when deciding whether to prescribe denosumab for osteoporosis treatment are discussed later and in the Box. Bauer DC, Ensrud KE.
