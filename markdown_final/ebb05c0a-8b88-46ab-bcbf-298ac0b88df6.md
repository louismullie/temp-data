## Question

Is vaginal estrogen appropriate for survivors of ER/PR-positive breast cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vaginal estrogen is appropriate for survivors of ER/PR-positive breast cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is on tamoxifen versus an aromatase inhibitor. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic data regarding systemic absorption with low-dose vaginal estrogens. Next, I will review clinical outcome data on recurrence and mortality, and I need to check how large observational studies and trials inform risk stratification. After that, I should examine guideline recommendations and shared decision-making frameworks. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, risk-stratified approach for product selection, dosing, and monitoring, while ensuring oncologic safety and symptom relief [^115uKnuE] [^116EqLmJ].

> Let me first confirm the problem we are trying to solve clinically, which is genitourinary syndrome of menopause compromising quality of life and potentially adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy in HR-positive breast cancer survivors, because alleviating GSM can improve comfort and may help patients stay on life-prolonging endocrine therapy, although I should confirm that evidence for adherence gains with VET is limited in cohort data [^1155QhvK] [^1143i5cd].

> I will now examine pharmacokinetic absorption, and I need to ensure I am using ultrasensitive LC-MS/MS data when possible; low-dose estradiol inserts such as the 4 μg and 10 μg softgel result in mean circulating estradiol levels generally within postmenopausal ranges, with absorption highest early when mucosa is atrophic and decreasing as the epithelium estrogenizes, and this pattern suggests minimal to negligible systemic exposure with lower-dose products, although I should double-check that initial transient rises can occur and may be clinically relevant for AI users [^114GigQu] [^116FzXiz].

> Next, I should review ultra-low-dose estriol gel data in AI-treated survivors; in a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, estradiol and estrone remained below quantification at all time points while estriol showed only transient early increases that normalized by week 12, indicating negligible systemic estrogenic impact, but I must not over-interpret hormonal surrogates as proof of oncologic safety since the trial was not powered for recurrence outcomes [^116Kko4B] [^111aAAgH].

> Hold on, I should verify the experience with estradiol delivery systems in AI users; a JAMA Oncology randomized trial evaluating an estradiol vaginal ring at 7.5 μg/day used a safety threshold of persistent estradiol elevations above 10 pg/mL, and while many patients remained below this threshold, a subset exceeded it, which cautions me that even low-dose estradiol products can occasionally produce measurable rises in AI-treated women and therefore require careful selection and monitoring in that subgroup [^112RpUah].

> I need to check smaller prospective Estring studies as well; although sample sizes were modest, one study measuring estradiol at baseline and week 16 did not show significant persistent increases and reported symptom improvement, but the small numbers and limited time points mean I should be cautious about generalizing these findings to all AI users [^11721pRL].

> Now, let me review the clinical outcomes that matter most, namely recurrence and mortality; the large Danish national cohort found that overall, vaginal estrogen therapy after ER-positive early breast cancer was not associated with increased recurrence or mortality, and at first glance I might conclude that VET is broadly safe, but wait, subgroup analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in recurrence among women on aromatase inhibitors using VET, whereas no such increase was seen with tamoxifen, which changes the risk calculus for AI users despite the overall neutral signal [^116EqLmJ] [^112Psteu] [^113YZdo6].

> I should confirm whether mortality signals exist; a recent JAMA Oncology analysis of two UK cohorts did not demonstrate an increase in breast cancer-specific mortality with vaginal estrogen therapy, which aligns with the Danish observation of no mortality increase, though I need to remember that recurrence and mortality can diverge and subgroup effects in AI users remain a particular concern requiring individualized counseling [^112JRWxB] [^116EqLmJ].

> Let me consider how systemic hormone therapy trials contextualize this; the HABITS trial showed increased recurrence with systemic estrogen-progestin therapy while the Stockholm trial, designed to minimize progestin exposure, did not, reinforcing that systemic progestins are a major driver of risk and supporting the principle that progestin exposure should be avoided in this population, although these trials evaluated systemic therapy and not local VET, their divergent results underscore mechanistic concerns and the protective ER blockade with tamoxifen that may mitigate small estrogen signals [^112SVfT5].

> Next, I should review guidelines; the Endocrine Society recommends nonhormonal measures first and then a shared decision-making approach involving the oncologist for considering low-dose vaginal estrogen in breast cancer survivors with refractory GSM, and Canadian SOGC guidance similarly supports local vaginal estrogen after discussion with the oncology team when lubricants and moisturizers fail, while an expert JCEM review advises particular caution or avoidance in AI users due to the potential to counteract estrogen suppression [^115uKnuE] [^112nkLqJ] [^112DF5rR] [^113xGxS7].

> Translating this into practice, I should stratify by endocrine therapy; for patients on tamoxifen with severe GSM refractory to nonhormonal therapy, low-dose local estrogen can be considered with shared decision-making, whereas for patients on aromatase inhibitors, I should first optimize nonhormonal options and consider alternatives such as short-duration intravaginal testosterone or vaginal DHEA where appropriate, acknowledging that DHEA and testosterone safety data post-breast cancer remain limited, and if VET is ultimately chosen in AI users, it should be the lowest effective dose with careful monitoring and oncologist involvement [^112RpUah] [^113xGxS7].

> I need to ensure product selection minimizes systemic exposure; ultra-low-dose estriol 0.005% gel has reassuring PK data in AI users with no quantifiable estradiol or estrone and only transient early estriol increases, and low-dose estradiol softgel inserts as low as 4 μg keep mean levels in the postmenopausal range, so I would preferentially choose these lower-dose local options, start with the least frequent effective schedule, avoid higher-dose creams, and reassess as the mucosa thickens to potentially reduce dosing frequency [^116Kko4B] [^116FzXiz].

> I should confirm safety counseling and monitoring steps; I will document shared decision-making with the oncologist, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, reinforce prompt reporting of vaginal bleeding, consider ultrasensitive estradiol monitoring in select AI users if symptoms or clinical context warrant, and schedule follow-up to reassess GSM control, endocrine therapy adherence, and any breast changes, aligning with regulatory labeling principles for estrogen therapies and the overarching priority to maintain effective adjuvant endocrine therapy [^115XdSXn] [^1137qqiX].

> In summary, vaginal estrogen is not categorically contraindicated in ER/PR-positive breast cancer survivors, but appropriateness depends on endocrine therapy and symptom refractoriness; it is reasonable after nonhormonal failure in tamoxifen-treated patients using the lowest-dose local products within a shared decision framework, whereas in aromatase inhibitor users, a signal for increased recurrence with VET mandates heightened caution, exploration of alternatives first, and, if used, meticulous dosing and monitoring with oncologist partnership [^116EqLmJ] [^115uKnuE] [^112JRWxB] [^116Kko4B].

Vaginal estrogen is **not first-line** for ER/PR-positive breast cancer survivors due to recurrence concerns [^112Psteu], especially with aromatase inhibitors [^116EqLmJ]. Use only if nonhormonal options fail, **after oncologist consultation and shared decision-making** [^115uKnuE]. If used, prefer ultra-low-dose estriol [^113ybKhy] or 4–10 µg estradiol inserts [^116FzXiz], monitor for early transient absorption [^114GigQu], and limit duration [^112mT1cT]. Avoid in active disease or high-risk patients, and monitor for recurrence and endometrial effects [^1179vkCp].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Nonhormonal options (moisturizers, lubricants, pelvic floor therapy) [^114Go1z6] are recommended initially for GSM in breast cancer survivors [^115uKnuE].

- **Second-line therapy**: Consider low-dose vaginal estrogen [^115uKnuE] only if nonhormonal therapies fail, with oncologist involvement and shared decision-making [^114Go1z6].

- **Patient selection**: Use cautiously in ER/PR-positive survivors, especially on aromatase inhibitors [^112Psteu], due to potential recurrence risk [^116EqLmJ].

---

## Evidence on safety and recurrence risk

- **Systemic absorption**: Low-dose vaginal estrogen has minimal systemic absorption [^116FzXiz], but transient early increases can occur [^114GigQu], particularly with atrophic mucosa [^112SbLrJ].

- **Recurrence risk**: Most observational data show no significant recurrence increase overall [^112qVKod], but a Danish cohort found higher recurrence with vaginal estrogen in AI-treated women (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.04–1.85) [^116EqLmJ].

- **Tamoxifen vs AIs**: Tamoxifen may offset modest estrogen rises [^116EqLmJ]; AI-treated patients may be more vulnerable to recurrence with vaginal estrogen.

---

## Efficacy in symptom relief

Vaginal estrogen effectively improves **GSM symptoms [^112PpAWd] and quality of life** in breast cancer survivors [^112RpUah]. Symptom improvement may **enhance adherence**, indirectly supporting outcomes [^1155QhvK] [^112PpAWd].

---

## Alternative non-hormonal therapies

Non-hormonal options such as moisturizers, lubricants, pelvic floor therapy, and vaginal laser therapy are **effective alternatives**. Emerging **evidence** supports efficacy of vaginal laser therapy for GSM in breast cancer survivors.

---

## Patient selection criteria and contraindications

Reserve use for **severe, refractory GSM** after nonhormonal failure, with oncologist input and shared decision-making [^112DF5rR] [^115uKnuE]. Contraindications include **active disease**, **high recurrence risk** [^112DF5rR], or strong patient preference against hormones [^114Go1z6].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly **assess** for recurrence, endometrial hyperplasia, and adverse effects during therapy [^1179vkCp] [^112DF5rR]. Schedule **consistent visits** to reassess risks, benefits, and patient preferences [^114Go1z6] [^112DF5rR].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical guidance** |
|-|-|-|
| Nonhormonal therapies | High | First-line for GSM [^115uKnuE] in breast cancer survivors [^112DF5rR] |
| Vaginal estrogen | Moderate | - Second-line after nonhormonal failure [^112DF5rR] <br/> - Oncologist involvement required [^114Go1z6] |
| Aromatase inhibitor patients | Moderate | - Use cautiously <br/> - Potential recurrence risk [^116EqLmJ] |
| Tamoxifen patients | Moderate | May be safer due to receptor blockade [^116EqLmJ] |
| Monitoring | High | Regular assessment for recurrence [^112DF5rR] and adverse effects [^114Go1z6] |

---

Vaginal estrogen can be considered for ER/PR-positive breast cancer survivors with severe, refractory GSM, but use cautiously in AI-treated patients due to possible recurrence risk [^116EqLmJ]. Prioritize **nonhormonal options** [^115uKnuE], involve the oncologist, and monitor closely [^1179vkCp].

Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

Our results provide clinical evidence on the efficacy of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors treated with NSAI. Despite the ultra-low dose of estriol, the application of the gel is safe and improves vaginal symptoms and signs, including vaginal pH and maturation associated with the depletion of estrogens that occurs in these patients, resulting in improved sexual function. The negligible impact of the product on the levels of estrogens, FSH, and LH supports the safe use of this ultra-low dose estriol vaginal gel as a treatment option for vulvovaginal atrophy in BSCs receiving NSAIs.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^114GigQu]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

We found that absorption of estradiol was higher with initial administration, when the vaginal lining was atrophic, than at later treatment periods when the vaginal lining was thickened in some studies. The reason for this higher early absorption is hypothesized to be due to the thin, atrophied vaginal lining that undergoes "estrogenization" and thickening with continued use of vaginal estrogens over time. The physiological changes and symptoms associated with VVA, or the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, are known to be associated with diminishing levels of circulating estrogens at the time of menopause. For example, the ratio of superficial and parabasal cells in the tissue lining the vagina dramatically changes with the loss of superficial cells at menopause.

Several clinical studies show that vaginal estrogen therapies effectively increase the percentage of vaginal superficial cells, essentially "estrogenizing" and thickening the vaginal wall that had atrophied with lower levels of systemic estrogens. Thinner vaginal walls through atrophy are believed to more readily absorb estradiol than thicker, well-rugated vaginal walls resulting from estrogen therapy. However, because not all studies measuring estradiol over time show the difference early versus later in the study, this hypothesis needs further testing. Any biological significance of this acute absorption of estradiol early in treatment is unknown but not very likely. Additionally, estradiol levels with use for up to 84 days indicated no accumulation of estradiol with lower-dose products.

### Systemic or vaginal hormone therapy after early breast cancer: A Danish observational cohort study [^112Psteu]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Low credibility.

In a recent systematic review concerning the safety of vaginal estrogen therapy (VET), Crandall et al. suggested that slightly elevated serum estrogen levels may be observed within the first 12 weeks following VET. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) lower or nearly eliminate estrogen. As such, even a modest increase in circulating estrogens may have contributed to our observed increased risk of recurrence in the AI-treated subgroup of breast cancer (BC) survivors who received VET. In contrast, tamoxifen competes with estrogen for binding the estrogen receptor (ER). A modest elevation of the very low serum estrogen levels in AI-treated women is not assumed to counteract the receptor blockade. The increased risk of recurrence in patients receiving AIs and VET in our study was, however, not accompanied by increased mortality. Therefore, we urge researchers to assess in future studies whether there is an increased mortality associated with VET use in BC survivors, particularly in patients treated with AIs.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^116vr7k5]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Among women who developed breast cancer in the prospective studies, the mean age at menopause was 50 years (SD 5), the mean age at first MHT use was 50 years (SD 6), and the mean duration of MHT use was 10 years (SD 6) in users and 7 years (SD 6) in past users. Hysterectomy largely determined MHT type; the proportions of women reported to have had the procedure were 2,710 (7%) of 37,951 for estrogen-progestogen users and 31,187 (84%) of 37,213 for estrogen-only users.

- **Relative risks (RRs)**: RRs were consistently greater for estrogen-progestogen than estrogen-only preparations, greater in current than in past users, and increased steadily with duration of use for both current and past users. For each MHT type, there was a significant excess risk even during years 1–4 (mean: year 3) of use: the RRs were 1.60 (95% CI 1.52–1.69) for estrogen-progestogen and 1.17 (1.10–1.26) for estrogen-only MHT. During years 5–14 (mean: year 9) of use, the RRs were 2.08 (2.02–2.15) for estrogen-progestogen and 1.33 (1.28–1.37) for estrogen-only MHT. In past users, excess duration-dependent risks persisted for more than a decade after stopping MHT use. There is little information about breast cancer risk associated with past use that had ceased more than 15 years previously.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^116FzXiz]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

Despite several pharmacokinetic studies demonstrating low to negligible systemic absorption of estradiol with low-dose and ultralow-dose vaginal estrogen use, the boxed warning included in the class labeling of systemically administered estrogens is required for low-dose vaginal estrogens, even though experts affiliated with several medical societies have been advocating for its removal. While low-dose vaginal estrogens are contraindicated in breast cancer survivors, the North American Menopause Society, the Endocrine Society, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended a shared decision-making process, which includes an oncologist, to determine low-dose vaginal estrogen use in women with GSM and breast cancer or a history of breast cancer, when they do not respond to nonhormonal therapies. Further support of minimal absorption is shown by the mean estradiol levels with 4-μg and 10-μg estradiol softgel inserts being similar to those at baseline or with placebo in a phase 3, pharmacokinetic substudy. This 4-μg estradiol vaginal insert was approved in May 2018 by the US FDA as Imvexxy, is now the lowest vaginal estradiol dose available, and results in mean circulating levels of estradiol < 4 pg/mL utilizing LC MS/MS.

### Endocrine therapy for surgeons: Practical pearls for managing menopausal, bone loss and sexual adverse effects [^1155QhvK]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Breast cancer patients are living longer than ever before, and as such, the population of breast cancer survivors continues to grow. Approximately 80% of breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive (HR+), and most patients will receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant estrogen blockade, referred to as endocrine therapy. Although endocrine therapy reduces HR+ breast cancer recurrence by 30–50%, significant adverse effects pose a threat to treatment adherence. These adverse effects include vasomotor symptoms, colloquially referred to as hot flashes, bone loss, joint arthralgias, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), previously referred to as vaginal atrophy, and low libido.

This review presents the evidence-based treatments available for each of these adverse effects, including clear treatment algorithms for GSM, which is often experienced by patients but overlooked by providers. The most important takeaway is to ask open-ended questions, encourage reporting of these symptoms, and refer patients to specialty providers as needed. Surgeons may be the first to encounter these symptoms; therefore, it is critical to remain informed of the treatment options.

### Systemic or vaginal hormone therapy after early breast cancer: A Danish observational cohort study [^116zGQ3G]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Low credibility.

Breast cancer (BC) survivors often experience symptoms of declining estrogen levels. Adjuvant endocrine therapy, particularly aromatase inhibitors (AIs), may aggravate these symptoms. The urogenital system is especially sensitive to estrogen deprivation, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) often develops. Symptoms include vaginal dryness, itchiness, burning, overactive bladder, and urinary incontinence.

- **Evidence and recommendations**: The American Endocrine Society concluded that level A evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of systemic or local hormone therapy in GSM. Vaginal estrogen therapy (VET) is well-tolerated and indicated for isolated GSM among healthy women.

- **Studies on BC survivors**: The use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is cautioned in BC survivors following the demonstration of an increased risk of recurrence in the HABITS (Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer – is it Safe?) trial and in the Livial Intervention following Breast Cancer: Efficacy, Recurrence, and Tolerability Endpoints trial. However, this association was not reproduced in the results published from the Stockholm trial. A small cohort study and a nested case-control study, including a total of 340 women with early BC, investigated the risk of BC recurrence associated with the use of VET. Neither showed an increased risk. However, these studies had several limitations, including small sample size and short follow-up. It remains unclear whether VET or MHT is safe in women treated for BC.

Among women without a history of BC, a meta-analysis from the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer reported increased risk.

### A phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer in treatment with aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting [^116Kko4B]. The Oncologist (2020). High credibility.

Consistent with the decline in absorption of vaginal estrogens with epithelium maturation [5, 6], estriol levels were higher in the active group within the first 3 weeks but decreased throughout treatment, reaching similar levels at week 12: median (IQR), 0.5 (0.5 to 7.3) and 0.5 (0.5 to 0.5) for the active and placebo groups, respectively (p = .140). As expected, the serum levels of estradiol and estrone remained below the limit of quantification at baseline and at all time points for both active and placebo groups.

In summary, our results provide confidence in the safe use of ultralow-dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in breast cancer survivors treated with NSAIs. The application of the gel has a negligible impact on the systemic levels of estrogens, FSH, and LH in these patients, whereas the proven efficacy in symptom relief may improve compliance with adjuvant treatment for breast cancer.

### Management of complications from estrogen deprivation in breast cancer patients [^111HzfiS]. Current Oncology Reports (2009). Low credibility.

In the United States today, more than 2 million women live as breast cancer survivors. As the number of cancer survivors grows, the unique long-term side effects of cancer treatment and aging play an increasingly prominent role in the routine care of these patients. Of special concern are the short- and long-term effects of sex hormone deprivation. This article reviews issues surrounding the acute and late effects associated with hormone deprivation in breast cancer survivors and summarizes the scientific and therapeutic discoveries at the time of writing to identify optimal nonestrogenic treatments for symptom control in individual patients.

### Changes in serum estradiol levels with Estring in postmenopausal women with breast cancer treated with aromatase inhibitors [^11721pRL]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Anti-estrogen therapy is an effective intervention for preventing the recurrence of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in women. However, the side effects, including urogenital symptoms, have been reported to cause significant morbidity. Controversial data, primarily due to small sample sizes, exist regarding the safety and efficacy of using vaginal estrogen to treat these symptoms in patients on aromatase inhibitor therapy.

- **Methods**: We proposed a prospective trial to measure changes in blood estradiol levels in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer undergoing treatment with aromatase inhibitors when treated with the vaginal estrogen preparation Estring for their urogenital symptoms. Only eight prospective patients were enrolled, and the study was amended to include six retrospective patients who were treated similarly. Blood estradiol levels were measured at baseline and at week 16 for all patients.

- **Results**: The median age for all patients was 55 years, and the majority were treated with anastrozole. There was no significant difference in estradiol levels between baseline and week 16 (p = 0.81). In addition, patients in the prospective group reported subjective improvement in their vaginal dryness symptoms questionnaires.

- **Conclusions**: The vaginal estrogen preparation Estring did not cause persistent elevations in serum estradiol levels and might be a safer option for women with significant urogenital symptoms requiring estrogen therapy.

- **Implications for cancer survivors**: Vaginal estrogen preparations like Estring may offer relief for urogenital symptoms in survivors without significant impact on estradiol levels.

### Endogenous estradiol is not associated with poor physical health in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors [^111QN8ik]. Journal of Women's Health (2013). Low credibility.

Among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, poor physical health has been associated with higher risks of breast cancer events. Obesity and physical inactivity are known risk factors for poor physical health, while circulating estrogen is an additional potential risk factor. We tested the hypothesis that the relationship between poor physical health and worse breast cancer outcomes is mediated by higher estrogen concentrations associated with body size and physical inactivity.

- **Methods**: We used data from 1,030 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors to examine the association between serum estradiol levels, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and RAND-36-item Health Survey (SF-36) physical health.

- **Results**: In univariate analysis, poor physical health was associated with higher estradiol levels, in addition to obesity and low physical activity. Higher estradiol levels were significantly associated with higher odds of poor physical health (odds ratio, OR, 1.20 [95% confidence interval, CI, 1.03–1.39]) in a multivariable model adjusting for age, cancer stage and treatment, alcohol use, and physical activity. However, the relationship between estradiol levels and poor physical health was no longer significant (OR 1.06 [95% CI 0.91–1.24]) after adding BMI in the model. In multivariate analysis, only poor physical health resulted in higher risks of recurrence (hazard ratio 1.33 [95% CI 1.08–1.64]).

- **Conclusions**: These findings indicate that estradiol is related to poor physical health but is not an independent risk factor from body size or inactivity.

### Efficacy and safety of ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer treated with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors: A phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111aAAgH]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

This was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicenter study assessing the safety and efficacy of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for treating symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy. The study included postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (any HER2 status) early breast cancer (stage I-IIIA) who had been treated with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs), specifically anastrozole or letrozole, for at least six months.

Participants were recruited from five Spanish sites and one Swedish site during routine follow-up visits between April 2015 and October 2016. Postmenopausal status was defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels greater than 40 mIU/mL, or six weeks post-surgical bilateral oophorectomy, with or without hysterectomy. All patients experienced moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness according to FDA guidelines for drug development in postmenopausal women (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, CDER, January 2003). A moderate symptom was considered present, bothersome and annoying, while a severe symptom was considered present, bothersome, annoying, and interfering with normal activity.

Other inclusion criteria included a score of 0 or 1 in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG) and adequate bone marrow and organ function. Patients treated with another antitumoral therapy (excluding pamidronate or alendronate) and those receiving vulvovaginal treatment in the 15 days before the study start were also considered.

### Vaginal testosterone cream vs estradiol vaginal ring for vaginal dryness or decreased libido in women receiving aromatase inhibitors for early-stage breast cancer: A randomized clinical trial [^112RpUah]. JAMA Oncology (2017). High credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors (AI) are associated with significant urogenital atrophy, affecting quality of life and drug compliance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of intravaginal testosterone cream (IVT) or an estradiol-releasing vaginal ring (7.5 μg/d) in patients with early-stage breast cancer (BC) receiving an AI. The intervention was considered unsafe if more than 25% of patients had a persistent elevation in estradiol (E2), defined as E2 greater than 10 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 3.671) and at least 10 pg/mL above baseline after treatment initiation on 2 consecutive tests at least 2 weeks apart.

Postmenopausal (PM) women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive stage I to III BC taking AIs with self-reported vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, or decreased libido were randomized to 12 weeks of IVT or an estradiol vaginal ring. Estradiol was measured at baseline and weeks 4 and 12 using a commercially available liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assay; follicle-stimulating hormone levels were measured at baseline and week 4. Gynecologic examinations and sexual quality-of-life questionnaires were completed at baseline and week 12. This randomized noncomparative design allowed the safety evaluation of two interventions concurrently in the same population of patients, reducing the possibility of E2 assay variability over time and between the two interventions.

The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the safety of IVT or an estradiol vaginal ring in patients with early-stage BC receiving an AI.

### Surveillance and care of the gynecologic cancer survivor [^115oyLRN]. Journal of Women's Health (2015). Low credibility.

Cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancers are almost exclusively related to high-risk HPV and are not hormone-dependent. Therefore, hormone therapy (HT) is not contraindicated. About 80% of cervical cancers are squamous cell cancers, which are not hormone-dependent. In contrast, about 15% of cervical cancers are adenocarcinomas, which may be linked to estrogen exposure. However, no evidence links HT in cervical adenocarcinoma survivors with increased risk of recurrence or reduced disease-free survival.

Vaginal cancers are most commonly squamous cell cancers associated with HPV and not hormone-dependent. Vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma is extremely rare, with most cases diagnosed in women with diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure in utero. There are no data on HT in this population, though many have passed the age of menopause.

### A phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer in treatment with aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting [^114hQ3gk]. The Oncologist (2020). High credibility.

The levels of circulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estriol, estradiol, and estrone remained unchanged following a 12-week treatment with 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal women receiving nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. These results support the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of bothersome symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy in breast cancer survivors. The findings provide clinicians with confidence in the use of this product in women who do not experience symptom relief with nonhormonal remedies.

- **Background**: Symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy associated with treatment with NSAIs negatively impact patients' quality of life and may affect adherence to NSAIs. Vaginal estrogens effectively improve these symptoms, although their safe use in breast cancer survivors remains unclear.

- **Methods**: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving NSAI and experiencing moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness were randomized to 0.005% estriol vaginal gel or placebo for 12 weeks. Circulating estrogens, FSH, and LH were analyzed at baseline and at weeks 1, 3, 8, and 12. The primary safety outcome was the variation in serum FSH from baseline to week 12.

- **Results**: Sixty-one women (mean age, 59 years) enrolled in the study. Small oscillations were observed in FSH and LH levels; however, they were always maintained within the postmenopausal range.

### Prempro [^116Tuo3p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon the duration of use and could last up to more than 10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. The extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater and became apparent earlier with estrogen plus progestin therapy compared to the risk with estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

Use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

### Estrogen replacement therapy in breast cancer survivors: A matched-controlled series [^115udskZ]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

We prospectively administered estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) to control estrogen deficiency symptoms in breast cancer survivors as part of our clinical practice. We report the consequences of ERT compared with a historical matched-control group.

- **Design**: Two hundred seventy-seven disease-free survivors received ERT. Controls were matched for exact stage, a recurrence-free period similar to the period to ERT initiation in the ERT group, approximate age, and duration of follow-up. The mean time from breast cancer diagnosis to initiation of ERT was 3.61 (± 0.25) years, with a median of 1.88 years. The mean duration of ERT was 3.7 (± 3.01) years, with a median of 3.05 years.

- **Results**: Hot flashes were relieved in 206 of 223 women (92%), dyspareunia/vaginal dryness in 149 of 167 women (89%), and reactive depression/anxiety/mood change in 111 of 126 women (88%). Univariate analysis demonstrated no statistical differences between the groups for age, stage, pathology at diagnosis, progesterone receptor status, local therapy, breast at risk, prior chemotherapy, and duration of follow-up. The ERT group was more likely to be estrogen receptor negative (P = 0.01), to have received prior ERT (P < 0.001), and to have received no adjuvant tamoxifen (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the ERT and control groups in ipsilateral primary/recurrence (5/155 vs. 5/143; P = 0.85), contralateral breast cancers (10/258 vs. 9/260; P = 0.99), or systemic metastasis (8/277 vs. 15/277; P = 0.13). Non-cause-specific deaths in the control group numbered 15 (of 277).

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^112SVfT5]. Annals of Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Further corroborating evidence on the oncogenic role of progestogens in breast cancer may be gleaned from two independent RCTs that assessed the breast cancer risk of HRT among breast cancer survivors in Sweden: the HABITS and the Stockholm trials. The participants of these trials were postmenopausal women without evidence of recurrence after the diagnosis and treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer. After HRT versus no treatment for 2–5 years and median follow-ups of 2–10 years, the HABITS trial showed a significant increase in recurrence (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3–4.2), whereas the Stockholm trial reported no significant impact of HRT on breast cancer recurrence (relative hazard 0.82, 95% CI 0.35–1.9). No mortality difference was observed in both trials.

There were two major differences between these trials: progestin exposure and tamoxifen use. In the HABITS trial, nearly half (46%) of the participants were treated with continuous estrogen–progestin HRT, and 47% with estrogen alone or combined with low exposure to a progestin. In contrast, as the Stockholm trial was specifically designed to minimize progestin exposure from HRT, 95% of the participants were treated with estrogen alone or combined with low exposure to a progestin. Thus, investigators of these trials attributed the increased risk of recurrence in the HABITS trial to higher exposure to progestins. Also, more women were treated with tamoxifen as an adjuvant therapy in the Stockholm trial (52%) than in the HABITS trial (21%). The risk-reducing effect of breast cancer by tamoxifen was pronounced.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^117FRGfX]. Annals of Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Estrogens have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. Yet, emerging clinical and experimental evidence points to progestogens — endogenous progesterone or synthetic progesterone (progestin) — as the primary hormonal driver underlying the seemingly estrogen-associated breast cancer risk. Estrogens may contribute to breast cancer risk indirectly by inducing the progesterone receptor, thus amplifying progesterone signaling.

Large studies of hormonal contraceptives suggest that the small increase in breast cancer risk from hormonal contraceptives is mainly attributable to progestins, not estrogens. Estrogen-plus-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has consistently shown an increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, whereas estrogen-alone HRT has little impact on breast cancer risk in naturally or surgically menopausal women. In particular, the long-term follow-up of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials suggests a benefit of estrogen alone.

Recent data further indicate that endogenously elevated estrogen during assisted reproductive technology (ART) exhibits little adverse effect on, or potentially a reduction in, breast cancer risk and recurrence. Also, accumulating evidence suggests that inhibition of progesterone signaling is a critical mechanism underlying the risk-reducing and therapeutic effects of antiestrogens. Estrogen HRT has shown an array of proven benefits, including ameliorating menopausal symptoms and improving bone health. The collective evidence thus suggests that estrogen HRT is likely to offer health benefits.

### Hormone replacement therapy for survivors of breast and endometrial cancer [^111gkB4y]. Current Oncology Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Indirect evidence suggests that endogenous and exogenous estrogen does not influence the outcome of patients treated for breast or endometrial cancer. However, many reports have affirmed the beneficial effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in preventing multiple disease states and improving the quality of life for individual patients. Every practitioner of urogynecology understands the benefits of local and systemic therapy for women who suffer from urinary incontinence and/or loss of pelvic floor support. Thus, it seems appropriate to suggest that survivors of breast or endometrial cancer who request information on HRT for relief of their menopausal symptoms and other benefits, of which patients are becoming increasingly aware, deserve a comprehensive explanation.

### Hormone replacement therapy in gynecologic cancer survivors: Why not [^114xLkdg]. Gynecologic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

As a result of treatment, many women with gynecologic malignancies will experience menopause and display climacteric symptoms at an earlier age than occurs naturally. Iatrogenic menopause may adversely affect quality of life and health outcomes in young female cancer survivors. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has often been withheld from women with gynecologic cancer because of concerns that it might increase the risk of relapse or the development of new primary cancers. The purpose of this review was to examine the published literature on menopause management in gynecologic cancer survivors and highlight the risks and benefits of conventional and alternative HRT in this population.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search of English language studies on menopause management in gynecologic cancer survivors and women with a hereditary predisposition to a gynecologic malignancy was performed in MEDLINE databases through December 2010.

- **Results**: Both our review and a 2008 Cochrane review of randomized trials on the effects of long-term HRT demonstrate that for menopausal women in their 40s or 50s with and without gynecologic cancer, the absolute risks of estrogen-only HRT are low. Several prospective observational studies and randomized trials on HRT use in women with a genetic predisposition for, or development of a gynecologic malignancy suggest benefits in quality of life with no proven adverse oncologic effects as a result of short-term HRT use.

- **Conclusion**: In select women, it is reasonable to discuss and offer conventional HRT for the amelioration of menopausal symptoms.

### What is the optimal endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer [^113Ab8AT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old postmenopausal woman with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer was referred to discuss adjuvant therapy. An annual screening mammogram demonstrated a suspicious mass in the left breast. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy revealed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma that was estrogen receptor (ER) positive and progesterone receptor (PR) negative and lacked amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; i.e. HER2 negative). She underwent excision and sentinel node evaluation. Pathology demonstrated a 1.9 cm grade 2 invasive cancer without lymphatic vascular invasion; clean margins were obtained, and both sentinel nodes were free of cancer. The 21-gene recurrence score was 16. She has a body mass index (BMI) of 28.5 but is otherwise healthy; levothyroxine is the only prescription medication she takes. She experienced vaginal spotting two years earlier because of an endometrial polyp, which was resected. She exercises regularly and takes a calcium supplement with vitamin D. A bone density study performed six months earlier was normal, other than mild osteopenia in the femoral neck (T score, -1.3). Radiation therapy is planned.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^116desHn]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

The corresponding risks associated with 10 years of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use starting at age 50 would be about twice as great. In Western countries, approximately 20 million breast cancer cases have been diagnosed since 1990, of which about 1 million cases can be attributed to MHT use.

### Aromatase inhibitors affect vaginal proliferation and steroid hormone receptors [^116MsDTE]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Women with breast cancer who are treated with aromatase inhibitors often experience vaginal atrophy symptoms and sexual dysfunction. This study aims to investigate proliferation and the presence and distribution of steroid hormone receptors in vaginal biopsies in relation to vaginal atrophy and vaginal pH. The focus is on women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant endocrine treatment and healthy postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: This is a cross-sectional study comparing postmenopausal aromatase inhibitor-treated women with breast cancer (n = 15) to tamoxifen-treated women with breast cancer (n = 16), age-matched postmenopausal women without treatment (n = 19), and those on vaginal estrogen therapy (n = 16). Immunohistochemistry was utilized to study proliferation and steroid hormone receptor staining intensity. Data were correlated with estrogen as well as androgen levels, vaginal atrophy scores, and vaginal pH.

- **Results**: Aromatase inhibitor-treated women exhibited a lower grade of proliferation, weaker progesterone receptor staining, and stronger androgen receptor staining. These findings correlated with plasma estrone levels, vaginal atrophy scores, and vaginal pH.

- **Conclusions**: Women with aromatase inhibitor-treated breast cancer show reduced proliferation and altered steroid hormone receptor staining intensity in the vagina, which are related to clinical signs of vaginal atrophy. Although these effects are likely due to estrogen suppression, a potential local inhibition of aromatase cannot be ruled out.

### Vaginal estrogen and mammogram results: Case series and review of literature on treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in breast cancer survivors [^117RxKcg]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

To examine mammographic density before and after at least 1 year of vaginal estrogen use in a small cohort of healthy postmenopausal women and women with a personal history of breast cancer, data was extracted via chart review of patients from a single practitioner's menopause specialty clinic in Baltimore, MD. Mammographic change was primarily determined via the Bi-RADS scoring system, which includes the Bi-RADS density score. A narrative review of the literature on the usage of local estrogen therapy and systemic and local alternatives in the treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in breast cancer survivors was also conducted.

Twenty healthy postmenopausal women and three breast cancer survivors fit the inclusion criteria. Among these two groups, no increase in mammographic density was found after at least 1 year and up to 18 years of local vaginal estrogen use. The use of ospemifene in one patient did not appear to be associated with any change in Bi-RADS score. The narrative review found little data on the effects of vaginal estrogen therapy or newer alternative systemic therapies, such as ospemifene, on mammographic density.

In conclusion, low-dose vaginal estrogen use for 1 or more years in a small cohort of women with GSM did not appear to be associated with any changes in breast density or Bi-RADS breast cancer risk scores in the majority of study participants, including three breast cancer survivors. Larger long-term controlled clinical trials should be conducted to examine the effects of low-dose vaginal estrogen on mammographic density and breast cancer risk scores.

### Prempro [^115ff5dP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with the duration of use and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

Use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

### A phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer in treatment with aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting [^112SbLrJ]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

In addition to the high physiological variability observed in the serum levels of gonadotropins, which was overcome by analyzing the pretreatment and during-treatment variability, our study was limited by the unbalanced country representativeness, with all centers being Spanish except one. Of note, this did not affect the laboratory tests, which were performed by two central laboratories in Spain and Austria. Given that our results indicate that the 0.005% estriol gel preparation is safe, the replication of the study using a larger sample size is warranted.

In summary, our results provide confidence in the safe use of ultralow-dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors treated with NSAIs. The application of the ultralow-dose estriol vaginal gel has a negligible impact on estrogens, FSH, and LH systemic levels in these patients, whereas the proven efficacy of estriol in symptom relief may improve compliance to adjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens [^1179vkCp]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

It is estimated that up to 50% to 90% of postmenopausal women may experience genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which may have a detrimental impact on quality of life. One of the most effective modes of treatment for GSM is low-dose vaginal estrogens. Numerous studies have addressed the safety of these estrogens using endometrial biopsy and/or endometrial thickness on ultrasound. Based on these studies, the consensus is that low-dose vaginal estrogens do not substantially increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer; however, the data are severely limited by short duration of follow-up.

Although long-term trials are warranted, they are difficult to conduct, costly, and will not yield data for years. More immediate information regarding endometrial safety may be obtained from studies measuring endometrial tissue and serum concentrations of estradiol, estrone, and relevant equine estrogens after administration of different estrogen formulations and doses.

This would allow us to better understand the metabolism of estrogens by the vagina and endometrium, and how much estrogen is reaching the endometrium. Here, we discuss metabolism, receptor binding, and signaling of estrogens in vaginal and endometrial tissue and summarize the existing studies on the endometrial impact of low-dose vaginal estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women.

### Managing menopausal symptoms and associated clinical issues in breast cancer survivors [^113xGxS7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). High credibility.

The objective of this review is to evaluate evidence for the management of menopausal signs and symptoms in women post-breast cancer and to provide recommendations accordingly.

- **Evidence**: The review considers randomized controlled clinical trials, observational studies, evidence-based guidelines, and expert opinions from professional societies.

- **Background**: Symptoms and clinical issues related to estrogen depletion, such as sleep disorders, vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), vasomotor symptoms (VMS), mood changes, depressive symptoms, cardiovascular disease, osteopenia, and osteoporosis, affect an estimated 9.3 million breast cancer survivors globally.

- **Recommendations**: After breast cancer, women are generally not advised to undergo menopausal hormone therapy or use tibolone; instead, they should optimize their lifestyle. Women experiencing moderate to severe symptoms may benefit from mind-brain behavior therapy or nonhormonal pharmacologic therapy. Selective serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and gabapentin-like agents can improve VMS and enhance life quality. For osteoporosis, nonhormonal agents are available. The treatment of VVA is an unmet need. Although low-dose vaginal estrogen is absorbed in small amounts with blood levels within the normal postmenopausal range, it could potentially stimulate occult breast cancer cells and is not generally recommended, especially for those on aromatase inhibitors. Intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone and oral ospemiphene have been approved for treating dyspareunia, but their safety post-breast cancer remains unestablished. Vaginal laser therapy is also being used for VVA, although efficacy compared to sham treatments is yet to be confirmed.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^1122kGKb]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Estrogens have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. Yet, emerging clinical and experimental evidence points to progestogens — either endogenous progesterone or synthetic progesterone (progestin) — as the primary hormonal driver underlying seemingly estrogen-associated breast cancer risk. Estrogens may contribute indirectly by inducing the progesterone receptor and thus amplifying progesterone signaling. Large studies of hormonal contraceptives suggest that the small increase in breast cancer risk from hormonal contraceptives is mainly attributable to progestins, not estrogens.

Estrogen-plus-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has consistently shown an increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, whereas estrogen-alone HRT has little impact on breast cancer risk in both naturally and surgically menopausal women. In particular, the long-term follow-up of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials suggests a benefit of estrogen alone. Recent data further indicate that endogenously elevated estrogen during assisted reproductive technology (ART) has little adverse effect on, or potentially reduces, breast cancer risk and recurrence. Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that inhibition of progesterone signaling is a critical mechanism underlying the risk-reducing and therapeutic effects of antiestrogens.

Estrogen HRT has shown numerous proven benefits, including ameliorating menopausal symptoms and improving bone health. Collective evidence thus suggests that estrogen HRT is likely to offer health benefits.

### Systemic or vaginal hormone therapy after early breast cancer: a Danish observational cohort study [^116EqLmJ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Low credibility.

Background: Women treated for breast cancer (BC) often suffer from genitourinary syndrome of menopause. These symptoms may be alleviated by vaginal estrogen therapy (VET) or menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). However, there are concerns about the risks of recurrence of BC and mortality following treatment.

Methods: Our study included longitudinal data from a national cohort of postmenopausal women, diagnosed between 1997 and 2004 with early-stage invasive estrogen receptor–positive nonmetastatic BC, who received either no treatment or 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. We obtained prescription data on hormone therapy, VET, or MHT, from a national prescription registry. We evaluated mortality and risk of recurrence associated with the use of VET and MHT versus non-use using multivariable models adjusted for potential confounders.

Results: Among 8,461 women who had not received VET or MHT before BC diagnosis, 1,957 and 133 used VET and MHT, respectively, after diagnosis. The median follow-up was 9.8 years for recurrence and 15.2 years for mortality. The adjusted relative risk of recurrence was 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89 to 1.32) for VET (1.39 [95% CI = 1.04 to 1.85 in the subgroup receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitors]) and 1.05 (95% CI = 0.62 to 1.78) for MHT. The adjusted hazard ratios for overall mortality were 0.78 (95% CI = 0.71 to 0.87) and 0.94 (95% CI = 0.70 to 1.26) for VET and MHT, respectively.

Conclusions: In postmenopausal women treated for early-stage estrogen receptor–positive BC, neither VET nor MHT was associated with an increased risk of recurrence or mortality.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115uKnuE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for menopause, particularly in patients with breast cancer, the 2015 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend considering a shared decision-making approach. This includes involving the treating oncologist in discussions about the use of low-dose vaginal estrogen for patients with a history of breast cancer who are experiencing symptomatic genitourinary syndrome of menopause, such as vulvovaginal atrophy, and are not responding to non-hormonal therapies.

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline focused update [^1137qqiX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

To update the ASCO clinical practice guideline on adjuvant endocrine therapy based on emerging data about the optimal duration of aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment, ASCO conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials from 2012 to 2018. Guideline recommendations were based on the Panel's review of the evidence from six trials.

The six included studies of AI treatment beyond 5 years demonstrated that extension of AI treatment was not associated with an overall survival advantage, but was significantly associated with lower risks of breast cancer recurrence and contralateral breast cancer compared with placebo. Bone-related toxic effects were more common with extended AI treatment.

- **Recommendations**: The Panel recommends that women with node-positive breast cancer receive extended therapy, including an AI, for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment. Many women with node-negative breast cancer should consider extended therapy for up to a total of 10 years based on considerations of recurrence risk using established prognostic factors. The Panel noted that the benefits in absolute risk reduction were modest and that for lower-risk node-negative or limited node-positive cancers, an individualized approach to treatment duration, based on considerations of risk reduction and tolerability, was appropriate. A substantial portion of the benefit for extended adjuvant AI therapy was derived from prevention of second breast cancers. Shared decision making between clinicians and patients is essential for tailored treatment strategies.

### Systemic or vaginal hormone therapy after early breast cancer: A Danish observational cohort study [^113YZdo6]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Low credibility.

The risk of primary breast cancer (BC) has been associated with the use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in a meta-analysis by the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer from 2019. The risk increased with the length of use, and certain types of MHT (estrogen plus progestogen > progestogen > estrogen) were associated with an increased risk. This risk was said to persist for several years after termination of treatment. MHT has also been associated with an increased risk of BC death, as observed in the Million Women Study. However, we did not observe an increased risk of mortality among the 133 MHT-treated patients in our study, which does not allow us to make any firm conclusions due to the small number of MHT-treated patients. The potential for selection bias due to unknown confounding factors remains, and the safety associated with the use of MHT in BC survivors is still debatable.

The strengths of this study are the large nationwide cohort of patients uniformly treated according to national guidelines and the long-term follow-up. Furthermore, the validity of exposure was presumably high because users of MHT or vaginal estrogen therapy (VET) were classified based on at least two redeemed prescriptions, thus bypassing recall bias and increasing the probability that redeemed prescriptions reflected actual use.

The major limitation of the study is its nonrandomized nature. Though many factors are included in the adjusted analyses, our findings may be prone to residual confounding from differences in lifestyle factors, such as nutrition, physical activity, and adiposity. The treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in BC survivors remains a challenge.

### Addressing the needs of breast cancer survivors [^115daAqV]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

In advanced cases, symptoms may be attributable to vaginal stenosis or shortening, and the patient may not be able to engage in sexual activity. For such cases, low-dose vaginal hormones such as estradiol or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) have been studied. This is postulated to enhance collagen remodeling and augment elasticity and mucosal thickness. In conjunction with this, vaginal dilators may be used, with a recommended usage of three times each week for 10 minutes per session.

In situations where symptoms are refractory to non-hormonal pharmacological and non-pharmacological options, vaginal estradiol can be considered an effective management option for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). However, there is a concern for potential systemic absorption and elevation of serum estradiol levels, which raises concerns for its utilization in patients with a history of breast cancer. Utilizing lower doses of commercially available vaginal estrogens and application following non-hormonal moisturizer use to allow for mucosal atrophy recovery may help mitigate the risk of absorption. A large case-controlled study showed no increased risk of breast cancer recurrence with vaginal estrogen use. Similarly, a large observational Danish cohort study of postmenopausal women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who received systemic or local estrogen for endocrine-related genitourinary syndrome did not show an elevated recurrence risk or death. However, among patients using vaginal estrogen therapy while receiving aromatase inhibitors, there was a higher observed risk of cancer recurrence, although this did not trans.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: a systematic evidence review [^112B7dgD]. Menopause (2019). High credibility.

Clinical evidence from this systematic review does not support an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer with low-dose unopposed vaginal estrogen use. Sporadic reports of endometrial hyperplasia were not associated with a specific dose or duration, with the exception of the highest CEE dose of 1.25 mg used 21 days on/7 days off, which appears to be associated with an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia (2 cases in 28 women).

The well-established dose effect of endometrial hyperplasia seen with higher doses of oral estrogen products was not observed with lower doses of vaginal estradiol. Although older studies, which typically evaluated higher vaginal estrogen doses, were not powered to detect endometrial cancer because of small sample size and short duration, they were powered to detect endometrial hyperplasia, a signal that was not detected with low-dose vaginal estrogen products. Overall, the sporadic reports of endometrial hyperplasia observed (∼0.4% in RCTs) appear to be consistent with background rates of endometrial hyperplasia in the general population.

Of the 38 studies reviewed, only two retrospective observational studies showed an increased risk of endometrial cancer with vaginal estrogen use compared with nonuse. The first was a study reporting data from 1977 to 1979 from a single center in the United States, which observed an increase in endometrial cancer (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.1–4.6). This increase may be due to higher-dose vaginal products used in the 1970s compared with lower-dose products currently available.

### Systemic or vaginal hormone therapy after early breast cancer: A Danish observational cohort study [^113Vm4Rs]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Low credibility.

We examined the frequency and proportion of breast cancer patients according to the use of vaginal estrogen therapy (VET) and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) after the breast cancer diagnosis.

Follow-up time was quantified in terms of a Kaplan-Meier estimate of potential follow-up. For recurrence and competing risk analyses, the Fine and Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model and cumulative incidences were used. The cumulative incidence of recurrence was determined as the interval from surgery to any first event of local or regional invasive recurrence or distant recurrence, whereas other first events were considered competing risk events. The Cox regression model was used to assess overall survival.

Poisson regression was used to compute the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the assumption that the observed number of deaths followed a Poisson distribution. SMRs were computed as the ratio of the observed to the expected number of deaths and served as an estimate of relative risk of death. The number of deaths expected was calculated by applying age- and calendar year–specific female mortality figures of the general Danish population and the corresponding person-years of follow-up for the respective cohort members.

Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and relative risk estimates together with associated 95% confidence intervals according to exposure to VET and MHT were estimated. Use of VET and MHT were included simultaneously in the models, with the reference group being patients without prescriptions. The multivariable analyses included the following covariates: age at surgery.

### A phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer in treatment with aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting [^1163MAiT]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

Under the hypothesis that an ultralow‐dose estriol vaginal gel would not affect the serum levels of gonadotropin hormones, we randomized 61 NSAI‐treated breast cancer survivors to receive either 0.005% estriol vaginal gel (n = 50) or placebo moisturizing gel (n = 11). Owing to the high variability of FSH and LH levels between screening (study enrollment) and baseline (immediately before treatment start), the primary endpoint was based on the differences between physiological variability (i.e. screening vs. baseline) and treatment variability (i.e. mean of screening and baseline vs. given time point).

After 12 weeks of treatment, no significant differences were observed between physiological and treatment variability of FSH levels in the active group (median, −2.8 mIU/mL; interquartile range [IQR], −13.1 to 7.4; p = .104) or in the placebo group (median, 1.4; IQR, −5.4 to 15.7; p = .413). These results were reinforced by the lack of significant differences between treatment arms in the absolute values of serum FSH: median, 51.0 mIU/mL (IQR, 38.6 to 63.5) and 62.1 (46.8 to 90.1) for active and placebo groups, respectively (p = .078). This trend was also observed in LH levels, except for week 12, where median (IQR) differences between physiological variability and treatment variability were −0.8 (−5.3 to 2.9) and 1.3 (−1.6 to 7.1) mlU/mL for active and placebo groups, respectively (p = .025).

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^114hMuyc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

The guideline update aims to provide new insights into pharmacologic interventions for breast cancer risk reduction and address clinical issues related to the use of endocrine therapy.

- **Methods**: An Expert Panel conducted targeted systematic literature reviews to identify new studies.

- **Results**: A randomized clinical trial evaluated the use of anastrozole for reducing estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers in postmenopausal women at increased risk. This trial provided the predominant basis for the update.

- **Updated recommendations**: In postmenopausal women at increased risk, the choice of endocrine therapy now includes anastrozole (1 mg/day) in addition to exemestane (25 mg/day), raloxifene (60 mg/day), or tamoxifen (20 mg/day). The decision regarding the choice of endocrine therapy should consider age, baseline comorbidities, and adverse effect profiles. Clinicians should not prescribe anastrozole, exemestane, or raloxifene for breast cancer risk reduction to premenopausal women. Tamoxifen 20 mg/day for 5 years remains the standard of care for risk reduction in premenopausal women who are at least 35 years old and have completed childbearing. Data on low-dose tamoxifen as an alternative to the standard dose for both pre- and postmenopausal women with intraepithelial neoplasia are detailed in the Clinical Considerations section of this article.

### Vaginal estrogen therapy use and survival in females with breast cancer [^112JRWxB]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Menopause can lead to genitourinary syndrome, which is often treated with vaginal estrogen therapy. However, there is ongoing concern about the safety of this therapy in patients with breast cancer.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of vaginal estrogen therapy is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer-specific mortality in females with breast cancer, as compared to those who did not use hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This cohort study involved two large cohorts from Scotland and Wales, consisting of females aged 40 to 79 years with newly diagnosed breast cancer. These cohorts, spanning from 2010 to 2017 in Scotland and from 2000 to 2016 in Wales, were identified from national cancer registry records. Participants were followed for breast cancer-specific mortality until 2020. Those with a previous cancer diagnosis (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) were excluded. Data analysis occurred between August 2022 and August 2023.

- **Exposure**: The study assessed the use of vaginal estrogen therapy, including both vaginal tablets and creams. This was determined from the pharmacy dispensing records of the Prescribing Information System for the Scotland cohort and from general practice prescription records for the Wales cohort.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome measured was the time to breast cancer-specific mortality, data for which was obtained from national mortality records. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for breast cancer-specific mortality, comparing users of vaginal estrogen therapy with those using HRT.

### Safety of vaginal estrogen therapy for genitourinary syndrome of menopause in women with a history of breast cancer [^112qVKod]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the risk of breast cancer recurrence associated with vaginal estrogen therapy in women diagnosed with genitourinary syndrome of menopause who have a history of breast cancer. This was achieved using a large U.S. claims database.

- **Methods**: A U.S. health research network, the TriNetX Diamond Network, was queried from January 2009 to June 2022. Our cohort consisted of women diagnosed with breast cancer within 5 years prior to the initial diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Patients with active disease, defined as those undergoing mastectomy, radiation treatment, or chemotherapy within 3 months before the diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, were excluded. Recurrence was defined as the occurrence of mastectomy, radiation, chemotherapy, or secondary malignancy within 3 months to 5 years after the initiation of vaginal estrogen therapy. The study cohort included women with three or more vaginal estrogen prescriptions. The control cohort included women with breast cancer who did not receive any vaginal estrogen prescriptions after the diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Propensity matching was performed, and a subanalysis by positive estrogen receptor status, when available, was also conducted.

- **Results**: We identified 42,113 women with a diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause following a breast cancer diagnosis, with any estrogen receptor status, of whom 5.0% received vaginal estrogen. Of the initial cohort, 10,584 patients had a history of positive estrogen receptor breast cancer, and 3.9% of this group received vaginal estrogen.

This study highlighted the utilization and potential risks associated with vaginal estrogen therapy in women with a history of breast cancer, particularly with positive estrogen receptor status.

### Endocrine therapy use and cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors [^114BiBBu]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

Among postmenopausal women diagnosed with ER/PR+ breast cancer, we found convincing evidence of a higher risk of several cardiovascular diseases in AI compared with tamoxifen users. However, our results indicated no excess cardiotoxicities of either drug class, other than the known raised risk of venous thromboembolism with tamoxifen use. There was no evidence of raised risk of any specific cardiovascular disease with AI use, including in stratified results restricted to those with other prior cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that a history of cardiovascular disease is unlikely to be an important contraindication for prescription of an AI. Our results contribute to the evidence base regarding the risk–benefit balance of endocrine therapies with respect to cancer survival and cardiovascular outcomes and ultimately can help identify subgroups of postmenopausal women who are likely to benefit from tamoxifen over AIs.

### Estrogel [^112mT1cT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribe estrogens, with or without progestogens, at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with the treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

- **Warning: Endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disorders, probable dementia, and breast cancer**: See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

- **Estrogen-alone therapy**: There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in women with a uterus who use unopposed estrogens. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen-alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study reported an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older. Do not use estrogen-alone therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia.

- **Estrogen plus progestin therapy**: The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of pulmonary embolism (PE), DVT, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). Additionally, the substudy indicated increased risks of invasive breast cancer. The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study reported an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older. Do not use estrogen plus progestogen therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: A systematic evidence review [^1124PAnx]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The review was initiated by a request from the US Food and Drug Administration to investigate the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer associated with the use of vaginal estrogens. A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Clinicaltrials.gov was conducted from inception to August 2017, targeting journal articles, conference abstracts, and study data on the use of vaginal estrogens in menopausal women, published in English.

- **Literature search methodology**: For PubMed, the keywords included "vaginal" and "(estrogen or oestrogen or estradiol or oestradiol)". For EMBASE, the search terms were "(uterine or endometri*)" and "(cancer or carcinoma or hyperplasia or proliferation)" together with "vagin" and "(estrogen(s) or estradiol)" and "(menopaus* or postmenopaus*)" while excluding reviews and animal studies. Additionally, a targeted search for studies of vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; prasterone) in postmenopausal women used the keywords "vaginal" and "prasterone".

Bibliographies of selected review articles, published within the last decade, covering topics like vaginal atrophy, vaginal estrogen use, or menopausal hormone therapy, were evaluated for potentially relevant studies. Additionally, the most recent Cochrane reviews on vaginal estrogen use outcomes were scrutinized. Relevant articles, if mentioned in the results and discussion sections of full-text articles, were also considered.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^113gYZXi]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

If the associations are largely causal, MHT use in western countries has already caused about 1 million breast cancers, out of a total of about 20 million since 1990. For women of average weight in western countries, 5 years use of oestrogen plus daily progestagen MHT, starting at age 50 years, would increase 20-year breast cancer risks at ages 50–69 years from 6·3% to 8·3%, an absolute increase of 2·0 per 100 women (one in every 50 users). Similarly, 5 years use of oestrogen plus intermittent progestagen MHT would increase the 20-year risk from 6·3% to 7·7%, an absolute increase of 1·4 per 100 women (one in 70 users). Finally, 5 years use of oestrogen-only MHT would increase the 20-year risk from 6·3% to 6·8%, an absolute increase of 0·5 per 100 women (one in 200 users); this excess would be greater in lean women, but in obese women oestrogen-only MHT is associated with little excess risk. For 10 years of use, the 20-year increases in incidence would be about twice as great as for 5 years of use.

Most individual studies were too small to assess reliably the long-term breast cancer risk associated with just a few years of MHT use. Furthermore, some epidemiological evidence remains unpublished, and studies completed before the 2000s necessarily had limited information about long-term effects of past use. Reliable assessment of the association between breast cancer risk and past use of MHT requires review of the totality of the worldwide evidence, with careful control of potential sources of appreciable bias and confound

### Hormone-replacement therapy and breast cancer [^114iPu97]. The Lancet Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has been available for many years, but the important question of its role in the development and progression of breast cancer remains controversial. The provision of reliable risk estimates has been hampered by a lack of controlled data. Observational evidence suggests that the risk of breast cancer may be increased only if HRT is used long-term (i.e. for longer than 10 years) and that the risk decreases when use ceases. Systematic bias and the lack of adequately powered studies prevent any firm clinical recommendations about the prescription of differing HRT regimens and risk, or the effect of HRT on breast cancer proliferation and mortality. This review aims to summarize clinical data, justifying the need for prospective controlled trials in healthy women as well as those at higher risk of breast cancer or with a personal history of the disease.

### Vaginal health during breast cancer treatment [^111jKuzJ]. Current Oncology Reports (2016). Low credibility.

There is a rising number of breast cancer survivors, and chemotherapy or endocrine therapy can lead to effects on vaginal health that may affect the quality of life. These effects may impact sexual function, daily comfort, or the ability to perform a pelvic examination. Vulvovaginal atrophy, or genitourinary syndrome of menopause, may be treated with nonhormonal or hormonal measures. Breast cancer survivors who are menopausal and/or on endocrine therapy should be screened for issues with vaginal health and counseled about treatment options.

### Systemic or vaginal hormone therapy after early breast cancer: A Danish observational cohort study [^1143i5cd]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Low credibility.

The increasing use of adjuvant AIs raises two other important issues related to side effects: the impact on quality of life and the risk of noncompliance. The impact on sexual behavior is significant; at least one-half of women on AIs report major problems, and up to 24% cease sexual activity. Regarding adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy, discontinuation rates in the range of 15% to 30% have been found. Early discontinuation and nonadherence are associated with increased mortality. The GSM problems may play an important role in this discontinuation, ultimately compromising the effectiveness of AIs and affecting survival. Nonetheless, we did not observe an increase in adherence to endocrine therapy among BC survivors who received VET versus no treatment.

In BC survivors, the HABITS randomized clinical trial reported an increased risk of recurrence, with a hazard ratio of 2.4 (95% CI = 1.3 to 4.2) in the MHT group compared with the non-MHT group, prompting the discontinuation of the trial. In the Stockholm trial — another RCT comparing MHT with no MHT — the risk of recurrence of BC at a 10-year follow-up in the MHT group was 1.3 (95% CI = 0.9 to 1.9) and the relative risk of death was 1.1 (95% CI = 0.6 to 2.0) compared with the placebo group. An increased risk of recurrence with a hazard ratio of 1.64 (95% CI = 0.99 to 2.72) among users of tibolone (a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic activity) was also reported in the Livial Intervention following Breast cancer: Efficacy, Recurrence, and Tolerability Endpoints study comparing tibolone with symptomatic treatment.

### Guideline no. 422d: Menopause and sexuality [^112DF5rR]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, particularly with respect to the management of vulvovaginal atrophy, the SOGC 2021 guidelines suggest offering local vaginal estrogen. This should be done after consulting with the patient's oncologist if local lubricants and moisturizers are ineffective in patients with breast cancer and symptomatic genitourinary syndrome of menopause.

### Efficacy and safety of ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer treated with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors: a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112AUkUE]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

Even though low-dose estrogen-based vaginal preparations are widely used, scientific evidence regarding their safety and efficacy in women with breast cancer receiving NSAI treatment is still scarce. The need for placebo-controlled randomized trials in this setting has been highlighted. Given that NSAIs are a mainstay of endocrine adjuvant treatment for breast cancer survivors, further clinical research is needed to establish guidelines to treat its associated side effects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we investigated the efficacy and safety of an ultra-low dose of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal women treated with NSAIs under the hypothesis that its application is effective in the management of vulvovaginal symptoms without a significant impact on serum gonadotropins and plasma estrogens.

### Eluryng [^111Y2B3L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Malignant neoplasms**:
	- The etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between the use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between past use of COCs and the risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among recent users (< 6 months since last use) and users with a longer duration of COC use [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)].

- **Cervical cancer**:
	- Some studies suggest that combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.

- **Effect on binding globulins**:
	- The estrogen component of CHCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormones or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.

- **Monitoring**:
	- A woman who is using the etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and other indicated healthcare.

- **Hereditary angioedema**:
	- In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.

### A practical guide to the management of menopausal symptoms in breast cancer patients [^112XW6T4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Canadian women. As a result of increased screening and improved treatment, more women are becoming long-term breast cancer survivors. However, due to either their treatment or prolonged survival, many of these women face the consequences of premature menopause and prolonged estrogen deprivation. Hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy (HRT/ERT) has, in the past, been recommended to healthy women at menopause not only for relief of short-term menopausal changes, particularly hot flashes, but also for its benefits on bone density, fracture reduction, and genitourinary symptoms.

Recent studies have demonstrated that not only is HRT associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, but it has also been shown to increase the risk of recurrence in those with a breast cancer history. Until the safety of HRT/ERT in breast cancer patients can be more fully clarified, it would be wise to develop alternative strategies for the management of menopausal symptoms in these patients. This paper discusses nonestrogen-based therapies for hot flashes, osteoporosis, and genitourinary symptoms, with an emphasis on efficacy and safety in breast cancer survivors.

### Managing menopause [^1156WjV4]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

In the context of managing menopause, particularly for patients with breast cancer, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend discussing quality-of-life considerations when evaluating the use of intravaginal estrogen therapy for severe vulvovaginal atrophy. It is also important to address uncertainties regarding the potential effects of such therapies on breast cancer recurrence.

### When is it appropriate to prescribe postmenopausal hormone therapy [^1164dZpo]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to develop evidence and consensus-based recommendations for the use of hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women. Using evidence from clinical trials and other publications, a multidisciplinary group of women's health experts developed consensus-based recommendations for HT use in more than 300 clinical scenarios. These panelists utilized the RAND Appropriateness Method and a quantitative scale to rate the appropriateness of treatment options for women with various risk factors and clinical scenarios.

The panel judged it appropriate to prescribe all forms of HT to women with intolerable menopause symptoms and usual (age-expected) risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), venous thromboembolism (VTE), or stroke. Use of HT was judged not appropriate for the clinical scenarios of bone preservation, cosmetic appearance, memory loss, loss of libido, or CVD protection. For a woman still using HT after 5 or more years, it was considered appropriate to recommend the options of stopping or lowering the dose even if stopping was previously attempted. In treating intolerable symptoms in the presence of some elevated risk for diseases related to HT, the route of administration may affect appropriateness, but prior stroke or TIA is a contraindication.

Standard HT is appropriate for women with intolerable menopause symptoms in the absence of HT-related risk factors such as CVD, stroke, VTE, and breast cancer. Panelists judged it appropriate to repeatedly present the option of stopping or reducing the dose in most cases where risk factors are present.

### A phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer in treatment with aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting [^112PpAWd]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

The levels of circulating follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estriol, estradiol, and estrone remained unchanged following a 12-week treatment with 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal women receiving nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. These results support the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of bothersome symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy in breast cancer survivors. The results provide clinicians with confidence in using this product in women who do not experience symptom relief with nonhormonal remedies.

- **Background**: Symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy associated with treatment with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) negatively impact patients' quality of life and may affect adherence to NSAIs. Vaginal estrogens effectively improve these symptoms, although their safe use in breast cancer survivors remains unclear.

- **Methods**: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving NSAIs and moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness were randomized to 0.005% estriol vaginal gel or placebo for 12 weeks. Circulating estrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were analyzed at baseline and at weeks 1, 3, 8, and 12. The primary safety outcome was the variation in serum FSH from baseline to week 12.

- **Results**: Sixty-one women (mean age, 59 years) enrolled in the study. Small oscillations were observed in FSH and LH, although they were always maintained within the postmenopausal range. No significant differences were fo
