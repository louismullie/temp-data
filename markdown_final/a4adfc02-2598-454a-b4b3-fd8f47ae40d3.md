## Question

what are findings of PE on PE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the key findings of pulmonary embolism on physical examination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that no single physical finding reliably diagnoses or excludes PE. Then, I should verify which bedside findings meaningfully increase or decrease pretest probability. Next, I will review validated clinical decision rules that operationalize these findings. After that, I need to check the reliability and interobserver variability of physical signs. Finally, I will integrate these findings into a practical diagnostic pathway and highlight special populations and pitfalls, ensuring each assertion is supported by guidelines or high-quality evidence where possible.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: PE has no pathognomonic bedside sign, and clinical assessment alone cannot secure or exclude the diagnosis, so pretest probability must be paired with objective testing in a structured algorithm. I should double-check that this is consistently emphasized across contemporary guidelines and reviews, which it is, including ESC 2019 and major summaries in NEJM and JAMA [^116C7PxD] [^112kKbjQ] [^116wmKo1].

> Now, I will examine which physical findings most consistently raise suspicion. Tachycardia and hypoxemia stand out as the most sensitive markers, while signs of lower-extremity DVT such as unilateral leg swelling, erythema, tenderness, and a palpable cord meaningfully increase the likelihood of PE. Let me verify that these are repeatedly cited across emergency medicine and primary care sources, and yes, they are consistently flagged as high-yield bedside clues [^113wQsRn] [^1177j4mg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about specificity. I should confirm which signs, when present, truly shift probability upward. Pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis are classic and increase the probability of PE, whereas wheezing on lung exam tends to lower it; syncope can be a red flag for massive PE but is less specific overall, so I need to be cautious in interpreting it in isolation [^1177j4mg] [^113wQsRn].

> Next, I should review how these findings are operationalized. Validated clinical decision rules translate history and physical into standardized pretest probability. The Wells and Revised Geneva scores incorporate tachycardia, signs of DVT, hemoptysis, recent surgery or immobilization, prior VTE, malignancy, and other factors. The PERC rule identifies very low-risk patients in whom no testing is needed if all eight criteria are negative. Let me verify the components and thresholds, and they align with ACP and ESC guidance as well as the original derivation studies [^113ShcWT] [^112LkK69] [^117URCzd] [^112kKbjQ].

> Wait, let me verify the reliability of these bedside assessments. Interobserver agreement for gestalt pretest probability is poor, whereas explicit models improve reliability, and among physical findings, heart rate has the most consistent interobserver reliability. This reinforces the need to use structured tools rather than unstructured gestalt when estimating probability at the bedside [^113TBaLz].

> I will now examine how these findings fit into a diagnostic pathway. For low pretest probability, apply PERC, and if all criteria are met, PE is effectively excluded without further testing. If PERC is not fully negative, obtain a high-sensitivity D-dimer and use age-adjusted thresholds in patients over 50. For intermediate probability, proceed directly to D-dimer. For high probability, skip D-dimer and proceed to imaging, typically CTPA, with V/Q reserved for contraindications to contrast or CT. I should confirm that this sequence is consistent with ACP and ESC recommendations, which it is [^11693TVn] [^114MVN56] [^112kKbjQ].

> But wait, what if the patient is unstable? I need to ensure I do not delay life-saving care for testing. In suspected high-risk PE with shock or persistent hypotension, bedside echocardiography or emergent CTPA should be pursued depending on availability, and empirical anticoagulation may be warranted while arranging imaging. This is explicitly recommended in ESC guidance and echoed in emergency care reviews [^111m2sux] [^112ymNHB].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, the baseline prevalence of PE is lower than often assumed, so pretest probability assessment and D-dimer strategies tailored to pregnancy are essential to avoid over-imaging. In older adults, age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds safely reduce unnecessary CT while maintaining sensitivity. In patients with concurrent cardiopulmonary disease, the predictive value of individual signs is attenuated, so structured pretest tools become even more important to avoid misclassification [^117PPDHp] [^114q8N2s] [^112eeM4g].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of DVT signs in the PE workup. When DVT symptoms are present, starting with lower-extremity venous ultrasound can obviate the need for chest imaging because treatment of proximal DVT and PE is similar, and a positive ultrasound confirms VTE management. This is a practical shortcut endorsed by ACP and radiology appropriateness criteria [^112ymNHB] [^115yzD9T].

> I need to ensure I address the limitations and pitfalls. Overreliance on any single sign risks both under- and over-diagnosis, and overuse of CTPA exposes patients to radiation, contrast, incidental findings, and overdiagnosis of subsegmental clots. Conversely, anchoring bias and atypical presentations can lead to missed diagnoses. Balancing these risks is precisely why validated rules and stepwise algorithms are recommended [^115whr7i] [^112eeM4g] [^112kKbjQ].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. The most informative bedside findings that increase the likelihood of PE are tachycardia, hypoxemia, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and signs of unilateral leg DVT, while wheezing lowers probability. None of these are sufficient alone, so clinicians should use structured pretest probability tools, apply PERC in low-risk patients, and proceed with D-dimer and imaging according to risk tier to safely and efficiently confirm or exclude PE [^113wQsRn] [^113ShcWT] [^117URCzd] [^112kKbjQ].

The most common physical findings of pulmonary embolism (PE) are **dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia** [^notfound], with pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) such as unilateral leg swelling, erythema, and tenderness also frequently present [^113NNkM3]. Hypoxemia and a **low oxygen saturation** are common, while fever, syncope, and signs of right heart strain (elevated JVP, loud P2, right-sided S3) may occur in more severe cases [^notfound]. However, PE can present with normal vital signs and a nonrevealing exam, so **clinical suspicion must be guided by risk factors and pretest probability** [^1147Q6f8], with **validated tools** (Wells, Geneva, PERC) and D-dimer testing used to guide imaging [^113nGpw9] [^1179BewV].

---

## Common physical findings

- **Dyspnea**: The most frequent symptom, occurring in approximately 70–80% of patients [^112ckbEw].

- **Tachypnea**: Rapid shallow breathing is common, often accompanying dyspnea [^notfound].

- **Tachycardia**: Elevated heart rate (> 100 beats per minute) is present in many patients [^113ShcWT].

- **Pleuritic chest pain**: Occurs in about 50–60% of cases, often associated with pulmonary infarction [^notfound].

- **Hemoptysis**: Present in approximately 10–20% of cases, typically associated with pulmonary infarction [^notfound].

- **Signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**: Unilateral leg swelling, erythema, and tenderness are present in about 40–50% of patients with PE [^notfound].

---

## Less common physical findings

- **Syncope**: Occurs in about 10–20% of cases, often indicating massive PE with hemodynamic instability [^notfound].

- **Fever**: Low-grade fever may be present, particularly in cases of pulmonary infarction.

- **Cyanosis**: Bluish discoloration of the skin or mucous membranes due to hypoxemia.

- **Signs of right heart strain**: Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), loud second heart sound (P2), and right-sided third heart sound (S3) may be present in severe cases [^notfound].

---

## Vital sign abnormalities

- **Hypoxemia**: Low oxygen saturation (SpO2 < 90%) is common, particularly in moderate to severe cases [^notfound].

- **Hypotension**: Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg indicates massive PE and hemodynamic instability [^notfound].

- **Tachycardia**: Heart rate > 100 beats per minute is frequently observed [^113NNkM3].

---

## Physical examination findings associated with specific PE severity

| **Severity** | **Physical findings** |
|-|-|
| Mild | - Dyspnea <br/> - Tachypnea <br/> - Mild tachycardia <br/> - Normal vital signs otherwise [^notfound] |
| Moderate | - Hypoxemia <br/> - Pleuritic chest pain <br/> - Hemoptysis <br/> - Signs of DVT [^notfound] |
| Severe | - Syncope <br/> - Hypotension <br/> - Cyanosis <br/> - Signs of right heart strain [^notfound] |

---

## Limitations of physical examination in PE

- **Non-specificity**: Many findings (dyspnea, tachycardia, chest pain) are common in other conditions, limiting diagnostic specificity [^114ZHCnB].

- **Variability**: Clinical presentation varies widely, and some patients may have minimal or no abnormal findings [^11363Sdr].

- **Reliability**: Interobserver reliability for physical signs is often poor, emphasizing the need for objective diagnostic tools [^113TBaLz].

---

## Clinical prediction rules and diagnostic algorithms

Given the limitations of physical examination, **clinical prediction rules** (Wells, Geneva, PERC) [^112kKbjQ] are recommended to assess pretest probability and guide diagnostic testing [^113nGpw9]. These tools incorporate physical findings, risk factors, and symptoms to stratify patients into low, intermediate, or high probability categories, thereby guiding the use of D-dimer testing and imaging studies such as CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) [^115j6zVt].

---

## Conclusion

The most common physical findings of PE include dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and signs of DVT [^114XnYyJ]. However, these findings are **non-specific and variable**, necessitating the use of clinical prediction rules and objective diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis [^112kKbjQ].

### The problem of under-diagnosis and over-diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^112eeM4g]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is an increasingly recognised condition which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the better awareness of this serious condition, the diagnosis is still overlooked in many cases with sometimes fatal consequences. Under-diagnosis may be due to several reasons including reliance on non-specific 'classic' symptoms, belief that bedside measurements will likely be abnormal in the setting of acute PE, and confounding factors like co-existent cardiorespiratory diseases or being in an intensive care unit, where the diagnosis may not be considered. At the same time, incidental diagnosis of PE is occurring more often due to frequent use of imaging investigations alongside advancements in CT technology, and dilemma exists as to whether the chance finding of PE requires anticoagulation, especially when identified only at the subsegmental level. This article reviews these two issues of under-diagnosis and over-diagnosis of PE in the current era.

### Clinical features from the history and physical examination that predict the presence or absence of pulmonary embolism in symptomatic emergency department patients: results of a prospective, multicenter study [^1177j4mg]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Prediction rules for pulmonary embolism use variables explicitly shown to estimate the probability of pulmonary embolism. However, clinicians often use variables that have not been similarly validated, yet are implicitly believed to modify probability of pulmonary embolism. The objective of this study is to measure the predictive value of 13 implicit variables.

Methods

Patients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study from 12 centers in the United States; all had an objective test for pulmonary embolism (D-dimer, computed tomographic angiography, or ventilation-perfusion scan). Clinical features including 12 predefined previously validated (explicit) variables and 13 variables not part of existing prediction rules (implicit) were prospectively recorded at presentation. The primary outcome was venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis), diagnosed by imaging up to 45 days after enrollment. Variables with adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression with 95% confidence intervals not crossing unity were considered significant.

Results

Seven thousand nine hundred forty patients (7.2% venous thromboembolism positive) were enrolled. Mean age was 49 years (standard deviation 17 years) and 67% were female patients. Eight of 13 implicit variables were significantly associated with venous thromboembolism; those with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) greater than 1.5 included non-cancer-related thrombophilia (OR 1.99), pleuritic chest pain (OR 1.53), and family history of venous thromboembolism (OR 1.51). Implicit variables that predicted no venous thromboembolism outcome included substernal chest pain, female sex, and smoking. Nine of 12 explicit variables predicted a positive outcome of venous thromboembolism, including patient history of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis in the past, unilateral leg swelling, recent surgery, estrogen, hypoxemia, and active malignancy.

Conclusion

In symptomatic outpatients being considered for possible pulmonary embolism, non-cancer-related thrombophilia, pleuritic chest pain, and family history of venous thromboembolism increase probability of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis. Other variables that are part of existing pretest probability systems were validated as important predictors in this diverse sample of US emergency department patients.

### Association of corpus callosum development with fetal growth restriction… [^114LS9Dm]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Results of this study suggest that, in fetuses with FGR in pregnancies with PE or GH, decreased structural development of the CC, predominantly the splenium region, may be significantly associated with a higher risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and may be regarded as an MRI-based biomarker for better prenatal counseling and early management decisions. Furthermore, fetuses in the PE or GH with FGR group, when compared with fetuses in the control groups without FGR and normotensive pregnancies, had a significantly lower mean birth weight BPD and median OFD compared with fetuses in the control cases. To eliminate the disturbance of reduced BPD and OFD, we calculated the CIs and used them as adjusted ratios.

A brain imaging study using diffusion tensor imaging provided the first report of lower fractional anisotropy values from the splenium region in premature infants whose mothers had PE, thus indicating that PE might be a factor in a neurodevelopmental delay of the brain microstructure in the CC, especially in the splenium region. 24 It is unknown whether or to what extent the microstructural alterations occur in the CC of fetuses with FGR in pregnancies with PE or GH. We believe that the data provide converging evidence for the proposal that fetuses with FGR in pregnancies with PE or GH showed significant macrostructural decrease and lower ADC value in the splenium region of the fetal CC. This finding suggests that the fetal CC, especially the splenium region, in fetuses with FGR in pregnancies with PE or GH may be regarded as a potential MRI-based biomarker for better prenatal counseling and early management intervention.

Hence, ongoing work by our team includes conducting a prospective study with a larger sample size of individuals with PE or GH, acquiring fetal whole-brain structural imaging and diffusion MRI data, and examining the association between fetal brain alterations and poor neurobehavioral performance in infants.

### Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115MBX3q]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common, lethal yet treatable disease. The clinical diagnosis of PE remains to be a problem due to the nonspecific presenting signs, symptoms, electrocardiographic findings, arterial blood gas abnormalities and chest X-ray changes. Despite these nonspecific clinical findings, clinicians are adept at assigning pretest probability using overall clinical assessment. Clinical models have been developed to improve the accuracy of pretest probability assessment. D-dimers are becoming a widely available clinical tool useful in the diagnostic management of suspected PE. The limitations of the imaging modalities for PE [ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning, spiral computerised tomography, pulmonary angiography and venous leg imaging] necessitate the use of these tests in series and in combination with clinical pretest probability assessment and D-dimer in diagnostic management algorithms. These algorithms permit safe diagnostic management of patients with suspected PE while limiting invasiveness, inaccessibility and expense.

### 4-level clinical pretest probability score for suspected pulmonary embolism to safely decrease imaging testing… [^113WhaLx]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The 4PEPS strategy may lead to a substantial and safe reduction in imaging testing for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Importance In patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, overuse of diagnostic imaging is an important point of concern. Objective To derive and validate a 4-level pretest probability rule that makes it possible to rule out PE solely on clinical criteria and optimized D-dimer measurement to safely decrease imaging testing for suspected PE. Using 5 multicenter cohorts regrouping more than 12 000 patients suspected of PE, we were able to derive and validate a new clinical probability score to help physicians diagnose PE and safely decrease diagnostic imaging.

Applying the 4PEPS diagnostic strategy retrospectively to 2 external validation cohorts, the rate of false-negative tests was below 1%, and the 4PEPS strategy performed better than all previously proposed strategies in terms of reducing imaging testing. A negative PERC strategy finding defines a subgroup of these patients with a very low PE prevalence allowing PE to be ruled out without any testing. 15 However, applied alone or in association with the revised Geneva score, the PERC strategy appears to be insufficiently reliable. 28, 29 The 4PEPS strategy may not have such a limitation. This criterion is sometimes criticized for a lack of objectivity and reproducibility. Nevertheless, it is included in the Wells score9 and YEARS strategy, 12 is well-known by the ED physicians, and is easier to explain and to use than gestalt.

The inclusion of factors decreasing the probability of PE diagnosis as well as factors increasing it allowed us to derive a 4-level score that rules out PE when negative. The 4PEPS calibration and accuracy of the 4PEPS appear to be at least similar to previous CPP scores for PE. 8, 33. In conclusion, using a bayesian approach, we derived a new 4-level clinical probability score to help ED physicians make decisions regarding patients suspected of PE. The accuracy, safety, and efficacy of the 4PEPS strategy were confirmed in 2 independent external validation cohorts, one with a moderate PE prevalence and the other with a high PE prevalence. For both cohorts, applying 4PEPS resulted in a very low rate of diagnostic failure and a substantial reduction in imaging testing. It should now be tested in a formal outcome study.

### Current imaging of PE and emerging techniques: is there a role for artificial intelligence? [^113zUNHA]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical, potentially life-threatening finding on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional chest imaging. Timely and accurate diagnosis of thrombus acuity and extent directly influences patient management, and outcomes. Technical and interpretive pitfalls may present challenges to the radiologist, and by extension, pose nuance in the development and integration of artificial intelligence support tools. This review delineates imaging considerations for diagnosis of acute PE, and rationale, hurdles and applications of artificial intelligence for the PE task.

Description

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

Methods

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review, but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians should use age-adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should obtain imaging with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve ventilation-perfusion scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

The European Respiratory Journal (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ESC 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain bedside echocardiography or emergency CTPA (depending on availability and clinical circumstances) for the diagnosis of patients with suspected high-risk PE.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

Cancer screening

The overall incidence of a new cancer diagnosis is up to six-fold higher in patients with VTE than in sex- and age-matched controls. The absolute risk is highest during the first months after VTE diagnosis, in patients with unprovoked VTE, and in patients aged older than 50 years. The 1-year incidence of cancer is ∼1% in patients with provoked VTE compared to 5% in patients with unprovoked VTE, an incidence that gradually decreases to the risk of the general population over a 2-year period. Given these facts, we propose limited cancer screening in patients with unprovoked VTE to detect cancer at an early stage. Screening should include a thorough medical history, physical examination, basic laboratory testing (including a complete blood count, calcium, and liver function tests), and lung imaging (unless computed tomography [CT] pulmonary angiography was performed to diagnose PE). Age- and gender-specific testing (e.g. mammography, cervical smear, and prostate specific antigen testing) should be implemented in accordance with national guidelines and local practice. During follow-up after acute PE, the threshold to suspect cancer should be low in patients with a relatively recent history of cured cancer (e.g. within 5 years, as VTE can be a sign of recurrent cancer), early VTE progression/recurrence despite anticoagulant treatment, and anticoagulant-related bleeding shortly after start of treatment (particularly gastrointestinal bleeding or haematuria). If cancer is detected in the course of PE treatment, the choice and dosage of the anticoagulant as well as the duration of treatment should be adjusted accordingly.

Although (extensive) screening for cancer leads to an earlier cancer diagnosis, evidence that screening reduces cancer-related morbidity or mortality is lacking. Extensive imaging-based screening with chest CT imaging, abdominal CT imaging, and/or 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT imaging may further increase the number of cancers detected at VTE diagnosis but should be avoided, since the survival benefit of such an approach has never been demonstrated, and at the same time it carries the considerable costs and risks of invasive tests, false-positive findings, and overdiagnosis.

Evaluation of suspected acute PE — factors promoting overuse of imaging include that "pregnancy itself does not confer a greater risk for PE", physicians may feel compelled to "rule out the condition even if its likelihood is extremely low" and may prefer dichotomous tests "such as CT", while "the fear of litigation" may drive imaging; patient preferences and limited communication can increase testing, whereas such communication "has also been found to be associated with less use of diagnostic testing"; system factors include the growth in availability and use of CT in emergency departments and after-hours remote radiology, and "supply-sensitive care" whereby technology availability is linked to use and "may also promote overuse"; practice gaps include that many low- or intermediate-risk patients "either have no plasma D- dimer value obtained or go on to have CT despite normal D- dimer levels", and some with elevated d-dimer do not have follow-up CT, "contrary to evidence-based guidelines".

### Comparing' clinical hunch' against clinical decision support systems (PERC rule, wells score, revised Geneva score and YEARS criteria) in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism [^111e6x6Q]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As the present study found that CDSS gave a higher yield compared to clinical hunch, clinicians should trust the evidence-based clinical decision support systems in line with the international guidelines to diagnose PE.

Several other studies have shown that the CTPA PE yield is lower when the CDSS is bypassed. In our study, the decrease in yield ranged from 8 to 21%. The latest recommendations from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) (2019) state that CDSS should be used as a decision tool in the PE diagnostic process. The question is, why do clinicians bypass the CDSS algorithms?

In order to address this question, we started by comparing the bypassed and non-bypassed group to find parameters that might cause the clinician to sidestep the system. However, no definitive findings, including patterns of physical signs and symptoms, or laboratory values that might cause bypass, were identified. Some studies have noted that some clinician-perceived risk factors such as malignancy (last treatment < 1 year prior), travel ≥ 4 h, and thrombophilia are not included in any of the CDSS. These omissions might explain a few of the cases in our study but not all. In many cases, a CTPA was ordered for patients in a low-risk group who also had a negative D-dimer.

The following options may explain why a CTPA is ordered:
Clinicians do not want to miss PE, despite the radiation and contrast medium risk, not to mention the cost and time involved.
CTPA has become the go-to examination in patients with these symptoms because it might give other explanations if PE is negative.
Awareness or ease of use/availability of CDSS could be another reason.
Logistical issues and/or patient pressure.

Any combination of these four factors could be a reason for clinicians to include PE in their differential diagnosis, and thus order a CTPA more often than necessary.

There are an increasing number of CTPAs being made to diagnose PE (and an increase in CT use in general), but not a proportional increase in diagnosis yield. This increase in use has also lead to the diagnosis of smaller emboli at the subsegmental level, which may not be clinically relevant; the decision on whether to treat subsegmental emboli is still being debated, considering there is a 7% risk of major bleeding associated with anticoagulation therapy. In our study, 21% of the diagnosed PE were subsegmental.

### Narrative review: should teaching of the respiratory physical examination be restricted only to signs with proven reliability and validity? [^112d9WXC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the reported reliability (reproducibility, inter-examiner agreement) and validity (sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios) of respiratory physical examination (PE) signs, and suggest an approach to teaching these signs to medical students.

Methods

Review of the literature. We searched Paper Chase between 1966 and June 2009 to identify and evaluate published studies on the diagnostic accuracy of respiratory PE signs.

Results

Most studies have reported low to fair reliability and sensitivity values. However, some studies have found high specificites for selected PE signs. None of the studies that we reviewed adhered to all of the STARD criteria for reporting diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusions

Possible flaws in study designs may have led to underestimates of the observed diagnostic accuracy of respiratory PE signs. The reported poor reliabilities may have been due to differences in the PE skills of the participating examiners, while the sensitivities may have been confounded by variations in the severity of the diseases of the participating patients. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE AND MEDICAL EDUCATION: Pending the results of properly controlled studies, the reported poor reliability and sensitivity of most respiratory PE signs do not necessarily detract from their clinical utility. Therefore, we believe that a meticulously performed respiratory PE, which aims to explore a diagnostic hypothesis, as opposed to a PE that aims to detect a disease in an asymptomatic person, remains a cornerstone of clinical practice. We propose teaching the respiratory PE signs according to their importance, beginning with signs of life-threatening conditions and those that have been reported to have a high specificity, and ending with signs that are "nice to know", but are no longer employed because of the availability of more easily performed tests.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) — PERC rule in low pretest probability: In patients with low pretest probability, application of PERC can safely identify patients for whom diagnostic testing is not necessary, and if a patient with low pretest probability of PE meets all 8 PERC criteria, their likelihood of PE is 0.3% and no further testing is required. In a meta-analysis of 12 studies, which included 14 844 patients, the PERC were found to have a sensitivity of 97%. The PERC should not be used in patients with intermediate pretest probability.

### Improving the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^114ZHCnB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department is challenging due to the lack of clinical diagnostic criteria and imperfect investigations. The presenting symptoms are common and non-specific varying from chest pain, shortness of breath, cough and haemoptysis, to syncope and cardiac arrest. There is a high false positive rate with non-invasive testing (d-dimer) but relatively significant potential adverse events (radiation and contrast associated complications) with more invasive testing such as Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA).

Various scoring systems exist in an attempt to limit unnecessary imaging for those identified as having a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism without increasing the risk of missing the potentially life threatening diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Using a combination of the Wells score and either a d-dimer (if PERC positive) or no testing (if PERC negative) can reduce the need for imaging. These scoring systems are particularly useful for junior doctors who may lack clinical experience. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) has been validated for use within the emergency department. Within the emergency departments in which this project was undertaken there were no specific guidelines that junior doctors were required to follow although discussion with senior clinicians prior to requesting a d-dimer or imaging was encouraged.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines describe proposed best standards that should be met when considering the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism which involves appropriate use of the Wells scoring system.

Below is a summary of these guidelines:

Patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism should all have an assessment of their general medical history, a physical examination, and a chest X-ray. All patients with suspected pulmonary embolism should have their probability of pulmonary embolism assessed using the two-level Pulmonary Embolism Wells score.

Patients with a likely two-level Wells score should NOT have a d-dimer and be offered CTPA with the exception of patients with contrast allergy, renal impairment, or in whom risk of irradiation is high who should instead be offered a Ventilation Perfusion (V/Q) scan. All patients not able to have immediate imaging should have interim parenteral anticoagulant therapy.

### Effectiveness of a submassive pulmonary embolism protocol to standardise patient evaluation and treatment [^1178htTX]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

In the USA, pulmonary embolism is listed as the cause of death in approximately 100 000 cases annually. Risk stratification into low risk, submassive or massive pulmonary embolism (PE) categories should be initiated promptly to determine appropriate anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapy and reduce risk of recurrent thromboembolism and death.

SMPE is defined as PE without hypotension with embolus resulting in right heart strain or myocardial necrosis. Depending on comorbidities or clot burden, the physical and clinical manifestations encompass a wide spectrum of disease. In addition to the variability in SMPE presentation, the risk stratification classifications vary between the American Heart Association, American College of Chest Physicians and European Society of Cardiology depending on recommended use of the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score, right ventricle/left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio and elevated biomarkers.

Due to variability in PE stratification and treatment modalities including ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis, multidisciplinary consultation between specialties is advantageous to determining appropriate treatment. In 2016, Kabrhel et al, implemented a Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT) composed of cardiology, cardiac surgery, echocardiography, emergency medicine, haematology, pulmonary/critical care, radiology and vascular medicine. Once activated by a referring physician, the team reviewed clinical information in real time and returned treatment recommendations back to the referring provider. Implementation of the team was effective at coordinating multidisciplinary specialists to provide evidence-based care to patients with PE.

### Emergency department diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism [^113NNkM3]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is challenging to even the most seasoned physician. Although dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia and haemoptysis are hallmark features, PE also presents with non‐specific symptoms like fever, syncope or cough. While hormone use, recent surgery or trauma, malignancy and prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) are well‐known predisposing factors, recent infection, autoimmune or inflammatory bowel disease and recent admission for heart failure or myocardial infarction are also risks. Pregnancy increases risk, particularly in the third trimester until 6 weeks post‐partum, though evidence for increased risk in the first two trimesters is less convincing. Advanced age, obesity and smoking amplify these risks.PE should be considered in any patient with common presenting symptoms and pervasive risk factors.

### Pulmonary emboli: the differential diagnosis dilemma [^116NorQU]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a rare but serious medical condition, with an estimated mortality of 5% to 20%. Many patients receiving physical therapy may be at risk for developing pulmonary embolism, especially after periods of immobilization or surgery. Patients presenting with dyspnea, chest pain, or tachypnea, particularly after trauma or surgery, have an increased likelihood of pulmonary embolism. Clinical prediction rules have been developed, which can aid the practitioners in assessing the risk a patient has for developing pulmonary embolism. The present clinical commentary discusses the existing evidence for screening patients for pulmonary embolism. To illustrate the importance of the screening examination, a patient is presented who was referred to physical therapy 5 days after cervical discectomy and fusion. This patient was subsequently referred for medical evaluation and a confirmatory diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

Furthermore, to demonstrate our findings in a clinical context, we used the calculated indices for each pCPS to simulate how they would perform in a simulated population of 100 patients with a clinical suspicion of PE, with a true PE prevalence of 20%. In this simulated population, we compared pCPS based on how many patients with PE were missed (assigned to low-probability) and how many patients without PE were needlessly assigned to imaging (assigned to high-probability). To adjust for the significant variability in the reported range of observed PE prevalence in practice, we also calculated the number of missed PE cases and unnecessary imaging patients across simulated populations with PE prevalence rates ranging from 5 to 30%, in 5% increments.

### Testing pleural and pericardial effusion for EGFR variants in non-small cell lung cancer… [^113LVyFj]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Among 171 patients enrolled, there were 104 in cohort 1 and 67 in cohort 2. In cohort 1, 37% were EGFR-variant positive; PE-cfDNA showed 97% sensitivity, 97% specificity, and 97% concordance for the detection of sensitizing EGFR variants. The EGFR T790M variant was detected in 51% of PE-cfDNA vs 25% of PE cell block samples. Conclusions and Relevance In this diagnostic study, EGFR variants could be accurately detected from PE-cfDNA in patients with NSCLC. More EGFR T790M was detected in PE-cfDNA than in guideline-recommended PE cell block preparations. These results suggest that PE-cfDNA can complement plasma and tumor genotyping for detecting EGFR variants in patients with advanced NSCLC. Pleural and pericardial effusion provide a rich source of cfDNA; EGFR variants can be detected from PE even with negative cytological findings.

12, 13 Previous studies14, 15 were limited either by small sample sizes or retrospective design. The current study is, to our knowledge, the first prospectively designed trial with statistical power to validate the diagnostic utility of cfDNA obtained from PE for detecting sensitizing EGFR variants in EGFR-TKI–naive patients and T790M in patients with first- and second-generation EGFR-TKI resistance. There were 171 patients. Among 104 patients enrolled in cohort 1, 99 of PE samples were from pleural fluid, 90 tumors were adenocarcinomas, and 38 were EGFR positive. Among 67 patients enrolled in cohort 2, demographic characteristics were similar. We prospectively validated the diagnostic accuracy of PE-cfDNA testing for sensitizing EGFR and showed that PE-cfDNA had a high yield for resistant T790M in advanced NSCLC.

### Pulmonary embolism: making sense of the diagnostic evaluation [^111c6F2c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the publication of the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis in 1990, the diagnostic evaluation of pulmonary embolism continues to be approached in an inconsistent fashion. The reasons for this are unclear but likely have to do with inadequate methods for predicting pretest probability of disease and the inconvenience and perceived risk of pulmonary angiography. Because pulmonary embolism and its treatment carry substantial risk of morbidity and mortality, a consistent approach to evaluation is desirable. This article reviews large, prospective studies that suggest that it may be unnecessary to diagnose pulmonary embolism with the certainty that pulmonary angiography allows. Finally, the article proposes an algorithm that may be acceptable to patients and clinicians alike if safety is confirmed in future prospective studies.

### Adverse clinical outcomes among patients with acute low-risk pulmonary embolism and concerning computed tomography imaging findings [^113nYec2]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are concerning computed tomography findings among patients seen in the emergency department with acute, low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) (eg, saddle PE, right ventricular strain, pulmonary infarct) associated with differences in treatment and/or clinical outcomes?

Findings

In this cohort study of 817 patients, concerning computed tomography findings were associated with increased hospitalization and resource utilization but not short-term adverse clinical outcomes.

Meaning

These findings suggest that concerning computed tomography imaging findings may be a significant barrier to outpatient treatment among patients with otherwise low-risk acute PE.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112ckbEw]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism — epidemiology, symptoms, and diagnostic evaluation in acute chest pain: The incidence of PE is estimated at 65 cases per 100000, one-third of deaths are sudden, and 60% are undiagnosed before death; risk factors include inherited hypercoagulable states and acquired risk factors such as recent surgery, trauma, immobilization, malignancy, smoking, obesity, and oral contraception, and dyspnea followed by pleuritic chest pain is the most common presenting symptom with signs of deep venous thrombosis possibly present on examination. CTA using PE protocol is the diagnostic modality of choice in stable patients, ventilation-perfusion scanning is a second-line alternative in the acute setting, and use of clinical prediction rules to select patients for imaging can decrease radiation exposure and cost; troponin and brain natriuretic peptide can be elevated, echocardiography may reveal acute right ventricular strain consequent to large PEs, and troponin and brain natriuretic peptide are both markers for higher mortality rate. Recognition of PE is important because prompt anticoagulation improves outcomes, and diagnostic evaluation depends on clinical assessment of pretest probability; D-dimers are highly sensitive but not very specific for PE in emergency department patients, and measurement of D-dimers using age- and sex-specific cutoffs may be useful in patients at low to intermediate pretest probability such that those with negative D-dimers can probably be discharged without further testing whereas those with positive values should be considered for CTA.

### Diagnosis and exclusion of pulmonary embolism [^112XvjVG]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Failure to test for pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a lethal mistake, but PE and produces symptoms similar to many other diseases. Overtesting for PE has negative consequences.

Objectives

Use published evidence to create a rationale and safe diagnostic approach for ambulatory and emergency patients with suspected PE in 2017.

Findings

Pulmonary embolism need not be pursued in patients with no symptoms of PE in the present or recent history (dyspnea, chest pain, cough or syncope), and always normal vital signs. When clinicians have a low clinical suspicion for PE or a Wells score < 2, they can reasonably exclude PE with the Pulmonary Embolism Rule out Criteria (PERC rule). For patients with a "PE-unlikely" pretest probability (Wells or simplified revised Geneva score < 5), PE can be ruled out with a normal or age-adjusted D-dimer concentrations. Other patients should undergo pulmonary vascular imaging, and the choices are discussed, including computerized tomographic pulmonary angiography, planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

Conclusions

A thoughtful algorithm for PE exclusion and diagnosis requires pretest probability assessment in all patients, followed by selective use of clinical criteria, the quantitative D-dimer, and pulmonary vascular imaging.

### Revised paradigm for acute pulmonary embolism prognostication and treatment [^1137gdrS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

- What is the optimal timing for assessing outcomes after a diagnosis of acute PE?

Early assessment for adverse outcomes might improve decision making regarding outpatient therapy of PE and escalated PE-associated monitoring and therapy.

- What kind of relationship should prognostic outcomes have to the therapeutic and monitoring options?

Prognostication should accurately estimate all-cause mortality in patients undergoing consideration for outpatient therapy. Alternatively, prognostication should accurately estimate PE-related mortality and PE-related decompensation in patients undergoing consideration for disease-specific therapy.

- What is the operational definition of PE-associated deterioration?

PE-associated adverse outcomes include death, recurrent PE, RV dysfunction, end-organ hypoperfusion, respiratory failure, and hypotension (and tachycardia).

- For patients with acute PE, how should clinicians accurately estimate the individual risk of patients for adverse outcomes?

Calculators could provide individual risk estimations that help guide the choice of available therapeutic options. Retrospective analyses of large registries' data could assist with the rapid development of new risk calculators. Prospective studies could assist with the development, validation, and revision of these tools and schemas at a slower pace and at a greater cost.

- What predictor variables should physicians consider and/or which prognostic tools should be included?

New risk calculators should include variables associated with medical history and physical examination, laboratory testing, and tests that assess for the presence and the degree of hypoxemia, RV dysfunction, myocardial injury, clot burden, organ perfusion, and systemic inflammation.

- Which intervention(s) has or have the best risk/benefit ratio for distinct subgroups of patients with acute PE?

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^114fWovk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — low pretest probability evaluation uses the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) and D-dimer testing. In patients believed to be at low risk for PE, the PERC criteria should be applied. In those who meet all 8 PERC criteria, the risk for PE is lower than the risks of testing; do not order a plasma d-dimer test. Those who do not meet all of the criteria should be further stratified by using a plasma d-dimer test. A normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; do not order imaging studies. An elevated plasma D-dimer level should lead to imaging studies. The PERC items are Age < 50, Initial heart rate < 100 beats/min, Initial oxygen saturation > 94% on room air, No unilateral leg swelling, No hemoptysis, No surgery or trauma within 4 wk, No history of venous thromboembolism, and No estrogen use; the table notes that pretest probability with score of 0 is < 1%.

### Advanced treatment strategies for acute pulmonary embolism, including thrombolysis and embolectomy [^112xSRis]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment strategy for acute pulmonary embolism relies upon a multidisciplinary team that rapidly assesses available data, performs additional testing if necessary, weighs treatment options, and recommends an appropriate therapeutic plan to the patient and family. Round-the-clock availability is imperative. Centers that specialize in pulmonary embolism management offer a wide range of therapeutic options. Hospitals with more limited facilities should establish pulmonary embolism patient referral and transfer contingency plans that can be activated at a moment's notice. Management options include anticoagulation alone, thrombolysis plus anticoagulation, insertion of an inferior vena caval filter, catheter embolectomy, or surgical embolectomy. The decision-making process requires accurate risk stratification, which is comprised of several crucial components: clinical evaluation that includes history and physical examination, biomarker measurement especially of troponin, as well as assessment of right ventricular size and function based upon chest CT scanning and echocardiography. The 'old school' approach of declaring a benign prognosis based solely upon the presence of normal systemic arterial pressure can delay advanced therapy until after the onset of irreversible cardiogenic shock. We have now formulated a more contemporary, comprehensive, and multifaceted strategy to prognosticate. Our 'new approach' uses advanced treatment strategies in addition to anticoagulation for those pulmonary embolism patients deemed to be at high risk for a poor outcome.

### Comprehensive management of acute pulmonary embolism in primary care using telemedicine in the COVID-era [^113TZyPr]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

With regard to acute pulmonary embolism management, the current literature is sparse on using telemedicine to evaluate acute complaints in general. The benefits of quick access via telemedicine are pitted against the absence of a complete physical examination. For this patient, missing critical objective components include a complete set of vital signs and detailed cardiopulmonary and extremity examinations. While additional testing including a 12-lead ECG and two-view chest radiograph may partly remedy initial examination shortcomings, these are predicated on timely access to diagnostic testing. As discussed above, the emergence of reliable tools for home vital sign measurements may help broaden the capacity of telemedicine. Elements of a proposed pathway for the telemedical evaluation of possible deep vein thrombosis may be adaptable for a similar pulmonary embolism pathway.

Telemedicine expanded in 2020 as a convenient means of providing healthcare without increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Given an eligible patient in the right care setting supported by adequate resources and infrastructure, this case raises the possibility that telemedicine may be used safely and effectively to diagnose and manage select cases of acute pulmonary embolism without the need for transfer to a higher level of care. However, one case report cannot justify wholesale a new pattern of care. Research should be undertaken to establish the safety and effectiveness of this approach and to identify patients who are best suited for telemedicine management. How well triage tools like the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index and the Hestia criteria might perform to identify patients with acute pulmonary embolism eligible for telemedical care without complete physical examination data is unknown. Expanding these questions beyond acute pulmonary embolism to other acute care conditions raises questions about which patients with which complaints in which care settings are eligible for comprehensive telemedical care. More research is needed to help us understand the possibilities and limitations of telemedicine in the management of patients with high-acuity complaints, including pulmonary embolism, and to ensure equitable patient access and outcomes. Preference for using telemedicine will likely remain higher after the pandemic, but the degree to which it is used or useful in a non-pandemic period is not yet clear.

### Comparison of the wells score with the revised Geneva score for assessing suspected pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112NGpYF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Thrombolysis (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Revised Geneva score for pulmonary embolism" for pulmonary embolism.

The Revised Geneva Score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients. This scoring system is used in the adult population presenting with symptoms suggestive of PE, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or unexplained cough.

The Revised Geneva Score is particularly useful in the emergency department or outpatient settings where PE is suspected. It helps clinicians decide whether further diagnostic testing (like CT pulmonary angiography) is needed. The score is based on various factors including age, previous history of DVT or PE, recent surgery or fracture, active malignancy, unilateral lower limb pain, hemoptysis, heart rate, and pain on lower limb deep venous palpation and unilateral edema.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that this score is less accurate in patients with certain conditions that can mimic the symptoms of PE, such as heart failure or pneumonia. It is also less reliable in pregnant women due to physiological changes that can affect the score parameters.

The Revised Geneva score for pulmonary embolism calculator evaluates eight inputs related to a patient's clinical history and symptoms, assigning a numerical score to each based on predefined criteria. The inputs include age, past medical history, recent surgeries, presence of malignancy, specific pain symptoms, hemoptysis, heart rate, and findings on limb examination. Each potential response to these inputs is assigned a score depending on its relevance to pulmonary embolism risk.

The scoring system is as follows:

- **Age > 65 years**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Previous DVT or PE**: Yes = 3, No = 0
- **Surgery or fracture within 1 month**: Yes = 2, No = 0
- **Active malignant condition**: Yes = 2, No = 0
- **Unilateral lower limb pain**: Yes = 3, No = 0
- **Hemoptysis**: Yes = 2, No = 0
- **Heart rate**: < 75 = 0, 75–94 = 3, ≥ 95 = 5
- **Pain on lower limb palpation and unilateral edema**: Yes = 4, No = 0

The calculator processes these inputs by summing the assigned scores, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 22. This total score is then used to interpret the risk of pulmonary embolism:

- A score of 3 or less indicates a 4–20% risk of pulmonary embolism.
- A score between 4 and 10 suggests a 25–40% risk.
- A score greater than 10 indicates a substantial risk, ranging from 50–91%.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) scope and audience — The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

### Clinical profile and outcome of isolated pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111EL15i]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A primary limitation was that individual patient data were not used, and that syntheses of study level data can suffer from ecological bias. In addition, the majority of studies included in this investigation were observational in nature, which complicates causal inference. Nevertheless, only studies at low risk of selection bias, with the majority employing an unselected enrolment strategy, were included. Moreover, since the estimands of interest in this study were the associations of clinical characteristics with PE phenotypes, and random allocation to risk factors or phenotypes is not possible, no benefit would be obtained by prioritising the inclusion of randomised trials in this study. Third, all meta-analyses of proportions exhibited high between-study heterogeneity. Reasons for such heterogeneity could include differences by study region, healthcare setting, diagnostic protocols, and stringency of medical examination. Large empirical comparisons of ratio measures versus absolute measures (e.g. risk differences, mean differences) for meta-analyses of the same underlying data have previously shown that ratio measures tend to exhibit much less heterogeneity in general, due to their independence of baseline prevalence. A fourth limitation was that few studies reported clinical outcomes, and those that did often followed patients for a limited period of time. Studies with longer follow-up are needed to provide more reliable insight into the incidence of various outcomes following acute PE.

The available evidence suggests that isolated PE should be recognised as a separate clinical phenotype. The diagnosis of isolated PE may indicate the presence of cardiovascular disease and long-term risk of arterial thrombosis. Randomised controlled trials are needed to determine whether alternative treatment regimens may be beneficial for this common patient subgroup.

### Emergency evaluation for pulmonary embolism, part 2: diagnostic approach [^115cfMiL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In part 1 of this two-part review, we discussed which risk factors, historical features, and physical findings increase risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) in symptomatic emergency department (ED) patients.

Objectives

Use published evidence to describe criteria that a reasonable and prudent clinician can use to initiate and guide the process of excluding and diagnosing PE.

Discussion

The careful and diligent emergency physician can use clinical criteria to safely obviate a formal evaluation of PE, including the use of gestalt reasoning and the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC rule, Table 2, part 1). We present published clinical and radiographic features of patients with PE who eluded diagnosis in the ED. D-dimer can be used to exclude PE in many patients, and employing age-based adjustments to the threshold to define an abnormal value can further reduce patient exposure to pulmonary vascular imaging. Moreover, we discuss benefits, limitations, and potential harms of computed tomographic pulmonary vascular imaging relevant to patients and the practice of emergency care. We present algorithms to guide exclusion and diagnosis of PE in patients with suspected PE, including those who are pregnant.

Conclusions

Reasonable and prudent emergency clinicians can exclude PE in symptomatic ED patients on clinical grounds alone in many patients, and many more can have PE ruled out by use of the D-dimer.

### How I diagnose acute pulmonary embolism [^117Jd6ps]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently considered in patients presenting to the emergency department or when hospitalized. Since symptoms are a-specific and the consequences of anticoagulant treatment are considerable, objective tests to either establish or refute the diagnosis have become a standard of care. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), which has replaced pulmonary angiography as first-line imaging test, is associated with radiation exposure, several complications resulting from contrast dye administration, and over diagnosis. Importantly, CTPA can be avoided in 20% to 30% of patients who present with a first or recurrent episode of clinically suspected acute PE by using a standardized algorithm. This algorithm should always include a clinical decision rule to assess the likelihood that PE is present, followed by a D-dimer blood test and/or CTPA. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians this practical diagnostic management approach using evidence from the literature.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^116W1esb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — high pretest probability: For patients with high pretest probability of PE according to either clinician gestalt or a clinical prediction tool, imaging studies should be performed. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred method of diagnosis when it is available and there is no contraindication to radiographic contrast dye. Ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning should be used when CTPA is unavailable or contraindicated. Of note, a D-dimer assay should not be obtained in patients with a high pretest probability of PE because a negative value will not obviate the need for imaging.

Suspected pulmonary embolism — diagnostic approach and risk stratification: CTA using PE protocol is the diagnostic modality of choice in stable patients, and ventilation-perfusion scanning is a second-line alternative in the acute setting; use of clinical prediction rules to select patients for imaging can decrease radiation exposure and cost. Troponin and brain natriuretic peptide can be elevated, echocardiography may reveal acute right ventricular strain consequent to large PEs, and both biomarkers are markers for higher mortality rate. Recognition of PE is important because prompt anticoagulation improves outcomes; clinical assessment combined with pretest risk stratification can help select patients appropriate for diagnostic imaging, and in the absence of shock, diagnostic evaluation depends on the clinical assessment of pretest probability. D-dimers are highly sensitive but not very specific for the diagnosis of PE in emergency department (ED) patients; measurement of D-dimers using age- and sex-specific cutoffs may be useful in patients at low to intermediate pretest probability, those with negative D-dimers can probably be discharged without further testing, whereas those with positive values should be considered for CTA. The incidence of PE is estimated at 65 cases per 100000, one-third of deaths are sudden and 60% are undiagnosed before death, dyspnea followed by chest pain is the most common presenting symptom, and signs of deep venous thrombosis may be present on examination.

### Prevalence of and eligibility for surveillance without anticoagulation among adults with lower-risk acute subsegmental pulmonary embolism [^113ZpXWf]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How prevalent is structured surveillance without anticoagulation for subsegmental pulmonary embolism in community practice, and what proportion of patients are surveillance eligible using modified American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) criteria?

Findings

In this cohort study of 666 outpatients examined over 5 years after publication of the 2016 CHEST guideline, only 1 patient (< 1%) with subsegmental pulmonary embolism underwent surveillance without anticoagulation in a community setting with excellent follow-up access. Using modified CHEST criteria, 35 patients (5%) with subsegmental pulmonary embolism were surveillance eligible.

Meaning

These findings suggest that only a small proportion of patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism may be surveillance eligible, and structured surveillance is rarely used despite the CHEST guideline.

### Blood clots&risk of permanent work-related disability… [^116qqGwi]. archive.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

This study is the first of its kind to document a relationship between VTE and subsequent work-related disability. This indicates that the economic burden of blood clots goes well beyond costs to the healthcare system; the loss of economic output of people who are unable to work due to complications of blot clots is also a substantial economic cost of VTE. About this Study CDC collaborated on a study of 66, 005 individuals aged 20–65 years who had participated in two previous Norwegian studies, the Tromso Study and the Nord-Trondelag Health Study, which looked at each participant's risk of a first-time VTE during 1994–2008. The new study looked at whether or not participants who previously developed a first-time VTE subsequently received a disability pension due to work-related disability.

Participants with a VTE in the study had either a deep vein thrombosis, a pulmonary embolism, or both DVT and PE. The following categories of participants with blood clots were examined for their risk of developing a work-related disability:

- **VTE**: Includes participants with DVT alone, PE alone, or both DVT and PE
- **DVT**: Includes participants with DVT alone
- **PE**: Includes participants with PE alone or both DVT and PE This study, published in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, used data collected for the Tromso and HUNT studies, including data from physical examinations, blood samples, and questionnaires filled out by the participants. We invite you to read the scientific summary of the study here. Main Findings from this Study
- Participants with unprovoked VTE had 52% higher risk of work-related disability than those without VTE.
- DVT was related to developing a disability. Patients with DVT had an 80% higher risk of work-related disability than those without DVT.
- Participants with PE did not have a higher risk of work-related disability compared to those without PE.

### Venothromboembolic signs and medical eponyms: part I [^1177oUxR]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Eponyms are honorific terms ascribed to individuals who discovered a sign, test, syndrome, technique, or instrument. Despite some contentions, eponyms continue to be widely ingrained and incorporated into the medical literature and contemporary language. Physical signs are considered unreliable methods alone for detecting deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The accuracy of the majority of these signs is unknown. For those signs that have been studied, there are a number of methodological limitations hindering the ability to draw meaningful conclusions about their accuracy and validity in clinical practice. Nevertheless, some findings when present and used in conjunction with other key signs, symptoms, and aspects of the patients history may be useful in further supporting the clinical suspicion and likelihood of DVT and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) or venothromboembolism (VTE). These signs also provide the means to better recognize the relationship between clinical findings and VTE. The acquisition of historical knowledge about these signs is important as it further enhances our understanding and appreciation of the diagnostic acumen that physicians were required to employ and to diagnose VTE prior to the advent of advanced imaging methods. Described in this paper is a brief overview of thrombosis as enumerated by Rudolf Virchow, and eponymous signs described in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

### The prevalence of clinically relevant incidental findings on chest computed tomographic angiograms ordered to diagnose pulmonary embolism… [^115whr7i]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

In a cross-sectional study, we reviewed 589 pulmonary CTAs that were ordered in the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital. We measured the prevalence of PE and placed other findings into the following 3 categories: findings that provided potential alternative explanations for acute symptoms, incidental findings that required clinical or radiologic follow-up, and other findings that required less urgent or no follow-up. We reviewed all newly diagnosed pulmonary nodules and significant thoracic adenopathy and determined standard recommended clinical follow-up. Conclusions The CTAs that are ordered in the emergency department are more than twice as likely to find an incidental pulmonary nodule or adenopathy than a PE. Systematic approaches should be developed to help primary care physicians contend with a growing number of clinically relevant incidental radiologic findings.

We reviewed the results of 589 CTAs that were ordered in the ED of a tertiary care medical center and compared the number of tests that were positive for PE with the number that had clinically relevant incidental findings requiring clinical or radiographic follow-up. We used a cross-sectional study design to characterize PE and non-PE findings on CTAs. The protocol entailed review of existing medical records with minimal risk to patients, so the requirement of informed written consent was waived after review by the institutional review board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. None of the 24 patients who had a negative D-dimer test result had findings consistent with PE. Findings of PE and radiographic findings supporting potential alternative diagnoses are shown in Table 1. Fifty-five of the CTAs were positive for PE. Four hundred seventy-eight patients had findings other than PE.

Only 4 patients required no follow-up because they were nonsmokers and their nodules were smaller than 4 mm in diameter. Among our sample of CTAs that were ordered to rule out PE in the ED, 24% had incidental findings that required radiographic or clinical follow-up; most of the findings were pulmonary nodules and adenopathy. In fact, the likelihood of finding a new incidental nodule or adenopathy was twice that of finding a PE. Our positive PE rate of 9% on CTAs is similar to rates reported in observational studies at other North American centers. 21, 22 However, it is much lower than that found in the PIOPED II trial. 23 The PIOPED II trial involved a highly selected population, enrolling only 824 of 7284 patients who had suspected PE.

### Pulmonary embolism [^116C7PxD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains one of the most challenging medical diseases in the emergency department. PE is a potentially life threatening diagnosis that is seen in patients with chest pain and/or dyspnea but can span the clinical spectrum of medical presentations. In addition, it does not have any particular clinical feature, laboratory test, or diagnostic modality that can independently and confidently exclude its possibility. This article offers a review of PE in the emergency department. It emphasizes the appropriate determination of pretest probability, the approach to diagnosis and management, and special considerations related to pregnancy and radiation exposure.

Objective

The purpose of this essay is to highlight the clinical features and imaging findings associated with different types of nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism.

Conclusion

Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism is an infrequent condition with various causes that can be life-threatening pathologic conditions. The entity presents a diagnostic challenge because of the low specificity of clinical symptoms and imaging signs. Awareness of the imaging features of nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism facilitates correct diagnosis and leads to appropriate patient care.

### Acute pulmonary embolism. part 1: epidemiology and diagnosis [^111RpMz2]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a frequently occurring, acute, and potentially fatal condition. Numerous risk factors for PE, both inherited and acquired, have been identified. Adequate diagnosis is mandatory to prevent PE-related morbidity and mortality on the one hand, and unnecessary treatment on the other. Only around 1 in 5 individuals with suspected PE will have the diagnosis confirmed, therefore, the diagnostic work-up for PE should comprise safe, efficient, and noninvasive methods. The first step in the approach to diagnosis of patients with suspected PE is to determine the clinical probability and to perform a D-dimer test. PE can be excluded in patients with a 'low', 'intermediate' or 'unlikely' clinical probability and a normal D-dimer test. Additional imaging is required for those with a 'high' or 'likely' clinical probability or a positive D-dimer test. CT pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, followed by additional testing is the next step when test results are nondiagnostic. Although various diagnostic strategies have been introduced and validated, selected patients may require a tailored approach.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a review [^116wmKo1]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is characterized by occlusion of blood flow in a pulmonary artery, typically due to a thrombus that travels from a vein in a lower limb. The incidence of PE is approximately 60 to 120 per 100 000 people per year. Approximately 60 000 to 100 000 patients die from PE each year in the US.

Observations

PE should be considered in patients presenting with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncope. The diagnosis is determined by chest imaging. In patients with a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, the following 3 steps can be used to evaluate a patient with possible PE: assessment of the clinical probability of PE, D-dimer testing if indicated, and chest imaging if indicated. The clinical probability of PE can be assessed using a structured score or using clinical gestalt. In patients with a probability of PE that is less than 15%, the presence of 8 clinical characteristics (age < 50 years, heart rate < 100/min, an oxygen saturation level of > 94%, no recent surgery or trauma, no prior venous thromboembolism event, no hemoptysis, no unilateral leg swelling, and no estrogen use) identifies patients at very low risk of PE in whom no further testing is needed. In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, a D-dimer level of less than 500 ng/mL is associated with a posttest probability of PE less than 1.85%. In these patients, PE can be excluded without chest imaging. A further refinement of D-dimer threshold is possible in patients aged 50 years and older, and in patients with a low likelihood of PE. Patients with a high probability of PE (ie, > 40% probability) should undergo chest imaging, and D-dimer testing is not necessary. In patients with PE and a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, compared with heparin combined with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin followed by warfarin alone, direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, are noninferior for treating PE and have a 0.6% lower rate of bleeding. In patients with PE and systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg, systemic thrombolysis is recommended and is associated with an 1.6% absolute reduction of mortality (from 3.9% to 2.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, PE affects approximately 370 000 patients per year and may cause approximately 60 000 to 100 000 deaths per year. First-line therapy consists of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, with thrombolysis reserved for patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg.

Non-thrombotic PE does not represent a distinct clinical syndrome. It may be due to a variety of embolic materials and result in a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, making the diagnosis difficult. With the exception of severe air and fat embolism, the haemodynamic consequences of non-thrombotic emboli are usually mild. Treatment is mostly supportive but may differ according to the type of embolic material and clinical severity.

### Emergency evaluation for pulmonary embolism, part 1: clinical factors that increase risk [^113wQsRn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be fatal, but profligate testing for PE can harm patients.

Objectives

With consideration of potential medicolegal implications, this two-part review provides current evidence about the care of patients with suspected and diagnosed PE in the emergency department (ED) setting.

Discussion

In part 1, we review published evidence to describe the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation of PE in the ED setting. Older age, surgery requiring endotracheal intubation within the past 30 days, new use of oral contraceptives, and prior unprovoked venous thromboembolism in nonanticoagulated patients are clear risk factors for PE in ED patients. Recent history of unexplained dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis increase probability, but the effect of syncope is less clear. Treated and inactive cancer, smoking, obesity, and pregnancy have not been found to increase the probability of PE in symptomatic ED patients. Unexplained dyspnea, tachycardia, and a low pulse oximetry reading increase probability of PE. Finding of wheezing on lung auscultation reduces the probability of PE, and findings that suggest deep venous thrombosis increase the probability of PE.

Conclusions

Understanding of risk factors, historical data, and physical findings that have been found to increase or decrease the probability of PE in symptomatic ED patients can help create rational guidelines for the diagnostic approach to PE.

### Pulmonary embolism [^115V5a3a]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common illness that can cause death and disability. It is difficult to detect because patients present with a wide array of symptoms and signs. The clinical setting can raise suspicion, and certain inherited and acquired risk factors predispose susceptible individuals. D-dimer concentration in blood is the best laboratory screening test, and chest CT has become the most widespread imaging test. Treatment requires rapid and accurate risk stratification before haemodynamic decompensation and the development of cardiogenic shock. Anticoagulation is the foundation of therapy. Right-ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography and higher than normal concentrations of troponin identify high-risk patients who might need escalation of therapy with thrombolysis or embolectomy even if the blood pressure is normal on presentation. When patients are admitted to medical wards or when patients undergo surgery, their physicians should prescribe prophylactic measures to prevent PE. After hospital discharge, prophylaxis should continue for about a month for patients at high risk of thromboembolism.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected pulmonary embolism: 2022 update [^115yzD9T]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a common and important clinical condition that cannot be accurately diagnosed on the basis of signs, symptoms, and history alone. The diagnosis of PE has been facilitated by technical advancements and multidetector CT pulmonary angiography, which is the major diagnostic modality currently used. Ventilation and perfusion scans remain largely accurate and useful in certain settings. MR angiography can be useful in some clinical scenarios and lower-extremity ultrasound can substitute by demonstrating deep vein thrombosis; however, if negative, further studies to exclude PE are indicated. In all cases, correlation with the clinical status, particularly with risk factors, improves not only the accuracy of diagnostic imaging but also overall utilization. Other diagnostic tests have limited roles. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Assessment of the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria rule for evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^117Lsgxx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Overuse of resources when evaluating pulmonary embolism (PE) is a concern if the D-dimer assay is improperly used in the evaluation of emergency department patients with suspected PE. The pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) rule was derived to prevent unnecessary diagnostic testing in this patient population. The objective of this study was to assess the PERC rule's performance in an external population.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of a prospectively collected database comparing PERC rule variables to diagnosis of PE in consecutive patients with suspicion for PE. Bivariate analysis on individual variables and the overall accuracy of the PERC rule were performed.

Results

Patients on 120 randomly assigned shifts were enrolled with a PE prevalence of 12%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values of the PERC rule were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 79%-100%), 16% (95% CI, 10%-24%), 14% (95% CI, 8%-14%), and 100% (95% CI, 80%-100%), respectively, for the total patient population, and 100% (95% CI, 25%-100%), 33% (95% CI, 12%-35%), 2% (95% CI, 0%-11%), and 100% (95% CI, 75%-100%), respectively, for the low pretest probability population. Bivariate analysis showed unilateral leg swelling, recent surgery, and a history of venous thromboembolic event to be predictive of the diagnosis of PE.

Conclusions

The PERC rule may identify a cohort of patients with suspected PE for whom diagnostic testing beyond history and physical examination is not indicated.

### The interobserver reliability of pretest probability assessment in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism [^113TBaLz]. Thrombosis Research (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pretest probability assessment and objective testing are combined to appropriately manage patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the interobserver reliability of pretest probability assessment has not been investigated. We sought to determine (for patients with suspected PE) the interobserver reliability of pretest probability assessment (by overall impression (gestalt) versus an explicit clinical model).

Materials and Methods

A prospective cohort study was conducted at an urban university hospital. For patients referred for ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) scanning for suspected PE, structured assessments (11 history and 4 physical examination parameters) were performed by a referring physician and a designated thrombosis physician. The referring and thrombosis physicians also assigned a pretest probability for PE (low, moderate, or high) by gestalt. An explicit seven-point clinical model for suspected PE was later applied to each structured assessment to determine the pretest probability. Assessments were performed independently and prior to diagnostic test results. Interobserver reliability (two rater unweighted Kappa (kappa) statistic) was determined for each parameter on the structured assessment and the pretest probability assessments (gestalt vs. explicit clinical model).

Results

One hundred and ten patients with suspected PE received duplicate assessments. Historical features demonstrated substantial to almost perfect interobserver reliability (kappa = 0.60–0.95). For the physical findings, only heart rate had substantial interobserver reliability (kappa = 0.60). Pretest probability assessment was not reliable when using physician's gestalt (kappa = 0.33), but produced substantial interobserver reliability using the explicit clinical model (kappa = 0.62).

Conclusions

Given the inadequate interobserver reliability of pretest probability assessment by overall impression (or gestalt), physicians should use explicit clinical models in the diagnostic management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.

### Current approach to the diagnosis of acute nonmassive pulmonary embolism [^1172XN7R]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially lethal disease. Given the variable presentation and associated morbidity of this condition, an accurate and efficient diagnostic algorithm is required. Clinical pretest probability serves as the root of any diagnostic approach. We, thus, review several clinical decision rules that may help standardize this determination. Using a review of the literature, the accuracy, predictive values, and likelihood ratios for several diagnostic tests are described. The combination of these tests, based on the pretest probability of disease, can be used in a Bayesian fashion to make accurate treatment decisions. A completely noninvasive diagnostic algorithm for patients presenting with suspected acute pulmonary embolism is proposed.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — intermediate pretest probability: For patients at intermediate risk for PE, D-dimer testing is warranted. As for patients at low pretest probability, a normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; no imaging studies are indicated, and an elevated plasma D-dimer level should prompt imaging studies.

Timely diagnosis is crucial, but challenging, as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is unspecific and easily mistaken for other common medical emergencies. Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer measurement allow stratification of patients into groups of expected prevalence and are key elements in adequate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging; however, the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple proposed prediction rules, when to measure D-dimer, and which cutoff to apply might be elusive to a significant proportion of physicians. 13 international guidelines authored by medical societies or expert author groups provide recommendations on facets of the diagnostic investigations in suspected pulmonary embolism, some of which are hallmarked by pronounced heterogeneity. This Review summarises key recommendations of each guideline, considers the most recent evidence on the topic, compares guideline recommendations on each facet of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and provides a synthesis on the most common recommendations.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism [^113xn5sB]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is complicated by its heterogeneous clinical presentation. Current diagnostic algorithms, combining clinical probability estimation with D-dimer testing and imaging tests, are very safe to exclude PE, although at costs of high numbers of CT-examinations. In view of cost- and time-saving as well as safety issues, several attempts have recently been undertaken to reduce the number of required imaging tests. Especially the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has greatly improved the potential for non-invasive exclusion of PE. Once the diagnosis of PE is established, immediate initiation of anticoagulant therapy is of vital importance. A new generation of direct oral anticoagulants, which overcomes the main disadvantages of conventional vitamin-K antagonists, has recently emerged. Risk stratification of hemodynamically stable PE patients with use of clinical decision rules, cardiac biomarkers or imaging tests, aids physicians in determining the most appropriate treatment approach for the individual patient. This is essential to differentiate patients at low risk of adverse outcome, who may be safely treated at home, from intermediate-risk patients, who require closer monitoring and for whom recent studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of systemic thrombolytic therapy. This article reviews recent advances and challenges that remain in the diagnostic work-up and initial management of acute, clinically stable PE.

### Physical examination findings in deep venous thrombosis [^111zkbGL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

DVT is a potentially serious disease and can serve as a marker for PE, an entity with even higher morbidity. Thus, it is critically important that emergency physicians consider this diagnosis in patients who present with suspicious symptoms. Recognition of alternative conditions, such as compartment syndrome, septic arthritis, and cellulitis, is also important for optimal care. Because physical examination is only 30% accurate for DVT, it serves to increase clinical suspicion in patients at risk but cannot be used to eliminate the possibility of thromboembolic disease. Because of this limitation, the diagnosis of DVT should be pursued using adjunctive testing in any patient with unexplained limb pain or swelling. Duplex sonography is currently the initial diagnostic study of choice for evaluation of DVT and, if test results are negative, it should be repeated serially if the clinical suspicion is high.

### Pulmonary embolism [^113gaDHB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

PE is one of the great challenges in medicine. It is a disease that carries with it a high mortality rate, yet no historical piece of information, physical examination finding, or diagnostic modality is perfect at excluding its possibility. Emergency physicians must be vigilant about considering PE in the differential diagnosis of a variety of presenting complaints and must use a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic options as they manage patients with suspected or confirmed PE. The diagnostic options range from bedside diagnostic tests to highly specialized imaging available at only specialized institutions. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each of the diagnostic modalities assists the physician in employing the best test. Therapeutic options also vary widely and include anticoagulation, vena caval interruption, systemic thrombolysis, embolectomy, and other therapeutic adjuncts, such as ECMO and inhaled nitric oxide. Similarly, awareness of the indications and contraindications to the varied therapeutic agents ensures appropriate therapy when the diagnosis is made.

### Diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism: a prediction model based on a patient data meta-analysis [^117NXgcK]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The diagnostic management of pulmonary embolism (PE) is a challenge faced by physicians in emergency rooms, outpatient clinics, and hospital wards, because signs and symptoms of PE are non-specific. The threshold to refer patients for (further) testing is usually low, since the consequences of a missed PE diagnosis can be serious and potentially fatal. PE can be confirmed or ruled out with sensitive and specific imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scanning.

The use of a diagnostic algorithm based on a clinical decision rule, consisting of medical history and physical examination findings, combined with D-dimer testing is recommended in patients with clinically suspected PE to exclude the disease and thereby reduce the need for CT scans. This is important since imaging results in radiation exposure, risk of contrast reactions or nephropathy, increased healthcare utilization and costs, overdiagnosis of small clots with uncertain relevance, and potential shortage of iodinated contrast material. In patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability and a D-dimer below a fixed or variable threshold, PE is considered excluded and imaging can be safely withheld. Nonetheless, up to 50% to 70% of patients with suspected PE with non-low clinical probability and elevated D-dimer levels are referred for imaging, and PE is not diagnosed in about 70% of those. Moreover, there are concerns about the generalizability of these algorithms given the differences in case-mix and PE prevalence across healthcare settings.

Thus far, the development of PE diagnostic scores has focused on simplicity, allowing the scores to be calculated at the bedside to rapidly decide which patients should be referred for D-dimer testing or directly for imaging. These scores are based on simple multivariable logistic regression models in which continuous variables were often categorized and potential interaction was ignored. Derivation of most PE diagnostic models also did not follow state-of-the-art methodological principles currently recommended including use of multiple imputation and internal-external validation. Finally, several diagnostic PE models include a subjective 'Gestalt' variable to indicate whether 'PE is the most likely diagnosis', which is difficult to standardize as it may vary depending on physician experience.

An alternative approach to the diagnostic management of suspected acute PE is to use a model which calculates an absolute PE probability for each patient, allowing the physician to make individualized management decisions, i.e. deciding whether imaging is required. Using a large individual patient dataset (IPD), we sought to derive and validate such a diagnostic model including objective clinical items and quantitative D-dimer testing.

### Diagnostic assessment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^112QVj5p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disorder that can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality through the clinical manifestations of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Although rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical in preventing PE, mortality and major morbidity due to conditions such as postthrombotic syndrome may complicate the differential diagnosis of VTE. The clinical symptoms associated with DVT are neither sensitive nor specific and can be indicative of a wide range of diagnoses. Because imaging studies can be expensive and are sometimes inconclusive, they should be used judiciously in patients with highly suspected VTE. This review offers a clinical perspective on the accurate, routine diagnosis of VTE, including an overview of common clinical signs and symptoms, as well as the advantages and drawbacks of available diagnostic strategies.

### Diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism [^1176dRcj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in the management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) have improved diagnostic accuracy and made management algorithms safer, easier to use, and well standardized. These diagnostic algorithms are mainly based on the assessment of clinical pretest probability, D-dimer measurement, and imaging tests-predominantly computed tomography pulmonary angiography. These diagnostic algorithms allow safe and cost-effective diagnosis for most patients with suspected PE. In this review, we summarize signs and symptoms of PE, current existing evidence for PE diagnosis, and focus on the challenge of diagnosing PE in special patient populations, such as pregnant women, or patients with a prior VTE. We also discuss novel imaging tests for PE diagnosis and highlight some of the additional challenges that might require adjustments to current diagnostic strategies, such as the reduced clinical suspicion threshold, resulting in a lower proportion of PE among suspected patients as well as the overdiagnosis of subsegmental PE.

### Diagnostic management of clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism [^114P8uCi]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Current diagnostic management of hemodynamically stable patients with clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) consists of the accurate and rapid distinction between the approximate 20–25% of patients who have acute PE and require anticoagulant treatment, and the overall majority of patients who do not have the disease in question. Clinical outcome studies have demonstrated that, using algorithms with sequential diagnostic tests, PE can be safely ruled out in patients with a clinical probability indicating PE to be unlikely and a normal D-dimer test result. This obviates the need for additional radiological imaging tests in 20–40% of patients. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the first line tool to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of PE in patients with a likely probability of PE or an elevated D-dimer blood concentration. While single-row-detector technology CTPA has a low sensitivity for PE and bilateral compression ultrasound (CUS) of the lower limbs is considered necessary to rule out PE, multi-row-detector CTPA is safe to exclude PE without the confirmatory use of CUS.

### Clinical manifestation of pulmonary embolism [^11363Sdr]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Results of prospective studies have shown that physicians' estimate of clinical likelihoods of PE have predictive value. The ability of clinicians to assess the factors that determine the probability of disease based on clinical manifestations such as history and signs and symptoms at presentation, and to make bedside estimates of that probability, has not been systematically studied. Data suggest that that this would be a fruitful area of future investigation. Susec et al noted that there has been a total of three studies (including their own) which have examined the clinical features such as risk factors, signs, and symptoms associated with PE in ambulatory outpatients. Hence, the data collected thus far might not be generalizable to the ED patient population. As with other illnesses, the ED patients usually present later and more atypically. The prevalence of PE could be lower among this population compared with hospitalized patients, causing a lower positive predictive value, derivable from the clinical features and risk factors at presentation. Finally, the ED patient population is usually healthier and younger than the hospitalized patients, and it is well recognized that PE can be clinically silent in young patients and that 28% have no associated risk factors. Based on their finding, the authors argue that clinical pathways to risk stratify patients in an ambulatory setting could be less useful than anticipated. The validity of these findings needs further investigation, however.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^112ymNHB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism imaging — Table 2 suggestions for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) specify the following actions using computed tomography (CT) and alternative tests. Immediate CT applies to patients who are "Hemodynamically unstable, with suspected PE" or have "High pretest probability of PE", with the basis that "Risks of inaction outweigh risks of CT" and that there is an "Incidence of PE 19%-28% even with a d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". Defer CT until after d-dimer result for "Intermediate pretest probability" or "Low pretest probability and PERC > 0", supported by "Low incidence of PE (< 1.1%) if d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". No CT or d-dimer test is suggested for "Low pretest probability and PERC = 0", given an "Incidence of PE < 1%". For patients with symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE, "Begin with lower-extremity venous ultrasonography", because "Similar treatment will be pursued without exposing the patient to the risks of radiation or intravenous contrast". A safety note states, "Hemodynamic instability may make transport for imaging problematic. Supportive measures or empirical anticoagulation until imaging can be obtained may be required".

Acute pulmonary embolism — overuse and harms: Well-validated decision rules have found that the risk for PE in patients who do not meet their criteria for additional testing is very low, and despite a significant increase in diagnoses of PE, mortality has remained unchanged, suggesting that we are overdiagnosing PE that are not clinically significant. Harms of imaging include radiation exposure, contrast-induced nephropathy and contrast allergy, cost, overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment with anticoagulants, and detection and work-up of incidental findings.

Pulmonary embolism workup — D-dimer is used in suspected pulmonary embolism; its sensitivity is much greater than specificity and positive predictive value is poor, so its primary value is rapid identification of patients with low probability of pulmonary embolism in outpatient settings, while its negative predictive value is poor in hospitalized patients, especially after several days or in patients older than 60 years of age.

### Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy [^117PPDHp]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a significant cause of obstetric morbidity and mortality. However, overdiagnosis related to excessive use of diagnostic testing is also associated with long-term major health issues, including impact on future pregnancies and subsequent health care. Accurate diagnosis of PE depends on the knowledge of prevalence of PE in the pregnant population, the a priori probability of a PE based on specific findings in a given patient, and understanding of the accuracy of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), the dominant diagnostic modality employed for this diagnosis. Venous thromboembolism is widely considered to be more common in pregnancy. However, this term includes both deep venous thrombosis as well as PE. While the former appears to be more common, published data on the prevalence of PE in pregnancy show little or no increase relative to the general population. Given the published data on the sensitivity and specificity of CTPA, a positive reading is more likely to be a false positive unless the probability of a PE in a given patient is at least 5% (a 200-fold increase from baseline). Doubling the probability to 10% (a 400-fold increase) only improves the positive predictive value to approximately 67%. Strategies to refine the a priori probability of a PE in a given patient are detailed, including scoring systems and D-dimer measurements. A careful history and physical examination and thoughtful development of a differential diagnosis are key elements of clinical practice and should include both the likelihood of each possible diagnosis and the accuracy of diagnostic modalities. This approach should precede the application of a given algorithm. Such a structured approach can decrease utilization and limit false positive diagnoses without increasing morbidity or mortality. KEY POINTS: · Incidence of PE is lower than assumed. · Incidence is critical for assessing predictive value of a test. · Computed tomography angiography is likely overused in pregnancy. · Clinical scoring and D-dimer have a role in PE diagnosis.

### Critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected pulmonary embolism [^116mDptP]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is the revision of a 2003 clinical policy on the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).(1) A writing subcommittee reviewed the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians answer the following critical questions: (1) Do objective criteria provide improved risk stratification over gestalt clinical assessment in the evaluation of patients with possible PE? (2) What is the utility of the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) in the evaluation of patients with suspected PE? (3)What is the role of quantitative D-dimer testing in the exclusion of PE? (4) What is the role of computed tomography pulmonary angiogram of the chest as the sole diagnostic test in the exclusion of PE? (5) What is the role of venous imaging in the evaluation of patients with suspected PE? (6) What are the indications for thrombolytic therapy in patients with PE? Evidence was graded and recommendations were given based on the strength of the available data in the medical literature.

### Pulmonary embolism [^114XnYyJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pulmonary embolism:

- **Definition**: PE is defined as an occlusion of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches, most often caused by a thrombus originating from deep veins of the lower extremities. The clot blocks blood flow to the pulmonary circulation, leading to impaired oxygen exchange and potentially life-threatening hemodynamic instability.
- **Pathophysiology**: Most pulmonary emboli (70–80%) arise from thrombi in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis, though about 6% originate in the upper extremities. Thrombosis is promoted by Venous stasis, Endothelial injury, and Hypercoagulability-the classic Virchow triad. Risk factors include major surgery, trauma, immobility, cancer, estrogen therapy, pregnancy, and inherited thrombophilias. Hemodynamic compromise results from increased pulmonary vascular resistance, RV overload, reduced LV filling, and decreased cardiac output.
- **Epidemiology**: PE occurs in approximately 60–120 cases per 100,000 people per year, causing an estimated 60,000–100,000 deaths annually in the US. Incidence increases with age, from fewer than 50 per 100,000 in those younger than 50 to about 350 per 100,000 in people older than 75. Widespread use of CT pulmonary angiography has increased diagnosis, including detection of smaller, nonfatal emboli. In-hospital mortality is about 14%, and 90-day mortality approaches 20%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for PE include immobilization or recent surgery, previous history of DVT or PE, malignancy, and certain genetic conditions. Other factors such as HR > 100 bpm and the presence of hemoptysis can also increase the likelihood of PE according to the Wells' Criteria.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, PE can present with a variety of symptoms including acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachycardia, and syncope. Some patients may also present with hemoptysis or signs of DVT such as unilateral leg swelling. Severe cases can cause hypotension, right HF, or cardiac arrest. Complications can include RV dysfunction, arrhythmia, hemodynamic collapse, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of PE varies depending on patient's hemodynamic status, underlying disease, and the presence of RV dysfunction. Adverse events within 30 days of PE diagnosis, such as death, secondary cardiogenic shock, or recurrent VTE, occur in approximately 7.4% of patients. Long-term prognosis can be influenced by the cause of the PE, with idiopathic PE associated with a worse long-term survival compared to other causes.
