## Question

What are the most common causes of paresthesia in the upper extremities?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common causes of paresthesia in the upper extremities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and frame paresthesia in the upper limb. Then, I should identify the major etiologic categories and rank them by prevalence and clinical impact. Next, I will extract and verify the most common specific entities within each category, making sure I anchor on high-quality sources. After that, I should consider key mimics and differentials that can confound diagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized list and note diagnostic implications and limitations of the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Paresthesia in the upper extremity typically reflects abnormal sensory nerve function, often from compression, traction, ischemia, metabolic-toxic injury, or central-peripheral processing disorders; clinically, patients describe tingling, pins-and-needles, numbness, or dysesthesias in a neuroanatomically plausible distribution, which helps localize the lesion to nerve root, plexus, or peripheral nerve territories [^6d58e84a] [^e490ecbc].

> Next, I should review the major etiologic buckets. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure I capture the categories that consistently emerge in reviews and guidelines: compressive/entrapment neuropathies, cervical radiculopathy, brachial plexopathies including thoracic outlet syndrome, systemic or metabolic neuropathies, and less common entities such as vascular ischemia, medication-induced neuropathy, and central or neurocutaneous dysesthesias. This categorization aligns with contemporary reviews and primary care approaches to peripheral neuropathy and upper-extremity nerve disorders [^d49d45a8] [^e490ecbc] [^8d5d0664].

> I will now examine compressive/entrapment neuropathies, since these are repeatedly cited as the most common cause of upper-extremity paresthesias. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most prevalent entrapment neuropathy, with U.S. prevalence around 7.8% and incidence about 2.3 per 100 person-years; patients report paresthesias in the median nerve distribution, often nocturnal and provoked by wrist flexion, and symptoms can extend outside classic territories, which is clinically relevant for differential diagnosis [^0df4f57a] [^812040f1]. Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common compressive neuropathy, typically causing ulnar paresthesias in the ring and little fingers and intrinsic hand weakness; epidemiology is less precisely quantified but it is consistently ranked immediately after CTS in frequency across reviews and surgical series [^eca5fd0e] [^35bd60ad]. Let me verify other common sites: radial tunnel syndrome and pronator teres syndrome are recognized but less prevalent, and thoracic outlet syndrome, while often categorized separately, shares compressive mechanisms at the plexus level and can produce diffuse arm and hand paresthesias, particularly with overhead activities [^d49d45a8] [^8b0a38c4].

> Now, cervical radiculopathy. I should confirm how often paresthesia appears and whether it tracks dermatomally. Large surgical series and guidelines indicate that paresthesia accompanies arm pain in the vast majority of radiculopathy cases, but only about half follow a strict dermatomal pattern; the remainder are diffuse or nondermatomal, which complicates localization and mandates careful correlation with motor and reflex findings and, when needed, imaging or electrodiagnostics [^91292b60] [^570d782d]. Wait, let me verify the epidemiology: incidence estimates around 83 per 100,000 person-years with peak in the 40s–50s are cited in contemporary reviews, supporting its status as a leading cause of upper-extremity paresthesias in middle-aged adults [^703fc77b].

> Brachial plexopathies and thoracic outlet syndrome come next. I need to check the relative frequency and diagnostic uncertainty. Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is the most common TOS subtype but remains controversial due to lack of standardized objective criteria; nonetheless, it presents with positional arm and hand paresthesias, often nondermatomal and sometimes ulnar-predominant, and is linked to repetitive overhead or computer work and trauma or congenital bands/ribs, with diagnosis resting on history, provocative maneuvers, and exclusion of other causes [^94b7db94] [^8b0a38c4]. Neuralgic amyotrophy (Parsonage-Turner) is less common but important; it presents with acute severe shoulder/arm pain followed by weakness and paresthesias, often patchy and nondermatomal, and can follow viral illness, immunizations, or surgery, with MR neurography helping confirm the diagnosis when suspected [^53ad3709] [^f02ff20c].

> Systemic and metabolic neuropathies also contribute. Hold on, I should verify the pattern. Diabetic and other length-dependent polyneuropathies often start in the feet but can involve the hands, producing symmetric paresthesias; chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy frequently begins in the hands and feet and is a notable iatrogenic cause of upper-extremity paresthesias; and medication-induced neuropathies, including from fluoroquinolones and some antiretrovirals, can present with distal paresthesias and should be considered in the medication history [^e490ecbc] [^0dff89a7] [^20d455be] [^68de28bb]. I should double-check that these are indeed common in primary care cohorts; yes, diabetes and medication exposures are repeatedly emphasized in primary care neuropathy frameworks, supporting their clinical relevance even if exact prevalence in upper-extremity–predominant presentations varies [^e490ecbc].

> Less common but important causes include vascular ischemia and acute compartment syndromes. Acute limb ischemia of the upper extremity presents with pain and paresthesias and mandates urgent revascularization; paresthesias correlate with ischemia duration, though symptom severity does not perfectly predict complications, underscoring the need for rapid recognition and intervention [^33f5a8f2]. Exertional compartment syndrome, while rare in the upper limb, can cause diffuse paresthesias after strenuous activity and requires a high index of suspicion to avoid delayed fasciotomy and nerve injury [^93cb7895].

> But wait, what if the paresthesias are not purely organic? I need to ensure I consider functional or dysesthetic presentations. Dysesthesias can occur without identifiable structural disease and carry substantial psychosocial burden; they remain a diagnosis of exclusion after appropriate evaluation for organic causes and require a careful, empathetic approach to management [^8d5d0664]. Similarly, neurocutaneous dysesthesias and pruritic neuropathies can localize to the arms and reflect underlying nerve irritation or compression, reminding me to integrate dermatologic and neurologic perspectives when the story does not fit classic entrapment patterns [^8df49e8b].

> Next, I should review mimics and differentials that can confound the picture. Cervical radiculopathy, TOS, and median or ulnar entrapment can produce overlapping symptoms; distinguishing them relies on distribution, provocative maneuvers, and, when needed, electrodiagnostics and imaging, with ultrasound increasingly useful for dynamic assessment of entrapment sites and MRI or MR neurography valuable for plexus and root pathology or when ultrasound is limited by depth or operator factors [^6b332cbf] [^6327238d] [^458a843f]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse a multimodal approach; yes, contemporary reviews emphasize combining clinical examination with electrodiagnostics and selective imaging to resolve diagnostic uncertainty [^458a843f].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the hierarchy. The most common causes of upper-extremity paresthesias are compressive/entrapment neuropathies, led by carpal tunnel syndrome and followed by cubital tunnel syndrome, with other entrapments such as radial tunnel and pronator teres syndromes occurring less frequently; cervical radiculopathy is the next most common, especially in adults over 40; brachial plexopathies, including neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome and neuralgic amyotrophy, are less prevalent but clinically important; systemic and metabolic neuropathies, particularly diabetic and chemotherapy-induced, as well as medication-induced neuropathies, round out the common etiologies; vascular ischemia and compartment syndromes are rare but emergent causes that must not be missed [^0df4f57a] [^812040f1] [^eca5fd0e] [^91292b60] [^703fc77b] [^94b7db94] [^e490ecbc] [^0dff89a7] [^20d455be] [^33f5a8f2] [^93cb7895].

> Finally, I should translate this into diagnostic implications. Let me reconsider the first steps: a careful history mapping symptom distribution, nocturnal exacerbation, occupational or repetitive exposures, trauma, and medication use, followed by a focused neurologic exam including sensory, motor, and reflex testing and provocative maneuvers such as Phalen's, Tinel's, and Spurling's, will narrow the differential efficiently; electrodiagnostic studies help distinguish radiculopathy from peripheral entrapment, and ultrasound can visualize entrapment dynamically, while MRI or MR neurography is preferred for suspected root or plexus disease or when ultrasound is non-diagnostic; early identification of compressive etiologies enables timely conservative or surgical management and improves outcomes, whereas recognizing systemic or medication causes guides disease-specific therapy and drug modification [^d49d45a8] [^6327238d] [^458a843f] [^0df4f57a].

---

The most common causes of paresthesia in the upper extremities are **carpal tunnel syndrome** (median nerve compression at the wrist) [^0df4f57a] and **cubital tunnel syndrome** (ulnar nerve compression at the elbow) [^eca5fd0e], accounting for the majority of cases. Other frequent causes include **cervical radiculopathy** from degenerative disc disease or herniation [^91292b60], thoracic outlet syndrome [^8b0a38c4], and systemic neuropathies such as diabetes or vitamin B12 deficiency [^e490ecbc]. Less common causes include brachial plexopathies, medication-induced neuropathy (e.g. chemotherapy, fluoroquinolones) [^20d455be], and acute compartment syndrome [^93cb7895]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical evaluation**, electrodiagnostic studies, and imaging when indicated [^458a843f]; management is cause-specific, ranging from conservative measures to surgery for refractory cases [^812040f1].

## Compression neuropathies

Compression neuropathies are the **most common cause** of upper extremity paresthesia, resulting from nerve entrapment or compression at specific anatomical sites [^d49d45a8].

| **Condition** | **Nerve involved** | **Clinical features** | **Prevalence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) | Median nerve at the wrist | - Paresthesia in the thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring finger <br/> - Nighttime symptoms <br/> - Weakness of thenar muscles | Most common entrapment neuropathy; prevalence ~7.8% in adults [^0df4f57a] |
| Cubital tunnel syndrome | Ulnar nerve at the elbow | - Paresthesia in the little finger and ulnar half of the ring finger <br/> - Weakness of intrinsic hand muscles <br/> - Claw hand deformity | Second most common entrapment neuropathy [^eca5fd0e] |
| Radial tunnel syndrome | Radial nerve near the elbow | - Posterior forearm pain <br/> - Paresthesia in the dorsal hand <br/> - Weakness of wrist and finger extension | Less common than CTS and cubital tunnel syndrome [^notfound] |

---

## Cervical radiculopathy

Cervical radiculopathy results from **compression or irritation of cervical nerve roots**, often due to degenerative disc disease or herniation [^703fc77b]. It typically presents with neck pain radiating down the arm, paresthesia following a dermatomal distribution, and associated motor weakness or reflex changes [^91292b60]. The C6 and C7 nerve roots are most commonly affected, causing paresthesia in the thumb, index, and middle fingers [^9f44f73a].

---

## Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS)

TOS results from **compression of the neurovascular bundle** at the thoracic outlet, causing paresthesia, pain, and weakness in the upper extremity [^8b0a38c4]. Symptoms are often positional, worsened by overhead activities, and may involve all fingers, particularly the fourth and fifth, reflecting lower plexus involvement [^94b7db94].

---

## Systemic and metabolic neuropathies

Systemic conditions such as **diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, and hypothyroidism** can cause peripheral neuropathies presenting with paresthesia in the upper extremities [^e490ecbc]. These neuropathies are typically symmetric, distal, and associated with other systemic symptoms [^6d58e84a].

---

## Less common causes

- **Brachial plexopathies**: Traumatic or non-traumatic injuries to the brachial plexus can cause paresthesia, weakness, and sensory loss in the upper extremity [^0d3575e8].
- **Medication-induced neuropathy**: Certain medications, including chemotherapy agents and fluoroquinolones, can cause peripheral neuropathy with paresthesia [^20d455be] [^c8380f5f].
- **Acute compartment syndrome**: Rare but serious, causing severe pain, paresthesia, and compartmental pressure elevation, requiring emergent surgical intervention [^93cb7895].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the underlying cause of paresthesia:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history, physical examination, and neurological assessment [^d49d45a8].
- **Electrodiagnostic studies**: Nerve conduction studies and electromyography to differentiate between radiculopathy, plexopathy, and peripheral neuropathies [^458a843f].
- **Imaging**: MRI or ultrasound to visualize nerve entrapment, cervical spine pathology, or mass lesions [^6327238d].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Conservative management**: Activity modification, physical therapy, splinting, and medications (NSAIDs, neuropathic pain agents) [^d49d45a8].
- **Surgical intervention**: Indicated for refractory cases of compression neuropathies, cervical radiculopathy, or thoracic outlet syndrome [^65988eab].
- **Systemic treatment**: Addressing underlying metabolic or systemic conditions, medication adjustment, and supportive care [^e490ecbc].

---

Paresthesia in the upper extremities most commonly results from **compression neuropathies** (CTS, cubital tunnel syndrome), **cervical radiculopathy**, and **thoracic outlet syndrome**, with systemic neuropathies also contributing. Accurate diagnosis and targeted management — conservative or surgical — are essential for symptom relief and functional recovery [^812040f1].

### Venous thoracic outlet syndrome as a cause of intractable migraines [^6ec9c424]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) refers to the compression of the neurovascular bundle within the thoracic outlet. Cases are classified by primary etiology-arterial, neurogenic, or venous. In addition to the typical symptoms of arm swelling and paresthesias, headaches have been reported as a potential symptom of TOS. In this report, we describe a patient with debilitating migraines, which were consistently preceded by unilateral arm swelling. Resolution of symptoms occurred only after thoracic outlet decompression. Patients with migraines and concomitant swelling and/or paresthesias, especially related to provocative arm maneuvers, should be considered a possible atypical presentation of TOS and evaluated in more detail.

### High-frequency spinal cord stimulation at 10 kHz for the treatment of combined neck and arm pain: results from a prospective multicenter study [^a1c5033a]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Cervical spine disorders are common conditions that are frequently disabling and costly to treat. Some of the most common diagnoses in patients with chronic neck pain include cervical radiculopathy, discopathy, and spondylosis. Patients are typically managed with conservative care, including physiotherapy and exercise programs. Upon a lack of improvement with conservative care, interventional procedures such as epidural steroid injections, facet rhizotomies, or surgical procedures such as anterior cervical discectomy with or without fusion are employed. Other treatment options for axial neck pain include peripheral subcutaneous field stimulation or peripheral nerve field stimulation.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is currently indicated as an aid in the management of chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs. Benefits of SCS for the treatment of neck and/or upper limb pain were demonstrated in a limited number of prospective studies and in multiple case-series reports. However, the efficacy of traditional low-frequency SCS (LF-SCS) is challenged by the difficulty in obtaining sensory paresthesias in the axial neck region and the variability of the paresthesias that come with the inherent, dynamic neck and upper limb movements in the human body. This variability may result in excessive stimulation and patient discomfort or less than optimal stimulation and loss of efficacy, leading to explant of the devices in some cases.,

High-frequency SCS at 10 kHz (10-kHz SCS) does not elicit paresthesias, thereby eliminating the need to establish paresthesia mapping and coverage. Ten-kilohertz SCS also eliminates the risk of uncomfortable stimulation due to positional variation, which can compromise neck and upper limb pain relief with LF-SCS. Ten-kilohertz SCS was previously shown to provide pain relief and improve quality of life in a retrospective chart review of patients with upper or lower limb pain, but the number of patients with upper limb pain included in the analysis was low and the study also did not include patients with neck pain. The goal of this study is to prospectively assess the safety and effectiveness of 10-kHz SCS in the treatment of upper limb and neck pain. In addition to the safety and pain relief assessments, the study also reports data from overall quality of life assessments, patient satisfaction, and changes in opioid medication usage.

Cervical radiculopathy symptom mapping — results note that although the distribution of symptom provocation resembled the classic dermatomal maps, symptoms were frequently provoked outside the classic descriptions, and author conclusions state there was a distinct difference between the dynatomal and dermatomal maps; additionally, the critique of methodology reports that paresthesias in the arm from nerve root stimulation can be different than dermatomal maps in a significant percentage of patients, making it difficult to identify the level based on pain distribution, and in some patients it explains the nondermatomal distribution of pain.

- Changes in sensation and possible nerve damage (Peripheral Neuropathy): Damage to the nerves in arms, hands, legs, or feet can happen in people who take fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Talk with your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in your arms, hands, legs, or feet:

-pain

-burning

-tingling

-numbness

-weakness

Ciprofloxacin may need to be stopped to prevent permanent nerve damage.

- **Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)**: People who take ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolone medicines with the oral anti-diabetes medicine glyburide (Micronase®, Glynase®, Diabeta®, Glucovance®) can get low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) which can sometimes be severe. Tell your healthcare provider if you get low blood sugar with ciprofloxacin. Your antibiotic medicine may need to be changed.

- **Sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity)**: See " What should I avoid while taking ciprofloxacin? "

- **Joint Problems**: Increased chance of problems with joints and tissues around joints in children under 18 years old. Tell your child's healthcare provider if your child has any joint problems during or after treatment with ciprofloxacin.

The most common side effects of ciprofloxacin include:

- nausea

- headache

- diarrhea

- vomiting

- vaginal yeast infection

- changes in liver function tests

- pain or discomfort in the abdomen

These are not all the possible side effects of ciprofloxacin. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you, or that does not go away.

### Neurocutaneous disease: neurocutaneous dysesthesias [^8df49e8b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Dysesthesia is a generic term for a cutaneous symptom — such as pruritus, burning, tingling, stinging, anesthesia, hypoesthesia, tickling, crawling, cold sensation, or even pain — without a primary cutaneous condition in a well-defined location that is often caused by nerve trauma, impingement, or irritation. There are multiple types of dysesthesias depending on the body location and the nerves involved. While location, exact symptoms, and etiologies might vary, the underlying theme is that these conditions are of neurologic origin and have dermatologic consequences. For many of these conditions, the symptoms are localized to the skin, and patients frequently present to the dermatologist; it is important for dermatologists to be knowledgeable about these symptoms and their underlying causes. In part II of this continuing medical education review, the primary diagnoses associated with underlying cutaneous dysesthesias will be explored, including scalp dysesthesia, trigeminal trophic syndrome, meralgia paresthetica, notalgia paresthetica, and brachioradial pruritus. The typical demographics in terms of symptoms, location, and patient populations will be discussed in addition to the specific etiologies, workups, and possible treatment options.

### Eligibility criteria of participants in randomized controlled trials assessing conservative management of cervical radiculopathy: a systematic review [^33c0e4b4]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants in randomized control trials (RCTs) assessing conservative management for cervical radiculopathy (CR), to determine if any consensus exists within the literature.

Summary Of Background Data

A 2012 systematic review identified a lack of uniformity for the eligibility criteria of participants in RCTs evaluating conservative interventions for CR. Since then, a large number of RCTs have been published, signaling the need for an updated evaluation of this topic.

Materials and Methods

We electronically searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO from inception to June 15, 2022, to identify RCTs assessing conservative management of CR. Information extracted was analyzed to determine the level of homogeneity and/or heterogeneity of the inclusion and exclusion criteria across studies.

Results

Seventy-six RCTs met our inclusion criteria with 68 distinct trials identified. The inclusion of arm pain with or without another symptom (i.e. numbness, paresthesia, or weakness) was required in 69.12% of trials, 50% of trials required participants to exhibit neck symptoms, and 73.53% of studies required some form of clinical examination findings, but inconsistencies existed for the number and type of tests used. Furthermore, 41.18% of trials included imaging, with 33.82% of trials requiring magnetic resonance imaging findings. The most common exclusion criteria included were the presence of red flags and cervical myelopathy in 66.18% and 58.82% of trials, respectively.

Conclusions

Overall, there is still a lack of uniformity for the inclusion/exclusion criteria of trials assessing the conservative management of CR, with some improvements noted compared with the 2012 review. Based on the current literature assessing the diagnostic utility of clinical symptoms and confirmatory tests, we proposed inclusion criteria for trials assessing conservative interventions. Future research should aim to develop standardized classification criteria to improve consistency among studies.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome [^f7fdc72b]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compressive neuropathy of the upper extremity. As a result of median nerve compression, the patient reports pain, weakness, and paresthesias in the hand and digits. The etiology of this condition is multifactorial; anatomic, systemic, and occupational factors have all been implicated. The diagnosis is based on the patient history and physical examination and is confirmed by electrodiagnostic testing. Treatment methods range from observation and splinting, to cortisone injection and splinting, to surgical intervention. Both nonsurgical and surgical management provide symptom relief in most patients. The results of open and endoscopic surgery essentially are equivalent at 3 months; the superiority of one technique over the other has yet to be established.

### Manual therapy for cervical radiculopathy: effects on neck disability and pain – A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^703fc77b]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical radiculopathy (CR) is a clinical syndrome characterized by degenerative changes within the cervical intervertebral discs and pathological alterations in the surrounding tissues, leading to narrowing of the intervertebral foramina and subsequent compression or irritation of the exiting cervical nerve roots. This often manifests as pain, paresthesia, and other related neurological symptoms in the head, neck, and corresponding upper extremity dermatomes, with a close relationship to cervical posture and movement.

CR is a common neurological condition caused by nerve root compression due to degenerative changes, disc herniation, or foraminal stenosis. It often presents with neck pain, radiating arm pain, sensory disturbances, and motor deficits, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Epidemiological data suggest that CR affects approximately 83 per 100,000 individuals annually, with peak incidence occurring between ages 40 and 50 years and a lifetime prevalence of 3.5% in the general population. Given its high burden, identifying effective non-invasive treatment strategies is critical. The underlying cervical spinal pathologies, including disc herniation, osteophyte formation, and spinal canal stenosis, are widely recognized as common precipitating factors for nerve root compression or inflammation in CR. Notably, the natural history of CR is often self-limiting, with symptom resolution observed in the majority of patients. Nonetheless, appropriate and timely management of CR can effectively mitigate symptoms and prevent disease progression.

### Multimodality imaging of peripheral neuropathies of the upper limb and brachial plexus [^171c564e]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

The peripheral nerves of the upper limb are affected by a number of entrapment and compression neuropathies. These discrete syndromes involve the brachial plexus as well as the musculocutaneous, axillary, suprascapular, ulnar, radial, and median nerves. Clinical examination and electrophysiologic studies are the traditional mainstay of diagnostic work-up; however, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging provide spatial information regarding the affected nerve and its surroundings, often assisting in narrowing the differential diagnosis and guiding treatment. Imaging is particularly valuable in complex cases with discrepant nerve function test results. Familiarity with the clinical features of various peripheral neuropathies of the upper extremity, the relevant anatomy, and the most common sites and causes of nerve entrapment assists in diagnosis and treatment.

### Peripheral nerve entrapment and injury in the upper extremity [^8a1f64a4]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Peripheral nerve injury of the upper extremity commonly occurs in patients who participate in recreational (e.g., sports) and occupational activities. Nerve injury should be considered when a patient experiences pain, weakness, or paresthesias in the absence of a known bone, soft tissue, or vascular injury. The onset of symptoms may be acute or insidious. Nerve injury may mimic other common musculoskeletal disorders. For example, aching lateral elbow pain may be a symptom of lateral epicondylitis or radial tunnel syndrome; patients who have shoulder pain and weakness with overhead elevation may have a rotator cuff tear or a suprascapular nerve injury; and pain in the forearm that worsens with repetitive pronation activities may be from carpal tunnel syndrome or pronator syndrome. Specific history features are important, such as the type of activity that aggravates symptoms and the temporal relation of symptoms to activity (e.g., is there pain in the shoulder and neck every time the patient is hammering a nail, or just when hammering nails overhead?). Plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging are usually not necessary for initial evaluation of a suspected nerve injury. When pain or weakness is refractory to conservative therapy, further evaluation (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, electrodiagnostic testing) or surgical referral should be considered. Recovery of nerve function is more likely with a mild injury and a shorter duration of compression. Recovery is faster if the repetitive activities that exacerbate the injury can be decreased or ceased. Initial treatment for many nerve injuries is nonsurgical.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^02adc3f2]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This is the first SR on definitions and selection criteria for CR. Even though CR is often mentioned as a separate entity in the assessment of patients with neck pain, most studies use their own criteria to sub-classify patients with CR, making comparisons difficult.

One of our limitations was that we only included published RCTs. Relevant unpublished trials were not included, thus potentially leading to publication bias. However, if they exist, these studies are likely to be small and to increase heterogeneity and therefore are unlikely to change our results.

For the purpose of this review, we have chosen to exclude studies that only included surgical interventions, as surgical studies may possibly recruit a different group of patients to justify the need for an invasive treatment.

We recommend to aim for consensus on a definition of CR and selection criteria among experts in this area, preferably with criteria that are quantifiable with validated clinical tests. Data from two recent RCTs support the clinical finding that patients usually report experiencing more arm pain than neck pain. We therefore suggest defining CR as: "Radiating pain in the arm with motor, reflex and/or sensory changes (such as paraesthesiae or numbness), provoked by neck posture(s) and/or movement(s)". It is the researchers' intent to conduct a Delphi study on this definition among different international researchers and practitioners. We would suggest the following selection criteria: pain radiating into the arm and motor, reflex, and/or sensory changes in the upper limb such as paraesthesia or numbness.

Future research should aim at the validity of selection criteria.

### First international consensus on the diagnosis and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^747633ed]. Vascular Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Upper extremity fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) — in the US Registry, upper extremity FMD has been reported in 15.9% (10/63) of patients who underwent upper extremity imaging. It typically involves the brachial artery, although it has been reported in the subclavian, axillary, radial, and ulnar arteries. It is most commonly of the multifocal type with the majority of patients having both asymptomatic and bilateral involvement. Symptoms may include finger or hand ischemia (rest pain, discoloration, ulceration or gangrene) from thromboembolism or dissection and hand or arm claudication, with other manifestations including Raynaud's phenomenon, paresthesia, and rarely aneurysms. Brachial bruit and discrepant arm blood pressures are frequently identified on physical exam when brachial FMD is present.

### Peripheral nerve entrapment and injury in the upper extremity [^d49d45a8]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Peripheral nerves in the upper extremities are at risk of injury and entrapment because of their superficial nature and length. Injury can result from trauma, anatomic abnormalities, systemic disease, and entrapment. The extent of the injury can range from mild neurapraxia, in which the nerve experiences mild ischemia caused by compression, to severe neurotmesis, in which the nerve has full-thickness damage and full recovery may not occur. Most nerve injuries seen by family physicians will involve neurapraxia, resulting from entrapment along the anatomic course of the nerve. In the upper extremity, the brachial plexus branches into five peripheral nerves, three of which are commonly entrapped at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Patients with nerve injury typically present with pain, weakness, and paresthesia. A detailed history and physical examination alone are often enough to identify the injury or entrapment; advanced diagnostic testing with magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, or electrodiagnostic studies can help confirm the clinical diagnosis and is indicated if conservative management is ineffective. Initial treatment is conservative, with surgical options available for refractory injuries or entrapment caused by anatomic abnormality.

### Postprocedural brachial neuritis: clinical, electrodiagnostic, and neuroimaging features [^f02ff20c]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Brachial neuritis is a monophasic condition affecting the brachial plexus and its branches, manifesting as acute shoulder and upper arm pain, followed by weakness and paresthesias. It can be triggered by antecedent events, including procedures such as surgery. Misdiagnosis and delay in diagnosis are common. Imaging is important to confirm the diagnosis of postprocedural brachial neuritis and exclude other etiologies.

Materials and Methods

Clinical, electrodiagnostic, and neuroimaging features of patients with postprocedural brachial neuritis from a single quaternary care institution were identified and analyzed.

Results

Six patients (2 women) were identified with a median age of 62 (range 49–70) years. Antecedent procedures included 4 cervical spine surgeries, 1 rotator cuff repair, and 1 central venous catheter placement. Time to symptom onset ranged from 1 day to 2 weeks. The initial symptom for 5 of the 6 patients was severe upper extremity pain followed by weakness. All patients had electrodiagnostic tests and MR neurography consistent with brachial neuritis. MR neurogram showed plexus and/or terminal branch abnormalities with associated muscular denervation edema. The C5 or C6 root and/or upper trunk were always involved. The most common branches affected were the suprascapular, long thoracic, and axillary nerves. Hourglass constrictions (HGCs) of these nerves were seen in 3 of 6 patients. The average time to diagnosis was 3.4 (range 1.5–5) months.

Conclusions

Postprocedural brachial neuritis is an under-recognized cause of acute upper extremity pain and weakness. MR neurography can exclude iatrogenic causes and document the presence of HGCs in affected nerves. Diagnostic neuroradiologists should be aware of this clinical entity and associated neuroimaging findings.

### High-resolution ultrasound of clinically relevant sensory nerves of the arm and the forearm [^e9814810]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Relevance and General Scanning Recommendation

Patients with cutaneous sensory nerve disorders typically experience symptoms resulting from either loss of function (anesthesia) or irritation (paresthesia or stabbing pain) of the affected nerve. The distribution of sensory symptoms along an area supplied by specific nerve can help identify the source of the problem. However, in some cases, the syndromes may be harder to recognize, as major nerve trunks may be affected alongside minor cutaneous nerves (eg, in large penetrating lesions). Additionally, when the affected cutaneous nerve is a terminal branch of a mixed nerve, such as the musculocutaneous nerve, sensory alterations may be associated with atrophy of specific muscle groups.

US imaging can accurately localize the site of injury, assist in formulating a prognosis, and help plan surgical intervention. With recent advances in ultrasound transducer technology, high and very high‐frequency probes (24–33 MHz) are now available, enabling the detection of even subtle pathological changes along the course of millimetric and submillimetric nerves. Cutaneous sensory nerves may be affected by traumatic injuries, compressive syndromes, tumors (Figure 1), diffuse neuropathies (eg, dysimmune conditions), and infectious diseases (eg, leprosy).

Figure 1
Fifty‐year‐old patient complaining of shooting pain on the lateral aspect of the forearm during flexion of the elbow against resistance. Electroneurography of the upper limb turned out negative. Considering the distribution of pain, a systematic scanning of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm (LCNF) was performed. The image in A shows an axial view at the distal third of the arm. The LCNF (white arrowheads) is seen in the fascial plane between biceps and brachialis. More distally (image B) a round, regular, hypoechoic structure along the LCNF is demonstrated (white asterisk), in close proximity to the lateral side of the biceps tendon (outlined arrowheads). The axial image C obtained immediately distally to the mass shows the enlarged LCNF (with arrowheads), as commonly found in proximity to a nerve sheath tumor. The diagnosis of schwannoma was proposed and the mass removed. Outlined arrowhead in A: intramuscular aponeurosis of biceps; white arrow in A: median nerve; BA: brachial artery; outlined arrowheads in C: distal biceps tendon; BRad: brachioradialis.

### First rib resection in thoracic outlet syndrome [^65988eab]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Most patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) present with exercise-induced upper extremity paresthesia. Neurogenic TOS is the most common type where the brachial nerve plexus is compressed against a tight thoracic outlet. Vascular compromise although rare can result from thoracic outlet pressure against the subclavian artery or more commonly the subclavian vein. This article reviews the pathophysiology of TOS and describes several effective surgical interventions. Complete first rib resection with surgical decompression is an essential part of the treatment for TOS. First rib resection via supraclavicular or a preferred transaxillary route should be considered when conservative modalities provide no symptom improvement.

### Brachial plexopathies: classification, causes, and consequences [^0d3575e8]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

The brachial plexus, which is the most complex structure of the peripheral nervous system, supplies most of the upper extremity and shoulder. The high incidence of brachial plexopathies reflects its vulnerability to trauma and the tendency of disorders involving adjacent structures to affect it secondarily. The combination of anatomic, pathophysiologic, and neuromuscular knowledge with detailed clinical and ancillary study evaluations provides diagnostic and prognostic information that is important to clinical management. Since most brachial plexus disorders do not involve the entire brachial plexus but, rather, show a regional predilection, a regional approach to assessment of plexopathies is necessary.

### Description of clinical features and diagnoses of 444 cases with neck-shoulder-upper extremity pain: a single-center retrospective review [^e9a39669]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylotic radiculopathy was the most common type of cervical spondylosis. The classic clinical picture includes neck pain, paresthesia in the arms and hands in conjunction with diminished muscle tendon reflexes, sensory disturbances, and/or motor weakness. Clinically, Spurling's test is valuable when the patient has symptoms consistent with radiculopathy. Among the 67 patients with cervical radiculopathy, 36 (53.7%) had positive Spurling's test. Rubinstein et alreported that a calculation for Spurling's test yielded a sensitivity of 52.9% and specificity of 93.8%. Some authors proposed that the sensitivity of Spurling's test varied from moderate to high while its specificity was high.

Cervical spondylotic amyotrophy is characterized by upper limb muscle weakness and atrophy without sensory deficits. In this study, among 106 patients with cervical spondylosis, muscle weakness, atrophy, and absence of hypoesthesia in the upper extremities were observed in 15 patients. These patients will be analyzed in detail in the follow-up study.

Our study focused on a group of patients with neck, shoulder, or upper extremity pain whose etiology is complex and difficult to diagnose. These descriptions can serve as a reference for health professionals caring for patients with NSUEP, including rheumatologists, neurologists, and general practitioners, as well as orthopedic surgeons. A multicenter study with a large sample size is required in the future to further clarify the clinical features and disease spectrum of NSUEP.

There were several limitations in our study. First, there were no standardized procedures during the assessment of the patients and data collection. Second, this study was a single-center study, and the generalizability is limited. Third, the findings are unsuitable for generalizing other levels of health care.

### High-resolution ultrasound of clinically relevant sensory nerves of the arm and the forearm [^7e2bc9d5]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The superficial sensory nerves of the upper limb are prone to several pathological conditions that may lead to disabling and often difficult to diagnose syndromes. US should be considered as a first level diagnostic modality in cases of suspected neuropathies of the MCNA, MCNF, PCNF, and LCNF, as it may provide critical information on nerve status that is often missed by electrodiagnostic and MRI studies. However, performing high‐ and ultra‐high‐resolution ultrasound examinations requires advanced, high‐end equipment, which may limit the widespread adoption of this specialized imaging technique.

### Evaluation and management of the dysesthetic patient [^8d5d0664]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Dysesthesia is symptomatology that includes but is not limited to sensations of pain, burning, crawling, biting, numbness, piercing, pulling, cold, shock-like, pulling, wetness, and heat. These sensations can cause significant emotional distress and functional impairment in affected individuals. Although some cases of dysesthesia are secondary to organic etiologies, most cases exist without an identifiable infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic, or neoplastic process. Ongoing vigilance is required for concurrent or evolving processes, including paraneoplastic presentations. Elusive etiologies, unclear treatment regimens, and stigma leave patients and clinicians with a difficult path forward marked by "doctor shopping", lack of treatment, and significant psychosocial distress. We address this symptomatology and the psychosocial burden that often comes with it. Although notoriously labeled as "difficult to treat", dysesthesia patients can be effectively managed, making life-changing relief possible for patients.

### Topographical assessment of symptom resolution following open carpal tunnel release [^47cfa8bb]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome commonly present with paresthesias and pain extending into the small finger and proximal to the hand. This study was conducted to assess the ability of carpal tunnel release to relieve symptoms outside of the median nerve distribution.

Methods

We enrolled 34 consecutive surgical patients (40 wrists) diagnosed exclusively with carpal tunnel syndrome based on the history, physical examination, and electrodiagnostic studies. Preoperative symptoms were categorized as pain, numbness, tingling, or "burning and electrical shocks". The presence or absence of each symptom type was recorded in 5 topographical areas (zone I, palmar thumb/index/long; zone II, small finger; zone III, volar forearm; zone IV, volar arm; and zone V, dorsal hand/forearm/arm). Patients were contacted at 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively to assess resolution of each symptom type by topographic zone.

Results

Preoperatively, the cohort reported symptoms in all zones: zone I, 120 reports; zone II, 47 reports; zone III, 33 reports; zone IV, 7 reports; and zone V, 23 reports. Numbness (n = 40) and tingling (n = 38) were the most common symptoms, followed by pain (n = 29) and "burning/shocks" (n = 16). Postoperatively, the total number of reports within the 5 zones decreased from 230 to 20. The probability that surgery would eliminate patient symptoms was 88% (104 of 120) in zone I, 96% (45 of 47) in zone II, 97% (32 of 33) in zone III, 86% (6 of 7) in zone 4, and 100% (23 of 23) in zone V. Across zones, the overall probability of symptom resolution was as follows: pain > 80%, numbness/tingling > 85%, and "burning/shocks" > 90%.

Conclusions

Symptoms experienced outside of the median nerve distribution had a high likelihood of resolution after carpal tunnel release. Over 85% of symptoms in each of the anatomic zones studied resolved. Feelings of burning or shock-like sensations were most reliably relieved at early follow-up.

### Cervical radiculopathy, entrapment neuropathy, and thoracic outlet syndrome: how to differentiate? Invited submission from the joint section meeting on disorders of the spine and peripheral nerves, March 2004 [^6b332cbf]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2004). Low credibility.

The common diagnoses of cervical radiculopathy and upper-extremity entrapment neuropathies can at times be difficult to differentiate. Additionally, thoracic outlet syndrome is often diagnosed when, in fact, the problem is radiculopathy or neuropathy. Another source of confusion, especially in older patients, is neuralgic amyotrophy, brachial plexitis, or the Parsonage-Turner syndrome. The differential diagnosis of unilateral arm pain, weakness, and/or sensory loss includes all of these problems. The clinical and electrodiagnostic features of each are discussed as an aid to distinguishing between these common and similar entities.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome [^f3e43460]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy in the upper extremity. The condition is responsible for substantial annual costs to society, both in terms of lost productivity and the costs of treatment. Accurate diagnostic criteria, the selection of treatment strategies based on high-level evidence, and outcomes data have been inconsistent despite the prevalence of the condition. The increased awareness of the need for evidence-based practice guidelines has, however, yielded important data to guide treatment of CTS. Evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment have been developed and should direct the treatment of CTS.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^7f58f1d2]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical disc herniation (CDH) clinical localization — observational prognostic study: The stated objective was to correlate clinical findings with operative findings when a single cervical nerve root (C5, C6, C7, C8) is compressed by a CDH, with number of patients 100. The presence of pain in the arm corresponded to the site compression in 23% of cases, forearm pain or paresthesia corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 32% and 66%, respectively, hand pain and paresthesia corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 70% and 27%, respectively, and subjective weakness corresponded to a single level in 22/34 (79%) cases. Potential level was II with downgraded level II, and conclusions state that clinical findings related to the fingers are the most accurate for localizing a CDH to a single level, and that single level CDH may produce signs and symptoms that correspond to overlapping dermatomal levels.

### Pediatric and adolescent T-type distal humerus fractures [^a2369497]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Features

Patients most often present with pain and swelling around the elbow, preferring to hold the upper extremity in a semiextended position. The elbow may appear ecchymotic or deformed, similar to the appearance of a supracondylar humerus fracture. Refusal to move the arm is common, and many children will be unwilling to have the extremity ranged or examined.

While permanent nerve damage during the injury itself is not exceedingly common, a careful neurovascular examination is critical because these injuries tend to occur with higher energy mechanisms, as transient traction neurapraxia may be more common. Between 29% and 38% of pediatric and adolescent fractures present with paresthesias in the ulnar nerve distribution; about a fourth of these will also have intrinsic weakness in the hand. The presence of an ulnar nerve palsy may be more likely to appear when the medial epicondyle is fractured. Radial nerve injuries and brachial artery injuries have been reported but are extremely rare. Furthermore, a recent study highlighted a correlation between obesity and more complex pediatric elbow fracture patterns, such as the T-type, demonstrating that these patients also had higher pre- and post-operative nerve palsies.

### Evaluation and management of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome with an overview of surgical approaches: a comprehensive review [^8b0a38c4]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation

The clinical presentation of TOS varies depending on the type, ie NTOS vs VTOS vs ATOS. Especially within the NTOS population, the clinical presentation can be diverse. The presentation can range from mild discomfort that is exacerbated by certain upper extremity or neck positions to the more common description of pain, paresthesias and/or numbness in the fingers, hands, forearm, or arm on the affected side.

In general, NTOS occurs more frequently in women (3–4:1), and typically presents between the ages of 20–40 years. Furthermore, certain vocations such as violinists, jobs that involve significant computer usage in non-ergonomic positions, and assembly line workers appear vulnerable given the physical nature of their occupation. Another population at risk includes athletes incorporating repetitive overhead motions such as volleyball players, swimmers, pitchers, and weightlifters.

Symptoms and clinical features include a history of neck trauma, whiplash injury, or repetitive overhead motions, pain exacerbated with certain positions, and pain often consistent with nerve irritation including complaints of pain, paresthesias, and weakness in the arm and hand. In general, these symptoms can involve all five fingers, and can even occur in the entire upper extremity in a non-dermatomal pattern. The symptoms can be further subdivided based on the areas of possible dysfunction. This includes compression of the upper brachial plexus, which involves compression of the C5-C7 nerve roots, causing complaints of ipsilateral neck, trapezius, mastoid or anterior chest wall pain, or even occipital headaches. In contrast, compromise of the lower plexus, involving the C8-T1 nerve roots can result in symptoms around the posterior aspect of the shoulder, with radiculopathy down the arm in the ulnar distribution. Despite these specific subdivisions, patients often feel that the entire limb is affected without dermatomal preference, which contributes to the controversy and difficulty surrounding the diagnosis.

### Thoracic outlet syndrome: a review [^12cba31a]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a rare condition (1–3 per 100,000) caused by neurovascular compression at the thoracic outlet and presents with arm pain and swelling, arm fatigue, paresthesias, weakness, and discoloration of the hand. TOS can be classified as neurogenic, arterial, or venous based on the compressed structure(s). Patients develop TOS secondary to congenital abnormalities such as cervical ribs or fibrous bands originating from a cervical rib leading to an objectively verifiable form of TOS. However, the diagnosis of TOS is often made in the presence of symptoms with physical examination findings (disputed TOS). TOS is not a diagnosis of exclusion, and there should be evidence for a physical anomaly that can be corrected. In patients with an identifiable narrowing of the thoracic outlet and/or symptoms with a high probability of thoracic outlet neurovascular compression, diagnosis of TOS can be established through history, a physical examination maneuvers, and imaging. Neck trauma or repeated work stress can cause scalene muscle scaring or dislodging of a congenital cervical rib that can compress the brachial plexus. Nonsurgical treatment includes anti-inflammatory medication, weight loss, physical therapy/strengthening exercises, and botulinum toxin injections. The most common surgical treatments include brachial plexus decompression, neurolysis, and scalenotomy with or without first rib resection. Patients undergoing surgical treatment for TOS should be seen postoperatively to begin passive/assisted mobilization of the shoulder. By 8 weeks postoperatively, patients can begin resistance strength training. Surgical treatment complications include injury to the subclavian vessels potentially leading to exsanguination and death, brachial plexus injury, hemothorax, and pneumothorax. In this review, we outline the diagnostic tests and treatment options for TOS to better guide clinicians in recognizing and treating vascular TOS and objectively verifiable forms of neurogenic TOS.

### Shoulder pain and dysesthesia of the hand: a prospective evaluation of 1201 consecutive patients presenting for shoulder surgery [^9ed96ddd]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and severity of numbness and tingling in the hand in patients presenting with disorders of the shoulder. This study also aimed to explore the potential associations of diagnosis of shoulder disorder, age, sex, duration of shoulder symptoms, work cover status, shoulder pain, shoulder function, and side of affected shoulder with hand dysesthesia to begin understanding the pathophysiology of this symptomology.

Methods

This prospective cohort study was conducted at a single campus. The prevalence and severity of hand paresthesia and numbness were assessed using the modified Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire. Shoulder status and pain were assessed using the L'Insalata Shoulder Questionnaire. Posthoc, patients were grouped by their diagnosis confirmed at surgery. Multivariate regression analyses were used to identify significant factors associated with hand dysesthesia.

Results

A total of 1201 patients were included in the analysis. Twenty-two percent to 45% of patients reported hand paresthesia and numbness, mostly of slight to medium severity, even though their primary diagnosis was a disorder of the shoulder. Patients with adhesive capsulitis had the highest prevalence of hand paresthesia (45%) and numbness (40%) while patients undergoing anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty had the lowest prevalence of preoperative hand paresthesia (22%) and numbness (22%). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified pain at rest as the most significant factor associated with of hand paresthesia and numbness. With each increasing level of pain at rest, patients were 3 times more likely to report hand paresthesia (odds ratio [OR]: 3.00, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33–6.79) and numbness (OR: 3.02, 95% CI: 1.34–6.79). Patients with adhesive capsulitis were twice as likely to report hand numbness (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.01–2.49) compared to patients with other shoulder disorders. Patients with self-reported stiff shoulders were also 2 times more likely to report worse hand paresthesia (OR: 1.66, 95% CI 1.03–2.66). Younger age, deficit in shoulder, internal rotation strength, and range of motion were weak predictors of hand numbness and paresthesia.

Conclusion

Approximately one-third of patients with common shoulder disorders also reported paresthesia and numbness in the ipsilateral hand, mostly of slight to moderate severity. Patients with adhesive capsulitis, painful, stiff, and weaker shoulders were more likely to experience hand symptoms.

Technological advancements in ultrasound systems, particularly the development of high‐ and ultra‐high‐frequency transducers, now allow for the detailed evaluation of sub‐millimetric sensory nerves in the upper limb, extending to their distal branches. This provides invaluable insights in patients with suspected neuropathies. This review aims to outline the scanning techniques and normal ultrasound appearance of cutaneous nerves of the upper limbs, including the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm, medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm, lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm, and posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm. Furthermore, several cases of nerve pathologies where ultrasound has played a crucial role in accurate diagnosis and therapeutic management are presented.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the upper limb: a pictorial review [^8e4a4569]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Peripheral nerves of the upper limb may become entrapped at various points during their anatomical course. While physical examination and nerve conduction studies are the mainstay of diagnosis, there are multiple imaging options, specifically ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which offer important information about the potential cause and location of nerve entrapment that can help guide management. This article overviews the anatomical course of various upper limb nerves, including the long thoracic, spinal accessory, axillary, suprascapular, radial, median, ulnar, and musculocutaneous nerves, and describes the common locations and causes of entrapments for each of the nerves. Common ultrasound and MRI findings of nerve entrapments, direct or indirect, are described, and various examples of the more commonly observed cases of upper limb nerve entrapments are provided.

### Enigmatic and unusual cases of upper extremity pain: mislabeling as malingerers [^c5c0cb01]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

With the intricate anatomy of the hand and upper extremity, there are many possible etiologies of pain. In addition, one must be alert to conditions typically affecting other areas of the body presenting in the hand and upper extremity. To add to the complexity of diagnosis, one must also be aware of potential secondary gains. With this in mind, a thorough history, physical examination, and broad differential can help avoid mislabeling patients with uncommon ailments. In this article, we present 4 cases of unusual causes of hand and upper extremity pain.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^91292b60]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy — retrospective observational series (Henderson et al) of 736 patients reported symptom and exam frequencies: arm pain (99.4%), neck pain (79.7%), scapular pain (52.5%), anterior chest pain (17.8%), headache (9.7%); dermatomal pain or paresthesia in 53.9% versus diffuse or non-dermatomal in 45.5% with 0.6% reporting none; sensory change to pinprick 85.2%, specific motor deficit 68%, specific decrease in a DTR 71.2%; one nerve root primarily responsible in 87.3% versus two levels 12.7%. Correlation with the primary operative level was 73.8% for pain/paresthesia, 84.8% for motor deficit, and 83.5% for DTR change, and "There was a 71.5% incidence of correlation between preoperative clinical findings and operative findings". Outcomes included "Good or excellent results" in 91.5%, with relief rates for arm pain 95.5%, neck pain 88.8%, scapular pain 95.9%, chest pain 95.4%, and headache 89.8%; DTR abnormalities resolved in 96.9%, with residual sensory deficit 20.9% and motor deficit 2.3%. Methodological note: "In critique, no validated outcome measures were used in the study. Thus, it provides Level II evidence that 71.5% of the time, the surgical site can be accurately predicted on the basis of clinical findings".

### Paresthesias among community members exposed to the world trade center disaster [^3880034c]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The World Trade Center (WTC) Environmental Health Center (EHC) is a treatment program for community members (local workers, residents, clean-up workers) who developed physical and mental health symptoms after exposure to dust and fumes from the destruction of the WTC towers on September 11, 2001 (referred to herein as "9/11"). Most patients presented to the program because of upper or lower respiratory symptoms, frequently accompanied by symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux.

Within several years of the WTC disaster, we noted that some patients were complaining of neurologic symptoms consistent with peripheral paresthesias, prominent symptoms among patients with peripheral neuropathy. One of the most common types of neuropathy is a symmetric length-dependent polyneuropathy that may be seen in diabetes, autoimmune disorders, heavy metal exposure, and alcohol exposure. Because of the length-dependence, symptoms are often first noted in the leg, but they also can appear in the upper extremities. Formal questions eliciting the presence of both upper and lower extremity paresthesias therefore were added to the standardized questionnaire administered at enrollment.

The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in adults in the 400 mg/day TOPAMAX group and at an incidence higher (≥ 10%) than in the 50 mg/day group were: paresthesia, weight loss and anorexia (see Table 5).

Approximately 21% of the 159 adult patients in the 400 mg/day group who received TOPAMAX as monotherapy in Study 1 discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. The most common (≥ 2% more frequent than low-dose 50 mg/day TOPAMAX) adverse reactions causing discontinuation were difficulty with memory, fatigue, asthenia, insomnia, somnolence, and paresthesia.

Pediatric Patients 6 to 15 Years of Age

The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in pediatric patients in the 400 mg/day TOPAMAX group and at an incidence higher (≥ 10%) than in the 50 mg/day group were fever and weight loss (see Table 5).

Approximately 14% of the 77 pediatric patients in the 400 mg/day group who received TOPAMAX as monotherapy in the controlled clinical trial discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. The most common (≥ 2% more frequent than low-dose 50 mg/day TOPAMAX) adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation were difficulty with concentration/attention, fever, flushing, and confusion.

Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions occurring in at least 3% of adult and pediatric patients treated with 400 mg/day TOPAMAX and occurring with greater incidence than 50 mg/day TOPAMAX.

### Approach to peripheral neuropathy for the primary care clinician [^e490ecbc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is commonly encountered in the primary care setting and is associated with significant morbidity, including neuropathic pain, falls, and disability. The clinical presentation of neuropathy is diverse, with possible symptoms including weakness, sensory abnormalities, and autonomic dysfunction. Accordingly, the primary care clinician must be comfortable using the neurologic examination-including the assessment of motor function, multiple sensory modalities, and deep tendon reflexes-to recognize and characterize neuropathy. Although the causes of peripheral neuropathy are numerous and diverse, careful review of the medical and family history coupled with limited, select laboratory testing can often efficiently lead to an etiologic diagnosis. This review offers an approach for evaluating suspected neuropathy in the primary care setting. It will describe the most common causes, suggest an evidence-based workup to aid in diagnosis, and highlight recent evidence that allows for selection of symptomatic treatment of patients with neuropathy.

RESULTS

Participants

From January 1, 2008, through October 30, 2015, we enrolled and consented 3193 subjects into the Bellevue Hospital WTC EHC. Fifty-two (1.6% of the consented population) did not respond to the question on the frequency of prickling or tingling in the year preceding interview and were dropped from the analysis leaving a sample of 3141 participants. As summarized in Table 2, the population was diverse, with 50% of the population women; a wide range of ages, with 98% being less than 64 years old at enrollment; 25% self-reporting as Hispanic; nearly 11% reporting a diagnosis of diabetes; and 13% reporting having had cancer. Only 10% reported current tobacco use.

Frequency of Report of upper and Lower Extremity Paresthesias

Many patients reported experiencing paresthesias in the year before enrolling in the WTC EHC. Similar percentages of the population reported paresthesias of the upper (46%, 1446) or lower (44%, 1383) extremity. Most of those reporting paresthesias had paresthesias of both extremities (1033, or 33% of all subjects), with 11% (346) of patients reporting isolated paresthesias of the lower extremities and 13% (407) reporting isolated paresthesias of the upper extremities. Hereafter, we focus on risk factors for paresthesia of either the upper or lower extremities, without regard in our primary analyses for either the location of the paresthesias or their reported frequency.

Odds Ratios for Paresthesias

Clinical Characteristics

Table 2 summarizes associations of paresthesias with demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions. The strongest associations were with histories of paresthesias before September 11, 2001, and diabetes mellitus. In addition, there were significant associations with female sex, African–American race, and Hispanic ethnicity.

### Imaging in the diagnosis of ulnar nerve pathologies-a neoteric approach [^4ec6dfdf]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

The ulnar nerve is a branch of the C8 and T1 nerve roots and arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus. It supplies the intrinsic muscles of the hand and assists the median nerve in functioning of the flexors. Also known as the musician's nerve, it is the second most common nerve involved in compressive neuropathy following the median nerve. Common sites of entrapment include cubital tunnel at the elbow, the ulnar groove in the humerus and the Guyon's canal at the wrist. Patients present with altered sensation in the ulnar fourth and the fifth digit and the medial side of arm with loss of function of intrinsic muscles of the hand, the flexor carpi ulnaris and ulnar fibres of flexor digitorum superficialis in more severe cases. Diagnosis relies on clinical examination, electrodiagnostic studies and imaging findings. Plain radiographs are used to identify fracture sites, callus, or tumours as cause of compression. Technological advances in ultrasonography have allowed direct visualisation of the involved nerve with assessment of exact site, extent and type of injury. It yields unmatched information about anatomical details of the nerve. MR imaging adds to soft tissue details and helps in characterising the lesion. This pictorial review aims to illustrate a wide spectrum of causes of ulnar neuropathies as seen on ultrasound and MRI and emphasises upon the importance of imaging modalities in the diagnosis of neuropathies.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^6d58e84a]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

4.1.1. A history of relevant neurological lesion or disease

There should be a clinical suspicion of a relevant lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system (eg, an episode of acute herpes zoster or a traumatic nerve injury). The temporal relationship between the lesion or disease and the pain may vary, but a close temporal relationship helps strengthen the clinical suspicion. The onset of pain is usually immediate or within a few weeks of the lesion or disease but may be delayed for up to several months after injury (eg, after stroke) or for many years in conditions with an insidious onset such as diabetic neuropathy. In some cases, the history of pain or sensory disturbances by themselves suggest a disease, eg, in polyneuropathy (peripheral neuropathy), where the insidious onset of distal pain or numbness may be the only history indicating the disease. Characteristic sudden short-lasting (usually a few seconds) paroxysmal pain in the face, which may recur several times and may be separated by a refractory period (usually some minutes), suggests trigeminal neuralgia, where the pain is the only symptom indicating a relevant neurological disease.

4.1.2. Pain distribution neuroanatomically plausible

The pain distribution should be anatomically consistent with the suspected location of the lesion or disease in the peripheral or central somatosensory nervous system (as derived from the patient's history). This can be difficult to decipher in the single patient, as the distribution of pain can occupy a smaller area or extend somewhat outside the innervation territory of a peripheral nerve or root or the somatotopic representation of the body within the central nervous system, but it should be in a distribution that is typical for the underlying disorder (see examples in Table 1). In painful channelopathies, the pain distribution may be unusual but should be consistent with the disorder, eg, familial episodic pain syndrome, in which pain is mainly localized to the chest and upper arms, or inherited erythromelalgia, in which pain is localized to the extremities (feet and hands and in some cases ears).

Table 1.
Common neuropathic pain conditions and neuroanatomically plausible distribution of pain symptoms and sensory signs.

When both requirements 1 and 2 of the pain history are fulfilled, the pain complaint may be termed possible neuropathic pain.

### Painful peripheral neuropathies of the lower limbs and / or lower extremities treated with spinal cord stimulation: a systematic review with narrative synthesis [^137a000c]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathies are common neurological diseases, with an estimated prevalence of between 1% and 12% in all age groups and higher rates in older people. Etiologies are diverse; nevertheless, the unifying feature is damage to the peripheral nervous system, resulting in either motor, sensory or autonomic dysfunction. Common causes of peripheral neuropathies include Carpal tunnel syndrome, Bells' palsy, diabetes mellitus, toxic exposure (eg, oncologic therapy), and hereditary polyneuropathy (eg, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease). Sensory and/or motor nerves are the most often affected, with common neurological symptoms including burning pain, numbness, paresthesia, muscle weakness and atrophy, and gait abnormalities.

Neuropathic pain is prevalent in peripheral neuropathy, affecting up to two-thirds of patients and severely impairing quality of life. Currently, oral pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, with gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants being the main recommended medications for symptom relief. However, these drugs generally have limited efficacy, and tolerability is often poor due to their systemic or centrally mediated effects. Other localized agents are also used in drug-refractory patients, including an 8% capsaicin patch recently approved by the FDA for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). However, overall, many patients are left with unrelieved pain. Furthermore, the unmet need for efficacious treatments in patients with painful peripheral neuropathy (PPN) is set to increase, with the rising prevalence of diabetes a major contributing factor.

### Thoracic outlet syndrome – aspects of diagnosis in the differential diagnosis of hand-arm vibration syndrome [^3b01c0f5]. Occupational Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a cause of vascular and neurological compromise to the arm and hand, and may manifest as Raynaud's phenomenon. It may be under-diagnosed.

Aim

This review was undertaken in order to clarify the diagnostic and investigative features of TOS that may differentiate it from hand-arm vibration syndrome.

Methods

A tiered review of the world literature was undertaken using Medline and Embase as the primary search engines.

Conclusion

Thoracic outlet syndrome most commonly presents with neurological symptoms in the arm. Vascular symptoms, including Raynaud's phenomenon, may occur in approximately 10% of cases. Careful clinical assessment by history and examination may reveal the elements of forearm and upper arm symptoms with postural exacerbation, which distinguish this condition from hand-arm vibration syndrome. The usefulness of investigation is unclear, but Doppler and neuroelectric studies may be valuable. Magnetic resonance imaging scan is the investigation of choice.

### Acute exertional compartment syndrome of bilateral upper extremities after a push-up contest [^93cb7895]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute exertional compartment syndrome (AECS) involving the upper extremity is a rare form of compartment syndrome that occurs after physical activity. Despite its infrequent occurrence, AECS has devastating sequelae, including muscle necrosis and nerve injury. It is imperative to promptly evaluate for AECS in any patient who has notable pain and sensory changes in the context of recent physical activity because of the dire consequences of a missed diagnosis. A 34-year-old man presented to the emergency department with excruciating pain and diffuse paresthesias in his bilateral arms and forearms after participating in a push-up contest. He also had pain with passive stretch of his triceps. Because of these physical examination findings and uncontrollable pain, a clinical diagnosis of AECS was made and was managed with fasciotomies. Postoperatively, the patient's pain and paresthesias slowly resolved, and he was eventually able to return to work at full capacity as a construction worker. This example of AECS of bilateral upper extremities emphasizes that it is a condition that, although rare, is real and must be taken seriously. With appropriate clinical suspicion, a prompt diagnosis can be made, and potentially devastating consequences can be avoided.

### Cubital tunnel syndrome [^eca5fd0e]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, or cubital tunnel syndrome, is the second most common peripheral nerve compression syndrome in the upper extremity. Diagnosis is made through a good history and physical examination. Electrodiagnostic testing can confirm the diagnosis and severity of injury to the nerve. Surgical intervention is indicated when nonoperative treatment does not relieve the symptoms. There is currently no consensus on the best surgical treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome. However, the only randomized prospective studies to compare treatment options to date indicate that simple decompression and anterior transposition yield comparable results.

Posterior-lateral foraminotomy for cervical radiculopathy — symptoms and localization accuracy in an observational prognostic study are summarized as follows: Number of patients was 736 who underwent one or more posterior-lateral foraminotomies for simple cervical radiculopathy. Symptom frequencies were arm pain 99.4%, neck pain 79.7%, scapular pain 52.5%, anterior chest pain 17.8%, and headache 9.7%; eleven patients presented with only left chest and arm pain ('cervical angina'). Pain or paresthesia followed a dermatomal pattern in 53.9%, was diffuse or nondermatomal in 45.5%, and 0.6% reported none; sensory change to pinprick occurred in 85.2%, a specific motor deficit in 68%, and a specific decrease in deep tendon reflex (DTR) in 71.2%. One level was thought to be primary 87.3% of the time and two levels equally involved 12.7% of the time, and this paper provides evidence that 71.5% of the time, the operative site can be accurately predicted on the basis of clinical findings.

### Imaging of peripheral nerves of the upper extremity [^458a843f]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy (often defined as weakness of sensory loss in one limb) of the upper extremity is a common clinical musculoskeletal scenario. The most common include carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and cervical radiculopathy. A combination of clinical examination, electrodiagnostic testing, and imaging studies, chiefly MR imaging and ultrasonography, is often needed to identify a specific diagnosis for an individual patient. In many cases, ultrasonography is preferred because of ease of access, the possibility of quick contralateral extremity imaging for comparison, and lower cost profile. MR imaging is preferred for deeper nerve structures and large-field-of-view evaluation.

### Predictors of disease severity for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, analysis from a randomized clinical trial [^1bc29dbd]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common nerve compression in the upper extremity. Painful paresthesias in fingers progress to muscle weakness and atrophy impairing activities of daily living. Despite common occurrence and impacting lives, risk factors that predispose UNE and help understand disease severity are not investigated thoroughly.

Methods

Patients enrolled in the Surgery for Ulnar Neuropathy (SUN) at the elbow study were included. Data on patient demographics, distance traveled, disease duration and comorbidities collected at the time of enrollment prior to surgery were used for this analysis. Ordinal logistic regression was used to determine risk factors associated with three-level UNE severity.

Results

225 study participants included in this analysis had an average age of 51 years. Age (OR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.08; p < 0.001) and disease duration (OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.93; p = 0.01) were significantly associated with disease severity. Patients with longer disease duration prior to surgery were less likely to have severe disease.

Conclusion

In this NIH-funded clinical trial, distance traveled, and patient comorbidities were not associated with severity of UNE. Patients with longer disease duration were less inclined to seek treatment sooner likely owing to mild disease severity. Our results inform that distance traveled by patients is not a limitation for UNE treatment. Older individuals are at increased risk of severe disease and can benefit from early referral and treatment.

### The cubital tunnel syndrome: a case report and discussion [^5458595e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Cubital Tunnel Syndrome is the second most common peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremity. It presents as elbow, forearm, or hand pain in the ulnar nerve sensory distribution and it is the result of overuse, trauma, or entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow. Proper physical diagnosis can localize the site of ulnar nerve entrapment to the elbow or wrist. Both conservative and operative modalities exist to treat the Cubital Tunnel Syndrome; optimal management is still unclear.

Symptoms as described by the patients

The 164 patients who gave a free text answer about the first manifested symptoms of their CIPN used an average of 2.2 descriptions with a maximum of 9 entries. The first symptoms were mainly localized in the feet (in 50%) and/or hands (24%). The arms (N = 7; 4.2%) were mostly spared, while the symptoms of the feet more often spread upwards (N = 47; 28.7%).

The patients marked an average of 4 and a maximum of 11 different descriptions for their symptoms, 41 of 185 patients did not agree with any description. Most frequently (N = 66; 35.7%), 4–6 symptoms were described. Numbness (N = 120), a tingling sensation (N = 99), or a decreased sensibility (N = 86) in the affected body regions was mentioned most frequently by far (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Symptoms as described by the patients (N = 185)

About two-thirds of the 120 patients (N = 85; 70.8%) who reported numbness also reported tingling. The symptom combination "numbness" and "decreased sensibility" was presented by 77 patients (64.2%). Tingling, numbness, and decreased sensibility occurred at the same time in 56 patients (46.7%). About 15% described, in addition to these three (most common) complaints, a (painful) stinging (N = 28), or burning (N = 27) sensation as a symptom.

The concomitant occurrence of the symptom "pain" was described by 121 patients. About 1 / 3 overall described them as "weak" (N = 11; 9.1%) or "mild" (N = 28; 23.1%). About 1 / 3 (N = 42; 34.7%) described their pain as "moderately severe". The rest called them "strong" (N = 21; 17.4%), "very strong" (N = 12; 9.9%) or "unbearable" (N = 7; 5.8%).

Clinical symptoms

Pain

Eleven studies reported pain as selection criterion. One study reported that pain intensity should be above 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). One study mentioned using the inclusion criteria from another study.

The location of pain (arm and/or neck) was described in 11 studies as criterion, but in two studies the location 'cervicobrachial pain' and 'neck pain' was not further explained. Two studies solely reported arm pain to be present, of which one study stated that arm pain, with radiation distal to the elbow, plus at least provocation of arm pain by neck movements should be positive as selection criterion. Six studies included patients with neck pain and arm pain. In three of these studies, patients also had to have nerve root distribution of the pain for inclusion.

Five studies described the duration of pain as selection criterion. These studies included patients with pain duration of < 1 month, > 1 month, < 3 months, or > 3 months. The total range of duration of pain ranged from 1 month to 1 year, from 6 months to 1 year, or from 1 month to 2 years.

We concluded that there was consensus (11 out of 13 studies; 85%) on pain as a selection criterion, but no consensus on the exact location, intensity, or duration of pain. Only 6 out of 13 studies (46%) require both neck and arm pain to be simultaneously present.

Sensory symptoms

There were five studies which used sensory symptoms as selection criteria. One study mentioned using reflex disturbances, motor and sensory deficits, together with the distribution of pain, to determine the clinical level of radiculopathy.

Other inclusion criteria used were paraesthesia, numbness, and sensory changes. A definition of these terms or what the symptoms include was often not explicitly outlined.

Three studies provided information concerning the location of the sensory symptoms. The C7 dermatome, one or more adjacent dermatomes, and symptoms in unilateral upper extremity were mentioned. The exact location of the sensory symptoms was not further explained in any of the studies.

No study described whether the information on sensory symptoms was gathered during history taking or by physical examination. In conclusion, we found no consensus (5 out of 13; 38%) across the studies about sensory symptoms as a selection criterion.

5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy

Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 39% of patients with cervical cancer treated with TIVDAK across clinical trials; 6% of patients experienced Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy adverse reactions included peripheral sensory neuropathy (23%), peripheral neuropathy (5%), paresthesia (3.8%), peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy (3.3%), muscular weakness (2.8%), and peripheral motor neuropathy (2.4%). One patient with another tumor type treated with TIVDAK at the recommended dose developed Guillain-Barre syndrome.

The median time to onset of peripheral neuropathy was 2.4 months (range, 0–11.3). Of the patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy, 18% had complete resolution and 21% had partial improvement (defined as a decrease in severity by one or more grades from the worst grade) at last follow up. Peripheral neuropathy led to discontinuation of TIVDAK in 7% of patients with cervical cancer.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neuropathy, such as paresthesia, tingling or a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, muscle weakness, or dysesthesia. For patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy, withhold dose, then dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TIVDAK based on the severity of peripheral neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

5.3 Hemorrhage

Hemorrhage occurred in 51% of patients with cervical cancer treated with TIVDAK across clinical trials. The most common all grade hemorrhage adverse reaction was epistaxis (33%). Grade 3 hemorrhage occurred in 4% of patients.

The median time to onset of hemorrhage was 0.3 months (range, 0–10.4). Of the patients who experienced hemorrhage, 71% had complete resolution and 12% had partial resolution (defined as a decrease in severity by one or more grades from the worst grade) at last follow-up.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hemorrhage. For patients experiencing pulmonary or CNS hemorrhage, permanently discontinue TIVDAK. For grade ≥ 2 hemorrhage in any other location, withhold until bleeding has resolved, blood hemoglobin is stable, there is no bleeding diathesis that could increase the risk of continuing therapy, and there is no anatomical or pathologic condition that can increase the risk of hemorrhage recurrence. After resolution, either resume treatment or permanently discontinue TIVDAK [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### New evidence for common practices in carpal tunnel syndrome [^0df4f57a]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on carpal tunnel syndrome:

- **Definition**: CTS is condition characterized by symptomatic compressive neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist.
- **Pathophysiology**: CTS is caused by compression and traction of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, either due to idiopathic causes or secondary to fibrous hypertrophy of synovial flexor sheath or due to repetitive movements of the wrist.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence and incidence of CTS in the United State are 7.8% and 2.3 per 100 person-years, respectively.
- **Disease course**: The combination of increased pressure in the tunnel, median nerve microcirculation injury, median nerve connective tissue compression, and synovial tissue hypertrophy results in altered function of the nerve, demyelination, and degeneration of the nerve at the site of compression and beyond. These events cause paresthesias, weakness, and loss of function in the distal distribution of median nerve (thumb, index, middle finger, and the radial side of the ring finger) and even outside the distribution of the median nerve.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Carpal tunnel release is effective in 70–90% of the patients. The recurrence rate after carpal tunnel release varies from 3–25%.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: a systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^f5dd170f]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Key intraoperative measures to prevent PUN are summarised in Table 3. In all patients, this means positioning the arm to reduce pressure on the ulnar groove, preventing extremes of flexion at the elbow, and positioning the forearm in a supinated or neutral position when the patient is supine. Despite meticulous positioning of the upper limb during anaesthesia, avoidance of excessive elbow flexion or extension, and avoidance of external compression over the cubital tunnel, PUN can still result. Numerous case reports describe PUN despite adequate padding applied to the ulnar groove, and large registry database studies report that 18–27% of ulnar nerve injuries occur in cases where appropriate padding of the ulnar groove had been performed.

Table 3
Summary of key intraoperative measures to prevent postoperative ulnar neuropathy (PUN).

The relative contribution to ulnar nerve injury of events during the postoperative period (when the patient may no longer be under the direct care of the anaesthetist) is debated. The presentation of some cases of PUN days or weeks after surgery has a variety of possible explanations. Distracting events (such as surgical pain) in the immediate postoperative period may prevent a patient paying due regard to early symptoms. Patients may notice unusual ulnar symptoms but place little concern in them, given their overall priorities for functional recovery after surgery. Patients may raise concerns with staff regarding ulnar symptoms, but unless these staff are aware of the specific neuropathic phenomenon, these concerns may remain informal, undocumented, and may never be escalated to anaesthetic or neurological staff. It is also possible that a nervous injury presenting in the later postoperative period was itself sustained in that period and is causally unrelated to immediate perioperative care. It has been shown that the incidence of ulnar neuropathy is approximately the same in both surgical and medical in-patients, further supporting the hypothesis that PUN can arise from injurious events unrelated to anaesthetic or surgical care.

Ulnar neuropathy at or distal to the wrist, the so-called ulnar tunnel syndrome, is an uncommon but well-described condition. However, diagnosis of ulnar tunnel syndrome can be difficult. Paresthesias may be nonspecific or related to coexisting pathologies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome, C8-T1 radiculopathy, or peripheral neuropathy, which makes accurate diagnosis challenging. The advances in electrodiagnosis, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have improved the diagnostic accuracy.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^9f44f73a]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Cervical spine — History and physical examination emphasize pain patterns, paresthesia validity, dermatomal mapping, and key maneuvers. Cervical spine pain is a common clinical condition affecting activities of daily living and QoL in people around the world and can manifest as neck pain, shoulder or trapezius pain, scapular pain, and upper extremity pain. Radicular pain is most likely to travel below the elbow, and somatic referred pain is most often limited to above the elbow, although either can occasionally cross these boundaries. In contrast to the lumbar spine, paresthesia is considered to be more valid than the distribution of pain, and in the hand it is considered more valid than forearm paresthesia distribution. Paresthesia, with or without pain, occurs in 90% of patients with surgically proven radiculopathy due to disc prolapse, yet approximately 45% of patients are unable to localize paresthesia and they present with diffuse, nondermatomal symptoms. Digit-specific patterns include thumb or index finger paresthesia attributed to the C6 dermatome, the middle finger (with or without index involvement) assigned to C7, and the little finger assigned to C8. Assessment is based on history and an extensive examination including neurological, motor, sensory, and reflex evaluation plus provocative maneuvers such as Spurling's neck compression test, shoulder abduction test, neck distraction test, Lhermitte sign, Hoffman sign, and Addison's test.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the upper limb: a pictorial review [^6327238d]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral nerves of the upper limb can become entrapped at various points. While physical examination and nerve conduction studies are the mainstay of diagnosis, there are multiple imaging options, especially ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which offer information about the cause and location of nerve entrapment, and help guide treatment.

Ultrasound is an appropriate first-line imaging modality for entrapment syndromes as it is cheap, fast, has high spatial resolution, and allows dynamic nerve assessment. The presence of an ultrasonographic Tinel's sign, which refers to paraesthesia in the cutaneous distribution of the nerve in response to transducer pressure at the entrapment site, can be a helpful supportive finding. Ultrasound also provides an opportunity for the operator to obtain more clinical information or history which may otherwise not be readily available. The drawbacks of ultrasound are that its field of view can be limited in depth and obstructed by structures such as bone. In addition, the technique is inherently operator dependent.

MRI of peripheral nerves predominantly utilises T1-weighted and fluid-sensitive sequences. Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is a technique which utilises the longer T2 isolation time of nerves to better image them. Benefits of MRI include better visualisation of deep nerves and high contrast resolution. Gadolinium-based contrast can also be administered to highlight mass lesions and inflammation that may be contributing to symptoms. The drawbacks of MRI are its cost, time-consumption, contraindications (e.g. pacemakers), and signal contamination from foreign bodies or blood flow.

This article describes the characteristic ultrasound and MRI findings of nerve entrapment syndromes, reviews the anatomy of the peripheral nerves of the upper limb, and illustrates common sites of entrapment. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with these entrapment syndromes as correctly diagnosing the site and cause of entrapment allows targeted treatments, such as corticosteroid injections or surgery, to be performed.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^570d782d]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy — retrospective PLF outcomes and symptom distribution: A retrospective observational study reporting results of PLF in the treatment of 736 patients with cervical radiculopathy found arm pain (99.4%), neck pain (79.7%), scapular pain (52.5%), anterior chest pain (17.8%) and headache (9.7%), with eleven patients presenting with only left chest and arm pain ("cervical angina"). Pain or paresthesia in a dermatomal pattern was reported by 53.9% of patients, 45.5% experienced a diffuse or non-dermatomal pattern, and 0.6% reported no pain or paresthesia. Of patients included, 85.2% reported a sensory change to pin-prick, 68% had a specific motor deficit and 71.8% had a specific decrease in a deep tendon reflex (DTR). One nerve root level was thought primarily responsible in 87.3% while two levels were equally involved in 12.7%. The correlation between pain/paresthesia, motor deficit, DTR change and the primary surgical level was 73.8%, 84.8% and 83.5%, respectively; there was a 71.5% incidence of correlation between presurgical clinical findings and surgical findings. Good or excellent results were reported by 91.5% of patients; good or excellent relief occurred for arm pain in 95.5%, neck pain in 88.8%, scapular pain in 95.9%, chest pain in 95.4% and headache in 89.8%. Resolution of DTR abnormalities was reported in 96.9%, with residual sensory deficit in 20.9% and motor deficit in 2.3%; these data presented evidence that the operative site can be accurately predicted on the basis of clinical findings 71.5% of the time.

Upper extremity positioning — ulnar, radial, and median neuropathies (literature) reports that a tilted body position of 15 to 20° versus nontilted positions reported a reduced frequency of ulnar neuropathy, while a prone position with forearms placed above the head showed equivocal findings for ulnar nerve injury; the literature is insufficient to evaluate the impact of forearm positioning on an armboard, arms tucked at the side, or elbow flexion on ulnar neuropathy. The literature is insufficient to evaluate perioperative positioning strategies intended to reduce radial neuropathy, and a case series describes median neuropathy when elbows were fully extended in supine or lateral positions. The literature is insufficient to evaluate the efficacy of periodic assessment of patient position during a procedure in reducing the risk of upper extremity peripheral neuropathies.

Fig. 9
PDFS (a) and PD sequence (b) of 40-year-old male with anconeus denervation oedema (white arrows) due to radial nerve neuropathy. The anconeus is supplied by the radial nerve before it bifurcates into the deep motor and superficial sensory branches, hence the cause of neuropathy in this case will be proximal to the bifurcation

The median nerve arises from the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus, with roots C6-T1. It descends laterally to the brachial artery, then crosses it to sit medially halfway down the arm. It enters the cubital fossa and runs deep to the bicipital aponeurosis and anterior to the brachialis. At the elbow joint, it passes between the superficial and deep heads of the pronator teres. In the forearm, the median nerve travels between the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis muscles, giving off two branches: the anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) which supplies the muscles in the deep anterior compartment, and the palmar cutaneous nerve which provides sensory innervation to the lateral palm. The median nerve then continues through the carpal tunnel, which is bounded superiorly by the flexor retinaculum, laterally by the trapezium and scaphoid, medially by the hook of hamate and pisiform and inferiorly by the palmar aspect of these carpal bones. Along with the median nerve, the normal carpal tunnel contains nine tendons: the flexor pollicis longus, four tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis and four tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus. After traversing the carpal tunnel, the median nerve divides into the recurrent branch which supplies the thenar muscles, and the digital cutaneous branches which provide sensory supply to the lateral three-and-a-half digits on the palmar surface and motor supply to the lateral two lumbricals. The most common median nerve neuropathy is carpal tunnel syndrome, where the nerve is compressed under the flexor retinaculum. Anatomical variants, such as additional muscles in the carpal tunnel, can predispose to nerve entrapment. An example is the accessory palmaris longus. The presence of a bifid median nerve, which has a reported incidence of up to 18% and may be accompanied by a persistent median artery, has also been implicated. Mass lesions such as ganglion cysts of the wrist should also be excluded. In addition to anatomical factors, medical risk factors for carpal tunnel syndrome include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism and obesity. However, most cases of carpal tunnel syndrome are idiopathic and typically linked with a history of repetitive or prolonged wrist flexion and extension. At the distal humerus, the median nerve can be entrapped by the ligament of Struthers, which is a fibrous band connecting the congenital supracondylar spur, present in 1% of individuals, with the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Entrapment at the elbow can be due to thickening of the bicipital aponeurosis or occur between the deep and superficial heads of the pronator teres at the elbow.

- Changes in your immune system (Immune Reconstitution Syndrome) can happen when you start taking HIV-1 medicines. Your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long time. Tell your healthcare provider if you start having new symptoms after starting REYATAZ.

- Changes in body fat can happen in people taking HIV-1 medicines. These changes may include increased amount of fat in the upper back and neck ("buffalo hump"), breast, and around the main part of your body (trunk). Loss of fat from the legs, arms, and face may also happen. The exact cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known.

- Increased bleeding problems in people with hemophilia have happened when taking protease inhibitors like REYATAZ.

The most common side effects of REYATAZ include:

- nausea

- headache

- stomach-area pain

- vomiting

- trouble sleeping

- numbness, tingling, or burning of hands or feet

- dizziness

- muscle pain

- diarrhea

- depression

- fever

Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.

Upper extremity positioning strategies to reduce perioperative neuropathies — ulnar, radial, and median nerve protection — emphasize positioning to unload vulnerable grooves and avoiding extremes of motion: position the upper extremity to decrease pressure on the postcondylar groove of the humerus, either supination or the neutral forearm positions may be used, and when arms are tucked at the side place the forearm in a neutral position; when possible, avoid flexion of the elbow to decrease the risk of ulnar neuropathy; avoid prolonged pressure on the radial nerve in the spiral groove of the humerus; avoid extension of the elbow beyond the range that is comfortable during the preoperative assessment to prevent stretching of the median nerve; and periodic perioperative assessments may be performed to ensure maintenance of the desired position.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: updated evidence and new questions [^812040f1]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment neuropathy, affecting quality of life for many people. Although it is a well recognised condition, new insights into epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment have emerged in the past 6 years. The availability of disease-modifying treatments for rare systemic disorders associated with carpal tunnel syndrome (eg, amyloidosis) should alert clinicians to these diagnostic possibilities. Besides clinical evaluation and electrophysiology, the role of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool has been confirmed and new ultrasound techniques have been applied, the clinical use and feasibility of which require further investigation. Surgical and non-surgical interventions are beneficial for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome and several treatment options are now available, giving clinicians the possibility to choose the best approach for every patient. New diagnostic and therapeutic techniques require further validation.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^1ff0b278]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peripheral neuropathic pain is a common finding in patients with peripheral nerve injury. It has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as a pain "caused by lesions or diseases of the somatosensory nervous system". Peripheral neuropathic pain is typically chronic in nature and is caused by a heterogenous group of diseases. It has an estimated prevalence of between 6.9% and 10% of the population. It is typically described as a "pins and needles", burning, cramping, or tingling pain by patients. Prior research has demonstrated that neuropathic causes of pain may be underrecognized and inadequately managed. In this review, we seek to briefly outline the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathic pain and provide a comprehensive list of non‐interventional treatment approaches.

### Applying evidence to inform carpal tunnel syndrome care [^95fb97e8]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common problems treated by hand surgeons. As our understanding of the condition has improved and focus on quality and evidence-based care has evolved, management of CTS has shifted as well. Although for many patients the diagnosis and treatment plan are relatively straightforward, understanding how to decide what diagnostics are appropriate, how to avoid complications especially in high-risk patients, and even which surgical option to offer remains a challenge. As CTS research efforts broaden and available evidence grows, understanding the different research findings in order to implement the evidence into practice is critical for all surgeons. In this article, we approach commonly encountered challenges in CTS management and take a methodological viewpoint to guide evidence-based practice.

### Paresthesias among community members exposed to the world trade center disaster [^11504b76]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Table 7 summarizes a multinomial logistic regression analysis in which individuals reporting different frequencies of paresthesias are treated as having distinct conditions, or separate values of this ordinal dependent variable. The ORs for paresthesias of all three frequencies were elevated in later years (2014 to 2015) compared with the reference years of 2008 to 2010. Within each model, the ORs for paresthesias increased with increasing severity of the coverage of one's body and clothes with dust on 9/11. Across all three models, there were significantly increased ORs for paresthesias associated with female sex, Hispanic ethnicity, and histories of smoking, diabetes, and cancer.

The findings from multinomial logistic regression analysis treating paresthesias in different bodily locations as different conditions are summarized in (Table 8). The OR for being heavily covered with WTC dust on 9/11 was significantly elevated among persons with paresthesias of the upper extremities only, paresthesias of the lower extremities only, and paresthesias of both the upper and lower extremities when compared with the group with no paresthesias. The ORs for having a job that included cleaning WTC dust was elevated among those with isolated paresthesias of the lower extremities and those with paresthesias of both the upper and lower extremities, while the OR for the upper extremities failed to achieve statistical significance (P = 0.16).

### Carpal tunnel syndrome and hand-arm vibration: a Swedish national registry case-control study [^1dfc673c]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hand-arm vibration (HAV) is a global work-related exposure that can cause different injuries. Vibration white fingers (Raynaud's phenomena caused by HAV exposure) and vibration neuropathy are well known symptoms of HAV. HAV exposure is also associated with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

CTS is one of the most common peripheral entrapments and is caused by compression of the median nerve passing the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Symptoms of CTS are neurological symptoms from the median nerve innervated area with numbness and tingling during the night or when the wrist is flexed. Clinically, CTS is often diagnosed with provoking tests, such as Tinel's test (percussion on palmar side) and Phalen's test (flexion of the wrist), which may induce symptoms or decrease vibro-tactile sense. Nerve conduction examination of the median nerve is often used to confirm the diagnosis prior to any treatment such as wrist brace, steroid injection, or surgery.CTS is an important contributor to work disability and is important to prevent.

### Outcomes of upper-extremity revascularization following acute limb ischemia [^33f5a8f2]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a vascular emergency that demands prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention. This study investigated the incidence, clinical presentation, and outcomes of upper-extremity ALI and examined the impact of patient risk factors on these outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients who underwent upper-extremity revascularization for ALI at a single health care system from 2003 to 2023 was conducted. Patients with ischemia duration under 14 days were included. Data on demographics, hypercoagulability risk factors, ischemia duration, clinical presentation, etiology, hospitalization length, and complications were analyzed.

Results

Three hundred sixty-six patients underwent revascularization for ALI during the study period. The average age of the patients was 65.0 ± 17.0 years, and 69.7% were women. Common etiologies included embolism from atrial fibrillation (21.5%) and iatrogenic injury (29.3%). The brachial artery was the most common occlusion site (89%). The median ischemia time was 12.0 hours (IQR = 29.2). Pain and paresthesia at initial presentation were considerably associated with increased duration of ischemia. Eighty patients (21.9%) experienced complications. Eleven patients (3%) who received prophylactic fasciotomy had a median ischemia duration of 22 (13–76) hours, which was similar to patients without prophylactic fasciotomy (14 [7–35] hours). Prophylactic fasciotomy was also associated with increased complications.

Conclusions

Upper-extremity ALI revascularization has a high complication rate. Although longer ischemia duration may intensify symptoms, it does not predict complications or hospital stay. Prophylactic fasciotomy, lacking clear benefit, may increase risks, and calls into question its routine use in upper-extremity ALI cases.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^f68bd3cb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 10 — AV access early postoperative evaluation and complications states that KDOQI considers it reasonable for AV access (arteriovenous fistula [AVF] and arteriovenous graft [AVG]) to be evaluated by a surgeon/operator for postoperative complications within 2 weeks and for an appropriate member of the vascular access team to evaluate for AVF maturation by 4–6 weeks after AV access creation and refer for further investigation if not maturing as expected (Expert Opinion). Ideally, the surgeon/operator evaluating for complications would be the same individual who created the AV access, early surgical complications need immediate attention and are best addressed by the surgeon or operator who created the vascular access, and surgeons typically see patients within 2 weeks to assess wound healing and potential complications; early complications include thrombosis, immaturity, infection, pain, numbness, weakness, and edema of the ipsilateral arm/hand, infections are more common after AVG than AVF and the majority of AVG infections occur in the first month, hand or finger tingling and numbness usually resolves within 4 weeks, and persistent edema (> 2 weeks) suggests central vein stenosis.

Symptoms

In our study, all patients had paresthesia or dysesthesia of the arm or the leg, while two patients presented with palsy (one of the arm and one of the leg), and one patient also had thoracic pain.

Nisson et al. reported in a review of 19 articles that 67% of patients with SAW had weakness, 65% numbness and/or sensory loss, and 19% incontinence.

In 81% of patients, symptoms predominated in the lower extremities, in 42% back/trunk, and 16% upper extremities. On the day of surgery, half of the patients had symptoms for 1 year or longer.

Other authors reported additional symptoms such as progressive myelopathy, back pain, clonus, hyperreflexia, and the Schiff-Sherrington phenomenon.

Radiological diagnosis and radiological FU

Hamilton et al. and Buttiens et al. concluded that MRI is the gold standard for diagnosing SAW with the pathognomonic so-called "scalpel sign" (or scalpel blade sign) because of the resemblance of the silhouette of a surgical scalpel blade. However, it might be difficult for MRI to visualize focal arachnoid lesions.

In our study, all patients had the pathognomonic scalpel sign, with anterior displacement of and caliber variation (the mean caliber variation was 3 mm) of the spinal cord.

It might be challenging to differentiate between SAW and other diseases with a ventral displacement of the spinal cord.

The "scalpel sign" in the case of SAW can be differentiated from the "C-shape" in the case of ISCH and the "concave aspect of the posterior spinal cord" in the case of an arachnoid cyst. The SAW and spinal cord herniation can be reliably distinguished on imaging by scrutinizing the nature of the dorsal indentation and the preserved ventral CSF flow. In rare cases, an "upside-down scalpel sign" had been described.

### Cubital tunnel syndrome: current concepts [^35bd60ad]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common upper extremity compressive neuropathy. In recent years, rates of surgical treatment have increased, and the popularity of in situ decompression has grown. Nonsurgical treatment, aiming to decrease both compression and traction on the ulnar nerve about the elbow, is successful in most patients with mild nerve dysfunction. Recent randomized controlled trials assessing rates of symptom resolution and ultimate success have failed to identify a preferred surgical procedure. Revision cubital tunnel surgery, most often consisting of submuscular transposition, may improve symptoms. However, ulnar nerve recovery after revision cubital tunnel surgery is less consistent than that after primary cubital tunnel surgery.

### Lichen simplex chronicus as a symptom of neuropathy [^f6437c13]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The main cause of lichen simplex chronicus (LSC) is not known but there is evidence to suggest that neurological abnormalities may be implicated in its aetiology.

Aim

To investigate neuropathy in patients with LSC on the limbs.

Methods

In total, 23 consecutive patients [15 women (65.2%) and 8 men (34.8%); mean ± SD age 48.2 ± 14.03 years, range 20–71] with LSC on the limbs were included in the study. Mean ± SD duration of disease was 22.86 ± 21.38 months (range 1–60). Radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrophysiological studies were performed for all patients.

Results

In total, 8 patients (34.8%) had LSC on the arms and 15 patients (65.2%) had LSC on the legs; 3 (37.5%) of the 8 patients with LSC on the arms and 6 (40%) of the 15 patients with LSC on the legs had radiculopathy in the electrophysiological studies. The prevalence of radiculopathy in patients with LSC on the limbs was higher than in asymptomatic subjects in the electrophysiological studies.

Conclusions

Damage to the peripheral nervous system, such as radiculopathy and neuropathy, can play a critical role in the aetiology of LSC on the limbs. Both nerve-root compression in MRI scans and radiculopathy in nerve-conduction studies are common findings in asymptomatic subjects, but they seem to be more common in patients with LSC on the limbs. Therefore, these patients should be evaluated for the possibility of underlying neuropathy.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^b4e09769]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy — history and examination findings emphasize paresthesia distribution and specific provocative tests. Paresthesia is considered to be more valid than the distribution of pain, and the distribution of paresthesia in the hand is also considered more valid than the distribution of paresthesia in the forearm. Paresthesia, with or without pain, occurs in 90% of patients with surgically proven radiculopathy due to disc prolapse, yet approximately 45% of patients are unable to vocalize the paresthesia to a distinct region. Dermatomal mapping notes that paresthesia of the thumb or index finger is attributed to the C6 dermatome, the middle finger (with or without index) to the C7 dermatome, and the little finger to the C8 dermatome. In a best evidence review, a positive Spurling's, traction/neck distraction, and Valsalva can be used to establish a diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy, and the existing literature appears to indicate high specificity, low sensitivity, and good to fair interexaminer reliability. For detection of radiculopathy, the presence of numbness has varied significantly from 24% to 48%, and 60% to as high as 86%; numbness is most often seen in the C6 and C7 dermatomes, and the predictive validity of numbness was calculated to be 0.7. Regarding imaging, in patients 50 years of age or older, plain spinal radiography together with standard laboratory tests are highly accurate in identifying the underlying systemic disease; however, plain radiography was not a valuable tool for nonspecific neck pain, and no systematic reviews were identified which examined the diagnostic accuracy of diagnostic imaging in those with neck pain.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis - History

Although NTOS is the most common subtype, representing up to 95% of TOS diagnoses, it is also the most controversial because it is difficult to diagnose, and remains without objective measures/criteria for diagnosis. As a result, the diagnosis remains one of exclusion, and relies heavily on a detailed and thorough history and physical examination. Unlike ATOS and VTOS, which can be diagnosed using ultrasound or CTA, objective measures and testing procedures for diagnosing NTOS remain limited. Further obscuring the diagnosis is confounding diagnoses that present with similar symptoms. For instance, patients who present with neck and arm pain may be misdiagnosed with cervical radiculopathy, rotator cuff injury, or peripheral nerve entrapment.

More recently, the Society for Vascular Surgery developed reporting standards for Thoracic outlet syndrome, including standardized nomenclature, definitions, and more consistent reporting standards. The most recent definition from 2016 by Illig etdefines NTOS as the presence of three of the four criteria:

1. Local symptoms in an area of compression (e.g. chest wall, trapezius, neck) and confirmed with pain on palpation in the specific area

2. Peripheral findings of arm or hand symptoms based on history, and confirmed by provocative maneuvers that reproduce or worsen the symptoms.

3. Absence of other reasonable/likely diagnoses such as cervical, shoulder, or peripheral nerve pathology.

4. Positive response to a scalene injection (typically local anesthetic)

Patients may also note a history of trauma. It is important to evaluate occupational, avocational, or sports activity risk factors. Other key symptoms that can be obtained from a thorough history include complaints of pain, numbness, tingling, sleep disturbances, and weakness, while exacerbating factors can include exercising, overhead arm motion, and driving. Symptom distribution generally involves all five fingers but can be more pronounced in the fourth and fifth digits and the ulnar forearm. Symptoms can sometimes be distinguished from cervical disc syndrome since NTOS generally presents without dermatomal preference, while cervical stenosis or disc syndrome may often present with a more defined dermatomal pattern; however, this can also make it difficult for general physicians, as the patient may complain of a nonspecific clinical presentation thereby confounding the picture and leading to an inaccurate or delayed diagnosis.

### Imaging of elbow entrapment neuropathies [^b0023c34]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Cubital tunnel syndrome

Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremity after carpal tunnel syndrome. It is the result of pathologic compression or a lesion of the UN within the cubital tunnel. Ulnar neuropathy at the cubital tunnel can occur due to dynamic compression during elbow flexion movements or can result from external compression or impingement. When the elbow is flexed, the space between the humerus's medial epicondyle and the olecranon widens, putting strain on the cubital tunnel retinaculum and thereby decreasing the ulnar canal's diameter. Individuals at high risk of developing ulnar neuropathy include baseball pitchers, truck drivers, and office workers whose jobs involve repetitive or prolonged elbow flexion. Extrinsic causes of compression can be masses (schwannomas or ganglia), accessory muscles (e.g. anconeus epitrochlearis muscle), elbow arthritis, bone abnormalities (due to previous fractures or surgery, osteophytes) (Video 04).

Common symptoms of UN compression are paresthesia and dysesthesia of the last two fingers, especially at night and during elbow flexion and repeated flexion–extension movements. The patient may also feel elbow pain that radiates towards the hand. In more advanced cases, the Wartenberg sign (the abduction stance of the small finger) can be seen, and there may be a claw deformity of the hand with extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints with flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joints, secondary to paralysis of lumbrical and interosseous muscles. Physical examination can also demonstrate a positive Tinel sign, defined as the "pins and needle feeling" elicited by tapping on the nerve proximally, with resulting paresthesia experienced in the corresponding distal cutaneous distribution of the injured peripheral nerve.
