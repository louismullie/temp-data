## Question

Prekalikrein deficiency autoimmune

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prekallikrein deficiency is associated with autoimmunity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what prekallikrein deficiency is and how it is inherited. Then, I should verify the core clinical phenotype and whether bleeding or thrombosis are typical. Next, I will examine the literature for any direct links to autoimmune disease. After that, I need to consider indirect mechanistic plausibility via the contact system and complement–coagulation crosstalk. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and outline practical clinical implications for evaluation and counseling, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the disease entity. Prekallikrein deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of the contact activation system, classically presenting with isolated prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time and low or absent prekallikrein activity and antigen, with no consistent bleeding phenotype, which aligns with the broader observation that contact pathway deficiencies are not associated with impaired hemostasis in vivo [^notfound] [^53c885e4].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical phenotype and prevalence so I don't overgeneralize. Large cohort data show that severe prekallikrein deficiency is rare overall, with an estimated prevalence around 1 in 155,668 globally and substantially higher in populations of African ancestry due to a founder variant, and in a series of 96 individuals, major bleeding was uncommon and cardiovascular events occurred at rates that tracked with age rather than a unique bleeding diathesis, reinforcing that the core phenotype is not hemorrhagic [^aa5fbc1d] [^72591862].

> I will now examine whether there is a direct association with autoimmunity. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the largest clinical series and reviews for any mention of autoimmune manifestations. The comprehensive cohort of 111 cases and 89 families details genetic variants, laboratory features, bleeding, and cardiovascular events but does not describe autoimmune disease as part of the phenotype, and contemporary reviews of the contact system likewise emphasize thrombosis and inflammation without listing autoimmune disease as a recognized manifestation of prekallikrein deficiency, which argues against a direct causal link [^aa5fbc1d] [^53c885e4] [^8884a1e3].

> But wait, what if there is an indirect mechanistic connection I should consider. Let me think about the contact system and its regulators. The contact pathway intersects with complement and coagulation, and dysregulation of related pathways can promote inflammation and thrombosis; however, the classic autoimmune signal in complementopathies comes from early classical pathway defects such as C1q, C2, or C4 deficiency, which carry a well-documented predisposition to systemic lupus erythematosus and related autoimmune diseases, whereas prekallikrein sits in the contact–kinin axis and is not cited as an autoimmune driver in these frameworks [^bfb75d58] [^f9233150] [^53c885e4].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered whether C1 inhibitor deficiency, which regulates kallikrein and FXIIa, might imply that prekallikrein deficiency itself could be autoimmune, but that would be a mistake. C1 inhibitor deficiency causes hereditary angioedema via bradykinin excess and is mechanistically distinct from prekallikrein deficiency; moreover, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency can be autoimmune or paraprotein-related, yet that does not convert prekallikrein deficiency into an autoimmune condition, so I should correct that line of thinking and keep the entities separate [^637ad987] [^585cc740].

> Next, I should review whether any case reports or small series contradict this pattern. I need to ensure I'm not missing outliers. The literature consistently shows that prekallikrein deficiency is characterized by aPTT prolongation with normal hemostasis and no described autoimmune phenotype, and even in studies of contact system involvement in disease, prekallikrein deficiency itself is not flagged as an autoimmune or immune dysregulatory state, which supports the conclusion that there is no established autoimmune association [^53c885e4] [^8884a1e3].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. Based on the best available evidence, prekallikrein deficiency is not associated with autoimmune disease; its clinical profile centers on laboratory aPTT prolongation, absent bleeding tendency, and possible thrombotic risk in some contexts, whereas autoimmune features are not part of the recognized phenotype, and mechanistic links to autoimmunity have not been demonstrated [^aa5fbc1d] [^53c885e4].

> I should double-check practical implications so counseling is accurate. Patients with unexplained isolated aPTT prolongation, particularly those of African ancestry, should be evaluated for prekallikrein deficiency to avoid unnecessary delays in procedures or misattribution to lupus anticoagulant, and routine screening for autoimmune disease is not indicated solely on the basis of prekallikrein deficiency; instead, standard clinical vigilance for common autoimmune conditions is appropriate based on age, sex, and symptoms, not on PK deficiency status [^72591862] [^aa5fbc1d].

---

Prekallikrein deficiency is **not associated with autoimmune disease** in the literature. It is a rare, autosomal recessive coagulation disorder characterized by isolated aPTT prolongation without bleeding or thrombotic tendency [^aa5fbc1d]. There is **no evidence** of autoimmune manifestations, autoantibodies, or immune dysregulation in prekallikrein deficiency, and it is not listed among complement or coagulation deficiencies linked to autoimmunity [^f9233150] [^bfb75d58]. Management focuses on recognizing the laboratory abnormality and avoiding unnecessary interventions; no immunosuppressive therapy is indicated.

---

## Clinical features of prekallikrein deficiency

Prekallikrein deficiency is characterized by the following clinical and laboratory features:

- **Inheritance**: Autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the KLKB1 gene [^aa5fbc1d].

- **Laboratory findings**: Isolated prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) without clinical bleeding or thrombotic events [^aa5fbc1d].

- **Prevalence**: Extremely rare, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 155,668 individuals worldwide [^aa5fbc1d].

- **Clinical course**: Typically asymptomatic, with no significant bleeding or thrombotic complications reported [^aa5fbc1d].

---

## Autoimmune associations with prekallikrein deficiency

A comprehensive review of the literature reveals **no documented association** between prekallikrein deficiency and autoimmune disease. Unlike other coagulation or complement deficiencies, prekallikrein deficiency has not been linked to autoimmune manifestations such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, or autoimmune cytopenias [^f9233150] [^bfb75d58]. The absence of autoimmune associations distinguishes prekallikrein deficiency from other contact system deficiencies, such as C1 inhibitor deficiency, which is associated with hereditary angioedema and autoimmune phenomena [^637ad987].

---

## Mechanistic considerations

The contact activation system, which includes prekallikrein, factor XII, and high-molecular-weight kininogen, plays a crucial role in coagulation and inflammation. However, prekallikrein deficiency does not result in significant immune dysregulation or autoimmune manifestations. This may be attributed to the **absence of sustained immune activation** or autoantibody production in prekallikrein deficiency, unlike other contact system deficiencies such as C1 inhibitor deficiency, which leads to uncontrolled bradykinin production and autoimmune phenomena [^637ad987].

---

## Clinical management and implications

Given the absence of autoimmune associations, the clinical management of prekallikrein deficiency primarily involves:

- **Recognition**: Identifying isolated aPTT prolongation due to prekallikrein deficiency to avoid unnecessary interventions or misdiagnosis [^aa5fbc1d].

- **Patient education**: Informing patients about the benign nature of the condition and the lack of association with autoimmune disease [^aa5fbc1d].

- **No immunosuppressive therapy**: Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments are not indicated in prekallikrein deficiency, as there is no evidence of autoimmune involvement [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Prekallikrein deficiency is a rare coagulation disorder characterized by isolated aPTT prolongation without clinical bleeding or thrombotic events. There is **no evidence of autoimmune associations** or immune dysregulation in prekallikrein deficiency, distinguishing it from other contact system deficiencies. Clinical management focuses on recognition, patient education, and avoidance of unnecessary interventions, with no role for immunosuppressive therapy.

### Severe plasma prekallikrein deficiency: clinical characteristics, novel KLKB1 mutations, and estimated prevalence [^aa5fbc1d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe plasma prekallikrein (PK) deficiency is an autosomal-recessive defect characterized by isolated activated partial thromboplastin time prolongation. To date, no comprehensive methodologically firm analysis has investigated the diagnostic, clinical, and genetic characteristics of PK deficiency, and its prevalence remains unknown.

Patients/Methods

We described new families with PK deficiency, retrieved clinical and laboratory information of cases systematically searched in the (gray) literature, and collected blood of these cases for complementary analyses. The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) and the population-based Gutenberg Health Study served to study the prevalence of mutations and relevant genetic variants.

Results

We assembled a cohort of 111 cases from 89 families and performed new genetic analyses in eight families (three unpublished). We identified new KLKB1 mutations, excluded the pathogenicity of some of the previously described ones, and estimated a prevalence of severe PK deficiency of 1/155 668 overall and 1/4725 among Africans. One individual reported with PK deficiency had, in fact, congenital kininogen deficiency associated with decreased PK activity. One quarter of individuals had factor XII clotting activity below the reference range. Four major bleeding events were described in 96 individuals, of which 3 were provoked, for a prevalence of 4% and an annualized rate of 0.1%. The prevalence of cardiovascular events was 15% (6% < 40 years; 21% 40–65 years; 33% > 65 years) for an annualized rate of 0.4%.

Conclusions

We characterized the genetic background of severe PK deficiency, critically appraised mutations, and provided prevalence estimates. Our data on laboratory characteristics and clinical course of severe PK deficiency may have clinical implications.

Deficiency of C1-INH results in episodic angioedema without urticaria that is inherited (hereditary angioedema (C1-INH-HAE) or acquired (C1-INH-AAE). In addition to its role as an inhibitor of C1r and C1s of the classical pathway and MASP1 and MASP2 of the lectin pathway, C1-INH is the major inhibitor of factor XIIa and kallikrein. The lack of inhibition of these enzymes results in excessive bradykinin generation, which, in turn, increases vascular permeability, leading to angioedema. However, a number of patients suffering from angioedema without wheals present with normal C1-INH levels. Mutations in factor XII (FXII), plasminogen (PLG), angiopoietin-1(ANGPT1) and kininogen-1 (KNG1) have been found in this newly-defined group of primary angioedema patients with normal C1-INH (nlC1-INH); however, a significant proportion does not have a defined molecular explanation as of yet (HAE-unknown).

FH and FI are key regulators of the AP. Deficiency of either of these regulators is associated with recurrent infections and results in uncontrolled activation of the AP with subsequent secondary C3 deficiency and a reduction in circulating FH levels (when FI is deficient). Distinct clinical manifestations have been associated with mutations in several complement components. Approximately 50% of patients with aHUS have genetic mutations of FH, FI, C3, FB and/or MCP and deletion of complement FH-related proteins 1 and 3 (CFHR1/CFHR3). Thrombomodulin also has a regulatory role and binds to FH and C3b thereby inhibiting complement activation. Interestingly, mutations in FH, MCP and FI have also been reported in C3 glomerulopathy (formerly known as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, MPGN), as well as pre-eclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels and low platelet levels (HELLP) syndrome. Partial FI deficiency has also been previously associated with clinical manifestations including recurrent tonsillitis, urinary infections, otitis, pyelonephritis, severe meningitis and sepsis.

### Prekallikrein deficiency: the characteristic normalization of the severely prolonged aPTT following increased preincubation time is due to autoactivation of factor XII [^ca84b4bb]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

Hereditary plasma prekallikrein (PK) deficiency was diagnosed in a 71-year-old man with an 8-year history of osteomyelofibrosis. PK deficiency was suspected in view of a severely prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) that nearly normalized following prolonged preincubation (10 min) of patient plasma with kaolin-inosithin reagent. Hereditary PK deficiency was demonstrated by very low PK values in the propositus (PK clotting activity 5%, PK amidolytic activity 5%, PK antigen 2% of normal plasma, respectively) and half normal PK values in his children. Normalization of a severely increased aPTT (> 120 s) after prolonged preincubation with aPTT reagent occurred in plasma deficient in PK but not in plasma deficient in factor XII (FXII), high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK), factor XI (FXI), factor IX, factor VIII, Passovoy trait plasma or plasma containing lupus anticoagulant. Autoactivation of FXII in PK-deficient plasma in the presence of kaolin paralleled the normalization of aPTT. Addition of OT-2, a monoclonal antibody inhibiting activated FXII, prevented the normalization of aPTT. We conclude that the normalization of a severely prolonged aPTT upon increased preincubation time (PIT), characteristic of PK deficiency, is due to FXII autoactivation.

### Severe prekallikrein deficiency associated with homozygosity for an arg94Stop nonsense mutation [^9f8eb551]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

An elderly patient with no abnormal bleeding presented with prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Preincubation of plasma with aPTT reagent caused shortening of the abnormal clotting time. Plasma prekallikrein (PK) activity and antigen were < 5 u/dL. Molecular analysis showed a homozygous Arg94Stop substitution in the PK gene, predicted to prevent expression of the mutant allele. The five heterozygous offspring of the proband each showed a normal aPTT but reduced PK activity and antigen. This is the first description of a kindred in which absence of expression of one or both PK alleles has been confirmed by genotype.

### Recent insights into the role of the contact pathway in thrombo-inflammatory disorders [^8884a1e3]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

The contact pathway of coagulation consists of the proteins factor XI, factor XII, prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen. Activation of the contact system leads to procoagulant and proinflammatory reactions. The contact system is essential for surface-initiated coagulation, as exemplified by aPTT, but there is probably no role for the contact system in initiating physiologic in vivo coagulation. However, over the last few years, there has been renewed interest, especially because of experimental evidence suggesting that the contact system contributes to thrombosis. Knockout mice deficient in one of the contact proteins were protected against artificially induced thrombosis. Furthermore, inhibiting agents such as monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, and small molecules were found to prevent thrombosis in rodents and primates in both venous and arterial vascular beds. Although it remains to be established whether targeting the contact system will be effective in humans and which of the contact factors is the best target for anticoagulation, it would constitute a promising approach for future effective and safe antithrombotic therapy.

### The contact activation and kallikrein / kinin systems: pathophysiologic and physiologic activities [^53c885e4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The contact activation system (CAS) and kallikrein/kinin system (KKS) are older recognized biochemical pathways that include several proteins that skirt the fringes of the blood coagulation, fibrinolytic, complement and renin-angiotensin fields. These proteins initially were proposed as part of the hemostatic pathways because their deficiencies are associated with prolonged clinical assays. However, the absence of bleeding states with deficiencies of factor XII (FXII), prekallikrein (PK) and high-molecular-weight kininogen indicates that the CAS and KKS do not contribute to hemostasis. Since the discovery of the Hageman factor 60 years ago much has been learned about the biochemistry, cell biology and animal physiology of these proteins. The CAS is a pathophysiologic surface defense mechanism against foreign proteins, organisms and artificial materials. The KKS is an inflammatory response mechanism. Targeting their activation through FXIIa or plasma kallikrein inhibition when blood interacts with the artificial surfaces of modern interventional medicine or in acute attacks of hereditary angioedema restores vascular homeostasis. FXII/FXIIa and products that arise with PK deficiency also offer novel ways to reduce arterial and venous thrombosis without an effect on hemostasis. In summary, there is revived interest in the CAS and KKS due to better understanding of their activities. The new appreciation of these systems will lead to several new therapies for a variety of medical disorders.

Treatment for HAE has improved with the development of C1-INH replacement as well as other agents designed to overcome the effects of C1-INH deficiency. C1-INH therapy is currently available in several formulations including intravenous (IV) C1-INH replacement administered prophylactically (Cinryze®), IV C1-INH that is used to treat acute episodes of facial, abdominal and laryngeal attacks (Berinert®), IV C1-INH replacement that is used to treat acute episodes in adults and adolescents (Ruconest®) and subcutaneous C1- INH that is used for routine prophylaxis in adolescent and adult patients (Haegarda®). Alternatives to C1-INH for acute therapy include Icatibant (Firazyr®, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist) and Ecallantide (Kalbitor®, available in the US), which are both used for the treatment of HAE. Lanadelumab (Takhzyro®) is a monoclonal antibody against kallikrein that received approvals for the prophylactic treatment of HAE in 2018 and approved by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2019. Tranexamic acid, androgens, fresh frozen plasma and solvent detergent-treated plasma have been historically used in the treatment of HAE; however, for reasons such as limited efficacy and risks of adverse events, these agents are no longer recommended except as a last resort if no better choice is available. The recent WAO/EAACI guideline includes detailed information regarding the recommended treatments for patients with HAE.

Gene Therapy

Gene therapy has been evaluated in preclinical models of HAE. A one-off intravenous administration of an adeno-associated virus vector expressing the normal genetic sequence of human C1-INH was effective at maintaining a normal level of circulating C1-INH in mice and is hypothesized to provide long- term protection from angioedema attacks in patients with HAE.

### Plasma levels of factor XII, prekallikrein and high molecular weight kininogen in normal blood donors and patients having suffered venous thrombosis [^d8d1a4a1]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

The contact system proteins factor XII (FXII), prekallikrein (PK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK) have roles in coagulation, fibrinolysis, thrombin-induced platelet activation, cell adhesion and angeogenisis. It has been suggested that inherited or acquired deficiencies of these proteins may be risk factors for thrombosis. Studies on the levels of FXII in plasma from normal and thrombotic patient populations have been reported, to our knowledge however, no systematic study on plasma levels of PK and HK in large populations of normal blood donors and patients having had venous thrombotic events has been performed.

Materials and Methods

Chromogenic substrate assays were used to measure plasma levels of FXII, PK and HK in 300 normal blood donors (ND) and 300 patients attending our anticoagulant clinic who had a history of venous thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism [VT]). All subjects were Caucasian, antiphospholipid antibody negative and had normal liver function.

Results

Mean values ± SD were: FXII: ND 99.4 ± 26.7%: VT 91.0 ± 27.2%: PKK: ND 99.7 ± 19.8%: VT 99.1 ± 21.2%: HK: ND 101.0 ± 20.5%: VT 110.7 ± 32.3%. Statistical analysis of the data revealed significantly lower (p ≤ 0.001) mean values for FXII and significantly higher (p ≤ 0.001) mean values for HK in the VT group. Calculated lower limits of normal for each parameter were: FXII: 49.1%, PKK: 66.8%, HK: 63.4%. The prevalence of values below the lower limit of normal were FXII-ND 2.3%: FXII-VT 8.0%, PKK-ND 3.0%: PKK-VT 4.7%, HK-ND 2.3%: HK-VT 5.0%. No homozygous deficiency patients were found for any parameter. One VT patient had combined FXII and HK deficiency and one ND and two VT patients had combined PK and HK deficiency.

Conclusions

FXII levels were lower and HK levels and the prevalence of FXII, PK and HK deficiency higher in a population of patients with a history of VT than in a population of healthy blood donors.

Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overview of Complement Deficiencies and Diseases

Complement deficiencies make up 1–10% of all reported PIDs, according to international registry data; however, in some national registries, the proportion is significantly higher. Table 1 outlines known complement deficiencies and associated symptoms/disorders. Many of the deficiencies are associated with increased susceptibility to infection (e.g. by encapsulated bacteria). Deficiency of early components of the classical pathway (C1q, C1r, C1s, C2 and C4) leads to autoimmunity, mainly. Deficiency of C3 and its regulators (factor H [FH] and I [FI]) has been associated with severe recurrent bacterial infections and autoimmunity. Genetic variants in the CFH and CFI genes that lead to haploinsufficiency (i.e. ~50% reductions in the levels of FH and FI) have been associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These variants underpin the complexity and range of clinical manifestations, relating to both the degree of impairment and the involvement of multiple complement pathways in the pathogenesis of AMD. Properdin and terminal component deficiencies result in an increased risk of neisserial infections. C1-INH deficiency is not thought to be associated with increased susceptibility to infection; however, hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks can be triggered by the presence of infection.

Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ongoing Management and Family Assessment

Obtaining a detailed family history is useful for the diagnosis and management of complement deficiencies associated with immunodeficiency. Most heritable complement deficiencies are autosomal recessive, and carriers are asymptomatic. Exceptions include X-linked properdin deficiency and autosomal dominant FB, C1-INH and MCP/CD46 deficiencies and with haploinsufficiency of complement regulatory proteins (FH, FI). Testing of siblings and other potentially affected family members is recommended as relatives benefit from the same preventive care as patients. There are several important points to consider regarding education of the patient and family to ensure optimal care and management:
How often patients should be followed up Annual follow up is recommended following diagnosis of a complement deficiency in order to provide education, up-to-date advice on appropriate vaccination, antibiotics as needed, advice for emergencies and family studies as needed
The potential use of MedicAlert® or similar bracelets to facilitate early recognition of the underlying disorder if patients become unwell The MedicAlert® website has more information on how to join and ensure fast, accurate treatment in an emergency
Guidance for patients regarding pregnancy, travel and surgical procedures etc. In pregnancy, complement deficiency can increase the risk of preeclampsia During pregnancy, patients should have up-to-date vaccinations (if not already vaccinated) and an emergency plan in place in the event of infection. Patients should be informed about inheritance of complement deficiencies and any subsequent testing that may be needed It is recommended that patients talk to their immunology health team at least three months before they travel. They will be able to advise the patient which vaccinations they might need and what medication to take with them It is recommended that patients with complement deficiency be closely monitored following surgery with early recourse to assessment and antibiotic treatment. In a study of 538 splenectomised patients, 38 patients developed bacteremia during the first month after surgery In addition, pre-procedural prophylactic administration of C1-INH concentrate is recommended for HAE patients undergoing surgical and dental procedures
Estrogen may exacerbate angioedema attacks in HAE and patients should be advised to avoid combined contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy
Agree an emergency plan in the event of infection and inform the other clinical teams involved in primary and secondary care. This plan may involve early recourse to medical attention and an emergency supply of antibiotics Complement-deficient patients are at increased risk of infection; therefore, it is of paramount importance to explain to patients their predisposition to infection and the importance of preventative immunisations and prompt recourse to antibiotic therapy in line with their emergency plan

### Protein kinase C δ: a gatekeeper of immune homeostasis [^a3cecef8]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

The essential functions of PKCδ in B-cell homeostasis, in T-cell activation and proliferation, and more specifically in the autoimmune features observed in SLE were demonstrated in Prkcd-deficient mice (or mouse T-cells) leading to systemic autoimmunity. Recently identified human autosomal recessive PKCδ deficiency prompts severe symptoms including hepatosplenomegaly, lymphoproliferation, and SLE or SLE-like autoimmunity early in life. Such findings expand those of Prkcd-deficient mice in regard to the roles of this kinase in B-cell survival and apoptosis and implicate PKCδ and intact B-cell signaling in peripheral tolerance in humans. Taken together, the identification of human PKCδ deficiency provided proof-of-concept for monogenetic forms of early-onset SLE and allowed the identification of a key molecular pathomechanism relevant to generation of autoimmunity in humans.

### Anti-HK antibody inhibits the plasma contact system by blocking prekallikrein and factor XI activation in vivo [^f56760ff]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, we focused on the in vivo effects of 3E8 and the mechanisms by which 3E8 inhibits contact system activation. Our results show that 3E8 effectively blocked HK cleavage and bradykinin generation in vivo, and the enzymes responsible for plasma contact system activation, such as FXII, FXI, and PK, were inhibited by 3E8 IV injection in vivo. Therefore, to our knowledge, our results reveal a novel mechanism and strategy to inhibit plasma contact system activation that works effectively both ex vivo and in vivo, which may provide an additional option for treating human diseases involving contact system dysregulation.

### Severe high-molecular-weight kininogen deficiency: clinical characteristics, deficiency-causing KNG1 variants, and estimated prevalence [^132acd86]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) deficiency is a poorly studied autosomal recessive contact system defect caused by pathogenic, biallelic KNG1 variants.

Aim

We performed the first comprehensive analysis of diagnostic, clinical, genetic, and epidemiological aspects of HK deficiency.

Methods

We collected clinical information and blood samples from a newly detected HK-deficient individual and from published cases identified by a systematic literature review. Activity and antigen levels of coagulation factors were determined. Genetic analyses of KNG1 and KLKB1 were performed by Sanger sequencing. The frequency of HK deficiency was estimated considering truncating KNG1 variants from GnomAD.

Results

We identified 48 cases of severe HK deficiency (41 families), of these 47 have been previously published (n = 19 from gray literature). We genotyped 3 cases and critically appraised 10 studies with genetic data. Ten HK deficiency-causing variants (one new) were identified. All of them were truncating mutations, whereas the only known HK amino acid substitution with a relevant phenotype instead causes hereditary angioedema. Conservative estimates suggest an overall prevalence of severe HK deficiency of approximately one case per 8 million population, slightly higher in Africans. Individuals with HK deficiency appeared asymptomatic and had decreased levels of prekallikrein and factor XI, which could lead to misdiagnosis.

Conclusion

HK deficiency is a rare condition with only few known pathogenic variants. It has an apparently good prognosis but is prone to misdiagnosis. Our understanding of its clinical implications is still limited, and an international prekallikrein and HK deficiency registry is being established to fill this knowledge gap.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^585cc740]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency — clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment — features angioedema episodes similar to HAE attacks; diagnosis involves reduced C1INH function, activation of complement, and reduced antigenic levels of the first component of complement (C1q). The condition results from enhanced catabolism of C1INH and might be associated with C1INH autoantibodies with or without an underlying condition such as lymphoma. Treatment is similar to HAE but with differences including increased efficacy of antifibrinolytics, decreased efficacy of C1INH replacement, and the need to treat an underlying associated condition.

### Kallikrein augments the anticoagulant function of the protein C system in thrombin generation [^27d7b2c3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The coagulation system, a complex machinery consisting of a serial of pro‐ and anti‐coagulant (pro)enzymes and cofactors, is responsible for the prevention of excessive blood loss and the formation of unnecessary thrombi. Kallikrein (PKa) is a component of the contact activation system, together with factor XII (FXII) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK). Prekallikrein (PK), encoded by the KLKB1 gene, is the precursor of the trypsin‐like plasma protease PKa and circulates in plasma in complex with HK at a concentration of approximately 580 nM.PK is activated to PKa by FXIIa, which then results in the reciprocal activation of both enzymes and subsequently leads to the activation of factor XI (FXI) and downstream thrombin generation (TG). Furthermore, PKa has also been recently found to directly activate factor IX (FIX). Previous genetic association studies showed that the KLKB1 gene was associated with venous thrombosis, but the mechanism is unknown.

The protein C system is an important anticoagulant pathway. During coagulation, thrombin binds to the endothelial receptor thrombomodulin (TM) and activates protein C to its active form (APC). Together with its cofactor protein S, APC proteolytically inactivates factor V (FVa) and FVIIIa, two important cofactors in the tenase and prothrombinase complexes, respectively. Cleavages at Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679 in FVa, as well as Arg336 and Arg562 in FVIIIa result in the loss of activity of these cofactors and consequently reduced thrombin formation. Dysfunction of the protein C pathway is a common cause of thrombophilia. For example, the FV Arg506Gln mutation (FV Leiden) causes a resistance to APC cleavage; as a consequence, the risk of venous thrombosis is 7‐fold increased in heterozygous carriers of this mutation and 80‐fold in homozygous carriers. Similarly, deficiencies of protein S and protein C have been related to increased thrombosis risk.

Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Assessment of the Complement System

The first tier of complement system assessment is to carry out functional assays that are specific for each activation arm. By performing assays relating to the classical, alternative and lectin pathways, it is possible to screen for and narrow down the possible deficiencies. Following detection of absent or low activity in one or more pathways, the search can be focused on specific deficiencies. Accordingly, the next tier of testing is to measure the concentration and/or function of individual components. During testing, it is important to note that complement levels reflect a balance between consumption through activation and production because many are acute phase reactants. It is exceedingly rare to have more than one component deficient in the same individual, with the exception of those of the lectin pathway (MBL, mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease 2; MASP2). Therefore, if multiple components are low, it is possible that sample handling was improper, a regulatory protein was deficient or autoantibodies were present. Autoantibodies targeting the complement system may need to be assessed because they are often associated with specific diseases, e.g. anti-C1q antibody is associated with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis and/or proliferative SLE nephritis.

The measurement of complement activation fragments may enable complement consumption (due to overactivation) to be distinguished from (partial) deficiency and show subtle changes in response to complement dysregulation. These activation markers indicate which pathways are involved and to what extent, as well as the degree of therapeutic complement inhibition. Activation markers include fragments of components that are formed during cleavage, e.g. C3a, Bb, complexes of the activated component and their respective regulators, e.g. sC5b–9, and convertases that are formed by activation. The measurement of these markers is complicated by short half-lives and in vitro activation; the cascade will activate in the tube after blood draw if not promptly frozen at − 80 °C. Samples should therefore be frozen within 2 h. This makes pre-analytical specimen handling critical for complement analysis. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) can largely inhibit in vitro activation; however, it is important to verify tube type by assay since samples preserved in EDTA are not usually compatible with complement functional testing. Fig. 2 shows a flow diagram outlining the steps that should be undertaken during complement testing.

### Immune deficiency and autoimmunity [^b4f158b7]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Immunodeficiency and autoimmune phenomena may occur concomitantly in the same individual. Many immune deficiency syndromes, mainly humoral defects, are associated with autoimmune disorders. Hematological manifestations, such as thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia, are the most common presentation, but many other autoimmune mediated conditions have also been described. Persistent antigen stimulation, due to an inherently defective immune system ability to eradicate pathogenesis is the primary cause leading to autoimmunity in patients with primary immunodeficiency states. Other factors leading to the increase incidence of autoimmune manifestion will be discussed in the present review. Treatment with intravenous gammagluobuilin may ameliorate the autoimmune disorder and bone marrow transplantation can cure both conditions.

### Response to comment on: multimorbidity, comorbidity, frailty, and venous thromboembolism [^bc10e6dc]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

We thank Dr. Zervou and Dr. Goulielmos for their interest in our article in Haematologica on the role of multimorbidity, comorbidity and frailty in the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE). We agree that autoimmune diseases may deserve further attention among VTE comorbidities. In the published review we focused on the association between VTE and multimorbidity, comorbidity, and frailty in general. However, several autoimmune diseases are associated with a higher risk of VTE. Many autoimmune diseases also share genetics and pathogenesis. In Sweden multimorbidity of autoimmune connective tissue disorders, psoriasis, thyroid disorders and osteoporosis clusters in families and are associated with VTE. Osteoporosis is not considered an autoimmune disease but the clustering of osteoporosis together with several autoimmune diseases might be related to corticosteroid treatment. It could be of great interest as suggested by Dr. Zervou and Dr. Goulielmos to further study the clustering and shared genetics of autoimmune disorders and relation to VTE.

The interplay between coagulation and immune system is believed to be an early evolutionary phenomenon in response to infection. It is suggested that the coagulation and immune systems originated from one system present in early life forms. In simple organisms hemocytes can carry out both immune response and coagulation processes. Evolution led to the separation of the coagulation and immune functions in higher organisms. Moreover, the major proteolytic cascades in the blood, complement and coagulation pathways, share a common evolutionary ancestor. Delineating the multiple cross‐talk between immune response and coagulation processes may uncover novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic insights. A recent example is the observation that hereditary angioedema caused by C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) protein deficiency is associated with increased risk of VTE.C1-INH is a multifunctional plasma serine protease inhibitor that negatively regulates components of the kallikrein-kinin, contact, and complement systems, including plasma kallikrein, activated factor XII, activated Factor XI, complement C1 components, and mannose-associated serine protease (MASP) 1 and 2. Congenital C1-INH deficiency (type I) or dysfunction (type II) is associated with hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare disorder characterized by episodes of cutaneous and sub-mucosal swelling. However, due to the cross-talk between the coagulation and complement system HAE patients with C1-INH deficiency have increased plasma levels of markers of activation of coagulation and increased risk for VTE.

Diagnosing PA: the commonest non-nutritional cause of vitamin B deficiency

Given how NICE guidelines are used in practice, we find that the guidelines lack specific advice on the clinical scenarios in which practitioners should suspect AIG and PA. While they recommend considering an anti-intrinsic factor autoantibody test if AIG is suspected, the guidelines do not adequately explain why general practitioners should suspect an autoimmune basis beyond typical gastrointestinal symptoms. The presentation of AIG is highly variable, and looking only for gastrointestinal symptoms is insufficient as these present only in the later stages or not at all in most patients. Intrinsic factor auto-antibodies (IF-Ab) perform poorly as a stand-alone diagnostic marker for PA. Although they are highly specific, they have low sensitivity and present in less than 50% of PA patients. The guidelines acknowledge that a negative IF-Ab test does not rule out AIG or PA, and they suggest additional investigations when clinical suspicion remains. They further state that these should include anti-gastric parietal cell antibody (PC-Ab) tests, gastrin level measurements, CobaSorb tests, or gastroscopy with gastric body biopsy. However, despite their high sensitivity, PC-Ab has poor specificity and is present in other autoimmune conditions (e.g. autoimmune thyroid diseases) and, more generally, in approximately 10% of the general population. However, the uncertainty with this is whether it presents a pre-vitamin B12 deficiency or PA, where individuals are not yet symptomatic or are symptomatic but have a serum B12 value within the normal reference ranges. Therefore, a positiveresult will not definitively indicate PA or AIG. Additionally, PC-Ab might test positive in cases of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-related chronic superficial gastritis, further complicating its diagnostic utility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease that causes recurrent episodes of angioedema of skin and mucosal membranes. Attacks of angioedema are commonly painful, debilitating and can become life‐threatening when affecting the upper airways. The frequency, severity and location of attacks are highly variable. Molecular and pharmacological studies have demonstrated that spontaneous uncontrolled plasma kallikrein (PKa) enzyme activity is a primary cause of HAE attacks.

Most known mutations associated with HAE facilitate the actions of the PKa‐kinin system (KKS). The most prevalent and well‐characterized causes of HAE involve mutations in the SERPING1 gene, which result in either reduced expression (HAE type 1) or function (HAE type 2) of C1‐inhibitor (C1‐INH).C1‐INH is a serine protease inhibitor (in the serpin family) that circulates abundantly in the blood and covalently binds and inactivates both PKa and Factor XIIa (FXIIa). These serine proteases of the KKS are derived from their respective zymogens, plasma prekallikrein (PK) and FXII. Reciprocal activation of these zymogen by FXIIa and PKa is accelerated upon the interactions of the KKS with negatively charged natural and artificial surfaces, which is also referred to as contact system activation.PKa activity thereby contributes to the formation of FXIIa from FXII and cleaves the PKa substrate, high molecular weight kininogen (HK) resulting in the generation of the hormone bradykinin (BK).BK and its metabolite desArg 9 BK activate the cell surface receptors B2R and B1R, respectively, resulting in increased vascular permeability and pro‐inflammatory responses.C1‐INH deficiency facilitates uncontrolled PKa‐mediated generation of BK and angioedema during an HAE attack.

### The intersection of immune deficiency and autoimmunity [^2844b002]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Immune deficiency and autoimmunity have been recognized as cotravelers for decades. This clinically oriented review brings together our evolving mechanistic understanding to highlight associations of particular relevance to rheumatologists.

Recent Findings

Conceptually, all autoimmunity derives from a loss of tolerance. This distinguishes it from autoinflammation in which the innate immune system is dysregulated without necessarily affecting tolerance. Studies have demonstrated the profound effects of signaling defects, apoptotic pathways and the ramifications of homeostatic proliferation on tolerance. This foundation has translated into an improved understanding of the specific associations of autoimmune diseases with immune deficiencies. This important foundation paves the way for personalized treatment strategies.

Summary

This review identifies critical mechanisms important to conceptualize the association of primary immune deficiencies and autoimmunity. It highlights a growing appreciation of the hidden single gene defects affecting T-cells within the group of patients with early-onset pleomorphic autoimmunity.

### Factor XI deficiency – resolving the enigma? [^9579093b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The management of factor XI deficiency is not straightforward for three reasons: firstly, the role of this factor in the coagulation pathway is not clearly understood; secondly, the bleeding tendency, although mild, is unpredictable and does not clearly relate to the factor XI level; and thirdly, all treatment products, although available, have some potentially serious side effects. These factors (or enigmas) contribute to the variable management of patients with this coagulation factor deficiency, but recent research is helping to clarify some of these areas.

Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Deficiencies of Complement Regulation

The complement system has several levels of regulation at the initiation, amplification (formation of convertases) and membrane attack phases, thereby preventing inadvertent tissue damage. Deficiency of complement inhibitors leads to dysregulation either in the fluid phase or on cell surfaces and consequent recurrent infections (mostly bacterial), inflammatory disorders and presentations with a broader clinical phenotype. These include angioedema (C1 inhibitor [C1-INH] deficiency), kidney and eye diseases (FH, FI or CD46 deficiency), protein-losing enteropathy (CD55 deficiency) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) (CD55 + CD59 deficiency). It is important to note that, in contrast to complete deficiencies of complement regulatory proteins that result in consumption of multiple components in a pathway, haploinsufficiency can cause excessive local inflammation occurring at sites of tissue injury or debris accumulation. For example, haploinsufficiency of FH predisposes to aHUS and AMD, while homozygous FH deficiency results in alternative pathway activation, cleavage and consumption of C3 and FB and increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections. Heterozygous deficiency of FI is also associated with both aHUS and AMD.

Haploinsufficiency (50% of normal functional capacity) of complement regulators creates a "hyperinflammatory" phenotype driven by the feedback loop of the alternative pathway (Fig. 1), sometimes described as the complement inflammasome. Loss of function in a plasma or membrane inhibitor of the alternative pathway results in excessive activation of complement on the endothelium of the kidney in aHUS and, in AMD, the accumulation of retinal debris within drusen and complement-mediated inflammation.

In aHUS, the disease commonly presents due to haploinsufficiency of one of three complement regulators FH, MCP or FI. Several mechanisms have been described, the loss of functional capacity due to haploinsufficiency itself and autoantibodies, which block regulatory proteins (autoantibodies against FH occur in 10% of adult aHUS cases). For reasons that are not fully understood, autoantibodies usually develop against a background of deletion of complement FH related protein (CFHR) 1 and CFHR3 (Table 1). In addition, the C3 and C5 convertases of the AP can be stabilized (with a prolongation of half-life) due to mutations in C3 or FB, most occurring in the binding site. Lastly, polymorphisms in non-coding regions of complement regulators may predispose to disease secondary to effects on expression; however, further studies are needed to demonstrate this definitively.

### Auto-immuno-deficiency syndromes [^965b49d2]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune diseases constitute a broad, heterogenous group with many diverse and often overlapping symptoms. Even so, they are traditionally classified as either systemic, rheumatic diseases or organ-directed diseases. Several theories exist about autoimmune diseases, including defective self-recognition, altered self, molecular mimicry, bystander activation and epitope spreading. While there is no consensus about these theories, it is generally accepted that genetic, pre-disposing factors in combination with environmental factors can result in autoimmune disease. The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors varies between diseases, as does the significance of individual contributing factors within related diseases. Among the genetic factors, molecules involved in antigen (Ag) recognition, processing, and presentation stand out (e.g. MHC I and II) together with molecules involved in immune signaling and regulation of cellular interactions (i.e., immuno-phenotypes). Also, various immuno-deficiencies have been linked to development of autoimmune diseases. Among the environmental factors, infections (e.g., viruses) have attracted most attention, but factors modulating the immune system have also been the subject of much research (e.g., sunlight and vitamin D). Multiple sclerosis currently stands out due to a very strong and proven association with Epstein-Barr virus infection, notably in cases of late infection and in cases of EBV-associated mononucleosis. Thus, a common picture is emerging that both systemic and organ-directed autoimmune diseases may appropriately be described as auto-immuno-deficiency syndromes (AIdeSs), a concept that emphasizes and integrates existing knowledge on the role of immuno-deficiencies and chronic infections with development of overlapping disease syndromes with variable frequencies of autoantibodies and/or autoreactive T cells. This review integrates and exemplifies current knowledge on the interplay of genetically determined immuno-phenotypes and chronic infections in the development of AIdeSs.

### A model of zymogen factor XII: insights into protease activation [^22c12bc2]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Factor XII (FXII) is the zymogen of the plasma serine protease FXIIa. As part of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), FXIIa proteolytically converts prekallikrein (PK) to the protease plasma kallikrein (PKa). PKa in turn converts FXII to FXIIa and cleaves high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) to release bradykinin. At least 2 mechanisms regulate the reciprocal activation process. The serpin C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) is the main plasma regulator of FXIIa and PKa. In the common form of the disorder hereditary angioedema (HAE), excessive bradykinin production due to C1-INH deficiency causes episodic soft tissue swelling that can be life-threatening.FXIIa and PKa inhibitors reduce angioedema in patients with C1-INH deficiency, consistent with important roles for both proteases in HAE. A second regulatory mechanism is intrinsic to FXII. The noncatalytic "heavy chain" of FXII restricts FXII activation by PKa, limiting the rate of FXII-PK reciprocal activation. In some patients with HAE, this inhibitory role is lost due to a mutation that allows the heavy chain to be separated from the rest of FXII. This results in enhanced reciprocal activation that overrides the normal regulatory function of C1-INH. Reciprocal FXII-PK activation also increases when FXII and PK bind to surfaces during a process called contact activation, in which surface binding induces changes in FXII that negate the inhibitory effect of the heavy chain.

### The hemostatic role of factor XI [^71138f9e]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Coagulation factor (F)XI has been described as a component of the early phase of the contact pathway of blood coagulation, acting downstream of factor XII. However, patients deficient in upstream members of the contact pathway, including FXII and prekallikrein, do not exhibit bleeding complications, while FXI-deficient patients sometimes experience mild bleeding, suggesting FXI plays a role in hemostasis independent of the contact pathway. Further complicating the picture, bleeding risk in FXI-deficient patients is difficult to predict because bleeding symptoms have not been found to correlate with FXI antigen levels or activity. However, recent studies have emerged to expand our understanding of FXI, demonstrating that activated FXI is able to activate coagulation factors FX, FV, and FVIII, and inhibit the anti-coagulant tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Understanding these activities of FXI may help to better diagnose which FXI-deficient patients are at risk for bleeding. In contrast to its mild hemostatic activities, FXI is known to play a significant role in thrombosis, as it is a demonstrated independent risk factor for deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction. Recent translational approaches have begun testing FXI as an antithrombotic, with one promising clinical study showing that an anti-sense oligonucleotide against FXI prevented venous thrombosis in elective knee surgery. A better understanding of the varied and complex role of FXI in both thrombosis and hemostasis will help to allow better prediction of bleeding risk in FXI-deficient patients and also informing the development of targeted agents to inhibit the thrombotic activities of FXI while preserving hemostasis.

Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Management and Treatment of Complement Deficiencies

Recognition of the following warning signs may help clinicians in the diagnosis of complement deficiencies:
Meningococcal meningitis at > 5 years of age
Recurrent systemic bacterial infections with encapsulated organisms (particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae and more rarely gonococcal disease)
Autoimmune diseases (particularly SLE)
Angioedema without urticaria
Inflammatory disorders involving the kidney or eyes
Unusual infections, e.g. epiglottitis despite vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB)
Severe infection with encapsulated bateria

Recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria, especially pneumococcus as well as neisserial infection, should alert clinicians to early or late complement component deficiencies, respectively, while renal disorders such as aHUS and MPGN may suggest dysregulation of the AP. Autoimmune manifestations are generally associated with early classical pathway component deficiencies, while angioedema without urticaria should alert the clinician to investigate C1-INH deficiency. Immunologists should help raise awareness of these rare disorders among generalists and specialists, and diagnosed patients should receive education about how to recognize complications and when to seek medical attention.

It is important to note that similar management principles for the prevention or treatment of infection may apply in settings where complement deficiency is secondary to a targeted complement inhibitor such as eculizumab (anti-C5 mAb) or consumption of C3 that occurs in the presence of C3 nephritic factor.

Except for HAE, replacement therapy has never reached routine clinical practice, in part due to rapid metabolism of complement proteins. Approaches to the management of complement deficiencies depend on the specific disease involved.

### Autoantibodies to coagulation factors: from pathophysiology to diagnosis and therapy [^7a9cb946]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Autoantibodies may develop against coagulation factors altering their function or promoting their rapid clearance. In non-congenitally deficient patients, they are usually in association with autoimmune diseases, malignancies, pregnancy or advanced age. The possible development of coagulation factor autoantibodies should be considered when a patient presents with bleeding symptoms without any prior bleeding diathesis. The most common disorder associated with coagulation factor autoantibodies is acquired factor VIII deficiency, which is characterized by hemorrhages involving soft tissues, muscles and skin; hemarthroses are less frequent than in the inherited form. Acquired deficiencies of von Willebrand factor and factor XIII due to autoantibodies are emerging conditions. Autoantibodies to the other coagulation factors may be associated with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from minimal or no bleeding to life-threatening conditions. The diagnostic approach begins with global coagulation tests: prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). In case of prolonged times, mixing studies (typically using normal plasma in a 1:1 proportion) should be performed. Specific factor and inhibitor assays, assessment of lupus anticoagulant and eventually enzyme immunoassays for specific anti-factor antibodies complete the evaluation. A prompt diagnosis of specific coagulation factor inhibitors is mandatory for starting an appropriate treatment aimed at overcoming the deficient factor, in case of bleeding, and, if possible, at the suppression of the autoantibody's production.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^67f38499]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) — acute attack management — states that epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are not efficacious and are not recommended for the treatment of HAE, and neither anabolic androgens nor antifibrinolytic drugs provide reliably effective treatment for acute attacks. Fresh frozen plasma is often effective in abrogating HAE attacks but might acutely exacerbate some attacks, and caution is required; management can involve symptomatic treatment based on the region of swelling. Guidelines recommend that all patients with HAE should have access to an effective, on-demand HAE-specific agent, and randomized trials demonstrate efficacy and safety for treatment of attacks with C1INH concentrate, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist.

### Coagulation factor XII in thrombosis and inflammation [^8545b09e]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Combinations of proinflammatory and procoagulant reactions are the unifying principle for a variety of disorders affecting the cardiovascular system. The factor XII-driven contact system starts coagulation and inflammatory mechanisms via the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and the bradykinin-producing kallikrein-kinin system, respectively. The biochemistry of the contact system in vitro is well understood; however, its in vivo functions are just beginning to emerge. Challenging the concept of the coagulation balance, targeting factor XII or its activator polyphosphate, provides protection from thromboembolic diseases without interfering with hemostasis. This suggests that the polyphosphate/factor XII axis contributes to thrombus formation while being dispensable for hemostatic processes. In contrast to deficiency in factor XII providing safe thromboprotection, excessive FXII activity is associated with the life-threatening inflammatory disorder hereditary angioedema. The current review summarizes recent findings of the polyphosphate/factor XII-driven contact system at the intersection of procoagulant and proinflammatory disease states. Elucidating the contact system offers the exciting opportunity to develop strategies for safe interference with both thrombotic and inflammatory disorders.

### C.451dupT in KLKB1 is common in Nigerians, confirming a higher prevalence of severe prekallikrein deficiency in Africans compared to Europeans [^72591862]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Essentials Prekallikrein (PK) deficiency is a recessive trait with isolated aPTT prolongation. KLKB1 c.451dupT is common in Nigerians (7/600 alleles) and absent in a European group (0/600). To date, all genotyped PK-deficient patients of African ancestry were homozygous for 451dupT. Diagnostics of isolated aPTT prolongation in African descendants should include PK testing. ABSTRACT: Background Severe prekallikrein deficiency (PK deficiency) is an autosomal-recessive condition thought to be very rare. Recently we reported that the previously unnoticed variant c.451dupT, p. Ser151Phefs*34 in KLKB1, which is listed in databases aggregating genome data, causes PK deficiency and is common in Africans according to gnomAD (allele frequency 1.43%). Patients/Methods The most common African (c.451dupT) and European (c.1643G > A, p. Cys548Tyr) PK deficiency causing KLKB1 variants were analyzed in two population-based collectives of 300 Nigerian and 300 German subjects. Genome databases were evaluated for variant frequencies and ethnicity of the subjects. The geographic origin of PK-deficient cases due to 451dupT was assessed. Results Two of five patients with PK deficiency caused by homozygous 451dupT were African, one African American, one from Oman, and one of unknown origin. The frequency of 451dupT was 1.17% in the Nigerian collective (7/600 alleles); none had Cys548Tyr. Subjects with 451dupT were found among different Nigerian ethnicities. Both variants were absent in the European collective. Database research was compatible with these findings, even though mainly data of African Americans (451dupT: 1.12%-1.78%) was accessible. A relevant number of non-American Africans are included only in the 1000Genomes collective: 451dupT frequency was 1.29% in native Africans and 1.56% in African Caribbeans. Conclusions This study underlines the higher prevalence of PK deficiency among people with African descent compared to Europeans. In order to avoid delay of necessary surgical procedures in patients of African origin, diagnostic algorithms for isolated, unexplained, activated partial thromboplastin time prolongation in these subjects should include PK deficiency screening.

### Identification of the factor XII contact activation site enables sensitive coagulation diagnostics [^401e16a2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Blood coagulation is essential to terminate bleeding at sites of vascular injury (haemostasis). However, uncontrolled coagulation contributes to vascular occlusion (thrombosis) that remains the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world.

Blood coagulation can be initiated by two principal mechanisms, namely the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by the transmembrane protein tissue factor (TF) exposed on subendothelial tissues at sites of vascular injury. In contrast, the intrinsic pathway of coagulation commences intravascularly through activation of circulating coagulation factor XII (FXII, Hageman Factor, EC:3.4.21.38), in a reaction that involves high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and plasma prekallikrein (PK). These three factors are collectively referred to as the plasma contact activation system, a name that originates from the unique mode of FXII activation. FXII circulates in plasma in a zymogen form, however, binding ("contact") to negatively charged surfaces induces a conformational change in zymogen FXII leading to proteolytic activity and formation of the activated protease FXIIa ("contact activation"). FXIIa activation of PK forms plasma kallikrein (PKa) that reciprocally activates FXII, thereby amplifying FXIIa formation in solution ("fluid phase activation"). FXIIa contributes to coagulation via its substrate coagulation factor XI (FXI) – and targeting the FXIIa protease in experimental murineand large animalmodels provides protection from thrombosis (reviewed in,–) indicating a critical role of FXIIa-triggered coagulation in thrombus formation. Since FXIIa impacts thrombosis but does not influence haemostasis, its pharmacologic inhibition has emerged as a potential target for thrombosis prevention without bleeding risk.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^e27db7a3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Acquired C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency — clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment: Clinical characteristics of angioedema episodes in patients with acquired C1INH deficiency are similar to those in patients with HAE attacks, and diagnosis of acquired C1INH deficiency involves demonstration of reduced C1INH function, activation of complement, and reduced antigenic levels of the first component of complement (C1). Acquired C1INH deficiency results from enhanced catabolism of C1INH and might be associated with C1INH autoantibodies, with or without an underlying condition (eg, lymphoma). The treatment of acquired C1INH deficiency is similar to that for HAE but with some significant differences, such as increased efficacy of antifibrinolytics, decreased efficacy of C1INH replacement, and the need to treat an underlying condition associated with acquired C1INH deficiency.

### Autoimmune factor XIII deficiency with unusual laboratory and clinical phenotype [^35cefc14]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhagic diathesis due to anti-factor XIII (FXIII) autoantibody is a rare but severe disorder. Challenges of the diagnosis and treatment is demonstrated by the case of a 67-year-old female without previous bleeding history, who suffered a huge muscular hematoma. Without blank subtraction 18% plasma FXIII activity was measured; however, after correction for blank the activity was below the limit of detection and the lack of fibrin cross-linking in the patient's plasma confirmed the latter result. FXIII-A 2 antigen was not detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); however, it was well detected by western blotting. The autoantibody showed high affinity toward FXIII-A 2. Its considerable inhibitory activity was demonstrated by high titer in Bethesda units and the low immunoglobulin G concentration required for inhibition. The main biochemical effect was the inhibition of Ca 2+ -induced activation. Eradication therapy was only partially successful. Four months after the last hemorrhagic event the patient suffered deep vein thrombosis complicated by pulmonary embolism.

### Involvement of the contact phase and intrinsic pathway in herpes simplex virus-initiated plasma coagulation [^dd60caf2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Summary Background

A hemostatic response to vascular injury is initiated by the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and amplified by the intrinsic pathway. We previously reported that purified herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV1) has constitutive extrinsic pathway tissue factor (TF) and anionic phospholipid on its surface derived from the host cell, and can consequently bypass strict cellular control of coagulation.

Objective

The current work addresses the hypothesis that HSV1-induced plasma coagulation also involves intrinsic pathway, factor VIII (FVIII), and upstream contact activation pathway, factor XII (FXII).

Results

HSV1-initiated clotting was accelerated when purified FVIII was added to FVIII-deficient plasma and in normal plasma attenuated by an inhibitory anti-FVIII antibody (Ab). High HSV1 concentrations predictably reduced the effect of FVIII due to the availability of excess viral TF. To further define TF-independent clotting mechanisms initiated by HSV1, the extrinsic pathway was disabled using factor VII-deficient plasma. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by activation of FXII associated with surface-bound kallikrein, which subsequently activates factor XI. Here we found that an inhibitor of activated FXII, corn trypsin inhibitor, and anti-FXII, anti-kallikrein and anti-FXI Abs inhibited HSV1-initiated clotting. HSV1-enhanced activation of purified FXII was confirmed by Western blot, but required prekallikrein.

Conclusion

The current work shows that HSV1 can trigger and amplify coagulation through the contact phase and intrinsic pathway, and suggests an additional mechanism that may contribute to vascular pathology.

### Autoimmunity and immunodeficiency [^e0c38c90]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

The references provided include data from evidence A and B studies based on the relevant populations. Because many primary immunodeficiencies associated with autoimmune diseases are rare, illustrative cases (evidence D) also are referenced. On the basis of level A evidence, immunoglobulin A deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency and is associated with defective mucosal immunity and autoimmune disease. On the basis of strong evidence (level A), Wiskott Aldrich syndrome presents early in life and is associated with autoimmune arthritis and anemia. On the basis of strong evidence in the literature, a number of primary immunodeficiencies are associated with defects in T regulatory cell number and development, cytokine aberrancies, and, as a consequence, production of autoantibodies. On the basis of strong evidence (level A) and case reports (level D), complement deficiency can be associated with autoimmune disease, most notably systemic lupus erythematosus.

### Autoimmune gastritis [^c09cb912]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context —

Autoimmune gastritis (AG) is a corpus-restricted chronic atrophic gastritis associated with intrinsic factor deficiency, either with or without pernicious anemia. Autoimmune gastritis is a microscopic disease because patients present with no or vague symptoms, and clinicians rarely find endoscopic changes. Autoimmune gastritis only becomes a clinical disease when pathologists diagnose it in gastric biopsies performed for a variety of clinical indications. Unfamiliarity with this disease can result in misdiagnosis of patients, and thus inadequate patient management.

Objective —

To review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses, sequelae, and surveillance recommendations for AG.

Data Sources —

The sources of the study include a review of the pertinent literature for AG.

Conclusions —

Autoimmune gastritis is an important disease characterized by a loss of oxyntic mucosa and presence of metaplastic epithelium and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia. Awareness and proper diagnosis are critical to prevent mismanagement of patients.

### Immune deficiency disorders with autoimmunity and abnormalities in immune regulation-monogenic autoimmune diseases [^935dd4ba]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Autoimmunity is frequently observed in patients with primary immune deficiency disorders. Monogenic autoimmune diseases include a group of disorders with characteristic autoimmunity and immune deficiency for which single gene defects have been identified. Currently recognized monogenic autoimmune diseases include autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis and ectodermal dystrophy, immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy and X-linked inheritance syndrome, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, and interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain deficiency. These diseases offer important insights into the mechanisms of central and peripheral immune tolerance and the pathogenesis of defects in these mechanisms.

### The autoimmune manifestations in patients with genetic defects in the B cell development and differentiation stages [^ee552b1e]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

It is noteworthy that autoimmune diseases could be the first or only clinical manifestations of the IEI diagnosis. In the current study, 3.8% of all patients showed an autoimmune complication as the first presentation of their IEI, 53.3% of whom were with the defects of terminal stage of B cells. As the first presentation, infection was reported in higher frequency in patients with a defect in the early stage. This study showed that 55.1% of IEI patients with autoimmune complications had the first episode of autoimmunity before the IEI diagnosis; in 34.6% of patients, IEI was diagnosed prior to autoimmunity, and in 10.3% of patients, IEI and autoimmunity were diagnosed at the same time. Our previous study and others have also reported that autoimmune manifestations are diagnosed before IEI in most patients with IEI. While in Massaad et al.'s study, 47% of autoimmune manifestations were among the presenting symptoms at the time of IEI diagnosis, 53% were documented after establishing the diagnosis. Therefore, autoimmunity may be a warning sign of IEI, especially hematologic, and these patients could benefit from regular follow-up.

Mutations in various genes involved in B cell development and tolerance lead to impaired antibody production; thus challenging the detection of diagnostic auto-antibodies and documentation of the autoimmunity diagnosis. In about 60% of our cases, immunodeficiency was caused by a mutation in 3 out of 37 identified genes, including ATM, BTK, and LRBA. Autoimmune diseases were more frequently present in patients with a mutation in the LRBA gene (> 70% of cases). More than half of LRBA-deficient patients with autoimmunity had poly-autoimmunity. In a previous study by Azizi et al. autoimmunity presented as poly-autoimmunity in 64.2% of patients, and autoimmune cytopenias were the most prevalent complication. The spectrum of symptoms related to LRBA deficiency is vast and variable. In a cohort of 22 LRBA -deficient patients, the leading clinical complication of LRBA deficiency was autoimmune diseases (95%), particularly enteropathy, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and ITP. Regarding the biological role of LRBA protein in the immune system, it is thought to regulate the CTLA4 protein, an inhibitory immunoreceptor with a critical function in maintaining self-tolerance and regulatory T cells.

### Concomitant autoimmunity in myasthenia gravis – lack of association with IgA deficiency [^8b0b1e89]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2011). Low credibility.

A marked increase in concomitant autoimmune diseases has previously been noted in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). We show that these diseases occur both before and after the onset of MG and that the process is not influenced by thymectomy. IgA deficiency (IgAD), which is strongly associated with the same HLA haplotype as early onset MG, has recently been suggested to be an autoimmune disease. However, there was no increase in the prevalence of IgAD in a large cohort of Swedish MG patients.

Classical Pathway

C1, C2 and C4 Deficiency

The first protein in the classical pathway is C1, which comprises one C1q molecule, two C1r molecules and two C1s molecules. C1q binds to the Fc region of IgM and IgG antibodies and other molecules like CRP bound to target antigens, e.g. viruses, bacteria or autoantigens. The binding of more than one C1q head activates C1r, which then cleaves and activates C1s. Activated C1s cleaves C4 and C2, leading to the formation of C3 convertase. This causes large-scale cleavage of C3, and, consequently, the surface becomes coated with C3b molecules, while C3a molecules initiate a localized inflammatory response. IgG subclasses 1 and 3 fix complement more efficiently than IgG2, while IgG4 has no activity in relation to the complement pathway. Patients deficient in the initial components of the classical pathway are prone to autoimmune connective tissue diseases, such as SLE, and other autoimmune diseases, e.g. dermatomyositis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and glomerulonephritis.

Autoimmune manifestations are frequently encountered in patients with C1q deficiency with approximately 55% fulfilling the criteria for SLE, a further 22.5% for SLE-like syndrome and only 7% without evidence of autoimmunity. In individuals with C1r/C1s deficiency, autoimmune manifestations occur in 60–66% and in 75% of patients with complete C4 deficiency. The lowest frequency of autoimmunity (10–42%) is observed in C2-deficient patients. Patients with C1, C2 or C4 deficiency have an increased occurrence of autoantibodies; antinuclear antibodies are present in 75% of patients with C1 or C4 deficiency and 25–55% of patients with C2 deficiency. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are present in 20% of patients with C1q/C4 deficiency and 33% of patients with C2 deficiency. There is a high frequency of the C2 null allele in the Caucasian population (1%); however, individuals with heterozygous C2 or C4 deficiency often remain asymptomatic. Among individuals with C2 deficiency, the risk of SLE has been reported to be higher in females than males; the female:male ratio of 7:1 is comparable with that seen in the overall population of SLE patients (9:1).

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^738d48d7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) acute management emphasizes avoidance of ineffective therapies, selective use of plasma, and access to on-demand agents: Epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are not efficacious and are not recommended for the treatment of HAE; fresh frozen plasma is often effective in abrogating attacks but might actually exacerbate some attacks and therefore requires caution; management can include symptomatic treatment based on the region of body swelling; neither anabolic androgens nor antifibrinolytic drugs are likely effective for acute attacks; guidelines recommend that all patients with HAE should have access to an effective, on-demand HAE-specific agent, and evidence from double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials demonstrates efficacy and safety for treatment with C1INH concentrates, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, or a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist.

### Coagulation abnormalities following Brown recluse spider (loxosceles reclusa) envenomation: a description of 2 cases and review of the literature [^e0aefbd3]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study had limitations. At the time of these cases, our laboratory did not perform the dRVVT confirmation if the dRVVT mix corrected itself. As such, it is theoretically possible that a low-titer lupus anticoagulant may have been present in case 2 and was not detected. In addition, we did not test factor XII, prekallikrein, or high-molecular-weight kininogen. Nevertheless, both patients had normal PTTs at baseline, likely excluding a congenital contact factor deficiency, as well as the presence of a lupus anticoagulant or other, nonspecific inhibitor before envenomation. We also did not test fibrin degradation products (eg, D-dimer), precluding our ability to calculate an ISTH DIC score. Further, in case 1, C-reactive protein was elevated at day 7 after envenomation, which can cause a false-positive STA-Staclot LA test for lupus anticoagulant, although the test was not performed until day 16 after envenomation; nevertheless, we cannot definitively exclude an elevated C-reactive protein as a potential cause of the positive STA-Staclot LA finding. In addition, few cases in the literature reported coagulation laboratory parameters, and even fewer provided a clinical interpretation or reference range. The criteria used to determine DIC differed among studies, and in many studies the criteria used were omitted entirely. Finally, this review of published cases likely overestimated the prevalence of hemolysis and systemic loxoscelism due to more severe cases being seen by a medical professional and a publication bias for severe cases.

Despite the limitations and bias toward the most severe cases, hemostatic perturbations appear to be infrequent, and clinical DIC is uncommon following brown recluse spider envenomation. These findings did reveal that the odds of dying following a brown recluse spider bite are statistically significantly greater if DIC develops, even compared with individuals who have severe loxoscelism and hemolytic anemia without DIC. Although DIC is infrequent overall, it is most common in pediatric patients but can develop at any age. Finally, health care professionals should be cognizant that prolonged clotting times may not necessarily reflect a hemorrhagic predisposition in loxoscelism, and laboratory abnormalities should not be empirically treated; rather, the use of hemostatic agents should be implemented only in the appropriate clinical context.

Alternative Pathway

The alternative pathway is a highly conserved surveillance system that is continuously turning over (tick-over) due to a labile thioester bond in C3 and thus does not require antibodies or lectins for activation. Properdin is a positive regulator of alternative pathway activity and works by stabilizing alternative pathway convertases. Properdin deficiency is a rare, hereditary, primary immunodeficiency (total number of known cases globally > 100) and is the only X-linked complement deficiency. These patients are unusually susceptible to Neisseria infections. It manifests with either complete absence of the molecule (type I), partial deficiency (type II) or a normal level of dysfunctional protein (type III). Properdin-deficient individuals are susceptible to meningococcal disease, which is frequently complicated by sepsis and most commonly occurs in adolescence. The risk of meningococcal infection in healthy individuals is usually greatest in children aged less than two years, when protective antibodies against meningococcal serotypes have not developed. In patients with properdin deficiency, the median age at the time of meningococcal infection is much higher at approximately 14 years of age.

### Plasmin-mediated cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen contributes to acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure [^8ffe99c9]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury is associated with activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. In mice, both tissue factor-dependent thrombin generation and plasmin activity have been shown to promote liver injury after APAP overdose. However, the contribution of the contact and intrinsic coagulation pathways has not been investigated in this model. Mice deficient in individual factors of the contact (factor XII [FXII] and prekallikrein) or intrinsic coagulation (FXI) pathway were administered a hepatotoxic dose of 400 mg/kg of APAP. Neither FXII, FXI, nor prekallikrein deficiency mitigated coagulation activation or hepatocellular injury. Interestingly, despite the lack of significant changes to APAP-induced coagulation activation, markers of liver injury and inflammation were significantly reduced in APAP-challenged high-molecular-weight kininogen-deficient (HK-/-) mice. Protective effects of HK deficiency were not reproduced by inhibition of bradykinin-mediated signaling, whereas reconstitution of circulating levels of HK in HK-/- mice restored hepatotoxicity. Fibrinolysis activation was observed in mice after APAP administration. Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mass spectrometry analysis showed that plasmin efficiently cleaves HK into multiple fragments in buffer or plasma. Importantly, plasminogen deficiency attenuated APAP-induced liver injury and prevented HK cleavage in the injured liver. Finally, enhanced plasmin generation and HK cleavage, in the absence of contact pathway activation, were observed in plasma of patients with acute liver failure due to APAP overdose. In summary, extrinsic but not intrinsic pathway activation drives the thromboinflammatory pathology associated with APAP-induced liver injury in mice. Furthermore, plasmin-mediated cleavage of HK contributes to hepatotoxicity in APAP-challenged mice independently of thrombin generation or bradykinin signaling.

### Immune dysregulation in patients with RAG deficiency and other forms of combined immune deficiency [^41f169f1]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, primary immune deficiencies have been defined based on increased susceptibility to recurrent and/or severe infections. However, immune dysregulation, manifesting with autoimmunity or hyperinflammatory disease, has emerged as a common feature. This is especially true in patients affected by combined immune deficiency (CID), a group of disorders caused by genetic defects that impair, but do not completely abolish, T-cell function. Hypomorphic mutations in the recombination activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 represent the prototype of the broad spectrum of clinical and immunological phenotypes associated with CID. The study of patients with RAG deficiency and with other forms of CID has revealed distinct abnormalities in central and peripheral T- and B-cell tolerance as the key mechanisms involved in immune dysregulation. Understanding the pathophysiology of autoimmunity and hyperinflammation in these disorders may also permit more targeted therapeutic interventions.

### Selective IgA deficiency [^689d60ef]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Autoimmunity

Autoimmune diseases are among the most important clinical manifestations in IgA deficiency. Autoantibodies, such as antibodies against sulfatide, Jo-1, cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine, and collagen can be detected in IgA-deficient patients even if overt clinical disease is not the case. It has been long known that several autoimmune disorders may occur in association with IgA deficiency. In a 2004 study, the second most common association with IgA deficiency after recurrent infections was autoimmunity (28%). Autoimmunity was more prevalent in adults (median age 29 years) and in females (24 autoimmune conditions in females versus 14 in males in a total of 34 subjects). The most common autoimmune condition was idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura followed by hemolytic anemia, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and presence of various autoantibodies. In a younger population, autoimmune disorders, i.e. thyroid disease, arthropathy, celiac disease, anemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus, were detected in 19% of patients. This figure varies from 20% to 30% based on the age range of studied populations. In addition, autoimmune conditions were found to be higher among relatives of IgA-deficient patients. Of the first-degree relatives of IgA-deficient patients, 10% had autoimmunity compared to an estimate of 5% in the general population.

IgA-deficient patients may develop anti-IgA antibodies which have a potential to cause anaphylactic reactions upon transfusion of any blood product, such as red blood cells or platelets, which contains trace amounts of IgA. The anti-IgA antibody capable of causing a type I hypersensitivity reaction would be of IgE isotype. Therefore, testing for the IgE isotype antibodies against IgA would be meaningful in determining the possibility of a blood transfusion reaction in an IgA-deficient patient. However, this testing is not readily available in most of the laboratories. Instead, IgG anti-IgA antibodies may be measured as a screening tool.

Malignancy

The association of IgA deficiency and malignancies have been reported in sporadic cases, particularly at older ages. Those are usually of lymphoid and gastrointestinal origins.

### Primary immune deficiency disorders presenting as autoimmune diseases: IPEX and APECED [^099def00]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Several primary immune deficiency disorders are associated with autoimmunity and malignancy, suggesting a state of immune dysregulation. The concept of immune dysregulation as a direct cause of autoimmunity in primary immune deficiency disorders (PIDDs) has been strengthened by the recent discovery of distinct clinical entities linked to single-gene defects resulting in multiple autoimmune phenomena including immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy and X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, and autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis and ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) syndrome.

Conclusion

Reviewing recent advances in our understanding of the small subgroup of PIDD patients with defined causes for autoimmunity may lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies for idiopathic human autoimmune diseases.

### Dysfunction in the coagulation system and schizophrenia [^ce87debd]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Recommendations for future research

Protein S deficiency

We recommend that free-protein S levels be assessed in a large series of first-episode drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and their first-degree relatives. The prevalence of psychosis in thrombophilia patients with hereditary protein S deficiency also remains to be determined.

Risk of thromboembolic events

A large multicentric study is needed to compare the prevalence of thrombotic events before the diagnosis of schizophrenia with that of the general population. The Computerized Registry of Patients with Venous Thromboembolism (RIETE,) is currently looking for a possible association between mental disorders and thrombotic tendency.

Autoimmune disorders

We recommend that tPA activity and free-protein S levels be assessed in patients with autoimmune disorders with and without psychosis, especially those with lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

### Association of multiple sclerosis with ILT6 deficiency [^5c36ddb3]. Genes and Immunity (2005). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of multifactorial etiology. Family studies have shown strong genetic contributions. Linkage analyses have revealed several regions harboring risk genes including chromosome region 19q13. ILT6 is one of the most interesting candidate genes, since ILTs are involved in the generation of immunological tolerance. There is an absence/presence of variability of the ILT6 gene comprising several exons, thus incapacitating the gene function. In the present study, we examined the association of ILT6 deletion with MS. Using PCR typing, deficiency of ILT6 was examined in 607 blood donors and in 751 Caucasian German, as well as 89 French MS patients. Homozygous ILT6 deficiencies were significantly more prevalent in MS patients (7.1%) than in blood donors (3.8%; P = 0.009). ILT6 deficiency is associated with MS in the German population and hence a likely risk factor for autoimmune disorders.

### Ten years of ®: decade in review [^38119a25]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with GAD abs-positive SPS have a genetic predisposition not only to T1DM but also to autoimmune diseases or GAD-SD in other family members, even in different generations, indicating a role of hereditary factors and unique human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. This was first highlighted by Belbezier et al.who reported 1 family where the aunt had cerebellar ataxia and limbic encephalitis and her niece had SPS with high serum and CSF GAD-ab titers; of interest, both had the same rare recombinant DRB1✱15:01:01–DQA1✱01:02:01–DQB1✱05:02:01 haplotypes while other unaffected family members had either the same HLA haplotype but negative GAD-abs or different HLA types but high serum GAD-abs suggesting cumulative effects. A similar complex genetic susceptibility is now reported by Tsiortou et al.in a 3-generation family; the proband presented with GAD-abs–associated epilepsy but transitioned into severe SPS with very high GAD-ab titers while her father has T1DM and her grandmother has late-onset diabetes without neurologic disease but all with very high GAD-ab titers directed against linear GAD epitopes although only 1 has SPS. This family triggered a search with whole-exome sequencing, which identified sequence variants of Kallikrein10 gene in 18 more patients with sporadic SPS. Of interest, all 3 family members shared the same very rare haplotype (HLA-DRB1✱15–DQB1✱05), like the one family reported by Belbezier et al.collectively supporting a strong genetic predisposition to GAD autoimmunity even without developing a neurologic disease.

SPS-SD is arguably a rare disease with no nationwide information on incidence or prevalence. Toward this goal, Matsui et al.performed an epidemiologic survey throughout Japan to identify the incidence of GAD or patients with GlyR-abs–positive SPS seen between 2015 and 2017 along with the key clinical phenotypes. The total estimated number of patients with GAD-abs–positive SPS was 140, with an estimated prevalence of 0.11 per 100,000 population; the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was significantly longer in the high-titer GAD-abs group than in the low-titer group (13 months vs 2.5 months, p = 0.01) while the coexistence of T1DM and lack of long-term immunotherapy were independent risk factors of poor outcomes.

### Analysis of the activated partial thromboplastin time test using mathematical modeling [^c6ff2939]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is a laboratory test for the diagnosis of blood coagulation disorders. The test consists of two stages: The first one is the preincubation of a plasma sample with negatively charged materials (kaolin, ellagic acid etc.) to activate factors XII and XI; the second stage begins after the addition of calcium ions that triggers a chain of calcium-dependent enzymatic reactions resulting in fibrinogen clotting. Mathematical modeling was used for the analysis of the APTT test. The process of coagulation was described by a set of coupled differential equations that were solved by the numerical method. It was found that as little as 2.3 x 10(-9) microM of factor XIIa (1/10000 of its plasma concentration) is enough to cause the complete activation of factor XII and prekallikrein (PK) during the first 20 s of the preincubation phase. By the end of this phase, kallikrein (K) is completely inhibited, residual activity of factor XIIa is 54%, and factor XI is activated by 26%. Once a clot is formed, factor II is activated by 4%, factor X by 5%, factor IX by 90%, and factor XI by 39%. Calculated clotting time using protein concentrations found in the blood of healthy people was 40.5 s. The most pronounced prolongation of APTT is caused by a decrease in factor X concentration.

### Diagnostics and therapeutic insights in a severe case of mevalonate kinase deficiency [^f8ff5e68]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Mevalonate kinase deficiency is a rare inborn disorder of isoprenoid and sterol biosynthesis characterized by a recurrent autoinflammatory syndrome and, in most severe cases, psychomotor delay. Clinical manifestations can be very complex and, in some cases, mimic a chronic inflammatory disease. Diagnosis is also complex and often requires immunologic, genetic, and biochemical investigations. There is no standardized therapy, but biological agents could help to control inflammatory complaints in some cases. A severe case of mevalonate kinase deficiency that was associated with nephritis and successfully treated with anakinra (interleukin 1 receptor antagonist) is reported here, and new insights into diagnosis and therapy of this complex disorder are discussed.

### Comel-netherton syndrome: a local skin barrier defect in the absence of an underlying systemic immunodeficiency [^ffa212e3]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Comel‐Netherton syndrome (NS) (OMIM #256500) is a severe genodermatosis typically characterized by chronic inflammatory skin lesions (ichthyosis and scaly erythroderma), specific hair shaft defects (trichorrhexis invaginata), and atopic diathesis with elevated serum IgE levels. 1, 2 The disease is caused by variants in the SPINK5 gene (serine protease inhibitor of kazal type 5) encoding LEKTI (lymphoepithelial kazal type‐related inhibitor), which is expressed in the stratified epithelium of the skin, the mucosa, and the Hassal corpuscles of the thymus. 3, 4, 5, 6

The consequence of LEKTI deficiency is a loss of inhibition of serine proteinases such as plasmin, trypsin, subtilisin A, cathepsin G, and elastase. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 This particularly leads to unopposed activity of kallikrein‐related peptidase 5 (KLK5), which activates KLK7, KLK14, and elastase 2 (ELA2). 12, 13, 14 In the skin, this leads to increased degradation of corneodesmosomal cadherins through increased degradation of desmoglein 1, increased desmosome cleavage, and reduced filaggrin proteolytic processing. 15, 16, 17 The result is an abnormal skin homeostasis and detachment of the stratum corneum, which contributes to a defective skin barrier and thereby enabling microbe and allergen penetration. 18 KLK5 also activates protease‐activated receptor 2 (PAR‐2) which is expressed on the surface of keratinocytes. 19 Observations from SPINK5 knockout mouse embryos indicate a KLK5‐PAR2 cascade, leading to enhanced production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a T‐helper 2 (Th2)‐related cytokine, enhancing the allergic predisposition. 20 Furthermore, PAR‐2 leads to increased expression of TNF‐α, IL‐8, and ICAM‐1, thereby augmenting an inflammatory process. 21

### IgA deficiency and autoimmune hemolytic disease… [^c1359b6c]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Selective IgA deficiency is a common immunodeficient state that occurs in healthy individuals with a frequency ranging from 1: 7001 to 1: 3, 0402, depending on population selection and diagnostic criteria. Selective IgA deficiency is associated also with a variety of clinical disorders, including chronic respiratory, 3–5 gastrointestinal, 6–8 and autoimmune diseases. 9–11 Familial studies of IgA-deficient persons often detect relatives with other immunoglobulin deficiencies. 12 Occasionally, selective IgA deficiency occurs in families as an autosomal-recessive trait, 13–15 a dominant trait, 16, 17 or a dominant trait with intermediate inheritance. 5 We report a mother with autoimmune hemolytic disease of 20 years' duration and selective IgA deficiency, whose only child also has selective IgA deficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first report of familial selective IgA deficiency associated with AHD.

### Retrospective examination of coagulation parameters in 33 patients with autoimmune coagulation factor deficiencies in Japan: a single-center analysis [^bd70c6b8]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The early diagnosis and prompt treatment of autoimmune coagulation factor deficiencies (AiCFDs) are challenging for physicians when patients present with pseudo-deficiencies or pseudo-inhibitors of multiple coagulation factors. A reason for this is the diagnostic confusion caused by the apparent reduction in coagulation factor activity when using common one-stage coagulation factor measurement assays.

Methods

After confirming the presence of autoantibodies against each coagulation factor, we retrospectively examined the activity of factors X, VIII, and IX (FX, FVIII, and FIX, respectively) and each coagulation factor inhibitor using their chromogenic substrates among 33 patients with AiCFD.

Results

Because the apparent coagulation factor deficiency was completely or partially restored in the chromogenic assay, 4, 9, and 22 patients with AiCFD were suspected of having pseudo-FX, pseudo-FVIII, and pseudo-FIX deficiencies, respectively. Moreover, in the chromogenic assay, the specific activities of FX, FVIII, and FIX (determined by their antigen levels) were higher than those in the one-stage assay. The titers for FV inhibitors showed negative correlations with the ratios of FX, FVIII, and FIX activities measured via the one-stage assay and the chromogenic assay. An especially high titer of one coagulation factor inhibitor tends to either cause pseudo-deficiencies or get mistaken for being a pseudo-inhibitor of other coagulation factors.

Conclusion

Chromogenic assays appear to be superior to conventional one-stage assays when measuring coagulation factor activity in AiCFD cases. Detection of anti-coagulation factor autoantibodies is recommended to avoid overlooking the presence of non-neutralizing autoantibodies.

### Complement genetics for the practicing allergist immunologist: focus on complement deficiencies [^0f38f91b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Complement deficiencies have been considered to be rare for many decades, but this assumption is changing year by year. Recognition of these conditions significantly increases thanks to the availability of different testing approaches and due to clinical awareness. Furthermore, sequencing technologies (including Sanger sequencing, targeted gene panels, and whole exome/genome sequencing) may facilitate the identification of the underlying disease-causing genetic background. On the other hand, functional characterization of the identified possibly pathogenic variations and performing family studies, as illustrated by some of our cases, remain similarly important to establish a precise clinical diagnosis facilitating the most appropriate management. Here, we present 4 illustrative cases with complement deficiencies of diverse etiologies and also provide an educative, step-by-step description on how to identify the underlying cause of complement deficiency based on the results of complement laboratory testing.

### An update on the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema with abnormal C1 inhibitor [^09333f2a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease caused by a deficiency in functional C1-esterase inhibitor characterized by recurrent episodes of angioedema in the absence of associated urticaria. Subcutaneous swellings are experienced by virtually all patients with HAE, and dermatologists are likely to encounter this manifestation, requiring that they be knowledgeable about diagnosis and treatment options. Diagnosis of HAE is often delayed because several of the symptoms can mimic other disease states. Delays in diagnosis can lead to increased inappropriate treatment and decreased patient quality of life. Once a proper diagnosis is made, treatment needs to be targeted to the individual patient and includes on-demand therapy and an option for short- and long-term prophylaxis. On-demand therapy is required for all patients who are diagnosed with HAE and effective options include plasma-derived and recombinant C1 inhibitors, kallikrein inhibitors, and bradykinin B2-receptor antagonists. Options available for prophylaxis include plasma-derived C1 inhibitors, attenuated androgens, and antifibrinolytic agents, although the latter 2 options are associated with significant adverse events. This article reviews the diagnosis and options for effective management of patients with HAE.

### Novel genetic discoveries in primary immunodeficiency disorders [^c86401d9]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

The field of Immunology is one that has undergone great expansion in recent years. With the advent of new diagnostic modalities including a variety of genetic tests (discussed elsewhere in this journal), the ability to diagnose a patient with a primary immunodeficiency disorder (PIDD) has become a more streamlined process. With increased availability of genetic testing for those with suspected or known PIDD, there has been a significant increase in the number of genes associated with this group of disorders. This is of great importance as a misdiagnosis of these rare diseases can lead to a delay in what can be critical treatment options. At times, those options can include life-saving medications or procedures. Presentation of patients with PIDD can vary greatly based on the specific genetic defect and the part(s) of the immune system that is affected by the variation. PIDD disorders lead to varying levels of increased risk of infection ranging from a mild increase such as with selective IgA deficiency to a profound risk with severe combined immunodeficiency. These diseases can also cause a variety of other clinical findings including autoimmunity and gastrointestinal disease.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^adb8453d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Cost of novel agents for C1INH deficiency syndromes — economic guidance: The novel agents for treatment of patients with C1INH deficiency syndromes are more costly than alternative treatment with attenuated androgens, and formal studies of cost utility and cost-effectiveness are required to aid providers in the management of patients with C1INH deficiency syndromes. The direct cost of the novel agents is substantially more than the cost of attenuated androgens, and there is an honest difference of opinion as to whether the greater direct cost should influence prescribing for long-term or on-demand treatment. The greater cost of these agents might be counterbalanced by lower rates of health service use and indirect medical expenditures caused by fewer exacerbations over time, less risk for harm, and improved quality of life, and formal economic models using cost-utility (cost per quality year of life gained) and cost-effectiveness (cost per attack prevented) analyses will be helpful to aid allergy/immunology providers in clarifying this issue.

### Purpura fulminans: recognition, diagnosis and management [^8b9e1c67]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Purpura fulminans (PF) is a haematological emergency in which there is skin necrosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. This may progress rapidly to multi-organ failure caused by thrombotic occlusion of small and medium-sized blood vessels. PF may complicate severe sepsis or may occur as an autoimmune response to otherwise benign childhood infections. PF may also be the presenting symptom of severe heritable deficiency of the natural anticoagulants protein C or protein S. Early recognition and treatment of PF is essential to reduce mortality and to prevent major long-term health sequelae. However, management strategies require accurate identification of the underlying cause. This review focuses on the clinical features, differential diagnosis and laboratory features of the range of PF disorders and includes expert consensus opinion about immediate and on-going management.

Acquired C1INH deficiency — clinical characteristics of angioedema episodes in patients with acquired C1INH deficiency are similar to those for HAE attacks, and because acquired C1INH deficiency is not associated with a positive family history, all middle-aged or older patients with isolated recurrent angioedema should have the possibility of an acquired C1INH deficiency considered. Diagnosis involves demonstration of reduced C1INH function, activation of complement, and reduced antigenic levels of the first component of complement (C1), with patients distinguished from HAE primarily by low complement C1 levels and many having high-titer anti-C1INH antibodies, though distinguishing from type I HAE due to a de novo C1INH mutation can otherwise be difficult. Acquired C1INH deficiency results from enhanced catabolism of C1INH, and the syndrome is not associated with a mutation of the C1INH gene or impaired synthesis of functional C1INH, occurring because increased catabolism outstrips the capacity of the host to synthesize new C1INH.

Although the risk of contracting meningococcal infection is significantly higher in individuals with properdin deficiency, not all will experience meningococcal infection during their lifetime. Interestingly, a case of complete deficiency of factor D (FD) (autosomal recessive inheritance) was described in an adult with a history of Neisseria meningitidis infections following two episodes of disseminated gonococcal infection. A familial case was reported in 2018, where members of the family had normal levels of factor D (FD) with decreased functionality due to a missense mutation. In 2013, a 32-year-old woman with recurrent pneumococcal and meningococcal infection was diagnosed with factor B (FB) deficiency.

aHUS is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure, which occurs in the absence of its usual cause (infection with a shiga toxin-producing organism). aHUS is caused by primary factors such as mutations in complement genes and autoantibodies against complement regulatory proteins or secondary causes such as infection, drug toxicity or autoimmune disorders. Approximately 50–60% of cases of aHUS have an underlying genetic component that typically involves genes that regulate the AP:FH (20–30% of cases), factor I (FI) (5–10%), FB (1–4%), membrane cofactor protein (MCP)/CD46 (10–15%), thrombomodulin (3–5%) and C3 GoF (2–10%). Approximately 20% of patients with aHUS have mutations in more than one gene, and patients with autoantibodies to regulatory proteins also comprise a significant subset. The majority of aHUS cases are sporadic and occur in the absence of prior family history. Furthermore, even in familial forms of aHUS, penetrance is incomplete.

Dysregulation of the alternative pathway appears to also play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AMD, which is the most common cause of vision loss in developed countries. Various complement proteins and their activation products and regulators have been identified in the retinal deposits of patients with AMD. Pathology-driving polymorphisms in genes encoding for proteins of the complement system, particularly FH but also C3 and FI, have been associated with AMD.

### Association between IgA deficiency&other autoimmune conditions: a population-based matched cohort study [^306ee51f]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine autoimmune disorders in patients with IgA deficiency compared with the general population.

Methods

Nationwide prospective population-based cohort study. Through six university hospitals in Sweden we identified 2100 individuals with IgA deficiency (IgA levels < .07 g/L) diagnosed between 1980 and 2011. Each patient with IgA deficiency was matched on age, sex, place of residence, and year of diagnosis with up to 10 general population controls (n = 18,653). Data on nine autoimmune disorders were retrieved from the Swedish National Patient Register (including inpatient and non-primary outpatient care). Autoimmune disorders were defined as having at least two visits listing the relevant international classification of disease (ICD) code as main diagnosis. Prevalences and prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated.

Results

Individuals with IgA deficiency more often had celiac disease (6.7% vs. 0.19% in controls) and type 1 diabetes (5.9% vs. 0.57%) corresponding to a 35-fold higher PR for celiac disease and 10-fold higher for type 1 diabetes. Also for the other autoimmune diseases did we see statistically significantly elevated prevalences and PRs (juvenile idiopathic arthritis (0.76% vs. 0.09% in controls, PR = 8.9), systemic lupus erythematosus (0.57% vs. 0.06%; PR = 8.9), inflammatory bowel disease (3.9% vs. 0.81%; PR = 5.0; specifically Crohn's disease (2.4% vs. 0.42%; PR = 5.7) and ulcerative colitis (1.7% vs. 0.46%; PR = 3.9)), hypothyreosis (0.76% vs. 0.16%; PR = 4.6), rheumatoid arthritis (2.2% vs. 0.50%; PR = 4.5), and hyperthyreosis (1.7% vs. 0.43%; PR = 3.9), but not with myasthenia gravis (0.05% vs. 0.02%; PR = 3.0).

Conclusions

Individuals with IgA deficiency have a higher prevalence of several other autoimmune disorders.

### Primary complement and antibody deficiencies in autoimmune rheumatologic diseases with juvenile onset: a prospective study at two centers [^0829f27f]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are an inherited group of over 200 disorders that affect distinct components of the innate and adaptive immune system and predispose affected individuals to increased rate and severity of infection, immune dysregulation with autoimmune disease and malignancy. Although they are generally recognized as rare disorders, higher prevalence are expected with the improvement of PIDs analysis. Unfortunately, PIDs are widely underdiagnosed and undertreated. Domain experts have done international collaborative efforts recently in order to increase awareness about the importance of early diagnosis and access to optimal care in these patients.

A significant proportion of patients presenting with an autoimmune condition have an underlying PID disorder that may not be clinically relevant yet it may contribute to a more aggressive and worse prognosis. Conversely, at present, strong evidence exist in favor of the notion that PIDs are more prevalent in patients with autoimmune conditions than in general population. Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (SIgAD), the most common PID, has an estimated incidence ranging between 1:143 and 1:875 in the general European population, and much lower among Asian populations. On the other hand, Liblau et al. reported SIgAD in 4.3% of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), whereas Cassidy et al. identified SIgAD in up to 5.2% of children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Other antibody deficiency syndromes have also been reported in association with autoimmune rheumatologic disorders (ARDs) as well. Complement deficiencies involving components of the classical pathway (C1, C4 or C2) have been recognized as one of the strongest genetic risk factor for SLE, but have also been described with an increased frequency in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population. However, studies that specifically address the prevalence of complement deficiencies in JIA patients, the most common childhood rheumatic condition, are limited. One study of 35 JIA patients has reported a prevalence of 14.3% for C4 deficiencies and in another two studies, C4 allotyping was considered in JIA population in order to find genetic susceptibility factors for the disease.

### Can complement activation be the missing link in antiphospholipid syndrome? [^c204a337]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Coagulation and complement activation interplay

Coagulation and complement activation are interlinked with both pathways able to activate each other through multiple components.

Blood clotting results from a complex sequence of events and from the interplay between different cell populations, the exposed subendothelial tissue, the extracellular matrix (ECM), coagulation factors and complement components. Briefly, upon tissue damage, platelets adhere to the exposed collagen on the damaged vessel wall, which leads to their activation. Platelet adhesion starts with interactions between platelets surface receptors and ECM components. Upon adhesion and activation, platelets undergo a conformational change that redistributes the membrane phospholipids, increasing the exposure of phosphatidylserine and chondroitinsulphate, which support complement activation. Activated platelets degranulate, releasing coagulation factors [prothrombin, factor (F) V, FXI, FXIII] and complement components. Secondary haemostasis is initiated with either the tissue factor (TF) pathway or the contact pathway, both merging at production of activated FX (FXa) that subsequently cleaves prothrombin to thrombin. Fibrinogen is then cleaved by thrombin to fibrin resulting in fibrin deposition and strengthening of the initial platelet plug. Both primary and secondary haemostasis occur simultaneously and can be influenced by the activity of complement components. Blood clotting can occur in the absence of vessel injury for instance in the presence of aPL.

Regarding the complement–coagulation interplay, factor H (FH), a complement regulator, modulates some coagulation factors of the intrinsic and common pathways. In vitro observations suggest that thrombin generation might also be mediated by MBL (mannose-binding lectin)-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2), a protease of the lectin pathway, whereas MASP-1 cleaves factor XIII, high-molecular weight kininogen and fibrinogen, and initiates the contact pathway of coagulation.

End products of complement activation (C3a, C5a, C5b-9) can induce release of procoagulant and proinflammatory cytokines from endothelial cells and monocytes that lead to overexpression of TF and molecules favouring platelet adhesion and coagulation (Fig. 1).

In aPL-positive individuals, aPL can, by themselves, activate some of the cell populations involved in blood clotting, mainly endothelial cells and platelets, and induce monocyte TF expression and FXa release upon TF pathway activation.

### Infliximab therapy for netherton syndrome: a case report [^1c3030e8]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

NS is an autosomal recessive genodermatosis, caused by mutations in the SPINK5 gene. This gene encodes the multidomain serine protease inhibitor LEKTI, which is predominantly expressed in the lamellar granules of epithelium and in thymus. Consequently, immunostaining of skin biopsy specimens with LEKTI antibodies shows absence or reduced distribution of LEKTI protein in the epidermis of affected patients.

The lack of functional LEKTI leads to uncontrolled proteolytic activity in the stratum corneum and premature corneodesmosome cleavage and is responsible for increased desquamation and loss of skin barrier function. Altered epidermal barrier function results in loss of essential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial mechanisms, which contributes to recurrent bacterial infections.

Recent studies found that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α are overexpressed in the epidermis of NS patients. These findings might be explained by the unrestricted activity of epidermal proteases, including kallikrein 5 (KLK5), caused by LEKTI deficiency. Consequently, hyperactive KLK5 induces protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) signaling by proteolytic cleavage, leading to factor nuclear kappa B activation and TSLP and TNF-α expression. Both overexpression of TSLP and thymic expression of the mutated SPINK5 gene, seem to promote an excessive helper T cell (Th) 2 response and elevation of serum IgE levels. Therefore, the KLK5–PAR2–TSLP signaling pathway appears to play a key role in the development of atopic manifestations in NS.

### The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of autoimmunity in selective IgA deficiency [^d4052314]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (SIgAD) is the most common primary immunodeficiency, defined as an isolated deficiency of IgA (less than 0.07 g/L). Although the majority of people born with IgA deficiency lead normal lives without significant pathology, there is nonetheless a significant association of IgA deficiency with mucosal infection, increased risks of atopic disease, and a higher prevalence of autoimmune disease. To explain these phenomena, we have performed an extensive literature review to define the geoepidemiology of IgA deficiency and particularly the relative risks for developing systemic lupus erythematosus, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and vitiligo; these diseases have strong data to support an association. We also note weaker associations with scleroderma, celiac disease, autoimmune hepatitis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Minimal if any associations are noted with myasthenia gravis, lichen planus, and multiple sclerosis. Finally, more recent data provide clues on the possible immunologic mechanisms that lead to the association of IgA deficiency and autoimmunity; these lessons are important for understanding the etiology of autoimmune disease.

### Autoimmune and other cytopenias in primary immunodeficiencies: pathomechanisms, novel differential diagnoses, and treatment [^e1f1d522]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Autoimmunity and immune dysregulation may lead to cytopenia and represent key features of many primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). Especially when cytopenia is the initial symptom of a PID, the order and depth of diagnostic steps have to be performed in accordance with both an immunologic and a hematologic approach and will help exclude disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, common variable immunodeficiency, and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes, hemophagocytic disorders, lymphoproliferative diseases, and novel differential diagnoses such as MonoMac syndrome (GATA2 deficiency), CD27 deficiency, lipopolysaccharide-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) deficiency, activated PI3KD syndrome (APDS), X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect (MAGT1 deficiency), and others. Immunosuppressive treatment often needs to be initiated urgently, which impedes further relevant immunologic laboratory analyses aimed at defining the underlying PID. Awareness of potentially involved disease spectra ranging from hematologic to rheumatologic and immunologic disorders is crucial for identifying a certain proportion of PID phenotypes and genotypes among descriptive diagnoses such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, chronic immune thrombocytopenia, Evans syndrome, severe aplastic anemia/refractory cytopenia, and others. A synopsis of pathomechanisms, novel differential diagnoses, and advances in treatment options for cytopenias in PID is provided to facilitate multidisciplinary management and to bridge different approaches.

### Bipolar and panic disorders may be associated with hereditary defects in the innate immune system [^4109d69a]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) represent important arms of the innate immune system, and different deficiencies may result in infections or autoimmune diseases. Both bipolar and panic disorders are associated with increased inflammatory response, infections and mutual comorbidity. However, associations with MBL, MASP-2 or the gene, MBL2, coding for MBL, have not been investigated thoroughly.

Methods

One hundred patients with bipolar disorder, 100 with panic disorder and 349 controls were included. Serum concentrations of MBL and MASP-2 were measured and seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing these concentrations were genotyped. Disease association with genetic markers and serum levels were investigated.

Results

In panic disorder, we observed a large proportion (30%) of MBL deficient (< 100ng/ml) individuals and significantly lower levels of MBL and MASP-2 plus association with the MBL2 YA two-marker haplotype. Bipolar disorder was associated with the MBL2 LXPA haplotype and lower MASP-2 levels.

Limitations

No information on course or severity of disorders was included, and only MBL and MASP-2 were measured, excluding other components from the complement pathway. Restrictions defined by ethnical committees preclude information of control׳s ethnic origin.

Conclusions

Significant differences in MBL and MASP-2 concentrations were observed between cohorts, especially an intriguing finding associating panic disorder with MBL deficiency. These differences could not be fully explained by allele or haplotype frequency variations. Since MBL deficiency is highly heterogeneous and associated with both infectious and autoimmune states, more research is needed to identify which complement pathway components could be associated with bipolar respectively panic disorder.

### Profile of autoantibodies against phosphorylcholine and cross-reactivity to oxidation-specific neoantigens in selective IgA deficiency with or without autoimmune diseases [^f834a275]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin A deficiency (IgAD) is considered the most common form of primary immunodeficiency. The majority of IgA-deficient individuals are considered asymptomatic, even though IgAD has been associated with an increased frequency of recurrent infections, allergy, and autoimmune diseases. In this study we evaluate the Natural autoantibodies (NatAbs) reactivity to phosphorylcholine (PC) and to some pro-inflammatory molecules in IgAD with or without autoimmune disorders. We observed that in the absence of IgA there is an enhancement of IgG subclasses functioning as NatAbs against PC. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) against lipopolysaccharide, C-reactive protein, and IgA was found in IgAD, regardless of the autoimmune manifestations. Nonetheless, IgAD patients with autoimmune disease showed significantly higher IgG reactivity against pro-inflammatory molecules, such as cardiolipin, oxidized low-density lipoproteins, and phosphatidylserine, with positive correlation between them. In conclusion, the IgG NatAbs against PC may represent a compensatory defense mechanism against infections and control excess of inflammation, explaining the asymptomatic status in the IgA deficiency.
