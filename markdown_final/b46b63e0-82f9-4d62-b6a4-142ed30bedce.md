## Question

Paralysis of the toe following a stingray attack

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about paralysis of a toe following a stingray attack and how to evaluate and manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism of injury and venom effects. Then, I should distinguish true neurologic paralysis from pain-limited immobility. Next, I will consider alternative etiologies such as mechanical nerve injury, compartment syndrome, vascular compromise, retained foreign body, and infection. After that, I need to outline a focused evaluation with history, exam, and imaging. Finally, I will map immediate and targeted management, including hot water immersion, wound care, antibiotics, surgical indications, monitoring, and rehabilitation, while verifying where evidence is strong versus extrapolated or provisional.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism of stingray injury and venom delivery, so I do not jump to conclusions about neurotoxicity without context. Stingrays deliver envenomation via a barbed tail spine with integumentary sheath that can embed and inject a heat-labile venom, with severe pain being the hallmark early manifestation, although the precise toxin effects are incompletely characterized in humans [^112WE39u]. I need to remember that dense neurovascular structures in the toes can be affected both by venom and by the penetrating barb itself, which raises plausibility for neurologic complaints at a confined anatomic site, but I should verify downstream causes before labeling this paralysis as venom-mediated [^115nPfMK] [^113ufgMr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "paralysis" when pain can cause pseudo-paralysis. Severe pain can lead to voluntary immobility that mimics weakness, and hot water immersion at about 45°C for 30–90 minutes provides rapid analgesia in most cases, which helps unmask any true neurologic deficit once pain is controlled [^112WE39u]. Hot water also plausibly inactivates heat-labile venom components in related scorpaenid fish envenomations, though that mechanistic assertion is better established for stonefish than stingrays, so I should be careful to avoid overgeneralization while still using this low-risk, high-yield intervention early [^114HTPHb] [^115nPfMK].

> Next, I should review the differential if weakness persists after adequate analgesia, because true motor deficits after a sting can arise from several mechanisms. Let me consider direct neurotoxic effects as biologically plausible by extrapolation from other venomous fish, but mechanical causes are common, including a barb transecting or compressing a digital nerve, evolving compartment syndrome from localized edema in a tight space, vascular injury or vasospasm causing ischemic neuropathy, retained foreign body provoking chronic neuritis, and secondary infection leading to septic neuritis or abscess, any of which could present as a paralyzed toe [^114HTPHb] [^115nPfMK] [^1111zd4i] [^111gwUfa].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence for neurotoxicity specifically in stingrays. The literature most strongly documents severe pain and local tissue injury with stingrays, while neurotoxic properties are more clearly described in related marine fish like stonefish; thus, it is reasonable to say neurotoxicity is possible, but I should not overstate it without direct data, and I should keep mechanical and ischemic mechanisms front and center in my working differential [^112WE39u] [^114HTPHb] [^115nPfMK]. But what if the clinical course shows progressive dysesthesia, weakness, or delayed neuropathy after the acute phase; late peripheral neuropathies are reported after some marine fish envenomations, so continued surveillance is prudent, even as I prioritize identifiable structural causes first [^114HTPHb] [^115nPfMK].

> I will now examine the key elements of history to structure the evaluation. I need to check the timing, location, and depth of water exposure, immediate pain intensity, presence of numbness or weakness at onset, duration and adequacy of hot water immersion, use of analgesics, progression of symptoms, tetanus status, and comorbidities such as diabetes or peripheral vascular disease that could worsen ischemia or infection risk [^115nPfMK] [^113ufgMr]. I should confirm any subsequent delayed reactions, including pruritic or histaminergic flares around a week later, because such delayed phenomena have been reported after stingray envenomation and could confound the clinical picture [^115Hvv6s].

> Next, I should review the focused physical examination. Let me carefully inspect the wound for puncture depth, ecchymosis, erythema, necrosis, and signs suggesting retained material, then perform a meticulous neurovascular exam of the digit to document motor function, light touch, two-point discrimination, capillary refill, and pulses, while palpating for tense compartments and testing for pain with passive stretch to avoid missing an evolving compartment syndrome [^115nPfMK]. I need to ensure serial exams after analgesia to distinguish pain-limited movement from true motor deficit, because that impacts the urgency of imaging and surgical consultation [^112WE39u].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic strategy and then refine it. Initial imaging to assess for retained foreign body is important; I initially think plain radiographs will suffice because the spine should be radiopaque, but wait, I should verify this because stingray spines can be variably radiopaque and sometimes radiolucent, meaning ultrasound or MRI may be needed to detect retained fragments, especially with persistent symptoms or chronic drainage, and delayed surgical exploration may be required if imaging is equivocal but suspicion remains high [^115nPfMK] [^111gwUfa]. If there are signs of ischemia or a pulsatile mass, I should double-check with vascular studies given case reports of arterial injury and pseudoaneurysm after stingray wounds, which can contribute to neuropathy and require vascular intervention [^1111zd4i]. For persistent weakness beyond 48–72 hours without a clear structural cause, electrodiagnostic testing can help quantify nerve injury and guide rehabilitation, although this is based on general neuromuscular practice rather than stingray-specific trials [^115nPfMK].

> I need to ensure immediate management addresses venom effects, pain, and contamination risk. Hot water immersion at about 45°C for 30–90 minutes is first-line and often rapidly effective for pain relief; I should verify temperature safety to avoid burns and reassess motor function once pain improves to detect a true deficit [^112WE39u]. Thorough wound irrigation, careful exploration, and debridement of devitalized tissue are next, with removal of visible spine fragments when safely feasible, and the wound is generally left open due to high contamination risk in marine puncture injuries; tetanus prophylaxis should be updated as indicated [^115nPfMK] [^115A2ZRp].

> Hold on, I should verify if there is any antivenom, because that would alter strategy. There is no specific antivenom for stingray envenomation, so therapy is supportive and complication-driven; regional anesthesia, analgesics, and early mobilization after pain control help functionally, while targeted surgical interventions address structural causes like retained spines, compartment syndrome, or vascular injury when present [^115nPfMK] [^115A2ZRp]. If a true inflammatory neuropathy is suspected after exclusion of mechanical and ischemic causes, a short trial of anti-inflammatory therapy may be considered case-by-case, but evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized with close follow-up, emphasizing rehabilitation to prevent contractures and maintain range of motion [^115nPfMK].

> I should double-check infection control because marine wounds carry distinctive pathogens. Empiric antibiotics that cover Vibrio, Aeromonas, and marine mycobacteria are reasonable for puncture wounds to the foot or hand, with a common empiric approach including doxycycline plus a fluoroquinolone or ceftazidime initially and culture-guided tailoring thereafter, recognizing that invasive infections may necessitate serial debridement and prolonged therapy if atypical mycobacterial infection is identified [^117Ck2rP] [^115nPfMK]. I need to obtain cultures when infection is suspected and consider specialized media if atypical organisms are in the differential, given the high risk of ulceration and secondary infection in these injuries [^114HTPHb] [^117Ck2rP].

> Let me reconsider monitoring and disposition to avoid missing delayed complications. While systemic toxicity from stingrays is uncommon, an observation period with serial neurovascular checks after pain control is prudent; some clinicians extrapolate an 8-hour observation window from pit viper guidance for minimally symptomatic bites to detect delayed effects, but I should clearly state this is extrapolation and tailor observation to symptom evolution and wound severity in stingray cases [^115utxKy] [^115nPfMK]. I should also warn patients about possible delayed histaminergic reactions around one week, advise prompt reassessment for increasing pain, weakness, or new neurologic deficits, and arrange early follow-up for persistent neuropathy that may benefit from targeted rehabilitation or further investigation [^115Hvv6s] [^115nPfMK].

> Finally, I should set expectations for recovery and prognosis while acknowledging uncertainty. Many marine fish envenomation injuries improve over one to two weeks with appropriate wound care and infection control, but retained foreign bodies and vascular or compartment complications can prolong recovery or cause permanent deficits if missed, so prognosis hinges on early identification and management of these complications rather than on venom effects alone in most stingray cases [^114HTPHb] [^111gwUfa] [^1111zd4i]. To ensure safety, I need to emphasize return precautions for worsening pain despite hot water and analgesia, spreading erythema, fever, progressive numbness or weakness, pallor or coolness of the digit, and severe swelling with pain on passive stretch, as these are red flags for infection, vascular compromise, or compartment syndrome requiring urgent intervention [^115nPfMK] [^115A2ZRp].

Toe paralysis following a stingray injury is most often due to **direct nerve trauma** from the barb [^115nPfMK], with contributions from venom-induced neurotoxicity [^115A2ZRp], ischemia [^1111zd4i], and secondary infection [^117Ck2rP]. Immediate management includes **hot water immersion** [^112WE39u], **thorough wound exploration** for retained barbs [^111gwUfa], and **empiric antibiotics** targeting marine pathogens [^117Ck2rP]. Early **surgical intervention** is critical when foreign bodies [^111gwUfa] or infection are present [^114HTPHb]. Prognosis depends on the **extent of nerve injury** and the **promptness of care**; persistent deficits may occur if nerve damage is severe or treatment is delayed.

---

## Pathophysiology of toe paralysis after stingray envenomation

Toe paralysis after stingray envenomation results from a **combination of mechanisms**:

- **Direct nerve trauma**: The barb can lacerate or transect digital nerves, causing immediate paralysis [^115nPfMK].

- **Venom-induced neurotoxicity**: Stingray venom contains neurotoxic components that disrupt nerve conduction, leading to paralysis.

- **Ischemic injury**: Venom-induced vasoconstriction or thrombosis can cause ischemia, resulting in nerve damage and paralysis.

- **Secondary infection**: Marine bacteria (e.g. Vibrio, Aeromonas) can cause severe infections, leading to nerve damage and paralysis.

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation

Typical presentation includes:

- **Immediate severe pain**: At the sting site [^112WE39u].

- **Swelling and erythema**: Localized inflammation [^115A2ZRp].

- **Puncture wound**: Often with retained barb fragments [^111gwUfa].

- **Neurological deficits**: Numbness, tingling, or paralysis of the affected toe [^115nPfMK].

Diagnostic evaluation includes:

- **Physical examination**: Assessing neurological function and identifying retained foreign bodies [^115nPfMK].

- **Imaging studies**: X-rays or ultrasound to detect retained barbs or foreign bodies [^115A2ZRp].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CRP, ESR, and wound cultures to assess infection and inflammation [^114HTPHb].

---

## Immediate medical management

Immediate management focuses on **pain control**, **wound care**, and **infection prevention**:

- **Hot water immersion**: Immersing the affected limb in 43–45°C water for 30–90 minutes to inactivate venom and relieve pain [^112WE39u] [^113ufgMr].

- **Wound exploration and debridement**: Thoroughly explore and debride the wound to remove retained barbs or foreign bodies [^111gwUfa].

- **Empiric antibiotic therapy**: Initiate antibiotics covering marine bacteria (e.g. doxycycline plus ceftazidime or fluoroquinolone) [^114HTPHb] [^117Ck2rP] [^1111zd4i].

- **Tetanus prophylaxis**: Administer tetanus vaccine if indicated [^115A2ZRp].

---

## Long-term management and rehabilitation

Long-term management focuses on **neurological recovery** and **preventing complications**. Physical therapy maintains joint mobility, prevents contractures, and improves muscle strength, while occupational therapy enhances functional independence and supports adaptation to any permanent deficits. Pain management includes NSAIDs, gabapentin, or pregabalin for neuropathic pain. Severe nerve injuries may require surgical repair or grafting [^112TM2wf].

---

## Prognosis and potential complications

Prognosis depends on the **severity of nerve injury** and the **promptness of medical intervention**. Mild nerve injuries typically recover within weeks to months with conservative management, whereas severe injuries may result in permanent paralysis or chronic neuropathic pain [^115A2ZRp]. Complications include chronic neuropathic pain, recurrent or chronic infections, and permanent loss of toe function [^111gwUfa].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive measures include wearing **protective footwear** in shallow water and **shuffling the feet** to alert stingrays and avoid stepping on them [^115A2ZRp]. Individuals should seek prompt medical care following a stingray injury [^115nPfMK].

Toe paralysis after stingray envenomation is primarily due to **direct nerve trauma** [^115nPfMK], with additional contributions from venom-induced neurotoxicity, ischemic injury, and secondary infection. Immediate management includes **hot water immersion** [^112WE39u], **wound exploration**, and **empiric antibiotics** [^117Ck2rP], while **long-term care** focuses on neurological recovery and preventing complications.

### Finger flexor tenosynovitis from stonefish envenomation injury [^114HTPHb]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The venom consists of four biologically active factors: hyaluronidase fraction, capillary permeability factor, toxic fraction, and a pain-producing factor. As a whole, the venom is an unstable, heat-labile, high molecular weight protein with both myotoxic and neurotoxic properties. Acute manifestations are characterized by intense pain at the wound site, erythema, ecchymosis, lymphedema, and paresthesias. However, chronic symptoms of the venom manifest as slowly healing ulcers at the wound site, continuing allodynic manifestations, and joint contractures. Late complications may include secondary infections, foreign body granulomas, and peripheral neuropathies.

First-line treatment of scorpaenid envenomation should include immediate immersion of the affected extremity in nonscalding hot water of up to 45°C for 30 to 90 minutes to inactivate the heat-labile components of the venom. Grossly contaminated or infected wounds should be cultured, and the use of a special culture media for Vibrio species or acid-fast stains for marine aquatic mycobacteria should be considered. Antibiotics are recommended for marine envenomation wounds of the hand or foot due to the high incidence of ulceration, necrosis, and secondary infection. Commonly, patients sustaining envenomation injuries to the hand demonstrate complete resolution of symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks and may require an average hospital admission stay of 4 days.

### Stingray envenomation: A retrospective review of clinical presentation and treatment in 119 cases [^112WE39u]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Stingray stings are common along coastal regions of this country and the world. The tail of the stingray contains a barbed stinger attached to a venom gland and contained within an integumentary sheath. During a sting, the stinger and sheath can become embedded in the soft tissue of the victim, and venom is injected into the wound. Stingray venom most often causes severe pain on contact, although the exact mechanism of toxicity is not certain.

Hot water immersion of the stung extremity has been reported to be effective in relieving pain associated with the envenomation, but large studies of this therapy have not been performed. We retrospectively reviewed stingray stings presenting to our emergency department (ED) over an 8-year period. Cases were divided into acute (group 1, within 24 hours of the sting) and subacute (group 2, 24 hours or more after the sting) presentations. Charts were abstracted for information concerning the victim's history, physical examination, treatment, diagnostic imaging, and outcome, including the effectiveness of hot water immersion as analgesia and use of antimicrobials.

A total of 119 cases were identified and abstracted, 100 in group 1 and 19 in group 2. Of the group 1 patients initially treated with hot water immersion alone, 88% had complete relief of pain within 30 minutes without administration of any other analgesic. In the patients who initially received a dose of analgesic along with hot water immersion, none required a second dose of analgesics, and all had complete pain relief before discharge. There were no adverse effects, such as thermal burns.

### Finger flexor tenosynovitis from stonefish envenomation injury [^117Ck2rP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The rates of surgical necessity for NTM infections of the hand approach 100%. Additionally, multiple surgeries are often required for the eradication of invasive infections, with up to seven repeat surgeries reportedly required for a single patient. Patients should always be counseled on this possible need for multiple surgeries at the time of diagnosis.

Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics for a marine puncture wound should include coverage for Vibrio, Aeromonas, M marinum, and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae species. An empirical regimen includes doxycycline in combination with a fluoroquinolone or ceftazidime and clindamycin for the initial 48 hours, followed by an additional week of Augmentin and doxycycline. If an overt infection exists, the antibiotic regimen should be based on culture sensitivity results. If M marinum has been identified as the infectious agent, a two- or three-drug regimen may be used, and anti-tuberculous drugs such as ethambutol or rifampin should be considered. The duration of antibiotic therapy ranges from 3 to 6 months when adjunctive surgical therapy has been performed.

Stonefish envenomation injuries present a unique medical challenge for physicians. Initial treatment should be focused on the acute envenomation toxicity, followed by empiric prophylactic antibiotics tailored to a marine bacterial profile. Should a delayed secondary infection arise, the physician needs to maintain a high level of suspicion for an NTM species as the causative agent. Invasive infections may require a combination of serial surgical debridement and a multidrug ant…

### Severe digital necrosis in a 4-year-old boy: Primary Raynaud's or jellyfish sting [^111K6jQq]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomena is a common disorder that may be primary or secondary to connective tissue disorders such as systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. A jellyfish sting is a rare but life-threatening cause of Raynaud's phenomena. Digital gangrene is reported in 3% of children with secondary Raynaud's phenomena, but it does not occur in children with primary Raynaud's phenomena. We report a case of a 4-year-old boy who initially presented with episodes of pain and bluish to blackish discoloration and necrosis affecting the fingers on both hands following a jellyfish sting, without any signs of connective tissue disorder.

### Snakebite: An exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis of adjunct treatment strategies [^115JtrLJ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Disability weights for chronic disabilities due to amputation were taken from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. However, we did not include an analysis of loss-of-function of limbs; we included only amputation because the cost of amputation is more predictable for an exploratory study such as this one. Because of the significant differences between the WHO disability weight update in 2004 and the GBD 2010, a range was used to account for both numbers in the sensitivity analysis. The base-case disability weight for below-knee amputation (0.164) was taken from the GBD 2010. The base-case disability weight for finger/toe amputation (0.02) was an assumption informed by several related disability weights reported in the 2004 update and the GBD 2010.

- **Outcome measures**: The primary outcome measures are the thresholds for treatment effectiveness and cost. These thresholds are defined as the increase in effectiveness and net cost at which a combination strategy becomes the more cost-effective option. As a secondary outcome measure, we report the ICER, which is the ratio of incremental costs per DALY averted. To compare an antivenom/adjunct combination strategy with antivenom alone, the ICER was calculated based on the difference in costs and DALYs between these two strategies.

### Global mortality of snakebite envenoming between 1990 and 2019 [^116wc1rj]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

After estimating venomous animal contact mortality for GBD 2019, we proceeded to estimate snakebite-specific mortality.

We initially reviewed all causes of death data that could be directly linked to snakebites or other venomous animals. The ICD codes for each animal are detailed in Supplementary Table 3, which also includes the volume and type of data used in snakebite modeling. The snakebite-specific model encompassed 10,636 location-years of data. Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 offer maps illustrating the volume and type of data utilized in the snakebite envenoming model for each location.

After gathering all relevant data, we applied the previously described cause-of-death noise reduction process to the animal-specific data. We redistributed deaths coded under ICD codes E905, E905.9, and X29, which refer to deaths from unspecified venomous animals. This was done by aggregating properly coded deaths by location, age, sex, and animal, and then applying the proportion of correctly coded snakebite-related deaths to the number of deaths coded for unspecified venomous animals. Redistribution based on location, age, and sex patterns from correctly coded venomous animal deaths was necessary. Of the 69,097 deaths that could be encoded to the mentioned ICD codes, 5,711 (8.3%) were attributed to unspecified venomous animal contact and required redistribution. The newly allocated animal deaths were added to the count of correctly coded deaths for each animal.

### Managing snakebite [^111vseKs]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the WHO recommend antivenom treatment for patients exhibiting symptoms such as shock, spontaneous systemic bleeding, uncoagulable blood, neurotoxicity, black urine, acute kidney injury, rapidly progressive local swelling, and bites from species known to cause local necrosis and digital bites.

Antivenoms are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins fractionated from the plasma of domesticated animals hyper-immunized with venom from one or more snake species over variable periods. They are highly specific and will neutralize only the venoms used in their production and those of a few closely related species. Polyspecific antivenoms are raised against a mixture of venoms from more than one species, while those raised against venom from a single species are monospecific.

Early administration of antivenom is crucial as it prevents or limits hemodynamic alterations, progression of coagulopathy to clinically overt bleeding, postsynaptic neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, acute kidney injury, and local tissue damage. Physiological levels of clotting factors are at least partially restored within a median of six hours with sufficient doses of specific antivenoms.

Robust clinical data on the safe and effective initial dose of antivenom are lacking for most products. Clinicians often rely on manufacturers' recommendations provided as package inserts or labels, but these can be unreliable. We suggest following national protocols or standard regional guidelines for dosing. Administration is always intravenous, delivered as a bolus or diluted in saline solution over 10–60 minutes, at the same dose for both adults and children.

### North American coral snake antivenin (equine) [^115dKNF4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

There have been no well-controlled clinical studies on the use of North American coral snake antivenin (equine) in patients experiencing envenomation by the Eastern Coral Snake. However, a retrospective analysis has been published of 387 coral snake exposures treated in a healthcare facility in Florida between 1998 and 2010, including 252 patients who were treated with North American coral snake antivenin (equine). Patients were managed according to different treatment strategies:

- **Empiric treatment**: Asymptomatic at emergency department (ED) arrival and treated empirically (n = 134).
- **Treatment upon symptoms**: Asymptomatic at ED arrival, but treatment withheld until symptoms appeared (n = 106; 6 of the 106 received North American coral snake antivenin (equine) at some point; the remainder were never treated).
- **Immediate treatment**: Symptomatic at ED arrival and treated with North American coral snake antivenin (equine) (n = 112).
- **No treatment**: Symptomatic at ED arrival but not treated with North American coral snake antivenin (equine) (n = 35).

The average number of vials administered to treated patients was 3.75 (range 1–20 vials); the 17 patients who received repeated treatment were administered 8.3 vials on average. There was no reported usage of foreign antivenom or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in this case series. The 387 patients were assessed for clinical outcomes. Outcomes codes ranged from full recovery with no residual effects ("No Effect") to less than full recovery with significant residual effects ("Major"). Empiric treatment of asymptomatic patients resulted in more 'moderate' and 'major' outcomes compared to other strategies.

### Recurrent Hopkin's syndrome: A case report and review of the literature [^113fbfpt]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Flaccid paralysis affecting one or more limbs after an asthma attack is a poliomyelitis-like illness known as Hopkins' syndrome (HS). Although a viral infection or multifactorial immune suppression during an acute attack of bronchial asthma has been proposed to be the mechanism involved in this syndrome, the precise etiopathogenetic mechanism remains unknown. We report a 13-year-old girl who had recurrent episodes of myelitis after asthma attacks. She had four episodes of acute flaccid paralysis, each of which was preceded by acute asthma attacks. Some of the attacks were accompanied by sensory and sphincter disturbances. She had hyper-IgEemia and the prick test to Dermatophagoides farinae and cedar pollen was strongly positive. The present case is the first HS case demonstrating frequent recurrences and suggests a possible link between HS and atopic myelitis.

### Medically important venomous animals: Biology, prevention, first aid, and clinical management [^115nWTQc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Venomous animals are a significant health problem for rural populations in many parts of the world. Given the level of international mobility of individuals and the inquisitiveness of travelers, clinicians and travel clinics need to be able to give advice on the prevention, first aid, and clinical management of envenoming. Health professionals often feel overwhelmed by the taxonomy of venomous animals; however, these animals can be grouped into cnidarians, venomous fish, sea snakes, scorpions, spiders, hymenopterans, and venomous terrestrial snakes using a simple set of criteria. Geographic distribution, habitats, and circumstances of accidents further reduce the range of culprits that need to be considered in any single event.

Clinical management of envenomed patients relies on supportive therapy and, if available, specific antivenoms. Supplies of life-saving antivenoms are scarce, particularly affecting rural populations in resource-poor settings. Travel clinics and hospitals in highly industrialized areas predominantly see patients with injuries caused by accidents involving marine animals, particularly stings by venomous fish and skin damage caused by jellyfish. However, globally, terrestrial venomous snakes are the most important group of venomous animals.

### An unusual neurological consequence of massive wasp stings [^114U7EcR]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Although rare, central and peripheral neurological manifestations after single or multiple wasp stings have been reported. The authors describe a 45-year-old man who developed periods of sudden loss of consciousness with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 6 after being stung by fifty wasps. These periods were observed directly after being stung and continued for months. Different mechanisms and pathophysiological findings of neurological sequelae reported after wasp stings are being reviewed.

### Snakebite: An exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis of adjunct treatment strategies [^114f5EGN]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

The burden of disease due to snakebite in developing countries is high and poorly recognized. Globally, an estimated 125,000 deaths per year are attributable to snakebite. The Million Deaths Study in India estimated 45,900 deaths attributable to snakebite in India in 2005, which translates to one in 200 deaths, even though governmental reporting is much lower. There is a strong negative correlation across countries between gross domestic product per capita and incidence of snakebite. Rural farmers are at the greatest risk because of time spent in the fields, where they often incur snakebites on the feet, legs, or hands. The limb deformities and amputations caused by snakebite lead to life-altering disabilities, which in turn contribute to the cycle of poverty. Adding to these factors are the prohibitively high costs of the treatments for snakebite, such as advanced hospital care and antivenom. To address these issues, the World Health Organization (WHO) included snakebite on its list of neglected tropical diseases in 2017.

Patients who receive antivenom in the presence of supportive care are not likely to die of snakebite, but currently, such treatments can only be given in a clinic or hospital setting, and it can be prohibitively expensive. Many victims of snakebite do not survive long enough to reach definitive treatment, either because of geographical or economic constraints that can cause morbidity and mortality through delays in care. In India and Nepal, more than 75% of snakebite deaths occur outside the hospital setting.

### Haemotoxic snake venoms: Their functional activity, impact on snakebite victims and pharmaceutical promise [^112jxtjQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Snake venoms are mixtures of numerous proteinaceous components that exert diverse functional activities on a variety of physiological targets. Because the toxic constituents found in venom vary from species to species, snakebite victims can present with a variety of life-threatening pathologies related to the neurotoxic, cytotoxic, and haemotoxic effects of venom. Of the 1.8 million people envenomed by snakes every year, up to 125,000 die, while hundreds of thousands survive only to suffer from life-changing long-term morbidity. Consequently, snakebite is one of the world's most severe neglected tropical diseases.

Many snake venoms exhibit strong haemotoxic properties by interfering with blood pressure, clotting factors, and platelets, and by directly causing haemorrhage. This review provides an overview of the functional activities of haemotoxic venom proteins, the pathologies they cause in snakebite victims, and how their exquisite selectivity and potency make them amenable for use as therapeutic and diagnostic tools relevant for human medicine.

### Complication of a Portuguese man-of-war envenomation to the foot: a case report [^115jFD5C]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Jellyfish stings have become more prevalent due to increased commercial activities along coastal waterways. These stings, referred to as envenomations, involve the injection of neurotoxic venom into the victim at the site of the sting. While these events are usually mild and mostly result in local hypersensitivity reactions at the site of the injury, certain species of jellyfish can cause more severe, systemic effects. These include muscle cramping, respiratory distress, hypotension, circulatory collapse, and even death. The Portuguese man-of-war is one example of a jellyfish with potent venom.

Most case reports of Portuguese man-of-war envenomations do not mention local soft tissue necrosis. The purpose of this case report is to present such a consequence following a jellyfish sting to the dorsum of the foot. A large area of skin necrosis developed after the envenomation, which required extensive debridement and skin grafting.

### Interventions for the symptoms and signs resulting from jellyfish stings [^117DZUo4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Jellyfish envenomation is common in many coastal regions and varies in severity depending upon the species. Stings cause a variety of symptoms and signs including pain, dermatological reactions, and, in some species, Irukandji syndrome, which may include abdominal, back, or chest pain, tachycardia, hypertension, cardiac phenomena, and, rarely, death. Many treatments have been suggested for these symptoms, but their effectiveness is unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: To determine the benefits and harms associated with the use of any intervention, in both adults and children, for the treatment of jellyfish stings, as assessed by randomized and quasi-randomized trials.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science up to 27 October 2022. We searched clinical trials registers and the grey literature, and conducted forward-citation searching of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention given to treat stings from any species of jellyfish. Interventions were compared to another active intervention, placebo, or no treatment. If co-interventions were used, we included the study only if the co-intervention was used in each group.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included nine studies (six RCTs and three quasi-RCTs) involving a total of 574 participants. We found one ongoing study. Participants were either stung accidentally or were handled in controlled settings.

### Haemotoxic snake venoms: Their functional activity, impact on snakebite victims and pharmaceutical promise [^114vkDLc]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Snakebite causes a multitude of pathologies. Because of the diversity of toxic components found in the venom of any one snake, the pathological consequences of envenoming can be diverse and multifactorial. Moreover, variables such as the location of the bite site and the amount of venom injected, which in turn can be highly variable [Alirol et al, 2010], can contribute to the severity of clinical signs observed in snakebite victims. While pathology can be limited to local effects surrounding the bite site, such as pain, oedema, and bruising, many envenomings also result in systemic pathology, which can be severe and lethal if untreated. Clinical patterns of envenoming can be broadly classified into three groups: neurotoxic, cytotoxic, and haemotoxic, although myotoxicity can also present in certain cases [World Health Organization, 2010a]. It is important to note that certain snake species are capable of causing combinations of these different toxicities, and there are also examples of the same snake species causing different pathologies in human patients across different parts of their range [Antonypillai et al, 2011; Massey et al, 2012].

Neurotoxic envenoming is characterised by descending neuromuscular paralysis, beginning with the eyes (ptosis), facial muscles, and other muscles innervated by the cranial nerves, before progressing to respiratory and generalised flaccid paralysis [Warrell, 1995a, b; Chippaux, 2010; World Health Organization, 2010a, b]. The toxins predominately responsible for neurotoxic venom effects are members of the diverse phospholipases A2 (PLA2).

### Repurposed drugs and their combinations prevent morbidity-inducing dermonecrosis caused by diverse cytotoxic snake venoms [^111a4Urg]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Snake venoms are comprised of dozens of different toxins at varying concentrations, which differ both inter- and intra-specifically and induce a range of pathological and pathophysiological effects. However, there are four primary toxin families that are dominant across many different venoms and thus represent attractive targets for toxin-inhibiting therapeutics: phospholipases A2 (PLA2s), snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), snake venom serine proteases (SVSPs), and three-finger toxins (3FTxs).

The main syndromes of snakebite envenoming are generally categorized as haemotoxic (e.g. haemorrhage and coagulopathy), neurotoxic (e.g. muscle paralysis), and/or cytotoxic (e.g. local tissue necrosis). Haemotoxicity is a particularly common sign of envenoming, especially following bites from viperid (family Viperidae) snakes, and is largely caused by SVMPs, SVSPs, and PLA2s. Neurotoxic envenoming is more commonly caused by elapid (family Elapidae) snakes and is primarily associated with neurotoxic 3FTxs and PLA2s. Local tissue necrosis around the site of the bite is caused by both vipers and certain elapids, is the result of cytotoxic 3FTxs, SVMPs, and PLA2s, and frequently leads to permanent disability often requiring surgical debridement or amputations of the affected limb or digit.

### Managing snakebite [^1151nyLU]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

Bites from venomous snakes can result in bleeding, paralysis, long-term disability, and death. Immobilize the bitten limb when transporting the patient to a medical facility; the universal use of pressure immobilization is controversial, and tourniquets are not recommended. The 20-minute whole blood clotting test is a simple bedside test to screen for and monitor coagulopathy in resource-limited settings. Assess vital parameters and initiate resuscitation measures if the patient is clinically unstable with signs of bleeding, shock, paralysis, or respiratory distress. Intravenous antivenom is recommended in patients with systemic symptoms; the dose and type depend on the likely snake species, local guidelines, and availability.

Snakebite affects between 1.8 to 2.7 million people worldwide each year, and it is estimated to cause between 80,000 and 138,000 deaths. A mixture of toxins (venom) is injected into the body following a bite by a venomous snake. Envenoming can be a highly dynamic clinical event. Symptoms can progressively worsen to a life-threatening emergency. Snakebites can have long-term physical sequelae such as amputation, paralysis, and disability, and psychological health consequences.

Snakebite envenoming is more common in South and South-East Asia (2 million annually), sub-Saharan Africa (420,000), and Latin America (150,000). These regions also report a high burden of deaths from snakebite (100,000, 32,000, and 5,000 deaths respectively), possibly due to poor access to medical aid. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can worsen prognosis.

### Jellyfish stings: A practical approach [^111fnbzj]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Jellyfish are distributed worldwide, and their stings can cause a range of reactions. These reactions may vary from cutaneous, localized, and self-limited to serious systemic or even fatal outcomes, depending on the envenoming species. Several first aid treatments are utilized to manage such stings; however, few have robust evidence backing their use. This review of the literature describes and discusses various first aid and treatment recommendations, concluding with a summarized practical approach. Further randomized controlled trials in this field are needed.

### Repurposed drugs and their combinations prevent morbidity-inducing dermonecrosis caused by diverse cytotoxic snake venoms [^113vsi5E]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Estimates suggest that 1.8–2.7 million people are envenomed due to snakebite every year, resulting in 81,000–138,000 deaths and 400,000 cases of morbidity annually, predominantly affecting those in the tropics and subtropics. One of the leading causes of snakebite-induced morbidity is local tissue necrosis, which can develop around the bite site and result in amputation of the affected digit or limb in survivors. Snakebite has been labeled 'the most neglected of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)', with the late UN Secretary General Kofi Annan calling it 'the biggest public health crisis you have likely never heard of'. In 2017, snakebite envenoming was added to the World Health Organization (WHO)'s formal list of NTDs; the WHO has since elevated snakebite to a 'priority category A NTD' and has created a roadmap with the goal of reducing the global burden of snakebite by one-half by the year 2030. One of the proposed methods to accomplish this is to develop novel treatments for snakebite, an ambitious task considering the myriad issues associated with developing snakebite therapies, including the variability and complexity of toxins that make up different snake venoms.

### Case report: JAK1/2 inhibition with baricitinib in the treatment of STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy [^1112Mcpk]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). High credibility.

- **Clinical manifestations**:
	- Clinical manifestations were observed in both the proband and her father. The proband exhibited clubbing fingers, a pigeon breast deformity, and facial rashes. Her father also showed signs of clubbing fingers and facial tissue loss.

- **Chest computed tomography findings**:
	- Chest CT scans revealed interstitial pulmonary inflammation in the proband's father. The proband's CT scans showed before treatment (Day 1), after treatment with antibiotics and IVIG (Day 7), following MP pulse treatment and one week after baricitinib introduction (Day 38), severe pneumonia in the 4th month, and 14 months after first discharge.

Laboratory examinations of the female patient identified elevated C-reactive protein (CRP, 54.19 mg/L, reference range: < 8 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 89 mm/H, reference range: < 20 mm/H), and white blood cell count (WBC, 16.3 × 10³/mm³, reference range: 4 to 10 × 10³/mm³). Hepatobiliary enzymes were not elevated, and renal and thyroid functions were normal. The autoimmune workup revealed elevated IgG (25.3 g/L), IgA (3.26 g/L), and IgM (1.69 g/L) despite normal C3 and C4 complement levels. Decreased CD4+ T lymphocyte counts and normal CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were identified. The patient tested positive for several auto-antibodies, including high-titer ANA (1:1000), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies. Cytokine testing indicated elevated interleukin (IL)-6 levels (62.4 pg/ml, reference range…).

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^116sqaPX]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

The prevention of periodic paralysis involves advising patients to avoid triggers such as high-carbohydrate and/or high-salt meals, alcohol, and stress. Although no randomized controlled studies are available to inform dosing, a daily slow-release potassium salt formulation may be considered the standard of care for chronic therapy.

Dichlorphenamide is approved for HypoPP and has been associated with reductions in attack frequency, severity, and duration during chronic treatment. Based on anecdotal reports, acetazolamide at doses of 125–1000 mg/day may be an effective chronic treatment of HypoPP. In a double-blind crossover study, acetazolamide 125 mg, administered three times daily or placebo for 2 weeks each, was evaluated in eight patients with HypoPP. Muscle strength was measured in muscle groups every week and improved significantly in seven of eight patients. Mean strength was significantly greater with acetazolamide (P = 0.05), and total muscle strength increased by a mean of 10% with treatment.

Potassium-sparing diuretics are a potential option for the chronic treatment of HypoPP. Recommended doses are triamterene 50–150 mg/day, spironolactone 25–100 mg/day, or eplerenone 50–100 mg daily. Spironolactone may be poorly tolerated due to androgenic side effects, and eplerenone may be substituted because it causes fewer hormonal issues. For patients with HypoPP, potassium supplementation and a potassium-sparing diuretic may be used concomitantly, but potassium levels should be routinely monitored.

Recent studies in mouse models of HypoPP with both SCN4A mutations and CACNA1S mutations are ongoing.

### Genetic neurological channelopathies: Molecular genetics and clinical phenotypes [^111bEJPv]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Management of the periodic paralyses rests on trigger avoidance. Oral potassium can speed attack resolution in Hypo PP, whereas ingestion of sweets and mild exercise can hasten attack resolution in Hyper PP. Inhaled salbutamol has also been shown to be effective in treating attacks of Hyper PP. Occasionally, prophylactic treatment is required. Acetazolamide is often a first-line treatment for both Hyper PP and Hypo PP, as it has been shown to increase muscle strength and endurance in a small randomized controlled trial. Dichlorphenamide was shown to reduce attack frequency in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Hyper PP and Hypo PP. An additional option in Hypo PP includes potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone or amiloride. Pinacidil, a potassium channel agonist, was found to improve muscle strength in a small randomized controlled trial.

- **Electrophysiology in skeletal muscle channelopathies**: The functional consequences of ion channel mutations in skeletal muscle can be examined by electrophysiology. Myotonia on needle EMG is seen in all forms of NDM, but severity can vary, and the duration of myotonic discharges on EMG can be used to distinguish sodium and chloride channel myotonias. Measurement of compound action potential amplitudes before and after exercise, using the short and long exercise tests, helps to distinguish between the different skeletal muscle channelopathies.

- **MRI in skeletal muscle channelopathies**: MRI has recently been developed for diagnosis and monitoring use in skeletal muscle channelopathies. A hyperintense central signal is a characteristic finding.

### Envenoming bites by kraits: The biological basis of treatment-resistant neuromuscular paralysis [^113fdPeV]. Brain (2005). Low credibility.

Beta-bungarotoxin, a neurotoxic phospholipase A2, is a major fraction of the venom of kraits. The toxin was inoculated into one hind limb of young adult rats. The inoculated hind limb was paralyzed within 3 hours and remained paralyzed for 2 days. The paralysis was associated with the loss of synaptic vesicles from motor nerve terminal boutons, a decline in immunoreactivity of synaptophysin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin, a loss of muscle mass, and the upregulation of NaV(1.5) mRNA and protein.

Between 3 and 6 hours after the inoculation of the toxin, some nerve terminal boutons exhibited clear signs of degeneration. Others appeared to be in the process of withdrawing from the synaptic cleft, and some boutons were fully enwrapped in terminal Schwann cell processes. By 12 hours, all muscle fibers were denervated. Re-innervation began at 3 days with the appearance of regenerating nerve terminals, a return of neuromuscular function in some muscles, and a progressive increase in the immunoreactivity of synaptophysin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin. Full recovery occurred at 7 days.

The data were compared with recently published clinical data on envenoming bites by kraits, and by extrapolation, we suggest that the acute, reversible denervation caused by beta-bungarotoxin is a credible explanation for the clinically important, profound treatment-resistant neuromuscular paralysis seen in human subjects bitten by these animals.

### Management of snakebites in the upper extremity [^114ZBidK]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Encounters with venomous snakes can lead to substantial morbidity or mortality if managed inappropriately. Medical management is the mainstay of treatment, but surgery may be necessary in rare cases. The hand surgeon should be well-versed in the types of venomous snakes, the mechanism of action of venom, and the management of these injuries, given the frequency of hand envenomation. The indications for surgery are not well established and rely on clinical judgment and the practitioner's experience. An understanding of previously reported outcomes and an algorithmic approach to treatment will help improve patient care and avoid complications.

### Do nerve resection, amputation, and immunotherapy relieve causalgia in the long term [^116fnNfb]. Pain (2025). High credibility.

Reported here is the unpublished long follow-up (22 years and 14 years) of two patients with longstanding causalgia initially successfully treated by nerve resection and reported in detail previously in this journal. There are very little such long-term data for causalgia of this nature available. This is a rare opportunity to reevaluate these two patients who began their stories not too differently but went on to follow very different paths.

One of these patients (CH) had causalgia following a traumatic right infraorbital nerve injury. This pain was relieved by nerve resection with no recurrence of facial pain for over 22 years.

The other patient (HG) had many years of intractable complex regional pain syndrome type 2 of the common peroneal and sural nerves following a left leg injury in childhood. HG had 4 years and 4 months of good relief by nerve resection. At this time, severe pain recurrence and incipient gangrene of the left leg required amputation, which saved the leg but did not affect the pain, a worsening severe skin rash, and frequent respiratory infections. The amputated limb pathology suggested an autoimmune response, and further tests provided evidence of autoimmune antibodies and immunoglobulin deficiency. Only after immunotherapy did these problems resolve, and this improvement has persisted for 4 years and 9 months.

There are few long-term assessments of causalgia treated by nerve resection, amputation, and/or immunotherapy. Short-term failures of these treatments may be due to treatable conditions such as immunological abnormalities.

Stingray injury is common in temperate and tropical waters worldwide. The majority of injuries are minor and can be managed with simple first aid at the shoreline; however, serious complications can occur. We report a case of Vibrio alginolyticus wound infection, retained foreign body, and posterior tibial artery pseudoaneurysm after stingray envenomation in a returning traveler. The patient presented with severe pain and dysesthesia associated with a puncture wound in the left lower leg 1 week after injury in Seychelles. Clinician awareness of infection and trauma-related complications of stingray and other penetrating marine injuries is important.

One patient, who had been bitten on the foot, brought the offending snake to the clinic. It was positively identified as N. kaouthia. The patient developed no neurotoxicity or local blistering and necrosis and she was discharged 48 hours after the bite. Subsequent analysis confirmed the absence of venom antigen in her serum. It was concluded that she had received a bite without the injection of venom. The other 69 patients were all envenomed:

- **Nonspecific signs/symptoms**: Vomiting was seen on admission in 43 patients, and fainting was experienced by 10 patients.

- **Neurotoxic signs present on admission**:
	- Bilateral ptosis was seen in 58 patients. Figure 2A illustrates bilateral ptosis, typically the first sign of neurotoxicity following snakebite envenoming, observed in patients bitten by Naja kaouthia in southeastern Bangladesh.
	- Difficulty in speaking (52 patients), generalized weakness (49 patients), weak neck muscles (44 patients), difficulty in swallowing (41 patients), blurred vision (29 patients), breathlessness (23 patients), and cyanosis in three patients.

No patient presented with or developed generalized muscle tenderness or pain.

- **Local effects**:
	- Swelling of the bitten limb was seen in 53 patients (Figure 2B), and skin necrosis was observed in 19 out of 70 patients in this series.

Figure 2B shows swelling extending above the elbow and early demarcated hyperpigmentation at the site of the bite over the proximal phalanx of the right index finger and over the dorsum of the hand. Figure 2C depicts advanced superficial necrosis and de-roofed blister following a bite on the dorsum of the foot.

### Snake antivenom for snake venom induced consumption coagulopathy [^11674zVM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Snake venom induced consumption coagulopathy is a major systemic effect of envenoming. Observational studies suggest that antivenom improves outcomes for venom induced consumption coagulopathy in some snakebites and not others. However, the effectiveness of snake antivenom in all cases of venom induced consumption coagulopathy is controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of snake antivenom as a treatment for venom induced consumption coagulopathy in people with snake bites.

- **Search methods**: The search was done on 30 January 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase Classic+Embase (OvidSP), three other sources, clinical trials registers, and we also screened reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: All completed, published or unpublished, randomised, controlled trials with a placebo or no treatment arm, where snake antivenom was administered for venom induced consumption coagulopathy in humans with snake bites.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors reviewed the identified trials and independently applied the selection criteria.

- **Main results**: No studies met the inclusion criteria for this review.

- **Authors' conclusions**: Randomised placebo-controlled trials are required to investigate the effectiveness of snake antivenom for clinically relevant outcomes in patients with venom induced consumption coagulopathy resulting from snake bites.

### Marine envenomation in Okinawa: Overview and treatment concept [^113ufgMr]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Okinawa Prefecture is a popular tourist destination due to its beaches and reefs. The reefs host a large variety of animals, including a number of venomous species. Because of the popularity of the reefs and marine activities, people are frequently in close contact with dangerous venomous species and, thus, are exposed to potential envenomation. Commonly encountered venomous animals throughout Okinawa include the invertebrate cone snail, sea urchin, crown-of-thorns starfish, blue-ringed octopus, box jellyfish, and fire coral. The vertebrates include the stonefish, lionfish, sea snake, and moray eel.

Treatment for marine envenomation can involve first aid, hot water immersion, antivenom, supportive care, regional anesthesia, and pharmaceutical administration. Information on venomous animals, their toxins, and treatment should be well understood by prehospital care providers and physicians practicing in the prefecture.

### Osteoplastic thumb ray restoration with or without secondary toe transfer for reconstruction of opposable basic hand function [^111H9dTb]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Mutilating hand injuries result in bone and soft-tissue defects. Osteocutaneous flaps can be used for osteoplastic thumb ray reconstruction as a definitive procedure or followed by toe transfer.

- **Methods**: Twenty-four hands with thumbs amputated proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joint underwent osteoplastic surgery for first ray bone and soft-tissue reconstruction. The Kapandji classification was used for the evaluation of basic hand function (opposable ulnar and radial components) after osteoplastic surgery and after toe transfer.

- **Results**: Thirteen of 24 osteoplastic neothumbs (54 percent) achieved opposition; the other 11 patients underwent corrective osteotomies or toe transfer on the osteoplastic thumb rays. Five in this group achieved opposition, resulting in an overall basic hand function outcome in this series of 83.3 percent (20 of 24). Thirteen of 15 patients (86.7 percent) who had thumb amputations regained basic hand function only after osteoplastic thumb ray reconstruction, and 14 of 15 (93.3 percent) did so after revision. Six of nine patients (66.7 percent) with multiple-digit amputations regained opposition after osteoplastic thumb ray reconstruction and secondary revision. Ten patients received 12 toe flaps, two received sensate flaps, and one received an opponensplasty. Ten patients undergoing toe transfers had an average improvement of 4.1 on the Kapandji scale.

- **Conclusions**: Osteoplastic thumb ray reconstruction followed by osteotomies or sensate flap transfers can yield satisfactory results for some patients. Optimal functional outcomes are achievable.

### Research into the causes of venom-induced mortality and morbidity identifies new therapeutic opportunities [^114MPTzA]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Low credibility.

Snakebite primarily affects rural subsistent farming populations in underdeveloped and developing nations. The annual number of deaths (100,000) and physical disabilities (400,000) among snakebite victims is a societal tragedy that poses a significant added socioeconomic burden to society. Antivenom therapy is the treatment of choice for snakebite; however, as evidenced by the continuing high rates of mortality and morbidity, too many rural tropical snakebite victims fail to access effective treatment. Here, we advocate for more basic research to better understand the pathogenesis of systemic and local envenoming, and describe how research outcomes can identify novel snakebite therapeutic strategies with the potential to be more accessible and affordable to victims than current treatments.

### Clinical challenges, controversies, and regional strategies in snakebite care in India [^1118T12g]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). Low credibility.

The efficacy of antivenoms, particularly polyvalent formulations such as the Indian polyvalent antivenom (IPAV), has been a focal point of debate in snakebite management due to its variable effectiveness across different snake species and geographic regions. Standardized treatment protocols for snakebites often fail to account for regional differences in snake species, venom composition, and healthcare infrastructure. There is a need for region-specific antivenoms and updated treatment guidelines tailored to the local snake fauna.

Rajasthan, with its desert-adapted snakes, and the North East, where haemotoxic Big Four species are rare, require different management approaches compared to other parts of India. Physicians' experiences and clinical observations suggest that the Indian polyvalent antivenom (IPAV) is ineffective against H. hypnale venom. However, in a recent survey, 43% of respondents indicated they would administer the currently available polyvalent antivenom for snakebites positively identified as H. hypnale. They based their decision on: "relying on a syndromic approach rather than species identification", "lacking confidence in accurately identifying the snake", and "concern about medicolegal implications of withholding antivenom from patients showing signs of envenomation". The panel emphasized that administering the Indian polyvalent antivenom (IPAV) for H. hypnale envenomation could cause more harm than benefit, particularly when there are risks of adverse reactions.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^116i6cPE]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

A progressive strategy should be used, beginning with patient education and lifestyle changes to minimize triggers of periodic paralysis (PP), followed by potassium therapy (supplement or avoidance) and the use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. As an initial step, discussion of triggering factors, especially diet, may be beneficial to decrease the number of attacks. Professional advice from a dietician may also be beneficial.

An understanding of the episodic nature of the disease is important for children, and health officials should be informed at schools where children with periodic paralysis are enrolled. If the potassium level during attacks is unknown, behavioral strategies for acute attacks should be used, such as mild exercise at attack onset.

Pharmacological interventions consist of therapy to abort acute attacks and chronic preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency. Treatment options for periodic paralyses are limited, and aside from the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of dichlorphenamide, they are based largely on anecdotal experience.

- **Table**: General approach to treatment for primary periodic paralyses.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, particularly acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide, have been used for almost 50 years as empiric treatment for both hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP). The mechanism of action in periodic paralyses is incompletely understood. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors promote kaliuresis and a non-anion gap acidosis by increasing urinary bicarbonate excretion. The systemic acidosis may reduce the…

### Probable Irukandji-like syndrome in the US Florida Keys [^116BhGmd]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

Sixteen of the world's 50 known species of box jellyfish are associated with Irukandji syndrome, which involves a multitude of delayed reactionary and potentially life-threatening symptoms. The most common species associated with Irukandji syndrome is Carukia barnesi (C. barnesi), a very small member of the Carybdeid family. These box jellyfish are native to Australian waters, where most cases of Irukandji syndrome occur. However, cases of Irukandji-like syndrome have been reported worldwide after envenomation by species other than C. barnesi, including non-Carybdeid jellyfish. Herein, we report a probable new case of Irukandji-like syndrome in the US Florida Keys, a region where C. barnesi has not been recorded. Although it is unclear exactly which jellyfish are the causal organisms, a clustering of four incidents in the western Florida Keys suggests that jellyfish other than C. barnesi, or possibly non-Carybdeid jellyfish, are causing Irukandji-like syndromes in this area.

### Global mortality of snakebite envenoming between 1990 and 2019 [^116n1E7R]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

We started by reviewing GBD 2019 mortality estimates for venomous animal contact. The GBD study and its methodological framework to estimate mortality due to injuries have been described in detail elsewhere.

In brief, we used a subset of the data for venomous animal contact to identify snakebite-specific mortality, as well as other animal-specific mortality. We evaluated these data using models that captured spatiotemporal patterns to estimate mortality for four different animals — snakes, bees, scorpions, spiders — and for a fifth residual category, which is other venomous animal contact. We adjusted each animal-specific mortality estimate so that their sum equaled the GBD 2019 overall venomous animal contact mortality estimates, thus preserving internal consistency. To account for uncertainty in the primary data, data processing, measurement error, and the choice of model, every model in the process was run 1000 times to produce final estimates with 95% uncertainty intervals, comprising the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of 1000 draws.

- **GBD 2019 venomous animal contact estimation**: We used published GBD 2019 estimates for overall venomous animal contact mortality as a platform for our analysis. A summary of the GBD 2019 estimation approach for mortality from venomous animal contact follows. The case definition for a venomous animal contact death in GBD 2019 was death resulting from unintentionally being bitten by, stung by, or exposed to a non-human venomous animal. We identified deaths in VR and VA cause of death data using ICD-9 codes E905-E905.99 and ICD-10 codes.

### Clinical challenges, controversies, and regional strategies in snakebite care in India [^112K2vR2]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

The Australian experience highlights a shift from using monovalent antivenoms guided by unreliable snake venom detection kits to focusing on diagnosing envenomation and administering polyvalent antivenom, or two key monovalent antivenoms (brown and tiger snake), based on geography and clinical presentation. This approach has simplified antivenom use, reduced errors, and minimized risks associated with incorrect antivenom administration, highlighting the importance of diagnostic clarity and pragmatic treatment strategies. Syndromic management, supported by region-specific clinical guidelines, remains the most pragmatic approach until more effective diagnostic and treatment options become available in the region. The inconsistent adherence to snakebite management protocols across India highlights the need for standardized yet adaptable guidelines that cater to regional specificities, ensuring effective, contextually appropriate care that enhances patient outcomes and optimizes resource use.

- **Plasmaphaeresis**: Theoretically, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) should facilitate the removal of venom toxins from the intravascular compartment, potentially redistributing them from extravascular spaces for subsequent elimination. While early case reports and studies indicate its utility in managing hematologic complications, robust evidence remains sparse. A retrospective study of 37 snakebite patients treated with TPE showed significant laboratory improvements and limb salvage without complications.

### Managing snakebite [^112atYdu]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

We searched the Cochrane Library, Google, and PubMed using the MeSH terms: "(snakebite, diagnosis and treatment guidelines) and (snake, scientific names of individual snake species, snakebite, envenoming, venom, and antivenom)". Research papers and case reports from Latin America, South and South-East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa were retrieved. There were no language restrictions. Additional articles were obtained by citation tracking of review and original articles. Although the search focused on key papers published in the past five years, older publications of importance have been included. The review also drew from the widely established African and South-East Asian regional guidelines on the treatment and prevention of snakebite envenoming.

### Neurologists and the threat of bioterrorism [^116DSRYy]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Neurologists are most likely to be involved in diagnosing bioterrorist attacks utilizing botulinum toxin. Oral ingestion or possibly inhalation are likely routes of delivery. The characteristic descending paralysis starts in the extraocular and bulbar muscles, with associated autonomic features. Repetitive nerve stimulation usually shows an incremental muscle response. Treatment is supportive.

The differential diagnosis includes naturally occurring paralysing illnesses such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic crisis, or diphtheria; paralysing seafood neurotoxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin; snake envenomation; and chemical warfare poisoning by organophosphates. Primary neurological infections are less feasible for use as bioweapons. However, there are theoretical possibilities for Venezuelan equine encephalitis transmission by inhalation and secondary zoonotic transmission cycles sustained by horses and mosquitoes. Severe haemorrhagic meningitis regularly occurs in anthrax, usually after severe systemic disease likely transmitted by spore inhalation.

- **Panic and symptomatology**: Panic and psychologically determined 'me-too' symptomatology are likely to pose the biggest diagnostic and management burden for neurologists handling a bioterrorist attack on an institution or a civilian population. Indeed, civilian panic and disablement of institutional operations are likely to be prominent intentions of any bioterrorist attack.

### Managing snakebite [^1139L4ef]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Reassure the person about prompt first aid and medical assistance to allay fears. Arrange for rapid transport to the nearest medical facility, preferably with access to antivenom and critical care support.

- **First aid measures**: Immobilize the person, especially the bitten limb, to slow venom spread. Remove rings and other tight objects around the limb. A systematic review identified pressure immobilization with an elastic bandage or pad (at a comfortable pressure) at the bite site as an effective first aid measure to slow venom spread, but the quality of evidence was very low. Its use is variable and is discouraged in most practice and guidelines because of the uncertainty of benefit and possibility of worsening local tissue damage. However, pressure immobilization is generally recommended for neurotoxic elapid bites in some regions. Its clinical efficacy and risk of worsening soft tissue injury in local envenoming have not been adequately assessed. A small study (15 patients) in Myanmar found that pressure pads were effective in reducing venom spread in Russell's viper bite, and local effects after pad application were no more severe than those before treatment.

- **Avoid harmful practices**: Tourniquets can cause severe local damage and gangrene and must not be used. It is common for communities to resort to traditional therapies such as wound incisions, cauterization, and application of herbs, minerals, or animal excrement. These can delay access to effective treatment and may cause more harm. Irrigate eyes with copious amounts of water if there is exposure to venom.

### Clinical management of North American snake and marine envenomations [^112TM2wf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Low credibility.

Envenomations rank as the 23rd most common reason for calls to US poison control centers, with over 35,000 incidents reported annually. Snake bites account for over 20% of these calls, while marine envenomations are likely underreported at 3% to 4%. Although these envenomations may not be encountered daily by many physicians, they warrant unique management strategies based on the offending creature and symptom presentation. This text serves as a review of the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and management of endemic North American species of snakes and marine vertebrate and invertebrate envenomations.

### Interventions for the symptoms and signs resulting from jellyfish stings [^115vBCKE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Jellyfish envenomations are common in temperate coastal regions and vary in severity depending on the species. Stings result in a variety of symptoms and signs, including pain, dermatological reactions, and, in some species, Irukandji syndrome. Irukandji syndrome manifests as abdominal, back, or chest pain, tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, piloerection, agitation, and sometimes cardiac complications. Many treatments have been suggested for jellyfish stings; however, it remains unclear which interventions are most effective.

- **Objectives**: To determine the benefits and harms associated with the use of any intervention, in both adults and children, for the treatment of jellyfish stings, as assessed from randomized trials.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases in October 2012 and again in October 2013: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, Issue 9, 2013); MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1948 to 22 October 2013); EMBASE via Ovid SP (1980 to 21 October 2013); and Web of Science (all databases; 1899 to 21 October 2013). We also searched reference lists from eligible studies and guidelines, conference proceedings, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and contacted content experts to identify trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared any intervention(s) to active and/or non-active controls for the treatment of symptoms and signs of jellyfish sting envenomation. No language, publication date, or publication status restrictions were applied.

### Managing an unidentified jellyfish sting with mixed envenomation syndrome at a noncoastal hospital: Is this a new form of jellyfish envenomation [^115Qhhhi]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Jellyfish stings are the most common cause of marine envenomation in humans. Various species of box jellyfish have been identified around Penang Island, Malaysia, including multitentacled and four-tentacled box jellyfish (class Cubozoa). The typical syndrome following envenomation from these jellyfish has been poorly documented, posing a greater challenge when managing an unidentified jellyfish sting from Penang Island. We report a case of a 32-year-old man from Penang Island stung by an unidentified jellyfish while walking into the sea. The patient reported feeling immediate and severe electric current-like pain over both thighs, left flank, and left forearm, followed by chest discomfort and breathlessness. Vinegar was applied over the affected areas, and he was rushed to a hospital, where he was treated with analgesia, steroids, and antihistamine. He refused hospitalization and was discharged against medical advice.

He then presented to a noncoastal hospital 377 km away in Kuala Lumpur the following day with severe pain over the affected sites as well as chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and abdominal cramps. The electrocardiograph demonstrated features of Wolff-Parkinson-White. Serial blood test results showed elevated creatine kinase but normal troponin I levels. The patient was managed symptomatically over a period of 4 days and was discharged with cardiology follow-up. Appropriate health-seeking behavior needs to be emphasized. This case report provides an opportunity to document the signs and symptoms of envenomation from possibly an undescribed jellyfish species and highlights the challenges faced in noncoastal hospital settings.

### Bilateral ptosis in a child following massive attack by a swarm of wasps [^113sPZGS]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Neurological manifestations of wasp stings are rare, and the etiopathogenesis is not completely understood. We report a case of a 2-year-old girl who developed bilateral ptosis after multiple wasp stings. The condition responded partially to pyridostigmine. This is the first reported case of wasp venom-induced ptosis in a child. We discuss the possible pathogenetic mechanisms behind this phenomenon.

### Scorpion bite-induced unilateral pulmonary oedema [^111rRbUE]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 24-year-old woman presented to the emergency room of our hospital six hours after sustaining a sting on the pulp of her middle finger of the left upper limb by an Indian red scorpion. On examination, she exhibited tachycardia, tachypnoea, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation at room temperature. Auscultation revealed poor air entry in all areas of the right lung, accompanied by crackles, while the left lung field was normal. Chest X-ray showed unilateral haziness of the right lung field. Two-dimensional echocardiography indicated clinical findings of myocarditis. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis with severe hypoxaemia, suggestive of type 1 respiratory failure.

After intubation and initiation of ventilatory support, the patient received intravenous analgesics, antihistamines, and infiltration at the bite site with 2% xylocaine. She was also started on inotropes, an alpha receptor blocker, intravenous steroids, bronchodilators, and diuretics. The patient clinically improved over the course of treatment and was subsequently discharged.

### Infectious complications following snakebite byin Martinique: A case series [^116vWpkR]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Snakebites account for about 1.8–2.7 million envenomings and 81,000–138,000 deaths per year worldwide. In Martinique, about 30 cases of snakebite are recorded every year. Bothrops lanceolatus, a member of the Viperidae family, Crotalinae subfamily, is the only venomous species encountered in Martinique. Bothrops lanceolatus bites may result in severe thrombotic complications, including cerebral, pulmonary, and myocardial infarction, as well as coagulation disorders and endothelial injuries, which could be fatal or involve long-term sequelae. Thus, envenomed patients should promptly receive a specific antivenom to prevent such severe complications.

Snakebites are frequently responsible for local complications combining pain and local edema in the minutes following the bite, followed, in severe cases, by local necrosis and blistering. Wound infection may contribute to tissue necrosis, bacteremia, and even septic shock. Like in envenomings by other snakes, such infectious complications are routinely observed following B. lanceolatus bites, but their precise incidence is unknown.

The oral bacterial flora of B. lanceolatus includes Aeromonas hydrophila, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus spp., and Enterococcus spp. These bacteria are usually found in post-snakebite abscesses, suggesting that they have been inoculated in the wound from the snake oral cavity, thus supporting the possible need for empiric antibiotic treatment after the snakebite, particularly in cases associated with prominent local tissue damage.

### Snakebites reported to the Kentucky Regional Poison Control Centers for the years 2012–2016 [^11645Qa7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Snake envenomations cause significant morbidity and mortality. The goals of this study were to assess the epidemiology of snakebites in Kentucky and the treatment strategies used by physicians reporting to the Kentucky Regional Poison Control Centers.

- **Methods**: This was a descriptive epidemiologic study compiling clinical data on snakebites reported to the Kentucky Regional Poison Control Centers from 2012 to 2016. We built a database of the patient demographics, treatment, and clinical course of each snakebite reported in the study period. Attention was paid to all antivenom interventions and the use of contraindicated therapies.

- **Results**: We compiled 674 total records. The patient age was 34 ± 18 years (mean ± SD), with males (71%) predominating. Most (97%) bites were to a distal upper or lower extremity. The majority (78%) occurred at a private residence. Most reports came between May and September (88%). Of the 674 patients, 24% (n = 159) were classified as moderate or severe. Two hundred thirty (34%) patients were admitted to the hospital. Forty-six patients (7%) received surgical consultation, and 12 (2%) underwent surgical intervention. One hundred fifty-three patients received antivenom, with 6 ± 3 vials used per patient. The length of stay was 3 ± 2 days when antivenom was administered and 2 ± 2 days when not administered. Six cases of coagulopathy were noted. Multiple contraindicated therapies were noted.

- **Conclusions**: Snake envenomations are a prevalent public health concern for residents of Kentucky, chiefly during summer months. Significant medical intervention is being performed.

### Oral varespladib for the treatment of snakebite envenoming in India and the United States (BRAVO): A phase II randomised clinical trial [^114jYYVY]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

The timing of outcome assessments is also important. Based on findings from studies of varespladib in animal models with lethal doses of venoms, we selected a primary outcome measured 6 and 9 hours after randomisation. The results of this trial confirm that, regardless of treatment arm, some toxicities resolve within 9 hours (e.g. cardiovascular) and some are unchanged over the first 48 hours (e.g. local wound and blood components that do not normally regenerate in 6–9 hours). The challenge of identifying a time frame for recovery that captures benefit for different toxicities is a study design issue that will need to be addressed in future global SBE studies. A measure that integrates differences observed over time, such as AUC, may provide a practical solution to this challenge.

Patient-reported physical function during recovery from SBE is an important patient-centred aspect of SBE that has been incorporated into prior studies. More specifically, the PSFS is an extensively validated, patient-reported measure that has had an in-depth psychometric evaluation in SBE. In patients treated within 5 hours, the point estimate for the increase in PSFS at day 3 for varespladib versus placebo exceeded the established minimum clinically important difference of 1.0 on the 11-point PSFS scale. We augmented this analysis of recovery by performing a post-hoc evaluation of the proportion of patients achieving complete recovery, defined as an SSS of 0. This outcome provides an intuitive and unambiguous clinical endpoint that approximates the condition under which a patient has had resolution.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^115AuwsF]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

In the absence of an identified genetic mutation in approximately 30% of patients, periodic paralysis subtypes can be distinguished on the basis of clinical presentation, serum potassium levels during attacks, and pattern of abnormalities on long exercise testing. If primary periodic paralysis (PP) is suspected but cannot be confirmed by genetic testing, further examination should be undertaken to confirm that the symptoms are not secondary to other conditions, such as thyrotoxicosis or secondary causes of blood potassium deficiency or excess.

Electrodiagnostic testing has been a mainstay to demonstrate evidence of muscle fiber changes in excitability in the muscle channelopathies. On needle electromyography (EMG), positive sharp waves and myotonia, characterized by spontaneous waxing and waning motor unit potential amplitude and frequency, can be seen in paramyotonia congenita (PMC) and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP). In PP, long exercise testing has largely replaced provocative maneuvers, which induce full-body attacks of paralysis. In the long exercise test, a focal attack of paralysis is induced by exercise of a single muscle. The patient is instructed to perform repeated isometric contractions of the abductor digiti minimi muscle over 5 minutes (in 15-second blocks alternating with 3–4 seconds of rest), and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) are recorded after supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve every minute or every other minute for 40–60 minutes post-exercise. A reduction in CMAP amplitude of 40% or more is an important diagnostic indicator.

### Identification and characterization of a novel botulinum neurotoxin [^111HW4m8]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

BoNT/X induced flaccid paralysis in vivo in mice

We next sought to determine whether BoNT/X is active in vivo using a well-established non-lethal assay in mice, known as the Digit Abduction Score (DAS) assay, which measures local muscle paralysis following injection of BoNTs into mouse hind limb muscles. BoNTs cause flaccid paralysis of limb muscles, which is manifested as the failure to spread the toes in response to a startle stimulus. We injected ligated X-FL (0.5 μg, activated by trypsin treatment) into the gastrocnemius muscles of the right hind limb in mice, which induced typical flaccid paralysis and the failure of toes to spread (Fig. 4f), indicating that BoNT/X is capable of causing flaccid paralysis in vivo. We note that the potency of ligated X-FL appears to be much lower than other BoNTs in this assay. To further confirm the low toxicity of ligated X-FL, we injected mice with 1 μg of ligated X-FL intraperitoneally (n = 3). No mice showed any systemic effects and all survived at this dose. Thus, ligated X-FL has a rather low toxicity in vivo in mice compared with other native BoNTs, which usually have lethal doses at low picogram levels per mouse.

### Venomous bites, stings, and poisoning: An update [^11211sU6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

This article discusses the epidemiology, prevention, clinical features, and treatment of venomous bites by snakes, lizards, and spiders; stings by fish, jellyfish, echinoderms, insects, and scorpions; and poisoning by ingestion of fish, turtles, and shellfish. Invertebrate stings cause fatalities by anaphylaxis, secondary to acquired hypersensitivity (Hymenoptera, such as bees, wasps, and ants; and jellyfish), and by direct envenoming (scorpions, spiders, jellyfish, and echinoderms). Simple preventive techniques, such as wearing protective clothing, using a flashlight at night, and excluding venomous animals from sleeping quarters, are of paramount importance to reduce the risk of venomous bites and stings.

### Venomous bites, stings, and poisoning [^117DUETa]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

This article discusses the epidemiology, prevention, clinical features, first aid, and medical treatment of venomous bites by snakes, lizards, and spiders; stings by fish, jellyfish, echinoderms, and insects; and poisoning by fish and mollusks, in all parts of the world. Of these envenomings and poisonings, snake bites cause the greatest burden of human suffering, killing 46,000 people each year in India alone and more than 100,000 worldwide, resulting in physical handicap in many survivors. Specific antidotes (antivenoms/antivenins) are available to treat envenoming by many of these taxa, but supply and distribution are inadequate in many tropical developing countries.
