## Question

what do we do with ESRD on HD patient and presetnd with AHRF? and voluem overload

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage an ESRD patient on hemodialysis presenting with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from volume overload. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation. Then, I should consider temporizing nondialytic measures if dialysis is delayed. Next, I will determine the definitive dialytic strategy including modality and ultrafiltration parameters. After that, I need to plan intradialytic monitoring to prevent hemodynamic instability. Finally, I should reassess post-dialysis response, adjust dry weight, and lay out prevention of recurrence along with special considerations and pitfalls to avoid, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-supported practice where available.

> Let me first confirm the likely cause of acute hypoxemia here; in an anuric or near-anuric ESRD patient with increased work of breathing and crackles, pulmonary edema from volume overload is the most probable driver, so I should immediately address oxygenation while reducing preload and afterload to stabilize gas exchange, all while preparing for urgent dialysis because volume removal is definitive in this scenario [^115TmtmT].

> I need to ensure oxygen delivery right away; start supplemental oxygen and titrate to maintain adequate saturations, and consider a trial of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, such as CPAP, if the patient is cooperative, protecting their airway, and not rapidly deteriorating, because positive pressure can recruit alveoli and reduce preload in cardiogenic pulmonary edema phenotypes, even though most high-quality NIV recommendations are anchored in hypercapnic COPD rather than uremic pulmonary edema per se; if NIV fails or the patient is in extremis, I should intubate and use lung-protective ventilation parameters consistent with ARDS strategies if a diffuse alveolar injury phenotype emerges, employing low tidal volumes to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury [^112LeyY1] [^116YETcU].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall I nearly introduced; I initially thought I should be unusually cautious with NIV purely because the patient is ESRD, but that overstates the risk in this context, as the contraindications to NIV are general and not unique to ESRD, and the hemodynamic benefits of positive pressure can be helpful in cardiogenic pulmonary edema while the airway is protected; so I should correct that and maintain standard NIV precautions rather than add ESRD-specific restrictions that are not evidence-based [^113XQkSF] [^112LeyY1].

> Next, I will examine hemodynamics and positioning; I should place the patient upright to reduce venous return, establish IV access, check blood pressure and MAP continuously if possible, and draw baseline labs with an arterial blood gas to define the severity of hypoxemia and any mixed acid-base disorder; I can obtain natriuretic peptides but must interpret them cautiously in ESRD given chronic elevation and confounding by ventricular hypertrophy and altered clearance, so trend and clinical context matter more than absolute cutoffs here [^111EG6UV].

> If urgent dialysis cannot begin within the next 1–2 hours, I should initiate temporizing pharmacologic measures to bridge to dialysis; IV nitrates to reduce preload and pulmonary congestion are reasonable, high-dose loop diuretics can be tried if there is any residual kidney function though response is often limited, and carefully titrated low-dose opioids for distress may be considered with caution while monitoring ventilation; CPAP can augment oxygenation and reduce venous return; but I need to be clear with myself that these are temporizing only and cannot substitute for extracorporeal fluid removal in anuric ESRD [^116Zagv6] [^115TmtmT].

> Hold on, I should verify that dialysis is indeed the definitive therapy here; yes, for refractory volume overload in ESRD with respiratory failure, extracorporeal therapies are indicated, so I must mobilize urgent hemodialysis with ultrafiltration as the first-line definitive intervention, ensuring timely initiation rather than delaying for extensive diagnostics once life-threatening congestion is established [^115TmtmT] [^116mWRLn].

> Now I need to decide on the dialytic modality; if the patient is hemodynamically tolerating, conventional intermittent hemodialysis with ultrafiltration is appropriate; if they are unstable or at high risk for intradialytic hypotension, SLED or CRRT provide slower, more controlled fluid removal and better hemodynamic tolerance, so I should coordinate with the ICU and nephrology teams to match modality to hemodynamic fragility and resource availability [^113cdHcT] [^112NsDPx] [^116nN6CH].

> Let me think about the dialysis prescription; I should calculate the target ultrafiltration volume based on interdialytic weight gain and clinical signs of overload, but I need to ensure ultrafiltration rates are modest to reduce the risk of myocardial stunning and intradialytic hypotension, often aiming below about 10–13 mL/kg per hour while accepting staged achievement of dry weight if needed; using a cooler dialysate at or below 36°C can improve hemodynamic stability, and setting a moderate blood flow rate can allow time for vascular refilling, all to balance decongestion with perfusion [^114RvxAV] [^111nzBEe] [^114wVWNG].

> I should double-check intradialytic monitoring; continuous noninvasive blood pressure or arterial line when available, with vigilance for intradialytic hypotension defined by KDOQI as a drop in systolic blood pressure over 20 mmHg or mean arterial pressure over 10 mmHg with symptoms; if it occurs, I need to promptly reduce the ultrafiltration rate, give small saline boluses if symptomatic and hypoperfused, and temporarily stop ultrafiltration to stabilize before resuming at a gentler rate [^111eQcKP] [^113cdHcT].

> Next, I should review objective tools to better guide volume removal; bioimpedance can quantify overhydration and support target weight adjustments, while lung ultrasound can track B-lines as a direct marker of extravascular lung water, and blood volume monitoring–guided ultrafiltration can improve hemodynamic tolerance and help "probe" dry weight more safely than clinical assessment alone [^114wVWNG] [^112eiGp8].

> I will now examine respiratory response during and after decongestion; I should follow serial pulse oximetry and respiratory rate, repeat an arterial blood gas after one to two hours of effective decongestion or sooner if deterioration occurs, and obtain a chest radiograph if improvement is not as expected; if invasive ventilation becomes necessary, I must apply lung-protective strategies with low tidal volume targets to mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury while continuing decongestive dialysis in parallel [^116YETcU].

> After the session, I need to evaluate the clinical and objective response; signs of success include improved work of breathing, oxygenation approaching baseline requirements, fewer crackles, weight decrement matching planned ultrafiltration, and a reduction in lung ultrasound B-lines; based on the response, I should consider lowering the estimated dry weight and plan for reassessment using clinical and objective tools at regular intervals to avoid both residual congestion and over-depletion [^114RvxAV] [^114wVWNG].

> To prevent recurrence, I should confirm patient education on fluid and sodium restriction, reinforce medication reconciliation to limit agents that predispose to intradialytic hypotension on dialysis days, and consider more frequent or longer dialysis sessions in patients with recurrent interdialytic weight gains to allow slower, safer ultrafiltration; I need to ensure shared decision-making around adherence and scheduling barriers because sustained volume control is central to outcomes in maintenance dialysis [^116mWRLn] [^114RvxAV].

> If the case is refractory despite these measures, I should reconsider the approach; isolated ultrafiltration devices can be considered where available, and in the ICU, continuous therapies may be needed to match fluid removal to hemodynamic tolerance; I must also assess for concomitant pulmonary hypertension or right-heart strain where targeted therapy may be warranted, and involve intensive care for ventilatory support escalation as needed, acknowledging the bidirectional lung–kidney interactions at play [^111Xaw8j] [^116frfnz].

> I should avoid harmful practices; large fluid boluses will worsen pulmonary edema unless there is life-threatening shock, delaying dialysis in a decompensated, anuric patient risks ongoing respiratory failure, and relying solely on clinical assessment for dry weight and congestion is error-prone, so I should supplement with objective measures where feasible and maintain a low threshold for definitive extracorporeal decongestion in hypoxemic fluid overload [^1111LvXs] [^114RvxAV] [^116mWRLn].

> Summarizing the key principles, fluid overload is common and strongly linked to adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients, clinical assessment of volume status is insufficiently reliable on its own, balancing decongestion against intradialytic hypotension and myocardial stunning is critical, technological adjuncts like blood volume monitoring, cooler dialysate, and slower ultrafiltration improve tolerance, and while nondialytic measures can bridge, urgent dialysis is the definitive therapy in anuric decompensation with hypoxemia [^114wVWNG] [^112eiGp8] [^116Zagv6] [^114RvxAV].

> Final algorithm in my mind, after double-checking the steps: stabilize airway and oxygenation with supplemental oxygen and consider NIV when appropriate, initiate temporizing vasodilators and diuretics only as a bridge if dialysis is delayed, proceed to urgent dialysis with carefully titrated ultrafiltration using hemodynamically tolerant parameters, monitor closely for intradialytic hypotension and adjust in real time, reassess and lower dry weight if indicated, and prevent recurrence through dietary counseling, schedule optimization, and objective volume assessments integrated into routine care [^116mWRLn] [^114RvxAV] [^116frfnz].

For ESRD patients on HD presenting with AHRF and volume overload [^116mWRLn], the priority is **urgent fluid removal** via immediate hemodialysis [^115TmtmT] with controlled ultrafiltration to achieve dry weight [^113fbroc] and relieve pulmonary edema [^11212qFS]. If hemodynamically unstable, use **CRRT or SLED** for gentler fluid removal [^113cdHcT] [^116nN6CH]. Start oxygen and escalate to **NIV** [^113XQkSF] or invasive ventilation if needed, using lung-protective strategies (tidal volume 4–8 mL/kg PBW, plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H₂O, PEEP 5–10 cm H₂O) [^116YETcU]. Avoid **diuretics**, monitor electrolytes and acid–base status closely [^116mWRLn], and reassess volume status with clinical exam, lung ultrasound [^114wVWNG], and bioimpedance [^114RvxAV]. Address precipitating causes, prevent recurrence with strict fluid and sodium restrictions [^113fbroc], and adjust the dialysis prescription to maintain euvolemia [^111nzBEe].

---

## Immediate clinical assessment and stabilization

- **Airway and breathing**: Ensure airway patency and initiate supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO₂ ≥ 92%. Escalate to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) [^113XQkSF] if respiratory distress or hypercapnia persists, and proceed to invasive mechanical ventilation if NIV fails or the patient deteriorates [^116YETcU].

- **Circulation**: Assess hemodynamic stability. Hypotension or shock may necessitate vasopressor support (e.g. norepinephrine) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg.

- **Volume status**: Perform a rapid clinical assessment (jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, lung crackles) and obtain chest radiography to confirm pulmonary edema [^114RvxAV].

---

## Dialysis management and fluid removal

### Immediate dialysis initiation

- **Urgent hemodialysis**: Initiate immediate hemodialysis [^116mWRLn] with controlled ultrafiltration [^114RvxAV] to remove excess fluid and achieve dry weight [^113fbroc]. This is the cornerstone of management for volume overload in ESRD patients [^11212qFS].

- **Ultrafiltration rate**: Target an ultrafiltration rate of 8–10 mL/kg/h, adjusted based on hemodynamic tolerance and patient stability.

- **Dialysate composition**: Use a dialysate sodium concentration of 138–140 mmol/L to minimize intradialytic hypotension and muscle cramps.

- **Dialysate temperature**: Maintain dialysate temperature at 35–36°C to reduce intradialytic hypotension risk [^114RvxAV].

---

### Alternative dialysis modalities

Consider **continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)** or **sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED)** for hemodynamically unstable patients to enable gentler fluid removal and improve hemodynamic stability [^113cdHcT] [^112NsDPx].

---

## Respiratory support and ventilation strategies

- **Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)**: Initiate NIV (e.g. bilevel positive airway pressure) for hypercapnic respiratory failure, particularly in COPD exacerbations or obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^113XQkSF] [^112LeyY1] [^1174hykS].

- **Invasive mechanical ventilation**: If NIV fails or the patient deteriorates, initiate invasive mechanical ventilation with lung-protective strategies:

	- **Tidal volume**: 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) [^116YETcU].

	- **Plateau pressure**: ≤ 30 cm H₂O.

	- **Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)**: 5–10 cm H₂O, adjusted to minimize alveolar collapse and improve oxygenation.

- **Avoidance of fluid overload**: Carefully monitor fluid balance during mechanical ventilation to prevent exacerbation of pulmonary edema [^116frfnz].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of dialysis prescription

Regularly reassess **volume status** with clinical examination, lung ultrasound [^11212qFS], and bioimpedance spectroscopy [^114RvxAV] to guide ultrafiltration targets and prevent intradialytic hypotension. Closely monitor serum electrolytes (potassium, calcium, bicarbonate) and acid–base status, adjusting the dialysis prescription as needed [^116mWRLn]. Remove fluid gradually to avoid rapid shifts that precipitate intradialytic hypotension, myocardial stunning, or cerebral edema [^111nzBEe] [^112jtYxA].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Diuretics are **generally ineffective** in ESRD because residual renal function is minimal; loop diuretics may be considered if meaningful urine output persists, though efficacy is limited [^113eN7NN]. Vasodilators such as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside can be used cautiously to reduce preload and afterload, improving cardiac output and oxygenation. If bronchospasm contributes to respiratory distress, administer inhaled bronchodilators (e.g. albuterol).

---

## Complications and preventive strategies

Prevent **intradialytic hypotension** through careful ultrafiltration rate adjustment, dialysate sodium profiling, and appropriate patient positioning [^114RvxAV]. Monitor for and promptly correct electrolyte disturbances, including hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic acidosis [^116mWRLn]. Maintain strict aseptic technique during catheter manipulation to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections [^116mWRLn].

---

## Long-term management and prevention of recurrence

Long-term management centers on **patient education** to reinforce adherence to fluid and sodium restrictions, regular dialysis sessions, and medication adherence [^113fbroc]. Individualize the dialysis prescription — frequency, duration, and ultrafiltration targets — to maintain euvolemia and prevent recurrent volume overload [^111nzBEe]. Arrange regular follow-up to monitor volume status, cardiovascular health, and dialysis adequacy [^114RvxAV].

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^113fbroc]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

The two main treatment parameters by which clinicians aim to optimize fluid control are target weight and ultrafiltration rate. Since the earliest days of dialysis, setting ultrafiltration to achieve a set target weight post dialysis, at which the patient is at their correct volume (or "dry"), has been the accepted method of maintaining a consistent volume state. However, the method is dependent on an accurate estimation of the correct target weight. Although most often assessed by clinical examination, the inaccuracy of this method is widely recognized, leading to both overestimation and underestimation. Overestimation can contribute to hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, while underestimation may accelerate the loss of residual kidney function and pose a risk of myocardial stunning.

To improve upon clinical assessment, nephrologists at one time advocated "probing" target weight: a gradual reduction until patients report symptoms suggesting hypovolemia. However, this approach may reduce treatment compliance. A more collaborative approach is increasingly common, where possible; patients should be encouraged to participate in monitoring their fluid status. Terminology should be simple and intuitively understood. For example, when discussing target weight, the term "dry weight" might suggest that the aim is to remove as much fluid as possible, while "ideal weight" can be confusing as it is also used to describe the preferred body mass index. Although less accurate, the term "hydration" is more familiar than "volume" as a description of fluid status. Stable patients should be assessed regularly to ensure accuracy in fluid control and treatment adherence.

### Volume overload in hemodialysis: Diagnosis, cardiovascular consequences, and management [^11212qFS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Fluid overload is a major risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the hemodialysis (HD) population. Volume overload underlies hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and dysfunction, as well as pulmonary circulation overload in these patients, and is a major contributor to the dire prognosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Dry weight assessment in clinical practice still rests on subjective evaluation of patient signs and symptoms rather than on objective measurements. However, clinical criteria to evaluate fluid balance are notoriously unreliable, and for this reason, volume overload goes undetected in HD patients. Inaccurate evaluation of fluid volume status may lead to incorrect antihypertensive drugs and ultrafiltration prescriptions.

The diagnosis of subclinical volume overload in HD patients has been a matter of research for decades. Bioimpedance spectroscopy is a widely used technique that provides reliable estimates of fluid overload in these patients, but adequately powered clinical trials based on clinical endpoints for recommending this technique as a useful instrument to guide ultrafiltration prescription in clinical practice are still lacking.

Lung ultrasound (US) subjectively quantifies interstitial fluid accumulation in a critical area of the central circulation, like the lung. Recent evidence suggests that application of this method may be useful to safely reduce ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive HD patients. Whether a lung US-guided treatment strategy can decrease major outcomes in high-risk HD patients remains to be answered by the ongoing LUST study. Apart from optimal dry weight estimation, management…

Regarding respiratory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, especially concerning mechanical ventilation and tidal volume targets, the ESICM 2023 guidelines recommend using low tidal volume ventilation strategies (4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight) over high tidal volumes. Historically, high tidal volumes have been used to normalize blood gases, but adopting low tidal volume strategies can reduce mortality in patients with ARDS not due to COVID-19.

### Volume overload and adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease: Clinical observational and animal studies [^111E9yx9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

- **Patients**: The baseline characteristics of the patients, divided based on the absence or presence of volume overload, are presented. During a median follow-up of 2.1 years, 78 patients in the volume-overload group (44.6%) reached the primary end point, compared with 22 in the euvolemia group (13.5%). Additionally, 71 patients (21%) progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring chronic dialysis.

- **Primary outcome**: The decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with volume overload was significantly faster than in those without volume overload (eGFR slope: −4.3 [−12.6, 1.2] versus −1.7 [−7.8, 2.7] mL/min per 1.73 m² per year, respectively; P < 0.05). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis revealed a significantly higher progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or ESRD in patients with volume overload (P < 0.001 by the log-rank test). In the multivariable regression analysis, patients with volume overload had more than double the risk of the composite end point (adjusted HR 2.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45 to 4.13; P = 0.001).

To further elucidate the contribution of elevated overhydration (OH) levels, we performed multivariable Cox analyses with OH as a continuous variable. These analyses confirmed an increased risk of the composite end point (adjusted HR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.42; P < 0.001) for every 1-liter increase in OH.

### Nondialytic management of hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema among end-stage renal disease patients: An evaluation of the evidence [^116Zagv6]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) and hyperkalemia are the two leading reasons for emergency dialysis among individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While hemodialysis serves as definitive treatment for both hyperkalemia and volume overload in ESRD patients, the initiation of dialysis may be delayed for those presenting outside of "regular dialysis hours". Nondialytic management can be instituted immediately and should be the initial therapy in managing hyperkalemia and CHF in these individuals.

The available evidence does not allow conclusions as to whether treatment with nondialytic strategies alone results in different outcomes than nondialytic strategies coupled with emergent hemodialysis. Therefore, whether or not nondialytic management alone is appropriate remains a matter of individual judgment that should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

### Early fluid management affects short-term mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [^1174xQdk]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) may experience low effective arterial blood volume and hemodynamic instability due to various combinations of sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, and other underlying diseases. Restoring intravascular volume and circulation may necessitate the administration of large volumes of intravenous fluids. Moreover, fluid overload — such as pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, or third-spacing — may be present upon ICU admission in ESKD patients on dialysis, who are vulnerable to poor fluid balance. Consequently, clinicians have chosen continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as a dialysis option to reduce fluid overload and secure hemodynamic stability. However, it remains unclear how to manage volume status by controlling CRRT input and output in these patients. Although a number of studies have addressed this issue, most have focused on acute kidney injury (AKI) patients. To our knowledge, the present study is the first attempt to investigate fluid balance in ESKD patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring CRRT.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^1152yYgd]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

In an acute care setting, delaying dialysis may not be an option for patients with a rapid decline in renal function and associated oliguria. The use of serum creatinine-based measures of renal function in these situations may be confounded by the decline in somatic protein stores in acutely ill patients. On the other hand, "early" dialysis initiation (absent a conventional or life-threatening indication) in the acute setting is not supported by available studies. As these acute episodes are common but not predictable, repeated joint decision discussions are necessary to have an understanding of a patient's preferences before these stressful, often intensive care unit-related decisions are required.

### Diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications of brain natriuretic peptide in dialysis and nondialysis-dependent chronic renal failure [^111EG6UV]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Premature cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure. Natriuretic peptides, specifically brain natriuretic peptide, are released from the heart in response to chamber distension and thus increase in the presence of volume expansion and cardiac overload. Their physiological role is to cause vasodilation and promote natriuresis to maintain volume homeostasis. Increasingly, serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide are used to both diagnose and manage cardiovascular disorders.

Furthermore, augmenting the beneficial hemodynamic actions of brain natriuretic peptide may have a therapeutic role in decompensated heart failure. However, the diagnostic role of serum brain natriuretic peptide levels in patients with advanced renal dysfunction remains to be defined. These patients have a high prevalence of left ventricular disorders, specifically left ventricular hypertrophy, which may reduce the diagnostic utility of brain natriuretic peptide. In addition, ventricular stretch may be determined by intravascular volume status rather than by cardiac dysfunction.

Nonetheless, as the prognosis for patients with end-stage renal failure and co-existing heart failure is so poor, the availability of a further marker of cardiac "distress" may in the future become a useful diagnostic tool and, in due course, may become a primary goal for titration and tailoring of therapy.

### Non-invasive venous waveform analysis (NIVA) for volume assessment in patients undergoing hemodialysis: An observational study [^111eQcKP]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) continues to represent a significant disease burden to patients and the healthcare system. Approximately one-third of patients with ESRD will proceed to kidney transplantation, while the remainder will require artificial renal-replacement therapy, most often accomplished via hemodialysis (HD). In 2016, 87.3% of incident individuals with ESRD began renal replacement therapy with HD, and 63.1% of all prevalent ESRD patients were receiving HD.

Comorbid cardiovascular conditions in the ESRD patient population are high, increasing the susceptibility to hemodynamic instability during HD, otherwise referred to as intradialytic hypotension (IDH). While there are no universal criteria for IDH, IDH is defined by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) criteria as a decrease in systolic blood pressure by > 20 mmHg or a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure by > 10 mmHg, associated with symptoms that include abdominal discomfort, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, restlessness, dizziness, fainting, and anxiety. IDH occurs because rapid fluid removal during HD depletes intravascular volume at a rate that exceeds that of secondary compartmental fluid shifts between the extravascular and intravascular compartments. This poses a major challenge in that IDH frequently results in premature termination of hemodialysis despite an overall state of volume overload due to inadequate urine production. Finding the right pairing of optimal volume removal with the appropriate volume removal rate is paramount to maintaining hemodynamic stability.

### End-stage renal disease in 2010: Timing of dialysis initiation and choice of dialysis modality [^112wtUYu]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Few, if any, doubt that renal transplantation should be the first choice of renal replacement therapy whenever this option is possible. But at which level of remaining kidney function should patients start on dialysis and which dialysis modality should be used? Several studies published in 2010 addressed these questions and will influence dialysis initiation strategies worldwide for years to come.

### On-line hemodiafiltration therapy for end-stage kidney disease patients: Promises for the future? What's next [^111cPAUy]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Low credibility.

OL-HDF remains a tool that has already brought advances in blood purification and offers a paradigm shift in renal replacement therapy for patients with end-stage kidney failure. As we have learned, renal replacement therapy for patients with chronic kidney disease has been a long journey, starting some 60 years ago. Improvements over time in its various components — such as buffer, membrane flux, treatment time, dialysate composition purity, and HD machine options — are supported by new clinical and biological findings. This continuous journey will not stop with OL-HDF.

Further developments are expected from more personalized treatment schedules, whether incremental, daily, nocturnal, or alternate day. Additionally, advancements may arise from dialyzers offering additional clearance of uremic toxins, particularly those modifying adsorption and displacement to remove protein-bound uremic toxins. New dialysis machine functionalities, such as biosensors, feedback loop control, and smart algorithms, or integration of dialysis machines into a web-based network system facilitating remote monitoring and clinical decision-making support, also hold promise.

Success in renal replacement therapy is a journey, not a destination. In this journey, OL-HDF represents a significant step forward designed to improve patient perceptions and outcomes.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^111Xaw8j]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The ultimate goal is to preserve tissue perfusion by optimizing fluid balance and effectively removing fluid without compromising the effective circulating fluid volume. Therefore, meticulous monitoring of fluid balance is critical for all patients.

Another option for treating patients with fluid overload is the use of new, smaller, and more portable devices like the Aquadex FlexFlow System (Baxter Healthcare). In patients with heart failure, Costanzo et al. compare adjustable ultrafiltration using a small ultrafiltration device to the use of intravenous loop diuretics. The authors found a trend toward longer time to recurrence of heart failure within 90 days after hospital discharge in patients treated with the ultrafiltration device and fewer heart failure and cardiovascular events. Changes in renal function and the 90-day mortality were similar in both groups. However, more patients who were randomized to adjustable ultrafiltration experienced an adverse effect of special interest (p = 0.018) and serious study product-related adverse events (p = 0.026).

### Initiation of dialysis should be timely: neither early nor late [^1125Gsji]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States are starting maintenance dialysis therapy at progressively higher estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR). Moreover, several observational studies have demonstrated an association of a higher risk of death with higher serum creatinine-based estimates of GFR at the time of initiation of dialysis. In contrast, studies in which renal function has been measured by timed urinary collection show either a lower risk of death or no significant association with higher GFR at the time of initiation of dialysis.

There are numerous potential sources of bias in such observational studies, particularly in those that use serum creatinine-based eGFR. The only randomized controlled clinical trial to have examined this question did not demonstrate either benefit or harm with the initiation of dialysis at a higher level of renal function. Thus, the data at the time of writing suggest that eGFR should not be the sole consideration when assessing the need for initiating maintenance dialysis in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

Given the high societal costs of starting renal replacement therapy earlier in the course of the disease, these considerations also suggest that dialysis can be safely postponed in otherwise asymptomatic individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease. By the same token, dialysis should not be denied to individuals who could clearly benefit from renal replacement therapy simply because the GFR is too high, such as in cases of volume overload or refractory hyperkalemia.

### Blood volume-monitored regulation of ultrafiltration to decrease the dry weight in fluid-overloaded hemodialysis patients: a randomized controlled trial [^112eiGp8]. BMC Nephrology (2017). High credibility.

In patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis treatment, excessive fluid volume is a major risk factor for death. Fluid overload, however, is potentially modifiable, and dialysis centers that emphasize strict volume control consistently report excellent survival results. In an observational study, the mortality benefit observed in hemodialysis patients without fluid overload was independent of blood pressure and dietary salt restriction, indicating that the dialysis prescription should primarily focus on the ideal target 'dry' weight for every patient.

The dry weight concept has evolved over time and now incorporates objective measures of volume status. Combining whole-body bioimpedance spectroscopy with a body composition model enables the quantification of fluid overload (in liters and as a percentage) above the extracellular fluid volume presumed 'normal' in a healthy individual. Despite their impaired renal function, hemodialysis patients can thus be classified as fluid overloaded, allowing for a precise prescription of their optimal dry weight based on bioimpedance spectroscopy measurements. This approach has been validated against gold standard methods of fluid assessment, including high-quality clinical assessment, demonstrating that it is an important addition to clinical judgment.

- **Strategies to facilitate fluid removal**: Regulation of ultrafiltration based on blood volume monitoring (BVM) and the modification of dialysate conductivity, as well as cooling. These techniques have shown to improve hemodynamics.

### The pathology of dialysis [^1152uZHx]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

There are a number of pathologies associated with the development of renal failure. Once renal function has deteriorated beyond a point where life is not sustainable without dialysis, new sets of pathologic processes develop. These are, in part, related to the continuation of poor renal function and to the process of dialysis itself. This article addresses the processes believed to be due to dialysis, among which are disorders of bone, deposition of metals and amyloid within a number of tissues, and local problems such as inflammation and tumors related to the dialysis site.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: Is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^115brG9V]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

A number of studies have focused on the comprehensive assessment of uremic signs and/or symptoms to determine optimal dialysis initiation. Chang et al. quantified uremic burden based on seven uremic indicators that reached the predefined threshold: hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate. Dialysis timing was classified as standard (met 0–2 uremic indicators), late (3–5 indicators), and very late (6–7 indicators); no correlation was found between the late or very late group and mortality.

Ying et al. developed an equation using fuzzy mathematics to assess the timing of hemodialysis initiation. Results indicated that a combination of factors — sex, age, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum albumin, hemoglobin, serum phosphorus, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure — resulted in the best accuracy for predicting 3-year survival. Matthew et al. categorized clinically documented primary indications for dialysis initiation into four groups: laboratory evidence of kidney function decline (reference category), uremic symptoms, volume overload or hypertension, and other/unknown. They found that volume overload or hypertension was associated with the highest risk for subsequent mortality.

These studies highlight the importance of comprehensive evaluation of dialysis timing, particularly in patients with volume overload and complications sensitive to volume changes during dialysis, which are mainly varied causes of cardiovascular instabilities. It is well known that the primary functions of peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) are to remove excess…

### A proposed approach to the dialysis prescription in severely hyponatremic patients with end-stage renal disease [^113fRmpy]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with renal failure and severe hyponatremia present a therapeutic dilemma. Conventional hemodialysis is necessary to correct blood chemistries and volume overload, yet it may raise serum sodium (Na) too quickly, potentially resulting in osmotic demyelination syndrome. We present the case of a patient who presented with renal failure requiring dialysis and also with a serum Na of 112 mEq/L. Using a dialysate Na concentration of 130 mEq/L and by limiting the blood flow to 50 mL/minute, we were able to raise her serum Na by only 2 mEq/L per hour during her hemodialysis treatment and thus control both the rate and total change in the patient's serum Na.

### Association between intradialytic central venous oxygen saturation and ultrafiltration volume in chronic hemodialysis patients [^112jtYxA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiac disease accounts for over 40% of mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Although the prevalence of cardiac disease is higher in older hemodialysis (HD) patients, the prevalence among those aged 20–44 years is significantly elevated compared to an age-matched general population. While traditional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia contribute to this condition, dialysis-specific factors such as anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and chronic inflammation are also implicated. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is highly prevalent among ESRD patients. HD treatment-related factors, including hemodynamic stress due to high ultrafiltration rates (UFR), intradialytic cardiac stunning from decreased myocardial perfusion, and episodes of intradialytic hypotension (IDH), may play roles in CHF pathogenesis.

The concurrence of CHF and ESRD makes fluid management particularly challenging. These patients are more volume-sensitive and prone to volume overload, while CHF patients are particularly susceptible to hypotension. Fluid removal is often limited by IDH episodes. A common therapeutic response to IDH is administering saline boluses, and as a result, patients often do not achieve their prescribed fluid status target by the end of treatment. Furthermore, episodes of IDH are not only uncomfortable for patients but are also associated with worse outcomes.

Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO₂) is determined by cardiac output, hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, arterial oxygen saturation (SaO₂), and oxygen extraction.

### Volume overload and adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease: Clinical observational and animal studies [^1174uDhX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

A strength of this study is its combined use of a prospective cohort study and an animal study. However, certain limitations of the study should be acknowledged. As is the case for any observational study, we were unable to establish the causality of the relationship between volume overload and outcomes. Although the results of the animal study supported the hypothesis that salt-induced volume overload could result in renal and cardiovascular damage, it was difficult to untangle the complex relationship between salt and volume. It is unclear whether the relationship involved salt toxicity or adverse effects from fluid retention. Another limitation was the lack of data regarding the dietary salt and fluid intake in CKD patients.

As shown in Table 1, 113 (33.4%) of study participants were receiving diuretic treatment. Twenty-four-hour urinary sodium excretion is a good proxy for salt intake in the steady state, but it can be falsely elevated in patients taking a diuretic. Furthermore, patients on diuretic therapy might have different levels of hydration status during the course of the day, and there is room for misinterpretation of hydration status in such patients.

Finally, the overall CVD event rate was low in the present study, as reflected by a relatively wide CI in the secondary endpoint. Although CKD patients in Western countries frequently die of CVD before developing ESRD, CKD patients in Taiwan are more likely to develop ESRD than to have a cardiovascular event. The limited number of CVD events also limits the ability to adjust for other potentially significant variables.

### Changes in pulmonary restrictive parameters by intensive home hemodialysis: A case report [^111Bc6eM]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) are at an increased risk for restrictive lung disease due to the accumulation of uremic toxins and volume overload. Hemodialysis is the preferred treatment for improving lung function in dialysis patients. However, the effects of fluid removal and solute clearance by hemodialysis on lung function remain unclear.

- **Case presentation**: We report a case of restrictive lung disorder in a hemodialysis patient, who showed improvement in both clinical and spirometric lung function after the initiation of intensive home hemodialysis (32 hours per week).

- **Conclusion**: Intensive hemodialysis augments fluid removal and solute clearance, which in turn may improve restrictive lung function.

### Effects of fluid overload on heart rate variability in chronic kidney disease patients on hemodialysis [^114JMUgN]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are known to have a higher risk of mortality than the healthy population. Cardiovascular events are a major cause of this high mortality, with more than 40% of all patients with ESRD dying of cardiac causes. Fluid overload (FO) is common in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD), and it can lead to hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and cardiac mortality. Even though the genesis of LVH is multifactorial, hypertension and FO are prominent factors of particular relevance for patients on HD. An abnormal hydration state has been related not only to LVH and hypertension but also to dialysis-related hypotension, pulmonary and peripheral edema, heart failure, and other adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, FO has also been highlighted as a key independent predictor of mortality in patients on HD.

Alterations in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are also associated with cardiovascular death, such as autonomic neuropathy in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sympathetic overactivity and parasympathetic blunting have been observed in patients with CKD and ESRD. This sympatho-vagal imbalance contributes to the increased risk of cardiac death in these populations. Heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects the ability of the sinoatrial node to change heart rate in response to sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs, is a valuable tool for assessing heart rate control and also allows quantification of autonomic activity. For instance, the spectral decomposition of HRV signals has been proved to provide valuable insights into autonomic function.

### Living guidance for clinical management of COVID-19 [^1111LvXs]. WHO Living Guidance (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of COVID-19 infection, specifically concerning intravenous fluids, the WHO 2023 guidelines recommend reducing or discontinuing fluid administration if there is no response to fluid loading or if signs of volume overload appear, such as jugular venous distension, crackles on lung auscultation, pulmonary edema on imaging, or hepatomegaly. This step is particularly important in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Be aware that fluid resuscitation may lead to volume overload, including respiratory failure, particularly with ARDS.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: Is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^1151kkHL]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

**Mortality**: Four studies indicated that patients who initiated renal replacement therapy optimally, or at higher estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR), demonstrated better survival outcomes. Martínez et al. observed improved survival rates in patients with an optimal start of dialysis — whether haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis — as opposed to those who began non-optimally. An optimal start was characterized by a planned dialysis initiation, a minimum of 6-month follow-up by a nephrologist, and the first dialysis method aligning with the one registered at 90 days. These findings were consistent even after adjusting for variables such as sex, age, primary renal disease, and dialysis modality [HRCrude = 0.635 (95% CI 0.598–0.674), P < 0.001 versus HRAdj = 0.669 (95% CI 0.628–0.712), P < 0.001]. Furthermore, Matthew et al. discovered that patients beginning dialysis due to volume overload faced a higher mortality risk compared to those starting routine dialysis based on laboratory evidence of kidney function decline. After adjustments for demographic variables, coexisting illnesses, and eGFR, the initiation of dialysis for volume overload or hypertension was associated with a 1.69 (95% CI, 1.02–2.80) times higher risk of subsequent mortality compared to initiation based on laboratory indications of kidney function decline.

### Adherence to hemodialysis and medical regimens among patients with end-stage renal disease during COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study [^114aUS3U]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Adherence of patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) to hemodialysis (HD), prescribed medications, diet, and fluid restrictions is essential to achieving desirable outcomes and preventing complications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ESRD patients became more concerned with attending HD sessions and following protective measures due to the potential for increased susceptibility to COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on patients' adherence to HD and medical regimens.

- **Methods**: Two hundred five ESRD patients on HD were interviewed using the ESRD Adherence Questionnaire (ESRD-AQ) and the Fear-of-COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Clinical and laboratory correlates of adherence were retrieved from patients' records.

- **Results**: Self-reported adherence to HD showed that 19.5% were not adherent during the pandemic compared to 11.7% before the pandemic (p < 0.001), with a significant agreement with the actual attendance of HD sessions (Kappa = 0.733, p < 0.001). Twenty-five patients (12.2%) had a history of COVID-19. The FCV-19S had a mean score of 18.8 and showed significant positive correlations with pre-dialysis phosphorus and potassium. Multivariate analysis indicated that the main predictors of non-adherence were the history of COVID-19, understanding and perception scores, and the Fear-of-COVID score.

- **Conclusions**: The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the adherence of ESRD patients to HD and medical regimens. Strategies to mitigate patients' fears of COVID-19 and improve their understanding and perceptions of adherence are necessary.

### Volume management in continuous renal replacement therapy [^113eN7NN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Volume management is an integral component of the care of critically ill patients to maintain hemodynamic stability and optimize organ function. The dynamic nature of critical illness often necessitates volume resuscitation and contributes to fluid overload, particularly in the presence of altered renal function. Diuretics are commonly used as an initial therapy to increase urine output; however, they have limited effectiveness due to underlying acute kidney injury and other factors contributing to diuretic resistance. Continuous renal replacement techniques (CRRT) are often required for volume management.

In this setting, successful volume management depends on an accurate assessment of fluid status, an adequate comprehension of the principles of fluid management with ultrafiltration, and clear treatment goals. Complications related to excessive ultrafiltration can occur and have serious consequences. Careful monitoring of fluid balance is therefore essential for all patients. This review provides an overview of the appropriate assessment and management of volume status in critically ill patients and its management with CRRT to optimize organ function and prevent complications of fluid overload.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^114RvxAV]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Guideline 4.1 - **Fluid assessment and management in adults**: We recommend assessment of fluid status when prompted by clinical circumstances and on a quarterly basis for stable patients [1C]. We suggest a multidisciplinary approach to fluid assessment, with patient involvement and the adoption of patient-friendly terminology such as "target weight", "fluid gain", and "over-hydration" [2D].

We suggest supplementing clinical assessment of fluid status with a validated objective measurement, such as bioimpedance, at regular intervals when clinical assessment is unclear and following an inter-illness [2C]. We recommend a dialysate temperature not greater than 36°C if standardized [1C]. We recommend avoiding excessive ultrafiltration rates by addressing fluid gains, accepting staged achievement of target weight, or using an augmented schedule as necessary [1B]. We recommend prompt nursing intervention to restore hemodynamic stability in symptomatic or severe intradialytic hypotension, with such interventions leading to clinical review [1C].

- **Rationale**: Fluid control is an essential clinical goal of maintenance haemodialysis, but correct fluid management requires clinicians to steer between the two competing and overlapping problems of fluid overload and intradialytic hypotension. Failure to control fluid overload may lead to obvious short-term effects, including hypertension and breathlessness, and nephrology trainees quickly become familiar with the emergency dialysis admission with pulmonary oedema. In the longer term, chronic fluid overload is one of the main concerns in patient care.

### Dialysis for chronic kidney failure: A review [^116mWRLn]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

More than 3.5 million people worldwide and 540,000 individuals in the US receive maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for the treatment of chronic kidney failure. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 40% after initiation of maintenance dialysis.

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis remove metabolic waste, excess body water, and rebalance electrolytes to sustain life. There is no recommended estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) threshold for initiating dialysis; patient-clinician shared decision-making should help determine when to initiate dialysis. Persistent signs and symptoms of uremia (e.g. nausea, fatigue) and volume overload (e.g. dyspnea, peripheral edema), worsening eGFR, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia inform the timing of therapy initiation. A randomized clinical trial reported no mortality benefit to starting dialysis at higher eGFR (10–14 mL/min/1.73 m²) versus lower eGFR (5–7 mL/min/1.73 m²) levels. Observational data suggested no differences in 5-year mortality with the use of hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis. Cardiovascular (e.g. arrhythmias, cardiac arrest) and infection-related complications of maintenance dialysis are common. In the US, hemodialysis catheter-related bloodstream infections occur at a rate of 1.1 to 5.5 episodes per 1000 catheter-days and affect approximately 50% of patients within 6 months of catheter placement. Peritonitis occurs at a rate of 0.26 episodes per patient-year and affects about 30% of individuals in the first year of peritoneal dialysis therapy.

### Obstructive sleep apnea severity and overnight body fluid shift before and after hemodialysis [^111ziNcW]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with significantly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Fluid overload may promote obstructive sleep apnea in patients with ESRD through an overnight fluid shift from the legs to the neck soft tissues. This study compared body fluid shift and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea before and after hemodialysis in patients with ESRD.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Seventeen patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea undergoing hemodialysis were included. Polysomnographies were performed the night before and after hemodialysis to assess obstructive sleep apnea. Bioimpedance was used to measure fluid overload and leg fluid volume.

- **Results**: The mean overnight rostral fluid shift was 1.27 ± 0.41 L pre-hemodialysis; it correlated positively with fluid overload volume (r = 0.39; P = 0.02) and was significantly lower post-hemodialysis (0.78 ± 0.38 L; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean obstructive apnea-hypopnea index before and after hemodialysis (46.8 ± 22.0 versus 42.1 ± 18.6 per hour; P = 0.21). However, the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index was significantly lower post-hemodialysis (-10.1 ± 10.8 per hour) in the group of 12 patients, with a concomitant reduction in fluid overload compared with participants without change in fluid overload (obstructive apnea-hypopnea index +8.2 ± 16.1 per hour; P < 0.01). A lower fluid overload after hemodialysis was significantly correlated (r = 0.49; P = 0.04) with a lower obstructive apnea-hypopnea index. Fluid overload, as assessed by bioimpedance, was identified as the best predictor.

Adherence of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to hemodialysis (HD), prescribed medications, diet, and fluid restrictions is essential to achieve desirable outcomes and prevent complications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ESRD patients became more concerned with attending HD sessions and following protective measures due to the increased susceptibility to COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pandemic's impact on patients' adherence to HD and medical regimens.

- **Results**: Self-reported adherence to HD showed that 19.5% of patients were not adherent to HD during the pandemic compared to 11.7% before the pandemic (p < 0.001), with significant agreement with actual attendance of HD sessions (Kappa = 0.733, p < 0.001). Twenty-five patients (12.2%) had a history of COVID-19. The FCV-19S had a mean score of 18.8 and showed significant positive correlations with pre-dialysis phosphorus and potassium levels. Multivariate analysis indicated that the main predictors of non-adherence were a history of COVID-19, understanding and perception scores, and the Fear-of-COVID score.

- **Conclusions**: The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the adherence of ESRD patients to HD and medical regimens. Strategies to mitigate patients' fears of COVID-19 and improve their understanding and perception of adherence to HD are necessary.

### Dose of dialysis in acute renal failure [^114uWynQ]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure (ARF) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in supportive care, outcomes in ARF have improved little over the past decades. The primary goals in the management of patients with ARF are to optimize hemodynamic and volume status, minimize further renal injury, correct metabolic abnormalities, and permit adequate nutrition. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is often required to achieve these goals while awaiting renal recovery, but the optimal dose of dialysis in patients with ARF is not known.

Extrapolation of the required dialysis dose from recommendations in chronic dialysis is unlikely to be appropriate because of the lack of a steady state and differences in the distribution volume of urea that are intrinsic to ARF. The prescribed dialysis dose in ARF is often low, and the actual delivered dose is often even less than prescribed. Delivery of dialysis in ARF is often hampered by the patient's hypercatabolic state, hemodynamic instability, and volume status, as well as suboptimal vascular access with temporary venous catheters.

The impact of intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) versus continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on outcomes in ARF is also not clear. Patient disease severity impacts more than dialysis modality on patient outcomes, but when patients are stratified for equal disease severity, CRRT may have potential benefits over IHD in terms of patient survival, fluid and metabolic control, and renal recovery. Strategies associated with improved outcomes that have emerged thus far in ARF include aiming for a time-averaged blood urea nitrogen level.

### Dialysis modality and dosing strategy in acute renal failure [^113Y1mZB]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

Many fundamental aspects of the management of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in acute renal failure (ARF) remain unresolved. While data from multiple studies support the initiation of RRT, in the absence of other indications, when the BUN has reached a level of approximately 90–100 mg/dl, there are conflicting data regarding the benefit of earlier initiation of renal support. The relative efficacy of the various RRT modalities is uncertain. Despite growing utilization, a survival benefit or greater recovery of renal function has not been demonstrated for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as compared to conventional intermittent hemodialysis (IHD).

Optimal dosing strategies are also poorly defined. While there is increasing evidence that more intensive renal support is associated with better outcomes in ARF, an optimal Kt/Vurea and treatment frequency for IHD remain to be established. Similarly, although data suggest that continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) should be dosed at no less than 35 ml/kg/hr (postdilution), confirmation of this dosing strategy and validation for other modalities of CRRT are required.

### Volume management in haemodialysis patients [^111nzBEe]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence supports the important contribution of volume-related metrics to morbidity and mortality in patients receiving chronic haemodialysis. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in the understanding and management of volume status in this high-risk group.

- **Recent findings**: Delivery of optimal volume management involves three key components: accurate estimation of volume status, correction of extracellular fluid overload, and prevention of intradialytic instability. The lack of a gold standard for assessing volume status makes accurate estimation difficult to achieve; clinical examination has insufficient sensitivity and specificity, while tools to assist in the objective measurement of extracellular fluid volume require further validation. Hypervolemia is common in patients on chronic haemodialysis and substantially increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Rapid correction of hypervolemia should be avoided due to the risk of precipitating intradialytic hypotension and hypoperfusion of vital end-organs, including the heart, brain, liver, gut, and kidneys. Evidence-based interventions to aid in normalizing extracellular fluid volume are urgently needed; several targeted strategies are currently being evaluated. Many centres have successfully implemented local protocols and programmes to enhance volume management.

Achieving normal volume status is a fundamental goal of haemodialysis. Novel methods of assessing and restoring extracellular fluid volume while maintaining intradialytic stability are currently under exploration.

### Changes in pulmonary restrictive parameters by intensive home hemodialysis: A case report [^117DJRT1]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) are at an increased risk for restrictive lung disease due to the accumulation of uremic toxins and volume overload. Hemodialysis is the preferred treatment for improving lung function in dialysis patients; however, the effects of fluid removal and solute clearance by hemodialysis on lung function remain unclear.

- **Case presentation**: We report a case of restrictive lung disorder in a hemodialysis patient who showed improvement in both clinical and spirometric lung function after the initiation of intensive home hemodialysis (32 hours per week).

- **Conclusion**: Intensive hemodialysis augments fluid removal and solute clearance, which in turn may improve restrictive lung function.

### Pulmonary artery pressure as a method for assessing hydration status in an anuric hemodialysis patient - a case report [^111xnrQ7]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Setting the dry weight and maintaining fluid balance is still a difficult challenge in dialysis patients. Overhydration is common and associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary hypertension is associated with volume overload in end-stage renal dysfunction patients. Thus, monitoring pulmonary pressure by a CardioMEMS device could potentially guide physicians in assessing fluid overload in hemodialysis patients.

- **Case presentation**: A 61-year-old male with known congestive heart failure deteriorated over three months from a state of congestive heart failure and diuresis to a state of chronic kidney disease and anuria. He began a thrice-weekly in-hospital hemodialysis regimen. As he already had a CardioMEMS device implanted due to his heart condition, we were able to monitor invasive pulmonary artery pressure during dialysis sessions. To compare, we estimated overhydration by both bioimpedance and clinical assessment. Pulmonary artery pressure correlated closely with fluid drainage during dialysis and inter-dialytic weight gain. The patient reached the prescribed dry weight but remained pulmonary hypertensive by definition. During two episodes of intradialytic systemic hypotension, the patient still had pulmonary hypertension.

- **Conclusion**: This case report observes a close correlation between pulmonary artery pressure and fluid overload in a limited amount of observations. In this case, we found pulmonary artery pressure to be more sensitive towards fluid overload than bioimpedance.

### Blood volume-monitored regulation of ultrafiltration to decrease the dry weight in fluid-overloaded hemodialysis patients: a randomized controlled trial [^112NP4cd]. BMC Nephrology (2017). High credibility.

This study originally had a crossover design with three intervention phases, each consisting of twelve hemodialysis sessions. This design allowed all participants to try the three different dialysis techniques. Notably, patients were not required to revert to a fluid-overloaded state after switching treatment modalities. Thus, the crossover design primarily served to explore additional endpoints, such as identifying the method patients preferred for hemodialysis. The primary outcome, most secondary outcome measures, and the sample size calculations were independent of the intervention phases. Due to a high rate of dialysis-related complications, as described in the Results section, the study was terminated after the first intervention phase.

### Fluid overload after coronary artery bypass graft in patients on maintenance hemodialysis is associated with prolonged time on mechanical ventilation [^114gX2nv]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

Fluid overload in patients on dialysis presents a therapeutic challenge as it can lead to several unfavorable outcomes. In this prospective study, we made the novel observation that fluid accumulation was directly associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients in this population. We also observed that the time spent since the CABG until the first hemodialysis session was another independent predictor factor of prolonged ventilation. Whether early dialysis would change this scenario warrants further studies.

Prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) has been associated with fluid overload. In the present study, patients who required more than 48 hours of ventilation had lower eGFR, and most of them were from the dialysis group. The propensity to vascular congestion and alveolar volume overload in patients with end-stage renal disease helps justify these data. Canver et al. showed that patients with renal failure had 12.8 odds to develop respiratory failure. Even in patients with normal renal function, fluid overload is associated with extravasation into the interstitial space and reduction of capillary blood flow, leading to renal ischemia.

A previous prospective study has shown that progressive fluid overload and changes in creatinine correlated with post-cardiac surgery mortality. Indeed, fluid overload was associated with prolonged length in ICU, and it was identified as an earlier and more sensitive prognostic marker than serum creatinine. Heringlake et al. in a post-hoc study enrolling 584 patients, showed that 7.4% of patients developed AKI stage 3 and initiated dialysis 26.5 hours after surgery.

The observed outcomes are a consequence of balancing the risks of advanced uremia versus the inherent dangers related to dialysis therapy itself. Many of these risks are inherent in how dialysis treatment is currently carried out and may be amenable to mitigation through the refinement of clinical practice and potentially modality choice. This article aims to discuss how patient outcomes are the composite result of this balance, focusing on the vulnerability of a particular patient to these attendant risks.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: Is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^117ExVq2]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

In conclusion, most studies proved that GFR at dialysis initiation was not associated with mortality. Timing of dialysis initiation should not be based on GFR. Assessments of volume load and patient's tolerance to volume overload are prospective approaches.

### The impact of continuous renal replacement therapy on drug therapy [^112NsDPx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients with multisystem organ failure often require the daily administration of large volumes of fluid to provide electrolyte and nutrition support, medications, and blood products. This frequently results in fluid overload, which has historically been managed with intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). Unfortunately, IHD entails a high rate of fluid and solute removal that often exacerbates hemodynamic instability. Accordingly, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), involving slow and continuous removal of water and solutes from the plasma, is currently preferred for managing these patients.

### Pulmonary artery pressure as a method for assessing hydration status in an anuric hemodialysis patient - a case report [^111qAiFP]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Setting the dry weight and maintaining fluid balance is still a difficult challenge in dialysis patients. Overhydration is common and associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary hypertension is associated with volume overload in end-stage renal dysfunction patients. Thus, monitoring pulmonary pressure by a CardioMEMS device could potentially be of guidance to physicians in the difficult task of assessing fluid overload in hemodialysis patients.

- **Case presentation**: A 61-year-old male with known congestive heart failure deteriorated over three months from a state with congestive heart failure and diuresis to a state of chronic kidney disease and anuria. He began a thrice-weekly in-hospital hemodialysis regimen. As he already had a CardioMEMS device implanted due to his heart condition, we were able to monitor invasive pulmonary artery pressure during the course of dialysis sessions. To compare, we estimated overhydration by both bioimpedance and clinical assessment. Pulmonary artery pressure correlated closely with fluid drainage during dialysis and interdialytic weight gain. The patient reached the prescribed dry weight but remained pulmonary hypertensive by definition. During two episodes of intradialytic systemic hypotension, the patient still had pulmonary hypertension by definition.

- **Conclusion**: This case report observes a close correlation between pulmonary artery pressure and fluid overload in a limited number of observations. In this case, we found pulmonary artery pressure to be more sensitive towards fluid overload than bioimpedance.

### Volume overload in hemodialysis: Diagnosis, cardiovascular consequences, and management [^115edRsk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

In the same vein, interdialytic volume accumulation during the long interval is associated with the dilatation of the left and right cardiac chambers, pulmonary circulation overload, and diastolic dysfunction in these patients. Cardiac chambers dilatation and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) are closely associated, indicating that the stretching of cardiac chambers between sessions results in long-term cardiac chamber remodeling. The long (3-day) interdialytic interval is associated with more pronounced left and right atrial enlargement and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) increase. The IDWG is the strongest factor driving the increase in RVSP, suggesting that continuous volume accumulation underlies not only left but also right atrium enlargement and pulmonary overload.

In clinical practice, higher IDWG prompts the prescription of higher ultrafiltration volumes, which in turn leads to diastolic dysfunction and myocardial stunning, possibly due to a rapid decrease in the intravascular fluid compartment. The increase in central blood pressure accompanying interdialytic volume accumulation directly increases cardiac afterload and raises myocardial oxygen demand, thereby favoring the occurrence of acute ischemic cardiac events.

Volume overload is considered a major underlying risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular death in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Large studies focusing on IDWG, a proxy of volume overload and the simplest biomarker of fluid overload, consistently exposed the potential deleterious effects of volume expansion on survival and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Timing of dialysis initiation in acute kidney injury and acute-on-chronic renal failure [^1129jrwE]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

The decision to provide dialytic support and choosing the ideal moment to initiate therapy are common impasses for physicians treating patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been extensively used in clinical practice for more than 30 years, there is a paucity of evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal utilization of RRT in AKI. In the absence of traditional or urgent indications, there is no consensus on whether dialysis should be offered and when it should be started. The lack of agreed-upon parameters to guide the decision, the fear of the risk of the procedure, and the possible contribution to worse prognosis with RRT have resulted in a considerable variation in practice among physicians and centers. In this review, we summarize the evidence evaluating time of initiation of RRT and discuss possible approaches for future trials in addressing this issue.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: Evaluation and management [^116nN6CH]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Fluid overload refractory to medical therapy requires the use of extracorporeal therapies such as continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) since critically ill patients often show hemodynamic instability and/or multiple organ dysfunctions. Accurate management of fluid balance becomes obligatory with the ultimate goal of improving pulmonary gas exchange and organ perfusion while maintaining stable hemodynamic parameters. The optimal renal replacement therapy for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluid overload has not been defined yet, and there is still an ongoing debate. The choice of the initial modality needs to be based on the availability of resources, local expertise, the individual needs of the patients, and finally on the patient's hemodynamic status.

In patients with fluid overload, CRRT provides a slower fluid removal compared to intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), resulting in more hemodynamic stability and better fluid balance control. Other advantages of CRRT over IHD include slower control of solute concentration, which avoids large fluctuations and fluid shifts, reducing the risk of cerebral edema. CRRT offers great flexibility in terms of treatment adjustment to the patient's needs at any time. Additionally, CRRT allows the treatment to be performed with relatively simple and user-friendly machines. Some large observational studies have suggested that CRRT is an independent predictor of renal recovery among survivors.

In the absence of definitive data to support the use of a particular type of renal replacement therapy, one should consider CRRT and IHD as complementary therapies.

### Volume overload and adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease: Clinical observational and animal studies [^114amVpR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a public health problem worldwide. CKD substantially increases the risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is associated with considerable healthcare costs. There is convincing evidence that the development of ESRD and CVD could be delayed by a multidisciplinary approach that controls modifiable risk factors. We previously demonstrated that volume overload is common in CKD patients and is associated with anemia, hypertension, proteinuria, arterial stiffness, and inflammation, which are strong predictors of CKD progression and CVD events. Consequently, volume overload shows great promise as a potential modifiable risk factor.

Volume overload has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis and in patients with acute kidney injury. However, the available evidence detailing the effects of volume overload in CKD patients does not use a valid technique for measuring the level of fluid status, and the values obtained cannot be compared directly with the values in the normal population. Few studies have been conducted to evaluate the association of volume overload with adverse outcomes in patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD, and even fewer have been conducted using animal models.

We hypothesized that volume overload might contribute significantly to the development of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD. In the present study, we examined the association between volume overload and renal and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Revised dialysis clinical practice guideline promotes more informed decision-making [^113xPdp6]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Over a decade ago, the Renal Physicians Association and the American Society of Nephrology published the clinical practice guideline, "Shared Decision-Making in the Appropriate Initiation of and Withdrawal from Dialysis", to assist nephrologists, patients, and families in making decisions to initiate and withdraw dialysis. Since then, researchers have extensively studied dialysis decision-making, and there is a substantial body of new evidence regarding:

- **The poor prognosis**: of some elderly stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease patients, many of whom are likely to die before initiation of dialysis, or for whom dialysis may not provide a survival advantage over medical management without dialysis.
- **The prevalence of cognitive impairment**: in dialysis patients and the need to periodically assess them for decision-making capacity.
- **The under-recognition and undertreatment**: of pain and other symptoms in dialysis patients.
- **The underutilization of hospice**: in dialysis patients.
- **Distinctly different treatment goals**: of ESRD patients based on their overall condition and personal preferences.

The Renal Physicians Association developed this second edition of the guideline to provide clinicians, patients, and families with:

1. The most evidence about the benefits and burdens of dialysis for patients with diverse conditions.
2. Recommendations for quality in decision-making about the treatment of patients with acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and ESRD.
3. Practical strategies to help clinicians implement the guideline recommendations.

### Lung-kidney interactions in critically ill patients: Consensus report of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) 21 Workgroup [^116frfnz]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The effects of extracorporeal devices on lung function in critically ill patients have been a topic of significant inquiry.

- **Consensus statements**: RRT applied for diuretic-resistant fluid overload may improve pulmonary function. There is little evidence that RRT, using various methods, directly leads to lung injury. The pathophysiological mechanisms of the potential association between RRT and lung function comprise hemodynamic, inflammatory, electrolyte-mediated, and acid-base effects.

- **Rationale**: RRT is usually initiated to compensate for complications of AKI, including fluid overload in patients with diuretic resistance, which is repeatedly described as a major risk factor for adverse outcomes. Early correction of fluid accumulation may be important to reduce further damage to the injured lung. However, earlier initiation of RRT in patients with severe AKI and ARDS has not been shown to improve outcomes.

Data on the direct effects of RRT on the lung are sparse and are mostly derived from patients with ESRD receiving IHD. Alternating episodes of volume depletion and overload, as well as leukocyte activation resulting from IHD, have been identified as triggers for the deterioration of lung function. Few studies have compared the impact of different RRT modalities on respiratory function in AKI patients, finding no significant difference between modalities, such as peritoneal dialysis versus IHD and IHD versus SLED.

Rapid correction of acid-base balance during intermittent hemodialysis may also impact the lungs and should be avoided when commencing RRT. When RRT is delivered to COPD patients with metabolic compensation, it may cause eventual complications in their respiratory function.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: Is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^114ETzW2]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Currently, clinical practice guidelines recommend that the decision to initiate maintenance dialysis primarily depends on clinical signs and symptoms attributed to uremic syndrome. The Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD Work Group suggests that the decision usually occurs within the GFR range between 5 and 10 ml/min/1.73 m². Additionally, the Canadian Society of Nephrology suggests that in the absence of these factors, the eGFR should only serve as a sole criterion for the initiation of dialysis if it is 6 mL/min/1.73 m² or less. The Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy proposes that patients endure under conservative treatment until the GFR < 8 mL/min/1.73 m², even if symptoms of renal failure are observed. Hemodialysis is recommended to be initiated prior to a GFR of 2 mL/min/1.73 m².

Our present systematic review included 13 studies from the last 5 years that investigated optimal dialysis initiation in ESKD patients. Nine of the 13 studies mainly focused on the optimal GFR for maintenance dialysis initiation. Seven studies used eGFR, one study used mGFR, and one study used both. Compared to previous studies, a wider range of GFR values and more detailed data stratification were applied in the study design and data processing stages. Seven studies considered a GFR ≤ 5 mL/min/1.73 m² or even lower; the lowest data range was an mGFR < 4.3 mL/min/1.73 m², and the highest range was an eGFR of 15–16 mL/min/1.73 m². Five studies showed no association between GFR and mortality or other adverse outcomes, and two studies showed dialysis initiation at…

### Kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis is a heterogeneous syndrome: we should treat it like one [^111d616v]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Advanced kidney failure requiring dialysis, commonly labeled end-stage kidney disease or chronic kidney disease stage 5D, is a heterogeneous syndrome. This is a key reason that may explain why treating advanced kidney dysfunction is challenging and many clinical trials involving patients on dialysis have failed thus far. Treatment with dialytic techniques, of which maintenance thrice-weekly hemodialysis is most commonly used, is broadly named kidney 'replacement' therapy. This term casts the perception of a priori abandonment of intrinsic kidney function and subsumes patients into a single, homogeneous group.

Patients with advanced kidney failure necessitating dialytic therapy may have ongoing endogenous kidney function and differ in their clinical manifestations and needs. Different terminology, for example, kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis (KDRD) with stages of progressive severity, could better capture the range of phenotypes of patients who require kidney 'assistance' therapy.

Classifying patients with KDRD based on objective, quantitative levels of endogenous kidney function, as well as patient-reported symptoms and quality of life, would facilitate hemodialysis prescriptions tailored to level of kidney dysfunction, clinical needs, and personal priorities. Such classification would encourage clinicians to move toward a personalized, physiological, and adaptive approach to hemodialysis therapy.

### Renal failure in the ICU: Comparison of the impact of acute renal failure and end-stage renal disease on ICU outcomes [^111Qzpam]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure (ARF) is associated with a persistently high mortality rate in critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Most studies at the time of writing have focused on patients with established, intrinsic ARF or relatively severe ARF due to multiple factors. None have examined outcomes of dialysis-dependent chronic renal failure [end-stage renal disease (ESRD)] patients in the ICU. We examined the incidence and outcomes of ARF in the ICU using a standard definition and compared these to outcomes of ICU patients with either ESRD or no renal failure. We sought to determine the impact of renal dysfunction and/or loss of organ function on outcomes.

- **Methods**: We prospectively scored 1530 admissions to eight ICUs over a 10-month period for illness severity at ICU admission using the Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE III) evaluation tool. Patients were defined as having ARF based on the definition of Hou et al. (Am J Med 74:243–248,1983), which is designed to detect significant measurable declines in renal function based on serum creatinine. ESRD patients were identified as being chronically dialysis-dependent prior to ICU admission, and the remainder had no renal failure. Clinical characteristics at ICU admission and ICU and hospital outcomes were compared between the three groups.

- **Results**: We identified 254 cases of ARF, 57 cases of ESRD, and 1219 cases of no renal failure, for an incidence of ARF of 17%. Roughly half the ARF patients had ARF at ICU admission, and the remainder developed ARF during their ICU stay. Only 11% of ARF patients required dialysis.

### Unfavorable effects of history of volume overload and late referral to a nephrologist on mortality in patients initiating dialysis: A multicenter prospective cohort study in Japan [^111f5Q3Z]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

We defined late referral as referral to a nephrologist less than 3 months between the first nephrology evaluation and dialysis initiation. A period of 3 months before the initiation of dialysis is the most widely accepted threshold for distinguishing early referral from late referral, as it is generally considered the minimum essential time required to prepare for renal replacement therapy (RRT), such as the creation of an arteriovenous fistula.

The clinical history of volume overload was evaluated by investigators at each dialysis institution. It was defined according to objective clinical findings obtained at least once during the period from chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), such as pulmonary congestion or pleural fluid seen on plain chest radiography and physical findings of lower extremity edema. Any incidence of volume overload occurring for the first time during the phase of dialysis induction was excluded from the definition of the history of volume overload. This history was also distinguished from heart failure symptoms at the start of maintenance dialysis or a past history of hospitalization for heart failure.

The following findings were considered heart failure symptoms: (1) dyspnea or orthopnea with hypoxemia and (2) weight gain or jugular venous distension. Coronary heart disease was defined as an angiographically confirmed occlusion or stenosis of one or more coronary arteries, causing myocardial infarction or angina pectoris. Peripheral artery disease was defined as a disease requiring admission for revascularization or amputation surgery.

### Volume overload in hemodialysis: Diagnosis, cardiovascular consequences, and management [^114wVWNG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Volume overload in hemodialysis (HD) patients is associated with hypertension and cardiac dysfunction and is a major risk factor for both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in this population. The diagnosis of volume excess and estimation of dry weight is primarily based on clinical criteria and is known for its poor diagnostic accuracy. The pursuit of accurate and objective methods to evaluate dry weight and diagnose subclinical volume overload has been intensive over the last three decades. Most methods have not been tested in appropriate clinical trials, leaving their usefulness in clinical practice uncertain, with the exception of bioimpedance spectroscopy and lung ultrasound (US).

Bioimpedance spectroscopy is possibly the most widely used method to subjectively quantify fluid distributions over body compartments, producing reliable and reproducible results. Lung US provides reliable estimates of extravascular water in the lung, a critical parameter of the central circulation that largely reflects the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

To maximize cardiovascular tolerance, fluid removal in volume-expanded HD patients should be gradual and distributed over a sufficiently long time window. This review summarizes knowledge about the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of volume overload in HD patients.

### Cardiovascular risk and mortality in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis: Sleep study, pulmonary function, respiratory mechanics, upper airway collapsibility, autonomic nervous activity, depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life: A prospective, double blind, randomized controlled clinical trial [^114S9u4M]. BMC Nephrology (2013). High credibility.

The present study involving patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was designed with four main objectives: (1) to assess the effects of dialysis on sleep parameters and determine the prevalence and severity of sleep disorders; (2) to determine the behavior of sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activity through an analysis of heart rate variability; (3) to detect upper airway collapsibility as a risk indicator for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); and (4) to evaluate levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life.

Our hypothesis is that the weight gain due to volume overload observed during the interdialytic period will influence the degree of collapsibility of the upper airway due to narrowing, predisposing to upper airway occlusion during sleep. We aim to investigate the effects of nocturnal hemodialysis compared to daytime hemodialysis and their influences on the physiological variables of sleep, autonomic nervous system (ANS), and respiratory mechanics, thereby potentially compromising the quality of life in CKD and end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis.
