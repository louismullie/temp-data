## Question

What conditions can lead to hyperprolactinemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what conditions can lead to hyperprolactinemia, but here is a concise synthesis of conditions leading to hyperprolactinemia, followed by a pragmatic diagnostic framework and key management cues informed by endocrine guidelines.

> Hyperprolactinemia is the presence of abnormally elevated circulating prolactin, a pituitary hormone secreted by lactotrophs under tonic hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition; elevations arise when physiological stimuli, medications, systemic or pituitary disease, or assay artifacts disrupt this axis.

> Physiological elevations are adaptive and typically transient, most prominently during pregnancy and lactation due to estrogen-driven pituitary lactotroph hyperplasia and increased PRL secretion; smaller rises can follow nipple stimulation, sleep, exercise, meals, pain, coitus, and acute stress, and these should be recognized to avoid overdiagnosis [^111jMnfU] [^112KJDec] [^113swhNa] [^116UCq8y].

> Drug-induced hyperprolactinemia is common and often dose related via D2 antagonism or reduced dopamine tone; prototypical culprits include antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine, and asenapine, as well as metoclopramide, some antidepressants, estrogen-containing therapies, and other dopamine-modulating or gastrointestinal agents; FDA labeling documents substantial PRL elevations with risperidone and frequent, though generally milder, changes with olanzapine and asenapine [^1164onmx] [^114NHAbZ] [^114K4VQp] [^117CXxzL] [^116UCq8y].

> Pathological causes span sellar disease and systemic endocrinopathies; prolactinomas are the most frequent functioning pituitary adenomas and typically show prolactin levels that parallel tumor size, while nonfunctioning adenomas and other parasellar masses may cause "stalk effect" hyperprolactinemia of lesser magnitude; primary hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, and chronic liver disease are established systemic contributors, and MEN1 can underlie pituitary pathology, all of which warrant targeted evaluation in the appropriate clinical context [^114MfskW] [^114d4tBq] [^1127ucW8] [^116UCq8y].

> Artifactual and assay-related issues can mimic or obscure true disease; macroprolactinemia due to high–molecular weight, largely bioinactive PRL can account for a meaningful fraction of laboratory hyperprolactinemia, the high-dose hook effect can yield falsely low PRL in the setting of very large adenomas, and inter-platform assay discrepancies can lead to overestimation and unnecessary interventions; proactively addressing these pitfalls is essential before committing to imaging or long-term therapy [^114LdS4i] [^116wjimn] [^113KpDLA] [^112XxaWG] [^112gmSwi].

> A practical diagnostic sequence emphasizes ruling out pregnancy, obtaining a single, stress-minimized serum prolactin to confirm elevation, reviewing medications, and screening thyroid and renal function; unexplained or discordant cases merit pituitary MRI, with attention to the hook effect via serial dilution in the presence of a large mass, and macroprolactin measurement is reasonable in asymptomatic elevations to avoid overdiagnosis [^112bYoxA] [^116X6ZFv] [^114MfskW] [^113KpDLA] [^112jNhUb] [^112LEBCA].

> For drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, guideline-concordant care prioritizes discontinuation or substitution of the offending agent when feasible and coordinated with the prescribing clinician; in symptomatic patients when withdrawal is not possible or onset does not align with treatment, MRI helps differentiate drug effect from a pituitary lesion, and routine treatment is generally avoided in asymptomatic drug-induced cases [^112eooRx] [^1162Wddx] [^112MSUJk] [^1178pcVQ] [^111zxWwc].

> When a prolactinoma is confirmed and the patient is symptomatic, dopamine agonists are first-line to normalize prolactin, restore gonadal function, and reduce tumor size, with cabergoline preferred for efficacy; resistant cases warrant dose optimization before surgical referral, and selected pregnancy scenarios have separate monitoring and therapeutic considerations addressed in endocrine guidelines [^1119DMso] [^112DarXC] [^112M1oKV] [^112pb9Wo] [^115FCvTu].

> Magnitude of prolactin elevation can refine differential diagnosis, as very high levels often indicate macroprolactinomas or pregnancy or lactation, whereas modest elevations are more consistent with microadenomas, stalk effect, hypothyroidism, or medication effects; nonetheless, assay pitfalls must be excluded before anchoring on severity thresholds [^113swhNa] [^114d4tBq] [^113KpDLA].

> In men with suggestive hypogonadal features, measure prolactin and consider pituitary MRI when secondary hypogonadism coexists with elevated prolactin or mass-effect symptoms; this aligns with urologic guidance and helps avoid delayed recognition of pituitary disease [^112rBVkd] [^113gxwWX].

Hyperprolactinemia has diverse causes, including **physiological states** (pregnancy, lactation, stress, sleep, exercise) [^114MfskW], **pituitary tumors** (prolactinomas, stalk effect) [^111jMnfU], and **medications** (antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiemetics, estrogens, opioids). Other causes include **hypothyroidism** [^114MfskW], chronic kidney or liver disease [^116D5XeR], chest wall injury [^116D5XeR], seizures [^111VHj5B], and macroprolactin [^114LdS4i]. Evaluation should confirm **true hyperprolactinemia** [^116X6ZFv], exclude physiological and drug causes [^114MfskW], and use MRI when indicated [^1178pcVQ].

---

## Physiological causes

Physiological states can transiently raise prolactin and are **not pathological**:

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Prolactin rises to support breast development and milk production [^112KJDec].
- **Stress**: Physical or emotional stress increases prolactin via hypothalamic pathways [^111Zyoaj].
- **Sleep**: Prolactin rises during sleep, especially REM.
- **Exercise**: Intense exercise can transiently elevate prolactin [^116UCq8y].
- **Nipple stimulation**: Breastfeeding or stimulation increases prolactin [^112bYoxA].

---

## Pathological causes

### Pituitary tumors and lesions

Pituitary tumors are a major cause, including **prolactinomas** [^114d4tBq], the most common pituitary adenomas causing marked hyperprolactinemia [^114MfskW], and **non-prolactin-secreting tumors**, which raise prolactin via stalk compression that reduces dopamine inhibition (stalk effect) [^116UCq8y].

---

### Hypothalamic disorders

Hypothalamic disease disrupts dopamine inhibition and includes **hypothalamic tumors** (craniopharyngiomas, germinomas, gliomas) and **infiltrative diseases** (sarcoidosis, histiocytosis, tuberculosis) [^116UCq8y].

---

### Systemic diseases

Systemic diseases can **elevate prolactin** by altering regulation, clearance, or metabolism [^114MfskW]. Mechanisms include hypothyroidism with TRH-driven prolactin stimulation [^114MfskW], chronic kidney disease with reduced clearance and increased production [^116D5XeR], and chronic liver disease with impaired metabolism [^116UCq8y].

---

## Medication-induced hyperprolactinemia

Medications are a **common cause**:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Antipsychotics | Risperidone, haloperidol, olanzapine | Dopamine D2 blockade [^111Szje8] |
| Antidepressants | SSRIs, TCAs | Serotonin-mediated prolactin release [^117CXxzL] |
| Antiemetics | Metoclopramide, domperidone | Dopamine antagonism [^117CXxzL] |
| Estrogens | Oral contraceptives | Pituitary lactotroph stimulation [^116D5XeR] |
| Opioids | Morphine, methadone | Dopamine inhibition [^117CXxzL] |

---

## Other causes

- **Chest wall injury**: Trauma, surgery, or herpes zoster can increase prolactin via neural pathways [^116D5XeR].
- **Seizures**: Generalized seizures transiently elevate prolactin [^111VHj5B].
- **Macroprolactin**: Biologically inactive prolactin isoforms can cause assay interference and apparent hyperprolactinemia [^114LdS4i] [^116wjimn].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured, stepwise approach** is essential:

- **Confirm hyperprolactinemia**: Repeat prolactin measurement, avoid stress, and exclude macroprolactin [^112jNhUb].
- **Exclude physiological causes**: Pregnancy test, review recent stress, sleep, exercise, and nipple stimulation [^116UCq8y].
- **Review medications**: Identify and, if feasible, discontinue or substitute prolactin-elevating drugs [^112eooRx] [^1162Wddx].
- **Evaluate systemic diseases**: Thyroid, renal, and liver function tests [^114MfskW].
- **Imaging**: Pituitary MRI if prolactin remains elevated after exclusions or if a pituitary lesion is suspected [^113gxwWX] [^1178pcVQ].

---

Hyperprolactinemia arises from physiological states, pituitary or hypothalamic disease, systemic illness, medications, and other factors [^114MfskW]; a **stepwise evaluation distinguishes true hyperprolactinemia** from transient or assay-related elevations and guides targeted management [^114LdS4i].

### Olanzapine [^111Szje8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hyperprolactinemia**: As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, olanzapine elevates prolactin levels, and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer.

In placebo-controlled olanzapine clinical studies (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 30% of adults treated with olanzapine as compared to 10.5% of adults treated with placebo. In a pooled analysis from clinical studies including 8,136 adults treated with olanzapine, significant changes in prolactin levels were noted.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114MfskW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hyperprolactinemia, specifically in relation to differential diagnosis, the Endocrine Society 2011 guidelines recommend excluding the following causes in patients with symptomatic non-physiological hyperprolactinemia:

- **Medication use**: This can potentially elevate prolactin levels.
- **Renal failure**: Impaired kidney function might contribute to elevated prolactin.
- **Hypothyroidism**: Thyroid hormone deficiencies can affect prolactin levels.
- **Parasellar tumors**: Tumors in the sellar region could be responsible for increased prolactin production.

These recommendations are vital for accurate diagnosis and effective management of hyperprolactinemia.

### Kisspeptin overcomes GnRH neuronal suppression secondary to hyperprolactinemia in humans [^111jMnfU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Pregnancy and lactation are the most common physiological causes of hyperprolactinemia. Pathophysiological causes include pituitary stalk compression, drug side effects, and pituitary adenomas, with adenomas being particularly important to detect. Prolactinomas can lead to mechanical compression of local structures such as the optic nerves, resulting in visual field disturbances and, in more severe cases, loss of vision. Therefore, the consequences of untreated prolactinomas can be severe.

Although excellent medical therapy (dopamine agonists; DAs) is available for patients with hyperprolactinemia, resistance to these drugs is becoming increasingly recognized. Resistance may occur in the setting of a macroprolactinoma, cavernous sinus invasion, certain gene mutations, and male sex, with bromocriptine DA treatment, and less commonly with cabergoline treatment. Although DAs are usually well tolerated, an important safety consideration related to their use is pathological impulse control disorder, which can include gambling, compulsive shopping, hypersexuality, binge eating, or repetitive activities. Given the potentially serious consequences and the paucity of other treatment options, there is a medical need to find alternative therapies for patients with hyperprolactinemia.

Hyperprolactinemia inhibits the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which, in turn, inhibits the release of both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary. The hyperprolactinemia-induced reductions of both the frequency and amplitude of LH pulses re-

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112LEBCA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The evaluation for hypersecretion should include an assessment for prolactin, GH, and ACTH hypersecretion. Evidence is strongest for the need to measure a serum prolactin level in all patients presenting with an incidentaloma. Ideally, for patients with large macroincidentalomas, the laboratory should measure prolactin levels in diluted serum to ensure that levels are not falsely lowered by a hook effect in the assay. Hyperprolactinemia was found in five of 42 patients with microincidentalomas at initial evaluation, but in other studies none of 22 developed a prolactin elevation on prospective follow-up. In other studies, prolactinomas were detected in seven of 46 patients with incidentalomas (micro and macro combined). In macroincidentalomas, prolactin levels were elevated in two of 16.

In a large autopsy study, 39.5% of the adenomas detected (most microadenomas) were found to stain positive for prolactin. These data might suggest that prolactinomas are very common among pituitary incidentalomas, which is contrary to the literature. Autopsy data should cautiously be considered representative of incidentalomas presenting in life because the autopsy studies lack clinical data, and prolactin staining may not have been associated with clinically relevant circulating hyperprolactinemia. Patients with hyperprolactinemia could receive a trial of dopamine agonist therapy so long as it is recognized that mild/moderate elevations may be due to stalk compression from a lesion other than a prolactinoma. In these patients, tumor shrinkage is unlikely, and growth of the incidentaloma is…

### Risperdal [^1164onmx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Risperdal has been shown to elevate prolactin levels in children, adolescents, and adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of up to 8 weeks duration in children and adolescents (aged 5 to 17 years) with autistic disorder or psychiatric disorders other than autistic disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar mania, 49% of patients who received Risperdal had elevated prolactin levels compared to 2% of patients who received placebo. Similarly, in placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents (aged 10 to 17 years) with bipolar disorder, or adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia, 82–87% of patients who received Risperdal had elevated levels of prolactin compared to 3–7% of patients on placebo. Increases were dose-dependent and generally greater in females than in males across indications.

In clinical trials involving 1885 children and adolescents, galactorrhea was reported in 0.8% of Risperdal-treated patients, and gynecomastia was reported in 2.3% of Risperdal-treated patients.

The long-term effects of Risperdal on growth and sexual maturation have not been fully evaluated in children and adolescents.

### Is a stable or decreasing prolactin level in a patient with prolactinoma a surrogate marker for lack of tumor growth [^112N5pvQ]. Pituitary (2014). Low credibility.

The optimal interval for follow-up imaging of patients with prolactinomas is unclear. We aim to determine the likelihood of tumor enlargement in patients with prolactinomas who have a stable or reduced prolactin (PRL) level over time, whether or not they are treated with a dopamine agonist (DA).

We identified 80 patients with prolactinomas (34 men, 46 women) who had at least two paired sets of serum PRL levels and pituitary MRIs, three or more months apart. Patients with hyperprolactinemia due to drug or stalk effects were excluded. The median age was 45 years, ranging from 25 to 77. Sixty-three patients (78.8%) were treated with DA. Initial and latest PRL levels (ng/mL) were 114 (0.3–15,732) and 16 (0.3–1,204), respectively.

In patients with identifiable tumors, the maximum tumor diameters (mm) at the initial and latest MRI studies were 12.5 (2–60) and 12.5 (2–39), respectively, with an interval of 2.9 years (0.3–9.7). Sixty percent of patients (n = 48) had a macroadenoma. Forty-two (52.5%) patients had either disappearance of the tumor (n = 22) or reduction (n = 20) in tumor size. In the remainder, tumor size was stable in 35 patients but increased in 3. One of these patients, observed off therapy, had a concomitant rise in PRL level. The other two had evidence of pituitary hemorrhage with no PRL increase.

Tumor growth in prolactinoma patients with a stable or decreasing PRL level, regardless of size, is a rare event. Repetitive pituitary imaging in these patients may not be warranted.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115FCvTu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The 2011 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend, for pregnant patients with hyperprolactinemia, obtaining a formal visual field assessment followed by an MRI without gadolinium in cases where a prolactinoma is causing severe headaches and/or visual field changes.

### Technology insight: Measuring prolactin in clinical samples [^114LdS4i]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

The measurement of prolactin is one of the most commonly undertaken hormonal investigations when evaluating patients with reproductive disorders. Hyperprolactinemia is found in up to 17% of such cases. The diagnostic evaluation of hyperprolactinemia is challenging but can be facilitated by a logical approach. This involves obtaining a thorough patient history, excluding secondary causes of hyperprolactinemia, and understanding the limitations of prolactin assays. Once hyperprolactinemia has been confirmed, efforts to establish the underlying cause can begin.

Due to workloads, laboratories rely on automated platforms to measure prolactin, most of which employ two-site immunoassay sandwich methods. Although generally robust and reliable, such immunoassays can be susceptible to interference, and good collaboration between clinicians and the laboratory helps to minimize problems.

A major challenge facing laboratories is the correct differentiation of patients with true hyperprolactinemia from those with macroprolactinemia. Macroprolactin is a high-molecular-mass, biologically inactive form of prolactin that all prolactin immunoassays detect to varying degrees. Conservative estimates suggest that the presence of macroprolactin leads to misdiagnosis in as many as 10% of all reported instances of biochemical hyperprolactinemia. In the absence of specific testing, macroprolactin represents a diagnostic pitfall that results in the misdiagnosis and mismanagement of large numbers of patients.

### Should macroprolactin be measured in all hyperprolactinaemic sera [^116wjimn]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Macroprolactin is a non-bioactive prolactin isoform, usually composed of a monomer of prolactin and an IgG molecule. This combination results in a prolonged clearance rate similar to that of immunoglobulins. Macroprolactinaemia, a form of hyperprolactinaemia entirely accounted for by the presence of macroprolactin, is estimated to account for approximately 10% of all hyperprolactinaemia cases coming to clinical attention in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Failure to recognize that macroprolactinaemia can explain hyperprolactinaemia leads to unnecessary investigation, incorrect diagnosis, and inappropriate treatment. Screening hyperprolactinaemic sera for the presence of misleading concentrations of macroprolactin is readily performed in biochemistry laboratories, although the procedures have not been automated.

The most widely employed method is treating the hyperprolactinaemic sera with polyethylene glycol, which precipitates out high-molecular-weight constituents, including immunoglobulins. Re-assaying the sera for prolactin will identify those sera yielding values within the normal range, indicative of macroprolactinaemia rather than true hyperprolactinaemia.

The case for routine screening of all hyperprolactinaemic sera for macroprolactin is compelling. The consequences of failing to recognize macroprolactinaemia are significant. The problem is frequently encountered, the means of addressing it are immediately available, and it is cost-effective.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^112rBVkd]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, specifically with respect to prolactin levels, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend measuring prolactin levels in patients with low sexual desire (or other suggestive signs/symptoms) and low or low-normal testosterone.

### High-dose olanzapine and prolactin levels [^1169SqsX]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

This study evaluates whether high-dose olanzapine is associated with the elevation of serum prolactin levels.

- **Method**: Twenty-four patients taking daily doses of olanzapine of 20, 25, 30, and 40 mg for DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder had serum prolactin levels measured. The patients were all from one author's (J.L.K.'s) clinical practice. The mean duration of olanzapine therapy was 15.3 months at a dose of at least 20 mg/day. Data were gathered in 2000 and 2001.

- **Results**: There was no significant correlation between olanzapine dose and prolactin level (Pearson product moment correlation coefficient = 0.09). No significant differences were found between mean prolactin values in each dose group.

- **Conclusion**: There was no significant elevation of prolactin with higher doses of olanzapine. Thus, preliminary evidence suggests that using higher doses of olanzapine is generally safe with regard to prolactin levels.

### The evolution of hyperprolactinaemia as an entity in psychiatric patients [^113ifGEV]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

This paper explores chronologically the evolution of raised prolactin levels as an entity in psychiatric patients. Menstrual problems were described in patients with schizophrenia prior to the introduction of antipsychotic medication, yet galactorrhea and gynecomastia were not commonly observed until the advent of antipsychotics. Following the introduction of antipsychotic medication, individual case reports of patients with galactorrhea and gynecomastia appeared. These initial reports were followed by a collection of case studies, culminating in today's data of laboratory-defined rates of prolactin and sexual side effects. The paper also reviews emerging research linking hyperprolactinemia with an increased risk of osteoporosis and possibly breast cancer. An overarching theme throughout these publications is the paucity of clinical research, a gap that has only recently begun to be addressed.

### Serum prolactin overestimation and risk of misdiagnosis [^113swhNa]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The magnitude of prolactin elevation guides the differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinaemia and typically parallels tumour diameter in prolactinomas. Severe hyperprolactinaemia (greater than 10-fold normal) is almost always due to macroprolactinomas (diameter greater than 1 cm), pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Causes of mild hyperprolactinaemia (less than 4-fold normal) include microprolactinomas (diameter less than 1 cm), dopamine interference (e.g. stalk compression/transection in the "stalk effect", antipsychotics, metoclopramide), primary hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and prolactin co-secretion in acromegaly or Cushing's disease. Mild, transient increases in prolactin may follow stress, pain, coitus, exercise, sleep, meals, or seizures.

### Serum prolactin overestimation and risk of misdiagnosis [^112XxaWG]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Falsely elevated prolactin measurements risk overdiagnosis and unnecessary imaging and treatment. We conducted a clinical audit of 18 patients who presented with hyperprolactinaemia, followed by a laboratory audit of 40 split samples across a range of serum prolactin (5‐5051 mIU/L). In each case (total n = 58), serum prolactin was measured on both Roche and Siemens platforms.

Serum prolactin as measured by Roche was higher than the corresponding Siemens value in every case, despite similar reference ranges. The mean discrepancy in serum prolactin by Roche vs. Siemens was +81% in the clinical audit and +50% in the laboratory audit. This led to unnecessary interventions in 7 out of 18 patients (39%) in the clinical audit.

Serum prolactin is overestimated on the Roche platform relative to the Siemens platform. Laboratories should review Roche reference intervals for serum prolactin, and clinicians should consider repeating serum prolactin on another platform if the serum prolactin is incongruent with the clinical scenario.

### New insights in prolactin: Pathological implications [^111tZecA]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Prolactin is a hormone mainly secreted by lactotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland, and it is involved in many biological processes, including lactation and reproduction. Animal models have provided insights into the biology of prolactin proteins, offering compelling evidence that the different prolactin isoforms each have independent biological functions. The major isoform, 23 kDa prolactin, acts via its membrane receptor, the prolactin receptor (PRL-R), which is a member of the haematopoietic cytokine superfamily, and the mechanism of its activation has been deciphered. The 16 kDa prolactin isoform is a cleavage product derived from native prolactin, and it has received particular attention due to its newly described inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and tumorigenesis.

The discovery of multiple extrapituitary sites of prolactin secretion expands the range of known functions of this hormone. This review summarizes knowledge of the biology of prolactin and its receptor, as well as its physiological and pathological roles. We focus on the role of prolactin in human pathophysiology, particularly the discovery of the mechanism underlying infertility associated with hyperprolactinaemia, and the identification of the first mutation in the human PRLR.

### Clinical and diagnostic characteristics of hyperprolactinemia in childhood and adolescence [^116dchXd]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Pituitary adenoma is the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia, a rare endocrine disorder encountered in pediatric patient care. Epidemiological and clinical information about hyperprolactinemia in childhood and adolescence is limited. Clinical signs of hyperprolactinemia are very heterogeneous. In girls, disturbances in menstrual function and galactorrhea may be seen, whereas in boys, headache, visual disturbances, delayed pubertal development, and hypogonadism are often present.

Owing to the ease of ordering a serum prolactin measurement, an evidence-based, cost-effective approach to the management of this endocrine disorder is required. Before a diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is made, drug use, renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and parasellar tumors should be excluded. The main objectives of treatment are normalization of prolactin level, adenoma shrinkage, and recovery from clinical signs related to hyperprolactinemia.

- **Treatment approaches**: In patients with microadenoma, invasive or non-invasive macroadenoma, and even in patients with visual field defects, dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment. Surgical treatment is indicated in patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to medical treatment or who have persistent neurological signs. Radiotherapy should be considered as a supportive treatment for patients in whom surgery fails or medical response is not achieved.

### Metabolic functions of prolactin: Physiological and pathological aspects [^112Z7JzD]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2020). Low credibility.

Prolactin is named after its vital role of promoting milk production during lactation, although it has been implicated in multiple functions within the body, including metabolism and energy homeostasis. Prolactin has been hypothesized to play a key role in driving many of the adaptations of the maternal body to allow the mother to meet the physiological demands of both pregnancy and lactation, including the high energetic demands of the growing fetus followed by milk production to support the offspring after birth.

Prolactin receptors are found in many tissues involved in metabolism and food intake, such as the pancreas, liver, hypothalamus, small intestine, and adipose tissue. This review examines the effects of prolactin in these various tissues and how they relate to changes in function in physiological states of high prolactin, such as pregnancy and lactation, and in pathological states of hyperprolactinemia in the adult. In many cases, whether prolactin promotes healthy metabolism or leads to dysregulation of metabolic functions is highly dependent on the situation. Overall, although prolactin may not play a major role in regulating metabolism and body weight outside of pregnancy and lactation, it definitely has the ability to contribute to metabolic function.

### Incidence and clinical significance of elevated macroprolactin levels in patients with hyperprolactinemia [^117Rn3mi]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with macroprolactinemia in an endocrinology practice at a tertiary care military medical center in the United States, we reviewed the medical records of 40 patients who had been referred for evaluation of hyperprolactinemia between June 2003 and August 2004 in whom macroprolactin had been measured.

Of the 40 patients, 18 (9 men and 9 women) (45%) had an elevated macroprolactin level, with a mean of 75% of the total prolactin. The demographic characteristics of these patients were similar to those of patients with elevated monomeric prolactin. Most of the men with macroprolactinemia (78%) had erectile dysfunction as the presenting complaint, whereas the most frequent symptom in women was menstrual irregularities (56%). Fifty percent of patients had no identifiable cause for their presenting complaint other than macroprolactinemia.

Of the 18 patients with macroprolactinemia, 16 underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary, of whom 56% had normal findings. Of the patients with abnormal MRI findings, 57% had a microadenoma, and 43% had either an atrophic anterior lobe or a prominent hypophysis. No significant relationship was detected between MRI findings or symptoms and the presence of elevated macroprolactin levels. Approximately 40% of patients in the macroprolactin group were treated with a dopamine agonist, 28% of whom had normalization of the total prolactin level.

Although macroprolactin is commonly found in patients with hyperprolactinemia, neither significant clinical correlation with symptoms nor MRI findings were evident.

- **Hyperprolactinemia**: Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, Secuado can elevate prolactin levels, and this elevation can persist during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion, which in turn may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia, when associated with hypogonadism, may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.

In the Secuado placebo-controlled trial, galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence were not reported for patients treated with Secuado or placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In sublingual asenapine adult pre-marketing clinical trials, the incidences of adverse events related to abnormal prolactin levels were 0.4% versus 0% for placebo.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Published epidemiological studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer.

- **Seizures**: In the Secuado placebo-controlled trial, there were no reports of seizures in adult patients treated with doses of 3.8 mg/24 hours and 7.6 mg/24 hours.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112RNDFn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia.

- **Participants**: The Task Force consisted of Endocrine Society-appointed experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

- **Evidence**: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

- **Consensus process**: One group meeting, several conference calls, and email communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society, The European Society of Endocrinology, and The Pituitary Society reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines.

- **Conclusions**: Practice guidelines are presented for diagnosis and treatment of patients with elevated prolactin levels. These include evidence-based approaches to assessing the cause of hyperprolactinemia, treating drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, and managing prolactinomas in nonpregnant and pregnant subjects. Indications and side effects of therapeutic agents for treating prolactinomas are also presented.

### A multicenter study of clinical outcomes and volumetric trends in suspected microprolactinomas [^117FnURb]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of pituitary microprolactinomas is often obscured by relatively low levels of elevated prolactin compared to macroprolactinomas, which may lead to varying patterns of medical therapy versus observation. We sought to correlate prolactin levels in suspected microprolactinomas with tumor volumes and clinical outcomes. This was a multicenter retrospective study of patients with pituitary microadenomas with baseline prolactin levels greater than 18 ng/ml for males and greater than 30 ng/ml for females. A linear-mixed model was used to depict changes in tumor volume over time.

There were 65 patients with a mean tumor volume of 95.9 mm³ and a mean prolactin level of 59.4 ng/ml. There were significantly higher prolactin levels in patients with tumors above the mean volume versus below (74.0 vs. 53.4 ng/ml, p = 0.027). Of the patients, 26 were observed, 31 were treated with anti-dopaminergic therapy, and 8 underwent surgery. There were significantly greater baseline prolactin levels for patients who were treated surgically (mean 86.4 ng/ml) than those treated medically (mean 61.7 ng/ml) or observed (mean 48.5 ng/ml, p = 0.02).

Among the 26 patients who were observed, 13 demonstrated spontaneous tumor shrinkage, 12 remained stable, and 1 patient's tumor grew but was lost to follow-up. Linear mixed modeling demonstrated a statistically significant rate of tumor shrinkage over time of 3.67 mm³ per year (p = 0.03). When analyzing patients who were observed versus those requiring surgery after initially being surveilled, there were significantly greater baseline prolactin/volume ratios in surgical patients versus those observed.

### Biochemical diagnosis in prolactinomas: Some caveats [^1145k2GN]. Pituitary (2020). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas are the most frequently seen pituitary adenomas in clinical practice. A correct biochemical diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is a prerequisite for further investigation but may be hampered by analytical difficulties, as well as a large number of potentially overlapping conditions associated with increased prolactin levels. Suspicion should rise in patients whose symptoms and biochemical results do not match. Assay problems, macroprolactinemia, and the high-dose hook effect are discussed as possible reasons for false positive or false negative prolactin levels. Physiological and pathological causes of hyperprolactinemia and their implications for interpreting prolactin results are reviewed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1119DMso]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hyperprolactinemia, specifically concerning dopamine agonists, the Endocrine Society's 2011 guidelines recommend initiating dopamine agonist therapy to lower prolactin levels, decrease tumor size, and restore gonadal function in patients with symptomatic prolactin-secreting microadenomas or macroadenomas.

### Hyperprolactinemia [^114d4tBq]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

In several respects, prolactin is unique among anterior pituitary hormones. The primary regulation of prolactin secretion is mediated through hypothalamic inhibition, and the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia can be established without the use of stimulation or suppression tests. Documenting the presence of hyperprolactinemia is not difficult; the challenge lies in identifying the cause of the hormone hypersecretion.

With immunoradiometric assays, falsely low levels of prolactin are occasionally seen in patients with macroadenomas and very high serum prolactin, known as the hook effect. Macroprolactin should be suspected when a patient with hyperprolactinemia does not present with typical clinical symptoms, and all hyperprolactinemic sera should be screened for macroprolactin.

- **Prolactinomas**: Prolactin levels generally parallel tumor size. Prolactin-secreting macroadenomas are typically associated with levels exceeding 250 microg/l and may surpass 1,000 microg/l. Large non-functioning adenomas also lead to hyperprolactinemia, but levels virtually never exceed 94 microg/l. Acquired and isolated prolactin deficiency is rare.

### Elevated prolactin secretion during proestrus in mice: Absence of a defined surge [^113tpmmo]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

This study showed a gradual and prolonged elevation in prolactin levels during proestrus in mice, validated by both tail tip blood (Figure 3) and trunk blood collection (Figure 5). The pattern of secretion is distinct from the well-defined surge observed in rats, which is tightly linked to the light–dark cycle and occurs only in the afternoon of proestrus, largely coincident with the LH surge. Interestingly, this prolonged rise in prolactin levels tracks rising estradiol levels during the day of proestrus in the rodent. Prolactin levels remained high throughout the day of proestrus and even into the early morning of estrus, in a strain-dependent manner (Figure 3).

In rats, the proestrous prolactin surge consists of a peak, plateau, and termination phase. The transition through these phases is thought to be controlled by a shift from a nondopaminergic mechanism involving one or more prolactin-releasing factors that induce increased prolactin levels during the peak phase. High progesterone post-ovulation maintains low dopamine levels during the plateau phase; then rising dopamine levels (dopaminergic mechanism) curtail the plateau phase and induce termination of the surge. These phases observed during the proestrous prolactin surge in rats are not clearly defined in our study using mice and suggest the proestrous prolactin rise in mice may not be as tightly controlled as that observed in rats. The prolonged nature of the prolactin rise during proestrus in our study can be defined as a gradual rise and then termination.

### Pituitary tumors in MEN1: Do not be misled by borderline elevated prolactin levels [^1127ucW8]. Pituitary (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this case report is to demonstrate that the simple expedient of measuring periodic prolactin levels in patients with MEN1 who have modest hyperprolactinemia and normal pituitary MRI scans is insufficient to monitor for the development of pituitary adenomas.

- **Methods**: Review of relevant literature and chart review.

- **Results**: A 25-year-old man with known MEN1, manifested by hyperparathyroidism and a gastrin-producing neuroendocrine tumor, was found to have a prolactin (PRL) level of 20.0 ng/mL (reference range: 1.6–16 ng/mL) but a normal pituitary MRI scan. The impression then was that he had a prolactinoma too small to be visualized on the MRI. Over the next 3.5 years, his PRL levels remained in this mildly elevated range, but he then presented with severe headaches and visual field defects. An MRI showed a 3.1 × 1.7 × 1.9 cm pituitary adenoma with compression of the optic chiasm and invasion of the left cavernous sinus. Surgery revealed a gonadotroph adenoma, and he subsequently required gamma knife radiotherapy for the residual tumor. Postoperative PRL levels were normal.

- **Conclusions**: Small, intrasellar microadenomas may be associated with elevated PRL levels due to possible direct hormone production (prolactinoma) or possibly to interference with portal vessel blood flow. In monitoring hyperprolactinemic MEN1 patients for the development of pituitary adenomas, measurement of PRL levels is insufficient, and periodic MRI scans are necessary at a more frequent interval than every 3–5 years. This may also pertain to patients with "idiopathic" hyperprolactinemia.

### Elevated prolactin serum levels and history of alcohol withdrawal seizures [^111gEHk1]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2007). Low credibility.

Prolactin has been discussed as useful for differential diagnosis in epilepsia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between prolactin serum levels and previous alcohol withdrawal seizures.

- **Methods**: We assessed 118 male patients admitted for detoxification treatment. Previous withdrawal seizures were recorded, and prolactin serum levels were measured using an enzymatic immunoassay.

- **Results**: Patients with a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures had significantly higher prolactin levels (17.8 ng/ml, SD = 12.1) than patients without previous seizures (13.0 ng/ml, SD = 8.1, p < 0.05). Logistic regression revealed significant predictive qualities for prolactin serum levels (B = 0.05, Wald = 5.30, p = 0.021, OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.01–1.11).

- **Conclusions**: The present findings show an association between elevated prolactin serum levels and a history of withdrawal seizures. Hence, the results suggest that prolactin elevation at admission may be a clinical marker for an increased risk of withdrawal seizures.

### Antipsychotic medication, prolactin elevation, and ovarian function in women with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder [^112gCTep]. Psychiatry Research (2002). Low credibility.

Some, but not all, antipsychotics elevate serum prolactin. Antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia is thought to account for high rates of menstrual dysfunction and diminished estrogen levels in women with schizophrenia. However, few studies have directly assessed the relationships between prolactin, menstrual function, and ovarian hormone levels in this population. Sixteen premenopausal women with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, eight treated with an antipsychotic with prolactin-elevating potential (five with typical antipsychotics and three with risperidone) and eight treated with an antipsychotic with prolactin-sparing potential (seven with olanzapine and one with clozapine), were studied for eight weeks.

Data were collected on menstrual functioning and on serum prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone levels. These were compared between subjects who received an antipsychotic with prolactin-elevating potential and those who received an antipsychotic with prolactin-sparing potential, as well as between subjects with hyperprolactinemia (N = 6) and normoprolactinemia (N = 10). Additionally, peak ovarian hormone levels were compared to normal values. While mean prolactin levels of subjects who received an antipsychotic with prolactin-elevating potential were significantly greater than those of subjects who received an antipsychotic with prolactin-sparing potential, there were no differences in rates of menstrual dysfunction or in ovarian hormone values between the two groups. Similar rates of menstrual dysfunction and ovarian hormone values were observed between the hyperprolactinemic and normoprolactinemic groups.

### Hormone concentrations throughout uncomplicated pregnancies: a longitudinal study [^112KJDec]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Prolactin is produced by the pituitary gland in a pulsatile fashion and plays essential roles in mammary development and lactation, as well as reproduction. Though the decidua or the fetus cannot be ruled out as a potential source of prolactin (PRL) during pregnancy, it is believed that the maternal pituitary is the main source of PRL secretion in pregnant women.

We observed an increase in PRL levels with progressing pregnancy; this is consistent with prior longitudinal studies and a cross-sectional study. The increase in PRL concentration is believed to result from the stimulatory effect of estradiol, and to a lesser extent progesterone, on the pituitary gland.

Contrary to previous reports, we did not observe lower prolactin levels in multiparous as compared to primiparous women. Estrogens are hypothesized to stimulate the enlargement of the pituitary gland during pregnancy, resulting in increased PRL concentrations, which parallel the increase in estrogens. In our study, the lack of an association between parity and PRL may be explained by the similar estradiol concentrations irrespective of parity. Two prior studies showing a decrease in PRL also observed decreased estradiol concentrations in multiparous women.

Past studies reported lower early pregnancy PRL in women smoking during pregnancy as compared to non-smoking women. We observed a non-significant suggestion of lower PRL concentrations in smoking women in the 1st and 2nd trimester and significantly lower PRL levels in the 3rd trimester. Given that nicotine exposure induces dopamine release, which inhibits PRL secretion, these findings are noteworthy in understanding the hormonal changes in smoking pregnant women.

### Elevation of prolactin levels by atypical antipsychotics [^111JM3C9]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics are thought not to elevate prolactin levels; however, the authors examined data suggesting that atypical antipsychotics do elevate prolactin levels, albeit more transiently than typical antipsychotics.

- **Method**: Prolactin levels in 18 male patients with schizophrenia who were receiving atypical antipsychotics were monitored over a 24-hour period following the administration of their daily oral dose of risperidone, olanzapine, or clozapine.

- **Results**: The baseline prolactin levels in patients receiving risperidone (mean = 27 ng/ml, SD = 14) were abnormally high, whereas the baseline levels in patients receiving olanzapine (mean = 9 ng/ml, SD = 5) and clozapine (mean = 9 ng/ml, SD = 5) were not high. All three atypical antipsychotics caused a doubling of prolactin levels over baseline levels 6 hours after medication administration.

- **Conclusions**: The data suggest that these atypical antipsychotics raise prolactin levels, although the increases with olanzapine did not reach statistical significance. This indicates that the differences in the effects on prolactin levels between atypical and typical antipsychotics are not categorical but rather lie in the degree and duration of dose-induced prolactin elevation. This variation is attributable to the differential binding properties of each drug on pituitary dopamine D(2) receptors.

### Prolactin - a pleiotropic factor in health and disease [^115ETrsb]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

The principal role of prolactin in mammals is the regulation of lactation. Prolactin is a hormone that is mainly synthesized and secreted by lactotroph cells in the anterior pituitary gland. Prolactin signalling occurs via a unique transmembrane prolactin receptor (PRL-R). The structure of the PRL-R has now been elucidated and is similar to that of many biologically fundamental receptors of the class 1 haematopoietic cytokine receptor family, such as the growth hormone receptor. The PRL-R is expressed in a wide array of tissues, and a growing number of biological processes continue to be attributed to prolactin.

In this review, we focus on the newly discovered roles of prolactin in human health and disease, particularly its involvement in metabolic homeostasis, including body weight control, adipose tissue, skin and hair follicles, pancreas, bone, the adrenal response to stress, the control of lactotroph cell homeostasis, and maternal behaviour. New data concerning the pathological states of hypoprolactinaemia and hyperprolactinaemia will also be presented and discussed.

### Surgery as first-line treatment for prolactinoma? Discussion of the literature and results of a consecutive series of surgically treated patients [^113yUAqn]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas, or lactotrophic adenomas, are the most common pituitary adenomas, accounting for approximately 50% of all pituitary adenomas and are characterized by excessive prolactin secretion (levels > 150–200 ng/mL). These high levels of prolactin can cause decreased fertility, decreased energy and libido, and galactorrhea in men and premenopausal women. Headache is a common symptom in men and pre- and postmenopausal women, while hypogonadism is seen exclusively in men, and oligo- or amenorrhea is seen exclusively in premenopausal women. Visual field deficits and visual acuity deficits can result from compression of the optic nerves and chiasm.

While elevated prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia) can also be caused by other pituitary adenomas through increased intrasellar pressure, known as the stalk effect, or by hypothalamic dysfunction, medications, or various conditions such as pregnancy, liver cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism, these levels are usually well below the prolactin serum levels caused by prolactinomas.

### Dopamine agonists for preventing future miscarriage in women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and recurrent miscarriage history [^117NEsf9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia is the presence of abnormally high circulating levels of prolactin. Idiopathic hyperprolactinemia refers to prolactin hypersecretion with no identifiable cause, and it is causally related to the development of miscarriage in pregnant women, especially those with a history of recurrent miscarriage. A possible mechanism is that high levels of prolactin affect the function of the ovaries, resulting in a luteal phase defect and miscarriage. A dopamine agonist is a compound with high efficacy in lowering prolactin levels and restoring gonadal function.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of different types of dopamine agonists in preventing future miscarriage in women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and a history of recurrent miscarriage.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in all languages examining the effect of dopamine agonists on preventing future miscarriage. Women who had idiopathic hyperprolactinemia with a history of recurrent miscarriage were eligible for inclusion in this review. Comparisons planned included dopamine agonists alone versus placebo/no treatment; and dopamine agonists combined with other therapy versus other therapy alone.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed a single trial for inclusion, evaluated trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

### Emotionally induced galactorrhoea in a non-lactating female — "Pseudo-lactation" [^116D5XeR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Causes for hyperprolactinaemia are numerous, including nipple stimulation, chest wall injury, breastfeeding, co-morbid psychiatric disorders, and treatment with dopamine antagonists. Additionally, direct stimulation of lactotrophs by oestrogen, such as during pregnancy or when using oestrogen-containing contraceptive pills, also causes hyperprolactinaemia. In the patient studied, all the aforementioned causes except pregnancy were excluded through a comprehensive history. Pregnancy was ruled out with a normal ultrasound scan of the abdomen.

The most common pathological cause of galactorrhoea is a pituitary tumour. Prolactin-secreting adenomas, other functional tumours co-secreting prolactin, or any form of macroadenoma large enough to cause pituitary stalk compression (i.e. disconnection hyperprolactinaemia) may result in hyperprolactinaemia. In this patient, an MRI scan of the pituitary gland did not reveal any evidence of microadenoma or macroadenoma. Although the MRI was conducted four months after the initial presentation, it is highly unlikely for a pituitary tumour to undergo spontaneous regression even without the use of drugs such as dopamine receptor agonists.

Hypothyroidism removes the negative feedback on hypothalamic TRH and subsequently may cause an increase in prolactin secretion. Nearly 30% of patients with chronic kidney disease have high serum prolactin levels, probably due to impaired renal excretion of prolactin. In our patient, hypothyroidism was excluded by normal TSH and T4 levels. Although the patient was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus, renal function tests were

### Olanzapine [^114NHAbZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, olanzapine elevates prolactin levels, and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion, which in turn may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia, when associated with hypogonadism, may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds that increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer.

In placebo-controlled olanzapine clinical studies (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 30% of adults treated with olanzapine as compared to 10.5% of adults treated with placebo.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112DarXC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hyperprolactinemia, specifically with respect to dopamine agonists, the Endocrine Society 2011 guidelines recommend preferring cabergoline over other dopamine agonists. This preference is due to cabergoline's higher efficacy in normalizing prolactin levels and its higher frequency of pituitary tumor shrinkage.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^116UCq8y]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023).

- **Diagnostic approach**: The diagnostic workup for hyperprolactinemia is illustrated in Fig. 2. As shown in Table 1, a variety of physiological, pathological, and drug-related factors can induce symptomatic hyperprolactinemia.

	- **Physiological conditions**: pregnancy, breastfeeding, stress, exercise, food intake, sleep
	- **Pathological conditions**: chronic kidney and liver failure, primary hypothyroidism, compression of the pituitary stalk by a non–PRL-secreting pituitary tumor or different parasellar mass, granulomatous infiltration of the hypothalamus
	- **Drug-related causes**: antidepressants, dopamine receptor blockers, dopamine synthesis inhibitors, oral contraceptives, gastrointestinal medications, neuroleptics, antipsychotics

	Before confirming a diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, these conditions must be investigated and excluded. Attention should be directed towards the patient's medical history, concomitant medications, and biochemical assessments. This is especially pertinent in cases of modest PRL elevations, which only occasionally may obscure the presence of a prolactinoma, as demonstrated in clinical case 2. To confirm the diagnosis of a PRL-secreting pituitary tumor, a single measurement of serum PRL without excessive venipuncture stress is strongly recommended.

- It is advised not to conduct a breast examination in patients with galactorrhea immediately before PRL assessment, as any nipple stimulation may lead to an increase in PRL levels. A level above the normal upper limit (25 μg/L in women, 20 μg/L in men) raises diagnostic suspicion. Conversely, dynamic testing of PRL secretion based on the administration of TRH, L-dopa, nomifensine, and domperidone does not.

### Drugs and prolactin [^117CXxzL]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Medications commonly cause hyperprolactinemia, and their use must be differentiated from pathologic causes. The most common medications to cause hyperprolactinemia are antipsychotic agents, although some newer atypical antipsychotics do not. Other medications causing hyperprolactinemia include antidepressants, antihypertensive agents, and drugs that increase bowel motility. Often, medication-induced hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, causing galactorrhea, menstrual disturbances, and erectile dysfunction.

In individual patients, it is important to differentiate hyperprolactinemia due to medication from a structural lesion in the hypothalamic-pituitary area. This can be done by stopping the medication temporarily to determine if the prolactin (PRL) levels return to normal, switching to another medication in the same class that does not cause hyperprolactinemia (in consultation with the patient's physician and/or psychiatrist), or by performing an MRI or CT scan.

If the hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, management strategies include switching to an alternative medication that does not cause hyperprolactinemia, using estrogen/testosterone replacement, or cautiously adding a dopamine agonist.

### Prolactin levels in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients treated with clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol [^114zwVt5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Prolactin levels are elevated to varying degrees by antipsychotics and may result in sexual and other adverse effects, potentially related to antipsychotic effects. This study used data collected in a trial of antipsychotics to examine the differential impact of these drugs on prolactin levels, to explore the relationship between clinical effects and prolactin levels, and to determine the relationship between plasma levels of antipsychotics and prolactin levels.

- **Method**: Treatment-resistant patients (133 men, 24 women) diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in a double-blind, randomized, 14-week trial comparing clozapine (N = 40), olanzapine (N = 39), risperidone (N = 41), and haloperidol (N = 37). Plasma levels of prolactin and antipsychotics were determined at baseline and at weeks 5, 8, 10, 12, and 14 during the trial. Clinical effects were measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. Statistical analyses were limited to the 75 men for whom repeated prolactin levels were available. Data were gathered from June 1996 to December 1999.

- **Results**: Risperidone caused significant elevation of prolactin levels (p < .05) that appeared to be dose-dependent. Clozapine and olanzapine were associated with decreases in prolactin, whereas haloperidol led to a minor, nonsignificant increase. Plasma olanzapine and prolactin levels were correlated. Prolactin levels were not related to clinical improvement or extrapyramidal side effects.

- **Conclusion**: Antipsychotics show a major di

### Changes in serum prolactin level during intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and effect on clinical pregnancy rate: a prospective observational study [^111igTmV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

In normoprolactinemic women, a state of transient hyperprolactinemia is clearly identified in patients undergoing ICSI. Although its cause is not identified, it can be attributed to stress and anxiety. This increase appears to be harmless and doesn't affect the outcome of ICSI. A significant positive correlation was identified between higher quality embryos and prolactin before ovum pickup. More research is warranted to help increase the predictability of better quality embryos and hence quantification of their implantation potential. This might help with embryo selection, aiming at a smaller number of embryos to be transferred per cycle, with a consequent decrease in the risk of multiple pregnancies without decreasing pregnancy rates.

### Elevated prolactin secretion during proestrus in mice: Absence of a defined surge [^112oZfwy]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Prolactin (A) and LH (B) levels were obtained via trunk blood collection following decapitation during proestrus. Mice were exposed to higher prolactin levels in the evening of proestrus compared to the morning (n = 8, p = 0.0047, Student's t-test; t = 3.354, df = 14). There was a significant difference in LH levels (n = 8, p = 0.0002, Mann-Whitney U test) on the evening of proestrus compared to the morning. Results are presented as mean ± SEM. ✱✱ p < 0.01, ✱✱✱ p < 0.001. Black dots indicate levels of LH and prolactin in individual mice.

- **Percentage increase in prolactin**: Prolactin (ng/ml) levels were measured by the different sampling methods (tail tip sampling and trunk blood collection) at 0900 h (morning) and 1900 h (evening) on proestrus.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113KpDLA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyperprolactinemia, specifically concerning serum prolactin levels, the Endocrine Society 2011 guidelines recommend performing serial dilution of serum samples. This procedure helps to eliminate an artifact that can occur with some immunoradiometric assays, leading to a falsely low prolactin value (known as the "hook effect") in patients with a discrepancy between a very large pituitary tumor and a mildly elevated prolactin level.

Regarding the medical management of hyperprolactinemia, specifically concerning dopamine agonists, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend considering the tapering and eventual discontinuation of dopamine agonist therapy. This should be done with careful clinical and biochemical follow-up in patients treated for at least two years, who no longer have elevated serum prolactin, and have no visible tumor remnant on MRI.

### Evaluation and management of galactorrhea [^112bYoxA]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Galactorrhea is commonly caused by hyperprolactinemia, especially when associated with amenorrhea. Hyperprolactinemia is most frequently induced by medication or associated with pituitary adenomas or other sellar or suprasellar lesions. Less common causes include hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, and nipple stimulation.

After pathologic nipple discharge is ruled out, patients should be evaluated by measuring their prolactin level. Those with hyperprolactinemia should have pregnancy ruled out, and thyroid and renal function assessed. If no other cause is found, brain magnetic resonance imaging should be performed. Patients with prolactinomas are usually treated with dopamine agonists like bromocriptine or cabergoline; surgery or radiation therapy is rarely required.

Medications causing hyperprolactinemia should be discontinued or replaced with those from a similar class with a lower potential for causing hyperprolactinemia. Normoprolactinemic patients with idiopathic, nonbothersome galactorrhea can be reassured and do not need treatment. However, those with bothersome galactorrhea usually respond to a short course of a low-dose dopamine agonist.

### Galactorrhea with menstrual irregularity: Something other than a prolactinoma [^114tejUu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Galactorrhea and menstrual irregularity are typical manifestations of hyperprolactinemia. In the absence of a demonstrable pituitary mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the condition is usually labeled as idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and presumed to be due to microadenomas too small to visualize. As our case will demonstrate, however, there are a number of other causes that should be considered in any patient with otherwise unexplained hyperprolactinemia.

### Prolactin in men's health and disease [^1127PHC3]. Current Opinion in Urology (2011). Low credibility.

To review the physiology of prolactin (PRL), the cause and management of hyperprolactinemia, and discuss the evolving diverse roles of PRL in men's health.

- **Recent findings**: Hyperprolactinemia can be physiologically found after sexual activities, exercise, lactation, during pregnancy, and after stressful venipuncture. Elevated PRL can be caused by medication use, renal failure, hypothyroidism, and prolactinoma — PRL-secreting tumors. Symptomatic hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas should be treated to lower PRL levels, decrease tumor size, and restore gonadal function. Three modes of treatment are typically utilized: pharmacological, radiosurgery with gamma radiation, and external beam radiation. Pharmacological treatment of prolactinomas is mainly based on dopamine agonists. The most frequently used dopamine agonists are bromocriptine and cabergoline, with cabergoline becoming the preferred drug in the treatment of prolactinomas due to a higher response rate and fewer side effects. Bromocriptine has been recently approved to improve glycemic control in diabetes mellitus.

- **Summary**: PRL plays a diverse role in men's reproduction and health. Detecting and treating elevated PRL may not only improve infertility and hypogonadism but also have a positive effect on the metabolic profile of the patient and control of glycemic control — an important advantage considering the dramatic worldwide increase in obesity and diabetes.

### Antipsychotics and hyperprolactinaemia: Clinical recommendations [^117JamwL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

A group of international experts in psychiatry, medicine, toxicology, and pharmacy assembled to undertake a critical examination of the currently available clinical guidance on hyperprolactinaemia. This paper summarizes the group's collective views and provides a summary of the recommendations agreed by the consensus group to assist clinicians in the recognition, clinical assessment, investigation, and management of elevated plasma prolactin levels in patients being treated for severe mental illness. It also addresses the special problems of particular populations, gives advice about information that should be provided to patients, and suggests a strategy for routine monitoring of prolactin levels.

The recommendations are based upon the evidence contained in the supplement 'Hyperprolactinaemia in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder: Clinical Implications' (2008). The guidance contained in this article is not intended to replace national guidance (such as that of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence); however, it does provide additional detail that is unlikely to be covered in existing guidelines and focuses on areas of uncertainty and disagreement. We hope it will add to the debate about this topic.

### Contemporary management of prolactinomas [^113rru5g]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas, known as prolactinomas, are the most common type of functional pituitary tumor. Treatment of hyperprolactinemia is indicated due to its consequences, which include infertility, gonadal dysfunction, and osteoporosis. Correct diagnosis is critical, as the first line of therapy is medical management with dopamine agonists. Medical therapy effectively normalizes prolactin levels in more than 90% of patients, although long-term treatment may be necessary for some.

Transsphenoidal surgery is typically indicated for patients where medical therapy fails, cannot be tolerated, or for those with microprolactinomas. In experienced hands, transsphenoidal removal of microprolactinomas can achieve hormonal and oncological cure in more than 90% of patients with minimal risk. Therefore, surgery might be a suitable option for young patients with microprolactinomas desiring fertility restoration and who wish to avoid long-term medical therapy.

The authors review the diagnosis and management of prolactinomas, including medical therapy, surgical therapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery.

### Advances in the treatment of prolactinomas [^111DJBws]. Endocrine Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas account for approximately 40% of all pituitary adenomas and are an important cause of hypogonadism and infertility. The ultimate goal of therapy for prolactinomas is the restoration or achievement of eugonadism through the normalization of hyperprolactinemia and control of tumor mass. Medical therapy with dopamine agonists is highly effective in the majority of cases and represents the mainstay of therapy. Recent data indicating successful withdrawal of these agents in a subset of patients challenge the previously held concept that medical therapy is a lifelong requirement.

Complicated situations, such as those encountered in resistance to dopamine agonists, pregnancy, and giant or malignant prolactinomas, may require multimodal therapy involving surgery, radiotherapy, or both. Progress in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of prolactinomas may enable future development of novel molecular therapies for treatment-resistant cases. This review provides a critical analysis of the efficacy and safety of the various modes of therapy available for the treatment of patients with prolactinomas with an emphasis on challenging situations, a discussion of the data regarding withdrawal of medical therapy, and a foreshadowing of novel approaches to therapy that may become available in the future.

### Serum prolactin overestimation and risk of misdiagnosis [^112gmSwi]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Falsely elevated prolactin measurements risk overdiagnosis, and unnecessary imaging and treatment.

- **Design**: We conducted a clinical audit of 18 patients who presented with hyperprolactinaemia, followed by a laboratory audit of 40 split samples across a range of serum prolactin (5–5051 mIU/L). In each case (total n = 58), serum prolactin was measured on both Roche and Siemens platforms.

- **Results**: Serum prolactin as measured by Roche was higher than the corresponding Siemens value in every case, despite similar reference ranges. The mean discrepancy in serum prolactin by Roche vs. Siemens was +81% in the clinical audit and +50% in the laboratory audit. This led to unnecessary interventions in 7 out of 18 patients (39%) in the clinical audit.

- **Conclusions**: Serum prolactin is overestimated on the Roche relative to the Siemens platform. Laboratories should review Roche reference intervals for serum prolactin, and clinicians should consider repeating serum prolactin on another platform if the serum prolactin is incongruent with the clinical scenario.

### Medical causes and consequences of hyperprolactinaemia. A context for psychiatrists [^111Zyoaj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and can lead to both short-term sexual dysfunction and galactorrhoea, as well as long-term loss of bone mineral density. Prolactin is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland under the influence of dopamine, which exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion. Physiological regulators of prolactin secretion include various types of stress and sleep. Disruption of the normal control of prolactin secretion results in hyperprolactinaemia from both pathological and pharmacological causes.

The administration of antipsychotic medication is responsible for the high prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia in people with severe mental illness. It is essential to distinguish physiological hyperprolactinaemia, such as that occurring during pregnancy and lactation, from pathological causes to prevent unnecessary investigation and treatment. This article discusses the causes, consequences, and management of hyperprolactinaemia.

### Does serum prolactin indicate the presence of seizure in the emergency department patient [^111VHj5B]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

We sought to evaluate whether there was a correlation between elevated serum prolactin in patients presenting with the question of seizure.

- **Methods**: A convenience sample of 200 consecutive patients was chosen who had a serum prolactin measurement taken in the setting of seizure activity.

- **Results**: The prolactin level ranged from 3.90 to 294.00 mg/dl, with an upper limit of normal being 29.9 mg/dl. Patients were ultimately diagnosed with seizure in 54.5% (109 of 200) of cases, with an abnormal prolactin level in 31.0% (62 of 200). The sensitivity of serum prolactin was 42%, the specificity was 82%, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 74%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 54%. There was an overall accuracy of 60% in the diagnosis of seizure, with a likelihood ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.5–3.9).

- **Conclusion**: The measurement of serum prolactin is helpful as a confirmatory test but not as a screening test in the emergency department setting.
