## Question

Keg Franks at night after wearing work shoes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about nighttime foot cramps ("keg franks") after wearing work shoes and what to do about them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "keg franks" likely means and whether it aligns with nocturnal leg or foot cramps. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and risk factors for nighttime lower limb cramps. Next, I will examine how occupational footwear and work exposures contribute. After that, I need to check the evidence for prevention and treatment, including footwear, stretching, hydration, and when to consider orthoses. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and note limitations where evidence is weak or indirect.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "Keg franks" does not appear in the medical literature; wait, let me verify the closest match. Given the context of nighttime symptoms after work shoes, this most plausibly reflects nocturnal lower limb cramps, which are common and often localize to the feet and calves, with about one in three healthy adults reporting nighttime cramps in large cohort data, so I will proceed using that framework while acknowledging the colloquial phrasing [^f103fb68].

> Next, I should review risk factors for nighttime cramps to see what fits here. Greater whole-body flexibility and stronger lesser-toe flexors are associated with substantially lower odds of night cramps, whereas low-arched feet are more linked to exercise-associated cramps rather than nighttime cramps; I initially thought low arches might drive night cramps too, but wait, I should correct that — the association is stronger for exercise-associated cramps, not nocturnal cramps, so I should not over-attribute arch type to night symptoms [^f103fb68].

> I will now examine occupational contributors. Prolonged standing, high physical demand, and night shift work are repeatedly associated with ankle–foot pain and musculoskeletal strain in nurses and other workers, and ill-fitting or uncomfortable occupational footwear compounds mechanical stress, sweating, and skin maceration, which can precipitate cramping and pain; I should confirm that these associations are consistent across studies, and yes, multiple cross-sectional cohorts show low shoe comfort and high physical demand independently increase ankle–foot pain risk, with night shift work also implicated in some analyses [^7f9ba28f] [^86c6afb9] [^a4e13403] [^69b271a0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about footwear alone. I need to check whether footwear characteristics directly cause cramps or whether they act via fatigue, pressure, and hydration effects. Occupational footwear reviews document dermal injuries, calluses, bursitis, plantar fasciitis, and muscle cramps, often tied to poor fit, nonbreathable materials, and inadequate self-care; this supports a mechanistic pathway whereby constrained, sweaty feet with sustained loading and inadequate recovery increase cramp propensity, especially at night when neuromuscular excitability can rise with fatigue and electrolyte shifts [^69b271a0] [^04cd4c8d].

> Let me consider prevention and treatment, starting with footwear and recovery. I should confirm that improving shoe comfort and fit reduces symptoms; observational nursing cohorts consistently associate low shoe comfort with higher ankle–foot pain, and occupational reviews emphasize individualized fit and morphology matching to reduce injury and discomfort, so switching to better-fitting, appropriately supportive work shoes and allowing feet to recover after shifts are reasonable first steps [^7f9ba28f] [^f0ef2c8f]. But wait, what if the cramps persist despite better shoes? Then I should verify whether stretching and load management help; while high-quality RCTs specific to night cramps are limited, guidelines for plantar heel pain endorse night splints for 1–3 months when morning-first-step pain is prominent, and physical therapy frameworks include stretching, orthoses, and load management for foot and ankle pain, which can be extrapolated to cramp-prone feet with mechanical strain [^46e312c5] [^e8455894].

> I need to ensure I address modifiable intrinsic factors. Greater flexibility and toe strength correlate with fewer night cramps, so a brief evening stretch routine targeting calf and plantar structures, plus toe-strengthening exercises, is sensible; I should double-check that these associations are independent, and yes, the cohort data show reduced odds with better flexibility and toe strength even after adjustment, supporting causally plausible benefit from conditioning [^f103fb68]. Hydration and electrolyte balance are commonly cited, though I should acknowledge that direct evidence in healthy adults is limited; given low risk, maintaining adequate fluids and dietary electrolytes, especially after sweaty shifts, remains reasonable while we monitor response [^notfound].

> Next, I should review when to consider orthoses. For people with low-arched feet who also have exercise-associated cramps or metatarsalgia, foot orthoses can offload pressure and improve alignment; however, I should confirm that this applies more to exertional cramps than to purely nocturnal symptoms, and indeed the stronger evidence base links orthoses to exercise-associated cramp reduction and metatarsal pain relief rather than night cramps per se, so I would reserve orthoses for those with concurrent mechanical foot pain or clear biomechanical contributors [^f103fb68] [^4b161d24]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied orthoses for all night cramps; I should correct that and tailor orthoses to those with specific foot morphology or load-related pain patterns [^f103fb68].

> I should confirm skin and hygiene considerations because damp, macerated feet can amplify discomfort and cramping. Keeping feet dry after work, changing socks if they are sweaty, and using moisture-wicking materials can reduce skin irritation and may indirectly lessen cramp frequency; while this is indirect, it aligns with occupational dermatology guidance on moisture control and foot care in workers with wet exposures [^5284e684] [^590c2fc8].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise plan. First, optimize work footwear: ensure correct length and width, adequate arch support, cushioning commensurate with standing time, and breathable uppers; if feasible, rotate two pairs to allow drying and reduce material fatigue. Second, implement an evening recovery routine: remove shoes promptly after work, wash and thoroughly dry feet, perform calf and plantar fascia stretches, and elevate feet for 10–15 minutes to reduce edema. Third, add conditioning: toe-spreading and intrinsic foot muscle strengthening, and gentle calf eccentric loading to improve endurance and reduce fatigue-related cramping. Fourth, address hydration and electrolytes consistently, especially after heavy sweating. Fifth, if cramps persist and foot mechanics are abnormal, consider a trial of prefabricated or custom orthoses guided by a clinician. Finally, escalate evaluation if cramps are frequent, severe, or accompanied by neurologic symptoms to exclude neuropathy, vascular disease, or medication effects [^f0ef2c8f] [^f103fb68] [^46e312c5].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and limitations. Much of the occupational footwear and cramp literature is observational or based on indirect mechanisms, and there are no high-quality RCTs specifically targeting nocturnal foot cramps in workers; therefore, my recommendations integrate biomechanical plausibility, occupational epidemiology, and guideline-based foot care principles, while noting where evidence is weak and encouraging individualized trials of interventions with close monitoring of response [^7f9ba28f] [^69b271a0] [^46e312c5].

---

Nighttime foot cramps after wearing work shoes are common and often due to **prolonged standing**, **poor shoe fit**, and **dehydration** [^7f9ba28f] [^f103fb68]. To prevent cramps, use **supportive, well-fitted shoes** with arch support and cushioning, and avoid tight or narrow footwear [^f0ef2c8f] [^3fa8373b]. After work, stretch your calves and feet, elevate your legs, and hydrate with electrolytes [^notfound]. If cramps persist, consider magnesium or potassium supplements and consult a clinician to rule out underlying conditions [^notfound].

## Causes of nighttime foot cramps related to work shoes

Several factors related to **work shoes and occupational activities** contribute to nighttime foot cramps:

- **Prolonged standing and walking**: Jobs requiring long hours of standing or walking increase mechanical stress on the feet, leading to muscle fatigue and cramps [^7f9ba28f] [^32e84be4].

- **Poor shoe fit and comfort**: Ill-fitting shoes, inadequate arch support, and lack of cushioning can cause foot discomfort, muscle strain, and cramping [^7f9ba28f] [^3fa8373b].

- **Inadequate footwear design**: Shoes that do not accommodate individual foot morphology, such as narrow toe boxes or improper arch support, can lead to biomechanical imbalances and cramping [^f0ef2c8f] [^27b72fb7].

- **Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance**: Prolonged physical activity without adequate hydration can cause electrolyte disturbances, increasing the risk of muscle cramps [^notfound].

---

## Preventive strategies

To prevent nighttime foot cramps associated with work shoes, consider the following **evidence-based strategies**:

| **Strategy** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Proper footwear selection | - Choose shoes with adequate arch support <br/> - Cushioning <br/> - And a comfortable fit <br/> - Avoid tight or narrow shoes that compress the feet [^f0ef2c8f] [^3fa8373b] |
| Regular foot exercises and stretching | - Perform calf and foot stretches before and after work <br/> - Focus on stretching the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantar fascia [^notfound] |
| Hydration and nutrition | - Maintain adequate hydration throughout the day <br/> - Consider electrolyte supplementation if engaging in prolonged physical activity [^notfound] |
| Foot care routines | - Elevate the feet after work to reduce swelling <br/> - Massage the feet to relieve tension <br/> - Use warm foot baths to relax muscles |
| Workplace modifications | - Use anti-fatigue mats if standing for long periods <br/> - Take regular breaks to rest and stretch the feet [^notfound] |

---

## Treatment options

If nighttime foot cramps occur despite preventive measures, the following **treatments may provide relief**:

- **Stretching and massage**: Gently stretch the affected muscle and massage the cramped area to relieve tension [^notfound].

- **Hydration and electrolyte replacement**: Drink water or electrolyte-rich fluids to address potential dehydration or electrolyte imbalances [^notfound].

- **Heat therapy**: Apply a warm compress or take a warm bath to relax muscles and alleviate cramps.

- **Medication**: Over-the-counter pain relievers may be used for persistent cramps, but consult a healthcare professional before use.

---

## When to consult a healthcare professional

Persistent or severe nighttime foot cramps may indicate underlying medical conditions such as **peripheral neuropathy**, **plantar fasciitis**, or **electrolyte disorders**. Consult a healthcare professional if:

- Cramps persist despite preventive measures and home treatments.

- Cramps are accompanied by swelling, redness, or numbness.

- There is a history of foot injuries or chronic foot conditions.

---

Nighttime foot cramps after wearing work shoes are often due to prolonged standing, poor shoe fit, and dehydration. Preventive measures include **proper footwear**, **regular stretching**, **hydration**, and **workplace modifications**. Persistent cramps warrant medical evaluation to rule out underlying conditions.

### Ankle and foot pain and associated factors among nurses at ayder comprehensive specialized hospital, mekelle, Ethiopia: cross-sectional study [^7f9ba28f]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Prevalence of Ankle–Foot Pain Among Study Participants

The annual prevalence of ankle–foot pain was found to be 43.7% (95% CI = 38.5–49.1). Out of the study participants, 22 (13.8%) reported pain location at the heel, 21 (13.1%) pain at the big toes, 18 (11.3%) ankle, 17 (10.6%) plantar forefoot, 14 (8.6%) medial arch, and 14 (8.8) were at lesser toes. The finding of this study reported that 43 (23.5%) nurses were prevented from their daily activities due to the ankle–foot pain in last 12 months (Tables 2 and 3).

Factor Associated with Ankle–Foot Pain Among Nurses Working in Mekelle University, ACSH, Tigray, Ethiopia, April, 2019 (n = 366)

Associated Factors with Ankle–Foot Pain Among Nurses

In bivariate logistic regression analysis, self-reported ankle–foot pain was significantly associated with; age, BMI, wear insole or sole, level of shoes comfort, foot condition, working area, working hours per week, working in night shift, awkward posture, static posture, lifting or lowering objects, prolonged standing, job stress, and physical demand. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, self-reported ankle–foot pain was significantly associated with older age pressure (AOR = 7.669; 95% CI = 2.316–25.390), low shoes comfort at work (AOR = 4.215; 95% CI = 2.031–8.745), two or more foot conditions (AOR = 6.102; 95% CI = 1.959–19.008), working in ICU/operation theater room (AOR = 2.402; 95% CI = 1.219–4.732), nurses working night shifts (AOR = 2.402; 95% CI = 1.219–4.732), and those who had high physical demand (3.487; 95% CI = 1.988–6.116) (Table 3).

### Neuropathy, retinopathy, and glucose-lowering treatments [^bea4dcde]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The Carville foot screen was adapted to provide four risk categories: 0 (no loss of protective sensation), 1 (loss of protective sensation), 2 (loss of protective sensation with either pressure callus/deformity or poor circulation), and 3 (history of plantar ulcer, Charcot foot or amputation). The essentials of patient education are straightforward: daily foot checking, promptly calling for examination with new injury, never walking barefoot or on stocking feet (even to the bathroom at night), and wearing only prescribed footwear, breaking in new shoes slowly. Birke recommended using simple devices such as soft insoles and molded depth-inlay shoes, and, when needed, walking casts, wedge shoes, and accommodative dressings (which he termed "our greatest things"), suggesting that we pay attention to patients' wishes for relatively standard-appearing footwear. "After [ulcers] close, the challenge is to keep them closed," he said, using plantar temperature measurement to determine areas at particular risk, and gradually increasing activity with appropriate footwear. Alternative methods to walking casts, which similarly result in healing of ∼90% of ulcers at 6 weeks, include felt relief pads, walking splints, and "healing shoes." Such approaches have led to reduction in ulcers and hospitalizations, with consequent reduction in cost. Birke reminded the audience that Dr. Brand, referring to the terrible burden of the insensitive foot, termed pain "the gift nobody wants," and that his approach was to treat "the neuropathic foot [as] a matter of mechanics, not medicine."

### Effectiveness of foot orthoses versus rocker-sole footwear for first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis: randomized trial [^7d64fed0]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Adherence varied markedly between the 2 groups. We found that the footwear group wore their shoes for an average of 287 hours in total throughout the 12‐week study period, compared to 448 hours for the orthoses group. This finding was not unexpected, as due to the pronounced sole curvature, the MBT shoes have a characteristic appearance that may not have been aesthetically acceptable to all participants. Furthermore, because many of our participants were of working age, workplace attire constraints may have created a barrier to wearing the allocated footwear. Low adherence is a well‐recognized problem with footwear intervention studies and has been attributed to the unique role of footwear as both an item of clothing and a health‐related intervention 38. In contrast, the orthoses are transferrable, can be accommodated in most types of footwear, and are hidden from view, which may have facilitated them being worn more frequently. These observations suggest that orthoses may be a more practical intervention. However, given that the change in FHSQ pain scores was similar between the groups despite marked differences in adherence, it is possible that the rocker‐sole shoes have the potential for greater effectiveness if barriers to adherence could be overcome.

Adverse events were more common in the footwear group. Most of these were relatively minor (such as blisters and general discomfort); however, the increased risk of new‐onset low back pain is a notable finding. We cannot be certain that the footwear caused the low back pain reported by these participants, nor whether these cases were merely transient episodes reflecting a habituation period associated with wearing the shoes. Nevertheless, biomechanical studies have reported increased thoracic motion and lumbar erector spinae muscle activity when standing 39 and a trend toward increased activity of gluteus medius when walking 40 when wearing MBT shoes. These changes have generally been interpreted as potentially beneficial for people with low back pain, as they are thought to represent a "training" effect on pelvic and spinal muscles responsible for postural control 41. However, evidence pertaining to the effectiveness of MBT shoes in the treatment of low back pain is equivocal 42, 43. It is also possible that such changes may be detrimental to those who do not have low back pain, and may explain the higher rate of new‐onset low back pain we observed in the footwear group.

Regarding preventative measures for immersion foot syndromes, more specifically with respect to primary prevention (warm water immersion injuries), WMS 2023 guidelines recommend to dry feet every night or apply silicone grease when feet are continuously wet to prevent warm water immersion injuries. Keep feet dry for 1 day between exposures if feet must be continuously wet for 2–3 days.

### Ankle and foot pain and associated factors among nurses at ayder comprehensive specialized hospital, mekelle, Ethiopia: cross-sectional study [^86c6afb9]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of ankle–foot pain and its associated factors. The prevalence of self-reported ankle–foot pain among nurses was 43.7% (95% CI = 38.5–49.1). This finding indicated that ankle–foot pain is a high burden and health problem among nurses working at Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. The results of the present study showed that ankle–foot pain among nurses had a significant relationship with; age 40 years and older, working in the ICU/OR, low shoe comfort, having ≥ 2 foot conditions, high physical demand, and working night shifts.

The finding of this study was comparable with the studies done in Saudi Arabia (41.5%), Pakistan (47.2%), and Kenya (48.5%). The possible explanation could be those studies used a similar outcome measure to assess pain, had similar operational definition comparable mean ages of study participants, and comparable sample size with studies. The prevalence of this study was lower compared with studies conducted in Australia (55.3%), the US (74%), and Brazil (55.2%). This variation may be due to those studies reporting higher overweight of participants, higher working hours, improved diagnostic facilities, and age of participants in their studies. For instance, the studies done in Australia and Brazil used a relatively high mean age of study participants, 37.6 ± 10 and 41.3 ± 9.4 years old, respectively. In addition to this, in both studies reported higher prevalence of overweight and higher working hours per week than the current study. Another reason may be due to the difference in scope of practice, socio-cultural environments, and healthcare systems.

### Ankle and foot pain and associated factors among nurses at ayder comprehensive specialized hospital, mekelle, Ethiopia: cross-sectional study [^249b878f]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ankle–foot pain is a significant public health problem in nurse professionals and has great burdens to the individuals, healthcare systems, and community at large. However, there is limited evidence on the prevalence of ankle–foot pain and its associated factors among nurses in Ethiopia. Thus, the finding of this study will help to address health problems resulting from ankle–foot pain among nurses.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of ankle–s–foot pain among nurse working in Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Tigray, Ethiopia.

Patients and Methods

An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 366 nurses, and a simple random sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. Data were collected by using a self-administered adapted standardized Nordic questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and a bivariate logistic regression model were done to identify factors associated with ankle–foot pain. Those variables with a P -value less than 0.05 with 95% CI in multivariate model were taken as statistically significant. Finally, AOR with 95% confidence interval at a P -value of < 0.05 was reported.

Results

The prevalence of self-reported ankle–foot pain among nurses was 43.7% (95% CI = 38.5–49.1). Older age (AOR = 7.669, 95% CI = 2.316−25.390), low shoe comfort (AOR = 4.215, 95% CI = 2.031–8.745), multiple foot conditions (AOR = 6.102 95% CI = 1.959–19.008), working night shifts (AOR = 2.047, 95% CI = 1.098−3.816), high physical demand (AOR = 3.487, 95% CI = 1.988–6.116), and nurses working in the intensive care unit (AOR = 2.402, 95% CI = 1.219–4.732) showed a statistically significant association with ankle–foot pain.

Conclusion

This study indicated that the prevalence of ankle–foot pain is commonly reported among nurses working in Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Therefore, awareness and prevention of ankle and foot pain in nurses should be prioritized to reducing risk factors. Nurses should give attention to comfortable footwear, and further longitudinal research is recommended.

### A review of the injuries caused by occupational footwear [^88464609]. Occupational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Occupational footwear provides protection to the foot from undesirable external stimuli. To prevent injuries in the work environment, many workers are required to wear occupational footwear for approximately 8 hours, 5 days a week, which means that a variety of designs in this type of footwear are required to meet the standards demanded. Certain occupations operate in particularly hazardous environments such as the construction industry, underground mining, law enforcement agencies, firefighters and military personnel. Due to these particularly hazardous environments, occupational footwear is the common component of all occupational personal protective equipment (PPE). Occupational footwear consists of boots, shoes and clogs that are made of a variety of materials suited to each job, and even their manufacturing may vary within occupations depending on the tasks to cover.

### Prevalence and associated factors of ankle-foot pain among nurses working in surgical units of comprehensive specialized hospitals in amhara regional state, northwest Ethiopia, 2022 [^a4e13403]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and Recommendations

The current study showed that more than half of nurses who work in surgical units had ankle-foot pain, in the preceding 12 months. More years of work experience, working more hours per week, prolonged standing, high physical job demand, and low job control had a statistically significant association with ankle-foot pain. Health system administrators were recommended to consider reducing nurses' exposure to job demands because these are the unavoidable nature of nursing jobs. They also need to consider expanding nurses' ability to exert their influence over their working environment. Further, nursing leaders should support workplace environments that prevent working more than the recommended hours per week. Nursing staff should prioritize wearing supportive shoes, moving around whenever possible, and elevating their feet during breaks as preventive measures to reduce ankle-foot pain. Future researchers were recommended to conduct prospective studies to provide more reliable evidence about ankle-foot pain.

### Correlates of night-time and exercise-associated lower limb cramps in healthy adults [^f103fb68]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

We explored correlates of night-time and exercise-associated lower limb cramps in participants of the 1000 Norms Project.

Methods

A volunteer community sample of healthy people aged ≥ 18y underwent assessment of motor function and physical performance, and were questioned about muscle cramps in the previous 3 mo.

Results

Of 491 (221 female) participants age 18-101y (mean: 59.12; SD: 18.03), about 1 in 3 experienced night-time lower limb cramps, and about 1 in 4 experienced exercise-associated lower limb cramps. For night-cramps, a one unit increase in Beighton score (greater whole-body flexibility) was associated with a 31% reduced odds of cramps (odds ratio [OR] = 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.45, 0.99) and passing all three lesser-toe strength tests was associated with 50% reduced odds of cramps (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.78). For exercise-associated cramps, participants in the fourth (lowest arch) quartile of Foot Posture Index were 2.1 times (95% CI: 1.11, 3.95) more likely to experience cramps than participants in the first (highest arch) quartile. Odds of experiencing both types of cramps versus no cramps were lower with passing all three lesser-toe strength tests (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.85) and better performance in the six-minute walk test (OR = 0.997, 95% CI: 0.996, 0.998).

Discussion

People who experienced both exercise-associated and night-time cramps were less functional. The association between night-time cramps with less whole-body flexibility and reduced lesser-toe flexor strength should be explored to determine causation. Planovalgus (low-arched) foot type was independently associated with exercise-associated cramps. The effectiveness of foot orthoses for secondary prevention of exercise-associated cramps in people with low-arched feet should be explored.

### Ankle and foot pain and associated factors among nurses at ayder comprehensive specialized hospital, mekelle, Ethiopia: cross-sectional study [^956b0d32]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

This study revealed that nurses who had reported two or more foot conditions were 6-times more likely to develop ankle/foot pain than those who had no foot condition. The findings of this study were consistent with a study done in Australia which showed that nurses having two or more foot conditions were 5.59-times more likely to develop ankle/foot pain than those who had no foot condition. This could be as foot conditions like flat foot, bunions, toe deformities, high arches, callous/corn, and heel spur have been associated with ankle/foot pain and this foot condition is a contributing factor for poor foot posture, gait instability, uneven weight distribution, and poor balance, which leads to ankle–foot pain.

This study showed that nurses who had high physical demand were 3.48-times more likely to develop ankle/foot pain than those who had low physical demand. This study finding agreed with two different studies done in Iran. This could be as both studies use a simple random sampling method and the same study design. Similarly, a study conducted in Japan indicated that nurses having high physical exertion were statistically correlated with ankle–foot pain. The possible explanation might be that nurses who have high physical demand will have high mechanical stress on the ankle–foot region and this could cause strain in the ankle and foot area, which leads to the development of ankle–foot pain. Nurses who were working in the ICU/OR were reported to be 2-times more likely to develop ankle–foot pain compared to those working in ward, Emergency unit, and OPD. This study agreed with a study done in Australia. This could be that nurses working in the OR/ICU are exposed to working in a prolonged fixed standing position for long durations, which might cause them to be unpleasant, with swelling, numbness, and more mechanical stress than others. This could lead to the development of ankle–foot pain. In this study, other work-related factors revealed that nurses who were working a night shift were 2-times more likely to develop ankle/foot pain than those who were not working a night shift (AOR = 2.047; 95% CI = 1.098–3.816, P = 0.024). This study finding is in line with a study conducted in Korea which indicated that nurses working a night shift were associated with ankle-foot pain. This may be due to the fact that nurses working the night shift may not get enough rest time and have a high work load, which might lead them to develop ankle–foot pain. On the contrary, a study conducted in Japan indicated nurses working the night shift were not associated with ankle–foot pain. This could be nurses working in Japan may takes enough snaps, and have a low work load and good working conditions.

### Differences in adherence to using removable cast walker treatment during daytime and nighttime weight-bearing activities in people with diabetes-related foot ulcers [^c80d5fdd]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Although we found higher adherence levels to wearing RCWs during the daytime, daytime non-adherence still presents a major challenge to unoffloaded (or 'unprotected') activity considering the significantly higher weight-bearing activity recorded during the daytime in comparison with nighttime. This means while patients may have higher adherence during the daytime, they also have higher rates of activity during the daytime, and thus a higher total load of unprotected steps during the daytime which likely results in more overall repetitive plantar tissue stress on the DFU during the daytime than during the nighttime. Thus, clinicians should consider both the different levels of weight-bearing activity along with adherence during the daytime and nighttime.

The factors we found associated with lower daytime adherence were, perhaps unsurprisingly, similar to the factors we originally found associated with overall adherence, as the majority of overall weight-bearing activity was performed during the daytime. Factors associated with lower adherence during daytime included male gender, longer diabetes duration, not having PAD and perceived heavier RCW. As per our original study, we hypothesise that this may be because males tend to perform fewer self-care activities than females, such as adhering to treatment, and people with longer diabetes duration are likely to have to adhere to more self-care activities due to a more complex burden of diabetes, PAD may be indicative of more severe plantar DFU cases (and pain) that is likely to result in more benefit when adhering to RCW treatments, and heavier RCWs are likely to be more challenging to use.

### A review of the injuries caused by occupational footwear [^852cbb1f]. Occupational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Occupational footwear is intended to provide protection against the risks associated with work activities. The choice of footwear is complex due to the welfare, health and safety conditions of workers.

Aims

To identify the injuries and problems caused by occupational footwear through a systematic review of the existing literature.

Methods

A literature search was carried out in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Dialnet Plus, Pubmed, Scientific Electronic Library Online, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science databases over the period 2000–23, following the PRISMA Declaration guidelines.

Results

A total of 27 studies were included in the review. The results indicated that there is a wide variety of injuries caused by occupational footwear: from dermal injuries (e.g. calluses) and injuries to the nail apparatus to inflammatory pathologies such as plantar fasciitis or bursitis. In addition, inappropriate footwear can cause pain in the ankle and foot, knees, hips and lower back. Other results include the discomfort derived from the footwear itself.

Conclusions

Inappropriate footwear can cause injuries to the foot and other related bone structures. Further studies are needed on the detection of foot injuries caused by occupational footwear and the levels of action at this level to improve the worker's health, the adaptability of the footwear to the wearer, and the worker's comfort and adherence to the footwear.

### Risk factors for foot and ankle disorders among assembly plant workers [^24166a52]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Jobs that necessitate prolonged standing and walking activities are commonly associated with worker's complaints of foot and ankle pain. The objective of this study was to determine the relative contributions of work activity (time spent standing, walking, or sitting), floor surface characteristics, weight, BMI, age, foot biomechanics, and other demographic and medical history factors to the prevalence of foot and ankle disorders.

Methods

A cross-sectional observational study design was used to evaluate employees of an engine manufacturing plant. The main outcome variable was foot or ankle disorders defined by pain and a positive physical examination. The independent variables included baseline demographics, medical history, ergonomic exposures, psychosocial factors, shoe characteristics and foot biomechanics.

Results

Twenty-four percent of the cohort met the case definition of foot/ankle disorder with 10% defined as new cases. Fifty-two percent had symptoms of foot/ankle. An increased risk of presenting with foot/ankle disorders was associated with high metatarsal pressure on gait assessment, increased time spent walking, female gender, reported high job dissatisfaction, a history of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis or vascular disorder. For the truck/forklift drivers, an increased number of times getting in and out of the vehicle was associated with a higher prevalence of ankle/foot problems.

Conclusions

An increased risk is associated with higher metatarsal pressure and increased time spent walking. These findings suggest several options for primary and secondary prevention strategies. The use of shoe orthoses with a medial longitudinal arch and metatarsal pad as well as including optional sit/stand workstations may be helpful.

### Programme for prevention of foot dermatoses in patients with work-related skin diseases: follow-up data of a prospective cohort study (OCCUPES) [^5284e684]. Contact Dermatitis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A programme based on health education has been developed to prevent foot dermatoses (FD) in patients with work-related skin diseases (WRSD).

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of the programme in a prospective cohort study (OCCUPES).

Methods

Six and 12months after completing the programme, follow-up questionnaires were sent to 231 patients with WRSD and FD. Assessments included occupational footwear and foot care, self-reported disease course, and health-related quality of life.

Results

Response to follow-ups was > 70%. Wearing functional socks and changing footwear and socks during one work shift increased (all p < 0.001). Complaints about occupational footwear decreased, including sweating and exposure to moisture/wetness. More than 60% reported improved FD while quality of life significantly increased. After 12months, all foot symptoms were less frequent, including itch (p = 0.009), pain when walking (p = 0.005), pain in rest (p = 0.015) and smell (p = 0.001). The programme received very good ratings by the participants.

Conclusions

The intervention was effective in improving occupational footwear, foot care and preventive behaviour. It resulted in a reduced burden of FD and should be implemented in the general care of patients with WRSD.

### Ankle and foot pain and associated factors among nurses at ayder comprehensive specialized hospital, mekelle, Ethiopia: cross-sectional study [^9178c5ce]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The findings of this study show that ankle–foot pain is a common health problem among nurses in Ethiopia. The results of the present study show that ankle–foot pain among nurses has a significant correlation with being old age, poor shoe comfort, having multiple underlying foot conditions, high physical demand, and work-related factors like nurses working in the ICU/OR, found to be independently associated with ankle–foot pain. This may lead to a negative impact on nursing care practice and their work performance. Nurses are recommended to give attention to comfortable footwear, keep their ankle/foot health, and further longitudinal researches with objective measurements is recommended.

### WITHDRAWN. interventions for treating plantar heel pain [^575eb15b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Ten percent of people may experience pain under the heel (plantar heel pain) at some time. Injections, insoles, heel pads, strapping and surgery have been common forms of treatment offered. The absolute and relative effectiveness of these interventions are poorly understood.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to identify and evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of treatments for plantar heel pain.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group specialised register (September 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2002), EMBASE (1988 to September 2002) and reference lists of articles and dissertations. Four podiatry journals were handsearched to 1998. We contacted all UK schools of podiatry to identify dissertations on the management of heel pain, and investigators in the field to identify unpublished data or research in progress. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of interventions for plantar heel pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently evaluated randomised controlled trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed trial quality. Additional information was obtained by direct contact with investigators. No poolable data were identified. Where measures of variance were available we have calculated the weighted mean differences based on visual analogue scale (VAS) scores.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised trials involving 1626 participants were included. Trial quality was generally poor, and pooling of data was not conducted. All trials measured heel pain as the primary outcome. Seven trials evaluated interventions against placebo/dummy or no treatment. There was limited evidence for the effectiveness of topical corticosteroid administered by iontophoresis, i.e. using an electric current, in reducing pain. There was some evidence for the effectiveness of injected corticosteroid providing temporary relief of pain. There was conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of low energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy in reducing night pain, resting pain and pressure pain in the short term (6 and 12 weeks) and therefore its effectiveness remains equivocal. In individuals with chronic pain (longer than six months), there was limited evidence for the effectiveness of dorsiflexion night splints in reducing pain. There was no evidence to support the effectiveness of therapeutic ultrasound, low-intensity laser therapy, exposure to an electron generating device or insoles with magnetic foil. No randomised trials evaluating surgery, or radiotherapy against a randomly allocated control population were identified. There was limited evidence for the superiority of corticosteroid injections over orthotic devices.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of local corticosteroid therapy, the effectiveness of other frequently employed treatments in altering the clinical course of plantar heel pain has not been established in randomised controlled trials. At the moment there is limited evidence upon which to base clinical practice. Treatments that are used to reduce heel pain seem to bring only marginal gains over no treatment and control therapies such as stretching exercises. Steroid injections are a popular method of treating the condition but only seem to be useful in the short term and only to a small degree. Orthoses should be cautiously prescribed for those patients who stand for long periods; there is limited evidence that stretching exercises and heel pads are associated with better outcomes than custom made orthoses in people who stand for more than eight hours per day. Well designed and conducted randomised trials are required.

### The prevalence and factors associated with musculoskeletal pain among pilgrims during the hajj [^526ca24e]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In the present study, the most common site of musculoskeletal pain was the ankle/foot (38.34%), with a prevalence higher than that identified in most other studies. While some studies reported higher rates of ankle/foot pain among some specific populations, such as nurses (43.8%)and housekeeping staff (58.3–60.4%), most studies reported lower rates of ankle/foot pain, with a prevalence lower than 20% in the general population or in specific populations such as nursing assistants, occupational drivers, construction workers, agricultural farmers and marathon runners., There are possible explanations why our study showed a higher prevalence of ankle/foot pain among pilgrims. One is that the Hajj is highly physically demanding. Pilgrims move long distances, generally by foot, which may exceed their typical physical activity levels., Several studies have documented an association between jobs or activities/tasks with high physical demands and musculoskeletal pain in different populations. For example, individuals who walk for long distancesor primarily work while standing and for longer periods of time, as well as those who are exposed to high physical workloadshave an increased risk of musculoskeletal pain, particularly in the lower limbs. Another possible explanation could be related to the use of poorly fitting footwear/shoes among pilgrims, which may not be suitable to wear during the Hajj. Multiple studies have shown that poorly and incorrectly fitting shoes are significantly associated with ankle and foot pain, implying the importance of using properly fitting footwear. Therefore, pilgrims are at a higher risk of developing musculoskeletal pain, especially pain in the ankle/foot.

### Slip-resistant footwear reduces slips among national health service workers in england: a randomised controlled trial [^057173ac]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted in Stata V.15 (StataCorp, 4905 Lakeway Drive, College Station, Texas 77845, USA), following the principles of intention-to-treat analysing participants in the groups to which they were originally assigned regardless of compliance (or not) with allocation, using two-sided significance of 0.05. The follow-up period for all participants commenced on the date of randomisation and lasted a maximum of 14 weeks; therefore, for intervention participants, this often included some weeks at the start when they had not yet received their shoes. For the primary analysis of the incidence rate of slips, a mixed-effects negative binomial model was used adjusting for gender, job role and baseline weekly slip rate as fixed effects and site as a random effect. The model took account of the number of weeks for which slip data were provided and the total hours worked during those weeks. The person-working-hours were calculated by multiplying the number of weeks for which the participant provided slip data by the average number of hours they told us they tended to work in a week. We assumed participants were working in the weeks for which they provided data. The primary analysis was undertaken by CF and checked by GF. Complier average causal effect (CACE) analyses were undertaken for the primary outcome to account for the number of weeks participants had their shoes and the amount of time they reported wearing them.

The incidence rate of falls (both resulting and not resulting from a slip) over 14 weeks was analysed in the same way as the primary outcome. Mixed-effects logistic regression adjusted as for the primary analysis was used to compare, between the two groups, the proportions of participants who: (1) slipped at least once over 14 weeks; and (2) fell at least once over 14 weeks. The time from randomisation to first slip was analysed by Cox proportional hazards regression. Proportion of participants reporting a fracture and time to first fall were summarised descriptively but not formally analysed due to the small number of events.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 8 travel for work and other reasons [^9869bc35]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Adventure travel health and safety tips — wilderness clothing and footwear recommendations specify that clothing helps prevent heat and cold illness, as well as bites and stings from insects and other arthropods. Cold weather clothing should be made of Merino wool, nylon, polyester, or, in cold, dry weather, down, and layering typically consists of a base layer, insulating layers, and a windproof, waterproof outer layer of tightly woven nylon with a durable water-repellent coating. For hot weather, sun- and insect-protective clothing is important, long-sleeved shirts and long pants offer the most protection, a bandana or buff, a sun shirt with a hood, and a wide-brim sun hat should be used to protect the head and neck; sunglasses are necessary to protect the eyes. Clothing should be sprayed with permethrin to repel insects and other arthropods, and footwear should be activity-specific boots or shoes; advise travelers to never go without footwear because even a minor foot injury can be debilitating.

Therefore, identifying the injuries and pathologies that can occur in the foot due to the use of occupational footwear or footwear for professional use and its suitability is of utmost interest to prevent these lesions, as well as to avoid discontinuing the use of such footwear. Similarly, it is important to review current field studies to verify the existing scientific evidence. Thus the aim of the present review was to identify the injuries and pathologies caused by occupational footwear among the working population.

### Slip-resistant footwear reduces slips among national health service workers in england: a randomised controlled trial [^2d958e66]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were inducted into the trial with a welcome text message followed by a pre-randomisation 'run-in' period of data collection in the form of weekly text messages, for up to 6 weeks, requesting data on slips at work in the previous week. The purpose of the 'run-in' period was twofold: to provide a baseline slip rate; and to assess for engagement with the text message data collection process. By only randomising participants who provided slip data for at least 2 weeks, we hoped to maximise response to the post-randomisation outcome texts. Participants were randomised 1:1 to either be offered and provided with a pair of 5* GRIP-rated slip-resistant shoes or asked to wear their usual work shoes. Randomisation was through the University of York, York Trials Unit (YTU) secure, remote, web-based randomisation service. The allocation sequence was generated by an independent data systems manager at YTU, who was not involved in the recruitment of participants. Sites informed YTU when they had capacity to order and deliver footwear. Block randomisation, stratified by trust, was used. The block size varied and was equal to the number of participants to be randomised in each batch, which was determined by site capacity (range 2 to 335, median 14). Participants and members of the study team including the statistician, health economist and those involved in the administration of the study were not masked to treatment allocation.

### A structural equation modelling approach examining the pathways between safety climate, behaviour performance and workplace slipping [^218b7eec]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Although our prospective assessment of safety climate allows us to better analyse its effects on workplace slips, we only analysed this relationship in a single direction. Our weekly data collection did not continuously assess safety climate. We also did not attempt to model the effects of slipping history on safety climate. Aside from difficulties in measuring rates of prior slips and/or injuries in their current job, we would have to ignore potential recall bias on historical slips that could vary with job tenure. Beus et al found that time-since-prior-event did not mediate the effects of previous injury on safety climate score. So while we could not model the effects of prior slips and injuries on safety climate, according to Beus et al, these prior events already affect individual safety climate scores.

We also did not follow-up on shoe wearing behaviour. Therefore, we had to assume that the shoes that workers were wearing at the initial interview would be the shoes that they would wear for the entire follow-up period. At baseline, over 90% of the participants reported wearing the same pair of shoes every day at work. Because the study was not designed to monitor shoe-wearing for each employee, we examined initial shoe wear as an intent-to-treat analysis. Because 90% of participants said they wore the same shoes to work every day, we anticipated that their shoes at baseline, either slip resistant or not, would be what they wore during the entire study period. Since no gold standard for 'slip resistance' exists for the shoes we examined in the study, it is likely that some slip-resistant shoes were more effective at deterring slips than others. Further investigation of shoe type and slips is warranted.

### Epidemiology of posterior heel pain in the general population: cross-sectional findings from the clinical assessment study of the foot [^f2fae7a8]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Associations of posterior HP

The association of posterior HP with the following factors was assessed: age, sex, body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2), individual occupational class, neighborhood deprivation quartile (NDQ), physical activity level, heel height, and diabetes mellitus. Age was categorized as 50–64 years, 65–74 years, and ≥ 75 years. BMI was calculated from self‐reported height and weight, and categorized as < 25.0, 25.0–29.9, 30.0–34.9, or ≥ 35.0. Sex and diabetes mellitus were self‐reported in the Health Survey questionnaire. Respondents were asked to report their current or most recent job title. Individual occupational class was then ranked using the UK Office for National Statistics 3‐tier socioeconomic classification: 1) higher managerial, administrative, and professional occupations, 2) intermediate occupations, or 3) routine and manual occupations 17. A fourth category, "other," was used to encompass housewives, nonworkers, retired people, and inadequately described responses, and was excluded from analysis. The NDQ was calculated from the respondent's Index of Deprivation score, derived from the respondent's post code using UK Government Department for Communities and Local Government data. The indices of deprivation are used as a relative measure of deprivation for an area in England, and are generated from 38 indicators, grouped into 7 domains that represent different aspects of deprivation. These include income, employment, health, education, crime, access to services, and living environment. An area is assigned a deprivation score from these domains, with deprivation decreasing with an increasing score, and respondents were categorized into quartiles using this score for their area 18. Physical activity was assessed using the short form International Physical Activity Questionnaire, a validated 4‐item construct that assesses physical activity levels over the previous 7 days 19. The construct contains questions such as "During the last 7 days, on how many days did you walk for at least 10 minutes at a time?" Respondents were categorized into tertiles corresponding to low, medium, and high physical activity groups. Heel height use was assessed in female respondents using shoe diagrams depicting 4 different heel heights 14. Respondents were asked to indicate which picture showed the height of the heel they wore most of the time in different decades of their life. High‐heel exposure was defined as a participant selecting either of the pictures depicting the 2 highest heels as that worn on most days for at least one 10‐year period between 20 and 49 years.

### A review of the injuries caused by occupational footwear [^69b271a0]. Occupational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, the most common injuries caused by occupational footwear are lower back pain, hip pain, knee pain and foot pain. Nail pathologies, calluses, dry skin, tinea pedis and allergic reactions can also be found among other dermal foot pathologies. Other pathologies such as muscle cramps, plantar fasciitis, metatarsalgia, heel bursitis, bone spurs, hammertoes or Achilles tendonitis should also be mentioned.

Workers reported that their occupational footwear was uncomfortable, heavy, hot and did not fit their feet. Most of the authors attributed this problem to the lack of training in occupational risk prevention for the worker when choosing suitable footwear, but action is also considered at the level of the choice of occupational footwear for the worker.

Literature on occupational footwear focuses on the risk of falls at the same level by improving slip-resistant soles of the footwear, but much more research is needed along the lines of the injuries described above to improve occupational footwear. This improvement will be easier to achieve, thanks to the adaptation of European regulations in the near future.

In short, further studies should be carried out on the detection of foot injuries due to occupational footwear and the levels of action at this level to improve the health of the worker, the adaptation of occupational footwear to the user, its comfort and the adherence of the worker to the footwear.

### Are habitually barefoot children compelled to wear ill-fitting school shoes? A cross-sectional study [^3fa8373b]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Most notable external factors influencing the development of the pediatric foot are climate, socio-economic status and shoe-wearing habits. For example, growing up barefoot, compared to growing up shod, influences pediatric foot arch morphology, foot pliability, the hallux valgus angle, rearfoot strike patterns and motor performance. Shoes have been identified as an external factor that could significantly influence foot development, as well as gait in children.

Forefoot movement patterns are also significantly influenced by shoes. Compared to barefoot walking, increased rearfoot strike patterns and knee and ankle range of motion, as well as longer steps, but reduced foot movements, swing phase leg speed and shock absorption, were reported in children wearing shoes. Although shoes should primarily protect the foot from the external environment, they should still allow the foot to develop and function optimally. The impact of shoes on developing feet is illustrated by the fact that shoes are often used to treat foot deformities and certain musculoskeletal injuries. Therefore, it is important that shoes are developed to fit properly, and not to interfere with the development of the pediatric foot.

Ill-fitting shoes have been associated with foot deformities such as hallux valgus and hammertoes, as well as heel spurs, plantar fasciitis, foot ulcerations and foot arthritis. These foot problems can lead to changes in the biomechanical alignment of the body and impact on load transfer during walking, causing other musculoskeletal conditions and pain, such as knee osteoarthritis and low back pain. It has been recommended that the fitting of shoes, as well as shoe characteristics, should be considered by health professionals when treating patients with musculoskeletal injuries. Large portions of adults and children in Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom and South Africa are wearing ill-fitting shoes, with associated pain and foot pathology. Previous research, mostly in adult populations, have shown that 46–81% of participants wore shoes that were too narrow for their feet. Most comprehensive studies have been done on adult feet and adult shoe design and not the pediatric population.

### "Somebody to say' come on we can sort this' ": a qualitative study of primary care consultation among older adults with symptomatic foot osteoarthritis [^1072565d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

While Bobby experienced a loss of self-respect as a worker, Julie believed foot pain impacted her ability to socialize and maintain her everyday responsibilities.

Among some of the women interviewed, footwear and appearance were important elements of a desirable self-image, particularly being young and able-bodied:

"I think about them all the time, because when I'm going out, I think 'do my bunions stick out, do my shoes look alright'.I'd love to wear strappy sandals and your flip flops and all that sort of thing, but I never would" (Emily).

"I've always maintained I want to be fashionable and everything. Even at my age I like to look nice and it's nice to wear nice things and nice shoes" (Janet).

These quotes illustrate that Emily and Janet shared similar experiences; while one person was self-conscious, the other enjoyed remaining fashionable. This suggests that conflicting feelings toward footwear may need to be managed in relation to pain, function, and a desirable or acceptable self-presentation. Although the importance of footwear selection did not emerge for men, for some men, foot pain still impacted their self-presentation: "I don't like limping… I think it don't look nice" (Stan).

Attempts to self-manage painful foot symptoms were often described in conjunction with other health concerns such as pain at other joint sites and comorbid conditions: "It's all connected" (Janet). "It's not continuous in one part, it's all over" (Bobby). These other health concerns may take precedence in terms of the decisions made to consult a GP. Altering daily activities with foot pain was often evaluated in terms of overall health concerns and lifestyle, as the following quote from Janet shows:

### Does policy that provides choice in athletic footwear affect musculoskeletal injury risk in US coast guard recruits? [^b95b553e]. BMJ Military Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Musculoskeletal injuries (MSKIs) are ubiquitous during initial entry military training, with overuse injuries the most common. A common injury mechanism is running, an activity that is integral to US Coast Guard (USCG) training and a requirement for graduation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a policy that allowed for athletic footwear choice on risk of lower quarter MSKI in USCG recruits.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed that included 1230 recruits (1040 men, 190 women) who trained under a policy that allowed self-selection of athletic footwear and 2951 recruits (2329 men, 622 women) who trained under a policy that mandated use of prescribed uniform athletic shoes and served as controls. Demographic data and physical performance were derived from administrative records. Injury data were abstracted from a medical tracking database. Unadjusted risk calculations and multivariable logistic regression assessing the effects of group, age, sex, height, body mass and 2.4km run times on MSKI were performed.

Results

Ankle-foot, leg, knee and lumbopelvic-hip complex injuries were ubiquitous in both groups (experimental: 13.13 per 1000 person-weeks; control: 11.69 per 1000 person-weeks). Group was not a significant factor for any of the injuries assessed in either the unadjusted or adjusted analysis, despite widespread reports of pain (58.6%), perceived injury attribution (15.7%), perceived deleterious effect on performance (25.3%), general dissatisfaction (46.3%) and intended discontinuance of use following graduation (87.7%).

Conclusion

MSKI continues to be a major source of morbidity in the recruit training population. The policy that allowed USCG recruits to self-select athletic footwear did not decrease or increase the risk of MSKI. While regulations pertaining to footwear choice did not influence injury outcomes, there was general dissatisfaction with the prescribed uniform athletic footwear conveyed by the recruits and widespread reports of discomfort, perceived deleterious effects from wear and intended discontinued use following training completion.

### Arthritis, foot pain and shoe wear: current musculoskeletal research on feet [^6dd4dd5c]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Both arthritis and foot pain are major public health problems. Approximately 24% of adults have foot ailments, and the prevalence increases with age. Foot pain, particularly related to shoes, footwear and rheumatic disorders, may be an important modifiable factor. Surprisingly, this topic has received little attention in the rheumatology community.

Recent Findings

Despite the major focus of structure and alignment in arthritis, remarkably little work has focused on the foot and nonsurgical foot interventions that might affect lower extremity joint alignment, structure and pain in rheumatic diseases. Emerging research suggests that there may be a significant role for foot orthotics and footwear in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis of the hip, knee and foot. This review highlights the current understanding on the topic of foot orthotics and footwear in adults with rheumatic diseases.

Summary

Biomechanical evidence indicates that foot orthotics and specialized footwear may change muscle activation and gait patterns to reduce joint loading. Emerging evidence suggests that orthotics, specific shoe types and footwear interventions may provide an effective nonsurgical intervention in rheumatic diseases. Yet good data are sparse, and it is premature to recommend guidelines. As there are a limited number of studies that underpin the foot's role in arthritis cause and progression, clinical trials and prospective studies are of utmost importance to unravel the links between foot pain, foot conditions and interventions that lessen the impact of rheumatic diseases.

### Systematic review: plantar fasciitis and prolonged weight bearing [^32e84be4]. Occupational Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Plantar fasciitis (PF) is one of the most common causes of foot pain. Work can involve factors that may predispose to foot pain.

Aims

To systematically review the evidence of the association between weight bearing (walking or standing) and PF among workers.

Methods

Literature search of relevant indexing databases from inception to May 2012, grey literature, websites of relevant organizations and reference lists for all identified articles. Two reviewers independently selected studies for full review, assessed methodological quality and graded evidence. Findings were summarized qualitatively.

Results

Four studies were included; all were assessed as high or unclear risk of bias. Three studies were case-control studies; two used clinic populations and one used volunteers. The other study was cross-sectional involving the workforce of an assembly plant. A number of associations between PF and risk factors were identified including sex, obesity, foot biomechanics and job factors (e.g. job tenure). Two case-control studies and the cross-sectional study found an association with weight bearing, but the assessment of weight bearing varied (e.g. time on feet, time walking or standing). There was low-quality evidence to confirm a causal relationship (Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) * grade).

Conclusions

This systematic review found low-quality evidence of an association between PF and weight-bearing tasks such as walking and standing on hard surfaces. The only occupations specifically identified as having higher risk were those associated with the engine assembly plant. Further research is required to fully determine the association between weight bearing and PF.

### Hyaluronic acid filler injections under the metatarsal heads provide a significant and long-lasting improvement in metatarsalgia from wearing high-heeled shoes [^4b161d24]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

All study subjects were regular wearers of high-heeled shoes who experienced pain during their daily activities while wearing high-heeled shoes before receiving the study treatment. At baseline, all subjects had the valgus foot and most subjects (86.7%) had at least 1 foot that was pes cavus. Valgus foot (pes valgus pronated foot) deformity is a condition in which the bone segment distal to a joint is angled outward, away from the midline of the body. Pes cavus is a descriptive term for a foot morphology characterized by high arch of the foot that can cause increased weight bearing for the metatarsal heads and associated metatarsalgia and callosities.

At 3 months after a single-injection session comprising an average of 6.2 injections and totaling 1.3 mL of HA filler for both feet, one-third of subjects reported no pain at all and this was maintained at 6 months after injections. Furthermore, even for those subjects still experiencing pain while wearing high-heeled shoes at 6 months after injections, there was a statistically significant reduction in pain (at onset and at shoe removal) and significant increase in mean total time of wearing high-heeled shoes (7.2 hours vs 3.4 hours at baseline).

Furthermore, relieving the pressure under the metatarsal heads by cushioning with HA filler injections led to a reduction in the number and severity of calluses with the mean number of callosities per subject decreasing from 1.9 at baseline to 1.0 at Month 6, by which time no subject had Grade 3 callosities. There can be multiple causative factors that lead to the development of metatarsalgia. One or more of the metatarsal heads may become painful and/or inflamed, usually because of excessive pressure from poorly fitting footwear, such as high-heeled shoes and other restrictive footwear, as well as atrophy of the metatarsal fat pad. Although corns and calluses are not usually a cause of metatarsalgia, the repeated friction and pressure that caused the metatarsalgia can also lead to the development of callosities, which are relatively thick, toughened areas of skin that may become painful after an extended period. Hence, it may be expected that by treating the metatarsalgia with filler injections and thus eliminating the source of friction or pressure, the callosities would also disappear.

### A review of the injuries caused by occupational footwear [^04cd4c8d]. Occupational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to identify the injuries and problems caused by occupational footwear. In this case, several alterations have been found as a result of their use such as plantar fasciitis, metatarsalgia, heel bursitis, bone spurs and Achilles tendonitis, with the main causes being inadequate self-care. Other authors identified the problem at the level of comfort associated with the footwear as both personal and psychological factors, requiring an individual and personal approach to the worker to study them. In fact, the same injuries are observed in jobs belonging to different sectors with problems related to the physical and technical specificities of the footwear used for each workstation. This could be explained by the fact that occupational footwear has a series of common characteristics (closed, with laces, with insoles, that support the weight of the worker, among others) and specific characteristics for each job (reinforced toecap, lightweight, puncture-proof soles, etc.)

On the other hand, podiatric problems, foot pain and the comfort of occupational footwear were not the only factors studied. Other factors such as foot temperature, impaired balance, gait and stability of the individual, performance with respect to the required tasks, and possible allergies to footwear materials may be relevant when it comes to favouring injuries or decreasing comfort. Similarly, the context in which each job was carried out also had an influence. In fact, the study by Rivas-López et al. concluded that offshore workers had a higher rate of fractures and need for pharmacological treatment than onshore workers. Along the same lines, a study carried out on 10 workers on a farm revealed other types of injuries such as crushing of the foot by large animals or snake bites to the worker's foot.

### Diabetic neuropathy collection: introduction to diabetic neuropathy [^8c69c3f8]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

VG: What kind of information should people suffering with diabetic neuropathy be given?

UA: We should really be educating patients on all aspects of diabetic neuropathy, so this includes the importance of glycaemic control in addition to improving the cardiovascular risk co-factors. In the early stages of diabetes it is really important to try to achieve good control of glycaemia and also to modify any risk factors. Importantly we should be telling people to stop smoking [if they smoke], and if people do have diabetic neuropathy and subsequently have symptoms of pain then they do need to be informed that we are unlikely to achieve 100% pain relief with any treatment; at best what we are aiming for is 50% pain relief. But as a part of our consultation we should be counselling patients in regards to all of these varying factors.

VG: Is there anything that we can do to prevent neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers?

UA: That's an excellent question. So diabetic neuropathy is the strongest risk factor for foot ulceration and amputation in people with diabetes. As a rule of thumb, those individuals that do have diabetic neuropathy, more so particularly those that have severe neuropathy, need to undergo daily foot examinations. Those that have insensate feet and a lack of sensation really need to emphasize the importance of foot care and protection, i.e. not to walk barefoot. They need to consider how they trim their toenails and to do this with great care and actually have podiatry input for this, and of course think about foot hygiene and look out for any kind of infection in the feet. And again, another really important aspect is the need for wearing well-fitted shoes and not to wear sort of hard-soled shoes where they are walking long distances in this, and of course there is trying to gain advice on footwear early on.

### Preventing needless work disability by helping people stay employed [^62e44d15]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Adopt a disability prevention model — increase awareness of how rarely disability is medically required emphasizes that only a small fraction of medically excused days off work is medically required, and that the remaining days off work result from nonmedical factors such as administrative delays of treatment and specialty referral, lack of transitional work, ineffective communications, lax management, and logistic problems; it notes that absence from work is "excused" and benefits are generally awarded based on a physician's decision confirming that a medical condition exists, which implies that a diagnosis creates disability; from a strictly medical point of view, people can generally work at something productive as soon as there is no specific medical condition to keep them from working, with examples that an employee with a cast on the right foot cannot drive a forklift but can perform other tasks until the cast is removed, and that a person recovering from surgery may not be able to work a full day in the office but could work half days; the text adds that people often get short term disability benefits because employers do not take advantage of available work capacity.

Comfort (tolerance) — temporary use after new symptoms, not chronic — Although temporary restrictions for new symptoms such as pain, numbness, and fatigue may be appropriate for a few days or weeks after the onset of an injury or illness, they are often not medically appropriate or necessary for chronic symptoms of this type. After an adequate work-up, and when treatment is in the setting of degenerative or soft tissue conditions, or inflammatory symptoms of pain and fatigue unaccompanied by corresponding objective findings, complaints need not be interpreted as ongoing warning signs of medical risk, and it can be helpful to educate patients about the distinction between hurt and harm.

### Voices that may not otherwise be heard: a qualitative exploration into the perspectives of primary care patients living with chronic pain [^296a5222]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Pain effect on activities of daily living

A photograph showing a pair of high-heeled shoes elicited talk about limitations concerning one's social life, activities, and hobbies. Concurrently, a patient mentioned that pain not only impedes what you do for fun but also inhibits performance at your job. The following quotations reveal some of the feelings that were expressed concerning these life changes: "Now, let me explain to you the reasoning in that… Prior to my chronic pain, I was rocking them heels. On a constant basis, so my closet is like full of those. Now, they're full of K-Swiss and Nikes. You know, my cousin is like, 'Yeah go get those heels, come wear them'.I can't. So, I try to put them on and try to be cute and before long, the flip-flops or the tennis shoes are on." And: "I'm a cook at a nursing home. I cook for 200 people, and that big pan there – I handle some pretty heavy duty stuff. It's wearin' and tearin' my hands up, but I'm too young to retire. I don't want to retire, I want to work. I have to find solutions for myself. I wrote my supervisor and she got me this three-tiered cart so when I lift up heavy pots and pans, I put them on the cart instead of carrying them. So that helps a lot."

### Are habitually barefoot children compelled to wear ill-fitting school shoes? A cross-sectional study [^9bc90abe]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Shoe designs for children in habitually barefoot populations should, therefore, produce a shoe to fit the foot properly and mimic the shape and dimensions of the bare foot. Optimum foot development occurs when the natural shape and function of the foot is respected. However, one of the most challenging tasks that remain in shoe manufacturing is the ability to access useful data to build a standard shape from available measurements. In most current designs, SL is used as a basic measurement, without considering the other dimensions.

Ill-fitting shoes can have a lasting effect on the gait patterns and development of the foot, causing foot abnormalities such as a hammer-, clawed- and retracted toes. Associated pain and pathology, due to ill-fitting footwear, are widely reported. Previously, eighty percent (80%) of South African adult females reported wearing shoes, which caused pain, blisters and callouses. Common foot deformities like hallux valgus are significantly induced and influenced by shoe fit being too narrow or too short. Shoes, which are too narrow for the foot, will restrict the slay of the forefoot, leading to biomechanical deviations and restriction in movement of the foot. Hallux valgus are believed to be avoided and corrected by selecting and wearing shoes that provide sufficient space for the toes.

A limitation of the current study could be the assessment of only two static measurements, being the HTL and FW compared to the SL and SW and not including a foot height measurement. However, school shoes in the South African retail market have the required shoelaces and/or adjustable straps over the upper part of the foot. The size over the upper part of the foot can therefore be adjusted. Using a pedobarographic platform to ensure the body weight was distributed exactly 50% over each foot while measuring in the standing position could have added value to the data collection procedures. Pedobarographic data would ensure that the foot is in maximal elongated position during the standing measurement.

Dynamic measurements will add another dimension to the development of the South African pediatric shoe. Future research to investigate the foot dimensions of habitually barefoot children and adolescents, focusing on shoe development, under dynamic conditions, is indicated. Future research should also investigate whether currently available shoes respect the foot development of the habitually barefoot population, with a specific focus on foot pliability and arch height index.

### Behavioural recovery after treatment for varicose veins [^f278c23c]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Post‐treatment activity

All participants were given a study patient information leaflet (PIL), which recommended a return to all normal activities as soon as they were able, but that strenuous activity/contact sport should be avoided for 1–2 weeks. The PIL specifically stated that following EVLA or UGFS 'most people are able to return to work within 2–3 days of treatment, but some people go back the following day or even the same day', and that following surgery 'people can return to office or sedentary work after 2–3 days; and that most people will be back at work within a week after surgery to one leg and 2 weeks after surgery to both legs; but there is no reason to remain off work as long if it can be managed with reasonable comfort'. Participants undergoing UGFS or EVLA were advised to wear compression stocking for 10 days constantly (day and night). Those in the surgery group were advised that bandages would be removed the day after operation, following which they should wear a stocking for 10 days, but that it was reasonable to remove the stocking after 4 or 5 days, providing that they were active.

### Objective measurement of brace wear in successfully ponseti-treated clubfeet: pattern of decreasing use in the first 2 years [^2bcedab0]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Once Ponseti correction of a clubfoot is achieved and 3-month full-time bracing treatment is completed, part-time bracing treatment for 12 hours at night for 2 to 4 years is considered necessary to maintain a successful outcome. This study objectively documents the amount of daily orthosis wear time in those who maintained correction at age 2 years and, in so doing, determines how well patients' caretakers comply with the prescribed brace program.

Methods

Patients < 3 months old with idiopathic clubfeet when Ponseti treatment was initiated, who successfully maintained correction at age 2 years without surgery and who had complete objective brace wear data, were included. The foot abduction orthoses had a temperature data logger embedded in a shoe. Six 3-month time intervals were monitored in every patient as follows: full time: 0 to 3; night time: 4 to 6, 7 to 9, 10 to 12, 13 to 15, and 16 to 18 months. The families were not informed that hours of brace wear were being measured.

Results

One hundred twenty-four patients with 187 clubfeet were included. During the 0- to 3-month interval, wear time averaged 19.8 hr/d. After this period of full-time use, the night-time brace wear decreased over each of the subsequent five intervals: 11.9, 9.6, 8.6, 7.9, and 7.7 hours. By the 18-month period of brace wear, 1 of 3 patients wore the orthoses less than 6 hours per day, and nearly 1 of 2 patients wore the orthoses less than 8 hours per day.

Discussion

In patients evaluated at age 2 years whose clubfeet had successful nonsurgical treatment, night-time brace wear varied greatly and decreased over each 3-month period measured. By the second year of bracing treatment, nearly half of the patients wore them 8 hours or less.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV case series.

### The importance of having a single, dedicated medical team to treat congenital talipes equinovarus using the ponseti method: a retrospective analysis of treatment outcomes after 3 years of follow-up [^b6fdeaf3]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

From 2013 onwards (period II), casting was accompanied by relaxing music to keep the infant as calm as possible during the intervention, and minimal pressure was applied to the foot so as not to disturb it.

After the casting phase comes the bracing phase, where a foot abduction brace (FAB) keeps the foot (or feet) in the corrected position. FAB holds the feet in external rotation and dorsiflexion. This should be worn continuously for 3 months, even at night. Then, it should be worn at least 10 to 12 hours per night until the age of 4 to 6 years old. This brace-wearing time instructions were the same for both period I and period II. The bracing phase is a critical component of the Ponseti method, with noncompliance or failure to wear the brace being reported as one of the most significant factors for treatment failure.

During period I, our hospital used the traditional Denis Browne bar FAB (which includes pre-walking shoes attached to a rigid metallic bar). From 2013 onwards (period II), it used a Mitchell brace (which includes detachable shoes, soft silicone and rigid metallic bar, ankle–foot orthosis-type inserts). During this period, the dedicated medical team also emphasized to patients' families how important the correct use of the brace was to reduce the brace noncompliance rate.

General guidelines for illness prevention in athletes

Behavioural, lifestyle and medical strategies A variety of behavioural, lifestyle and medical intervention strategies have been advocated to reduce the risk of illness in the athlete. These include advice to athletes, measures taken by medical staff and the athlete support team. Athletes are advised to: Minimise contact with infected people, young children, animals and contagious objects; Avoid crowded areas and shaking hands and minimise contact with people outside the team and support staff; Keep at distance to people who are coughing, sneezing or have a 'runny nose', and when appropriate wear (or ask them to wear) a disposable mask; Cough or sneeze on to the elbow and not on the hands — always clean the hands and nose after sneezing or coughing; Wash hands regularly and effectively with soap and water, especially before meals, and after direct contact with potentially contagious people, animals, blood, secretions, public places and bathrooms; Use disposable paper towels and limit hand to mouth/nose contact when suffering from upper respiratory symptoms or gastrointestinal illness (putting hands to eyes and nose is a major route of viral self-inoculation); Carry insect repellent, antimicrobial foam/cream or alcohol-based hand washing gel with them; Not to share drinking bottles, cups, cutlery, towels, etc, with other people; Choose beverages from sealed bottles, avoid raw vegetables and undercooked meat, wash and peel fruit before eating, while competing or training abroad; Wear enough covered clothing (covering the arms and legs) during training sessions when travelling in tropical areas, particularly at dusk and dawn; Wear open footwear when using public showers, swimming pools and locker rooms in order to avoid dermatological diseases; Adopt strategies that facilitate good quality sleep such as strategic napping during the day and correct sleep hygiene practices at night; Avoid excessive drinking and binge drinking of alcohol as this impairs immune function for several hours, particularly after strenuous training or competition; Practice the principles of safe sex and use condoms. Medical staff taking care of athletes is advised to consider the following: Develop, implement and monitor illness prevention guidelines for athletes and medical and administrative support staff; Screening for airway inflammation disturbances (asthma, allergy and other inflammatory airway conditions); Identify the high-risk athletes and take full preventative precautions during high-risk training or competition periods; Arrange for single room accommodation during tournaments for athletes with heavy competition load or known susceptibility to respiratory tract infections, or high performance priority athletes; Consider protecting the airways of athletes from being directly exposed to very cold (< 0°C) and dry air during strenuous exercise by using a facial mask; Adopt measures to reduce the risk of illness associated with international travel; Update athletes vaccines needed at home and for foreign travel and take into consideration that influenza vaccines take 5–7 weeks to take effect, intramuscular vaccines may have a few small side effects, vaccinations are performed preferably out of season and avoid vaccinating just before competitions or if symptoms of illness are present; Update administrative and support staff vaccines needed at home and for foreign travel; Consider zinc lozenges (> 75 mg zinc/day; high ionic zinc content) at the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, as there is some evidence that the number of days with illness symptoms can be reduced. The athlete support team can consider adopting nutritional measures to maintain robust immunity in athletes, including the following: Introduce personalised nutrition programmes to avoid deficiencies of essential micronutrients; Encourage athletes to ingest carbohydrate during and after exercise and to ingest both carbohydrate and protein after exercise; Measure and monitor the vitamin D status of athletes and supplement if required; Consider advising athletes to ingest probiotic such as Lactobacillus probiotics on a daily basis; Consider advising athletes on the regular consumption of fruits and plants, polyphenol supplements (eg, quercetin), or foodstuffs (eg, non-alcoholic beer and green tea) that may reduce risk of illness.
Training and competition load management There is evidence that poor load management with ensuing maladaptation can be a significant risk factor for acute illness and overtraining. However, data are limited to a few select sports and athlete populations, and this, combined with the unique nature of different sports, make it difficult to provide sport-specific guidelines for load management. However, the following general recommendations can be made: Very high loads can have either positive or negative influences on risk of illness in athletes, with the athlete's level of competition (elite), load history (chronic load) and intrinsic risk factor profile being important; Athletes should have a detailed individualised training and competition plan, including postevent recovery measures (encompassing nutrition and hydration, sleep, and psychological recovery); The training load is monitored using measurements of external and internal load; Training load is managed by adopting the following principles: Changes in training load should be individualised as there are large intraindividual and interindividual variances in the timeframe of response and adaptation to load; Changes in training load should be in small increments, with data (from the injury literature) indicating that weekly increments should be < 10%; The competition load is monitored and managed; Variation in an athlete's psychological stressors should guide the prescription of training and/or competition loads; It is recommended that coaches and support staff schedule adequate recovery, particularly after intensive training periods, competitions and travel, including nutrition and hydration, sleep and rest, active rest, relaxation strategies and emotional support; Sports governing bodies have the responsibility to consider the competition load, and hence the health of the athletes when planning their event calendars. This requires increased coordination between single-sport and multisport event organisers, and the development of a comprehensive calendar of all international sports events.
Psychological load management Psychological load (stressors) such as negative life event stress and daily hassles can significantly increase the risk of illness in athletes. Clinical practical recommendations centre on reducing state-level stressors and educating athletes, coaches and support staff in proactive stress management, and comprise the following: Developing resilience strategies that help athletes understand the relationship between personal traits, negative life events, thoughts, emotions and physiological states, which, in turn, may help them minimise the impact of negative life events and the subsequent risk of illness; Educating athletes in stress management techniques, confidence building and goal setting, optimally under supervision of a sport psychologist, to help minimise the effects of stress and reduce the likelihood of illness; Reducing training and/or competition loads and intensities to mitigate risk of illness for athletes who appear unfocused as a consequence of negative life events or ongoing daily hassles; Implementing periodical stress assessments (eg, hassle and uplift scale, LESCA) to inform adjustment of athletes' training and/or competition loads. An athlete who reports high levels of daily hassle or stress could likely benefit from reducing the training load during a specified time period to prevent potential fatigue, illness or burnout.
Measuring and monitoring for early signs and symptoms of illness, over-reaching and overtraining The use of sensitive measures to monitor an athlete's health can lead to early detection of symptoms and signs of illness, early diagnosis and appropriate intervention. Athletes' innate tendency to continue to train and compete despite the existence of physical complaints or functional limitations, particularly at the elite level, highlight the pressing need to use appropriate illness monitoring tools. It is recommended that: Ongoing illness (and injury) surveillance systems should be implemented in all sports; Athletes be monitored, using sensitive tools, for subclinical signs of illness such as non-specific symptoms and signs, or selected special investigations; Athletes be monitored for overt symptoms and signs of illness; Athletes be monitored for early symptoms and signs of over-reaching or overtraining; Illness monitoring should be ongoing, and long enough to detect early indicators of illness particularly during alterations in training load, travel and competitions.

### Flat flexible school shoes for adolescents with patellofemoral pain: a randomised, assessor-blinded, parallel-group feasibility trial [^12e13797]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Our results indicate that progression to a full-scale RCT investigating the efficacy of flat, flexible school shoes versus traditional school shoes for treating adolescent PFP is feasible. Our recruitment rate exceeded our a priori calculation for feasibility. All participants were recruited from social media advertising, a recommended strategy from a previous trial in adolescents with PFP. Most participants were excluded during physical screening due to other diagnoses of knee pain, comparable to previous trials in adolescent PFP. Many participants were excluded during telephone and online screening due to not responding to communication. Before conducting future RCTs, efforts to understand why participants do not respond to communication could be a strategy to enhance the recruitment rate. It took 7 months to recruit 24 participants, suggesting that the recruitment strategy is effective for future trials involving adolescents with PFP.

Adherence to the intervention was assessed through logbook completion and footwear wear time. Adherence to the prespecified shoe wear criteria met feasibility requirements for more than 90% of participants in both groups. Shoe wear time was similar between groups and consistent with other trials investigating flat, flexible footwear in those with knee osteoarthritis. Participants allocated to the flat, flexible shoe wore the shoe for 6.7 hours per day and 7 hours per day in the traditional school shoe. The only other study investigating foot-based interventions in adolescents with PFP reported foot orthoses or flat insoles wear time of 4.5 hours per day. The high adherence rates and comparable wear times to other footwear studies indicate that a school footwear intervention is feasible for adolescents with PFP.

### Prevalence and associated factors of ankle-foot pain among nurses working in surgical units of comprehensive specialized hospitals in amhara regional state, northwest Ethiopia, 2022 [^ae14b5f4]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition, the present study result is lower than the finding of the study conducted in Iran (59%). This discrepancy could be due to differences in the study populations. In this study, the study population was all nurses working in all surgical units. Whereas based on the study done in Iran, the study population was nurses working only in the operation room. This could be because nurses working in the operation room are at greater risk for ankle-foot pain. After all, the operation room is recognized as a physically and psychologically demanding environment that requires prolonged standing, walking, and excessive physical activities like lifting and lowering heavy loads, thus causing loading to the lower extremity, especially in the ankle-foot region.

In multivariable logistic regression analysis, more years of working experience, working more hours per week, prolonged standing, high physical job demand, and low job control were found to be significantly associated with ankle-foot pain.

This study showed that nurses who had more than 10 years of work experience were 3.5 times more likely to develop ankle-foot pain than those who had less than 5 years of work experience. This finding is supported by the study conducted in the USA showed that more years of nursing experience was associated with ankle-foot pain. The possible reason could be that nurses who have worked for a longer period have had enough exposure to risk factors, because ankle-foot pain by its nature is a repetitive strain that develops gradually as a result of overuse.

In this study, the odds of having ankle-foot pain were 2.7 times higher among nurses who were working 48 or more hours per week as compared to those who were working less than 40 hours per week. The result of this study is consistent with the study conducted in Ghana which revealed that there was a significant association between ankle-foot pain and working hours per week. This could be explained by the possibility that working more hours per week would result in longer exposure to job demands and hazards, or reduce the time for sleep, family, and non-work activities.

### Dermatologic adverse events associated with selective fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors: overview, prevention, and management guidelines [^5bdb4bb1]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

PPES

Prevention strategies for PPES include prophylactic removal of hyperkeratotic areas, application of moisturizing cream containing urea ≥ 10%, pedicures, and cushioning of callused areas using soft or padded shoes [48]. Other preventive tactics include avoidance of activities that cause force or rubbing on the hands and feet during the first 6 weeks of treatment and limiting contact with harsh chemicals and sources of heat, such as sitting in saunas or the sun.

Management of PPES consists of keratolytic agents such as urea ≥ 10% for grade ≥ 1 PPES, with addition of high‐potency topical steroids such as fluocinonide 0.05% for grade ≥ 2 symptoms.

Stomatitis

Preventive strategies include undertaking dental work aimed at eliminating existing tooth and gum disease before the start of treatment and education regarding the importance of thorough and frequent cleaning of the oral cavity. Avoidance of salty, spicy, or citrus‐based foods, as well as hot beverages, may help prevent stomatitis.

Upon emergence of grade 1 or 2 stomatitis, dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 mL elixir is recommended; an augmented betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% gel applied to gauze and held against the affected surface may also assist in alleviating symptoms.

Dry Skin

Patients should be advised to moisturize skin to minimize the risk of skin adverse events and to avoid excessive exposure to detergents and soaps containing fragrances. Urea preparations have been shown to prevent transepidermal water loss, and salicylic acid preparations are helpful for their keratolytic, bacteriostatic, and fungicidal effects [50]. Exfoliation of scaly areas of xerosis is recommended. For more severe grade 3 xerosis, which results in asteatotic dermatitis, treatment can be initiated with low‐potency topical steroids such as hydrocortisone 2.5% cream/ointment or triamcinolone 0.1% cream.

Dry Mouth/Xerostomia

Patient education is an important component of dry mouth prevention. The importance of good oral hygiene, regular dentist visits, and other strategies for preventing oral disease should be stressed.

Treatment may include systemic and topical salivary stimulants, such as cevimeline and pilocarpine, and intraoral topical agents, such as chewing gums and saliva stimulants and substitutes [59]. High‐fluoride toothpaste is also recommended to prevent cavities.

### A review of the injuries caused by occupational footwear [^f0ef2c8f]. Occupational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although in the field of occupational risk prevention, PPE must be chosen according to the results of a risk assessment of the workplace, in the case of footwear such an assessment alone cannot be considered sufficient, as the worker also needs to be assessed. The reason for this is that occupational footwear must conform to the morphology of the worker's foot, which is an individualized one (not all workers have the same morphology). Therefore, the choice of occupational footwear must also consider certain foot morphologies such as pes cavus, flat feet or foot width. Some of the manifestations indicated by workers may be related to narrow footwear, non-breathable footwear, or footwear that does not respect the pressure points of their feet, thus causing calluses or pathologies of the nail apparatus. Discomfort resulting from occupational footwear is a common situation that in extreme cases may even lead to the worker stopping wearing them because they cannot tolerate the specific footwear available. The interaction between the worker's feet and their work surface can influence essential requirements of foot movement and when this interaction is adversely affected (e.g. loss of ankle range of motion), a multitude of variables such as the individual's balance and gait can be affected.

Given the potential impact of occupational footwear on a worker's physical function, it is necessary to ensure that it is designed to mitigate injury, not to become its cause. The area of occupational footwear is comprehensively addressed by a set of standards at the European level (safety footwear, protective footwear and occupational footwear). In this sense, regulation not only exists for the design of footwear, but also for the testing methods to check its suitability for the indicated workplace. With this premise in mind, when manufacturing footwear as PPE, another consideration should be borne in mind: the comfort the footwear offers.

Regarding this comfort in footwear, it refers to the adaptation of the footwear to the worker's foot in such a way that it does not cause injury or discomfort, and that it respects the morphology of the individual's foot in terms of its pressure points and physiological conditions. In other words, it must fit well enough so that the worker does not feel discomfort, and it must reduce the injuries caused by the PPE itself so that the worker does not have the desire to stop wearing it.

### Therapeutic footwear for the neuropathic foot: an algorithm [^bcd562a3]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Neuropathy may bring about changes in form and function of the foot, which may lead to ulceration and progressive deformity. These manifestations often require specially adapted footwear. A comprehensive concept of the medical, functional, and technical requirements for this type of footwear is still lacking to date. In this article, We present an algorithm that should facilitate prescription and manufacture of adequate shoes. This algorithm attempts to establish a link between the requirements from a medical and functional point of view and the technical possibilities of orthopedic shoe technology.

### Splints / orthoses in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^e256baa8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Splints/orthoses are often recommended to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to decrease pain, decrease swelling and/or prevent deformity. These orthoses include resting hand splints, wrist supports, finger splints and special shoes and shoe inserts.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of splints/orthoses in relieving pain, decreasing swelling and/or preventing deformity and determine the impact of splints/orthoses on strength, mobility and function in people with RA.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the PEDro data base and Current Contents up to January 2002, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register to Issue 4, 2001 using the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. Unpublished studies were sought by hand searching conference proceeding and contacting key experts.

Selection Criteria

All randomized control trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs), case-control and cohort studies comparing the use of specific orthoses against placebo, another active intervention (including another type of orthoses) or regular treatment were selected, according to an a priori protocol.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected the studies and abstracted data. The methodological quality of the RCTs and CCTs was assessed using a validated scale.

Main Results

Twelve papers reporting on 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies dealt with the following: working wrist splints (5), resting hand and wrist splints (2), special shoes and insoles (3). There is evidence that wearing working wrist splints statistically significantly decreases grip strength and does not affect pain, morning stiffness, pinch grip, quality of life after up to 6 months of regular wear. We found no evidence that resting wrist and hand splints change pain, grip strength, Ritchie Index or number of swollen joints. However, patients who wore these splints for 2 months reported that they preferred use to non-use and padded resting splints to unpadded ones. The one study of special shoes provided evidence of significant benefits of wearing extra-depth shoes for 2 months including less pain on walking and stair climbing and more minutes pain free walking time. Extra-depth shoes with semi-rigid insoles provided better pain relief than extra-depth shoes alone when worn over 12 weeks. Posted insoles prevented progression of hallux valgus angle but did not affect pain or function.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of working wrist splints in decreasing pain or increasing function for people with RA. Potential adverse effects such as decreased range of motion do not seem to be an issue, although some of these splints decrease grip strength and dexterity. Similarly, preliminary evidence suggests that resting hand and wrist splints do not seem to affect range of motion or pain, although patients preferred wearing a resting splint to not wearing one. There is evidence that extra-depth shoes and molded insoles decreases pain on weight-bearing activities such as standing, walking and stair-climbing. Posted insoles may be effective in preventing progression of hallux abductus angle but do not appear to have an impact on pain.

### Internal environment of footwear is a risk factor for tinea pedis [^590c2fc8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, the study was conducted in a single institution. Second, the research was performed with arbitrary footwear (footwear worn at the visit) and the effect of changing the footwear by the same patients on different occasions was not examined. Finally, the conditions including sex, age, shoe type and experimental environment in this study are also not uniform, as they would be in a controlled experimental study, which is important to completely understand the relationship between footwear type and TP and TU incidences. Thus, a multi‐institutional study with a large sample size should be conducted to verify the results from this study. Verification of the results in countries with climate and lifestyle habits different from those in Japan is also necessary.

In conclusion, the internal environment of footwear is a risk factor for TP and TU. The findings confirmed that the footwear's internal environment is affected by the season. Moreover, frequency of TP among men is related to the interior environment of footwear. The dew point is an appropriate index for evaluating temperature and humidity environments in relation to TP. Although this study does not contribute directly to clinical practise, it may enable dermatologists to advise patients on how to wear and maintain footwear, rather than limiting consultations to simply prescribing topical and internal agents. Consequently, dermatologists may play an important role in TP treatment and prevention.

### A review of the injuries caused by occupational footwear [^1cb8546a]. Occupational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The results shown in the study by Maidana de Zarza et al. in which a sample of 1037 nursing professionals was studied, showed that 52% of the subjects considered clogs without a heel pad to be comfortable, while 36% considered them to be dangerous. Moreover, 73% considered that unsuitable footwear could cause various pathologies such as sprains and muscle cramps, among others. Self-perceived danger can be considered a risk factor for resorting to other types of footwear of various kinds, in that appropriate footwear with the right anthropometric characteristics is essential for the daily demands of the job.

Nealy et al. specified the most frequent types of problems that can be caused by inappropriate footwear such as plantar fasciitis, metatarsalgia, heel bursitis, bone spurs and Achilles tendonitis, with the main causes being inadequate self-care. For their part, Tojo et al. and Pedraza-Melo et al. related the comfort associated with the footwear to both personal and psychological factors. In this line, Bernardes et al. go further and conclude that interventions at this level are complex because of the context of the individual worker and the personal traits of the worker.

In other sectors such as the construction, telecommunications, and the hotel and catering industry, the same problems were observed, to which other problems could be added such as those derived from the use of closed footwear with reinforced toecaps, which results in greater weight and less comfort. In addition, in sectors such as the wine industry, the aeronautical industry and firefighting, more than half of the workers had calluses, dry skin and tinea pedis, as well as pain in the foot, specifically in the sole, external malleolus, heel, calcaneus and cuboid areas. Finally, in a group with a special regime, the military personnel, no difference was observed in terms of a higher incidence of injuries when using military boots, with the exception of the study by Schulze et al. which concluded that footwear had a significant influence on gait parameters and the functionality of the lower limb. Supplementary Table S4 (available as Supplementary data at Occupational Medicine Online) shows the main characteristics and findings of the studies included in this literature review.

### Operative versus nonoperative treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^cf1aa715]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the clinical outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures (DIACFs).

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and ClinicalTrial.gov.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials comparing operative and nonoperative treatment for DIACFs.

Data Extraction

Information on study methods and clinical outcomes.

Data Synthesis

We performed data synthesis on relevant clinical outcomes. Weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous data and relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous data. A fixed-effect model or a random-effect model was used.

Results

Seven randomized controlled trials involving 908 patients were included. Operative treatment for DIACFs reduced problems associated with shoe wear and increased walking ability but increased the risks of overall complications and infection. There were no significant differences between the groups in American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scores, The Short Form (36) Health Survey, return to work, rate of subsequent subtalar fusion, or the rate of reflex sympathetic dystrophy.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis documented that when surgery was performed correctly, better shoe wear and improved walking ability could be expected. These outcomes seemed to be based on the surgeon's ability to obtain an acceptable reduction. Benefits were tempered by the increase in wound complications associated with this intervention.

### Predicted distribution and burden of podoconiosis in Cameroon [^a983a3bc]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

In the current analysis, we have identified environmental factors associated with the risk of occurrence of podoconiosis. In addition to the factors identified in our previous model in Ethiopia, we have identifiedland surface temperature, distance to stable night-lights and pH of the soil as additional factors that drive the risk of occurrence of podoconiosis. In our previous model using data from Ethiopia, the factors that were found to be associated with the spatial distribution of podoconiosis were elevation, precipitation and EVI. According to our study, major drivers of podoconiosis occurrence in Cameroon appear to be soil composition and landscape characteristics (silt and clay composition of soil and slope of the land).

Our results show that podoconiosis is present in other regions of Cameroon besides the historical endemic North West region. Most of the areas where high prevalence of podoconiosis is documented are in the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL). The CVL is a 1600 km chain of volcanoes that extends along the border region of eastern Nigeria and includes islands such as São Tomé and Príncipe, and Bioko, which are also endemic for podoconiosis. These volcanic activities occurred over 1 million years ago, with subsequent weathering and generation of soils. Dense tropical forest has flourished over these rich soils for thousands of years and become highly rich in clay and silt because of the decomposition of organic matter.

Although podoconiosis was reported four decades ago in Cameroon, there has been no systematic effort to map the distribution and quantify the burden in the country. Podoconiosis services are only available in the North West region provided by a non-governmental organisation. Exposure to soil is common, as shoes are not worn regularly in rural areas of Cameroon. They are preserved for special occasions such as attending weddings, church ceremonies and weekly markets. In a survey conducted in the North West region, only a handful of interviewees reported wearing shoes during farm-related activities such as planting, harvesting and working on a rice farm. This is likely to have contributed to the continued presence of the disease in environmentally suitable areas. The lack of attention by national agencies and international partners, and difficulties in ensuring access to preventive methods, such as shoes, are listed among the major challenges for podoconiosis elimination.

### An investigation of risk factors for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee in women using a life course approach [^a60acefa]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To explore risk factors for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OAK) in women, which included wearing high heeled shoes.

Design

Matched case-control study. Exposure information obtained by interview, included details about past footwear. Self reported weight and height data obtained representing when women left school, were aged 36–40 and were aged 51–55. Regular work activities (including periods when homemaker or carer), smoking, and hormone related data gathered using a life-grid.

Setting

Interviews in participants' homes. Cases identified from orthopaedic hospital surgical waiting list, controls identified by general practitioners (GPs)

Participants

Women aged 50 to 70 years. Cases awaiting knee replacement surgery. Controls, who had no past knee surgery and no knee pain in the past three years, were matched for age and GP. Altogether 111 eligible women were interviewed (29 cases, 82 controls).

Main Results

Univariate analyses identified several significant associations with OAK including past knee injury, arthritis of the feet, heavy smoking, being overweight (BMI 25 or above) and various occupational activities. Virtually all measures of high heeled shoes use were associated with reduced risk of OAK, although none of these findings were statistically significant. In multivariate analysis only BMI 25 or above at age 36–40 remained significantly associated with OAK (OR 36.4, 95% CI 3.07 to 432, p = 0.004), although weak evidence suggested certain occupational activities might increase risk. Weight gain in early adult life was particularly pronounced among cases.

Conclusions

Being overweight before the age of 40 considerably increased the risk of subsequent symptomatic OAK in women. Wearing high heeled shoes did not.

- apply asbestos-free talcum powder in addition to regular changes of socks when using vapor barrier boots

- do not use neoprene socks

- do not use grease or oils on feet or hands

- rotate personnel regularly out of cold, wet environments

- encourage personnel to move around frequently and to avoid having the legs and feet dependent

- train personnel for operations in cold, wet conditions

- do not re-expose patients with previous nonfreezing cold injuries to cold environments.

### Effects of footwear and fatigue on running economy and biomechanics in trail runners [^5db771d2]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to examine the effects of footwear and neuromuscular fatigue induced by short distance trail running (TR) on running economy (RE) and biomechanics in well-trained and traditionally shod runners.

Methods

RE, vertical and leg stiffness (Kvert and Kleg), as well as foot strike angle were measured from two 5-min treadmill running stages performed at a speed of 2.5 (with 10% grade, uphill running) and 2.77 m·s (level running) before and after an 18.4-km TR exercise (approximately 90% of maximal heart rate) in runners wearing minimalist shoes (MS), MS plus added mass (MSm), or traditional shoes (TS). Maximal voluntary contraction torque of knee extensors and perceived muscle pain were also evaluated before and after TR.

Results

Maximal voluntary contraction values decreased after TR in all footwear conditions (P < 0.001), indicating the occurrence of neuromuscular fatigue. In the nonfatigued condition, runners exhibited a better RE only during level running in MS and MSm (i.e., combined effects of shoe mass and midsole geometry), in association with significant decreases in foot strike angle (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference in RE was observed between shod conditions after TR during either uphill or level running. Decreases in both Kvert/Kleg and foot strike angle were more pronounced during running in MS and MSm (P < 0.05) compared with TS, whatever the period. Calf pain increased after TR when wearing MS and MSm compared with TS (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

These findings indicated specific alterations in RE and biomechanics over time during the MS and MSm conditions compared with the TS condition. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the relationship between RE and footwear with fatigue in experienced minimally shod runners.

### Factors associated with use of slip-resistant shoes in US limited-service restaurant workers [^b6cba47b]. Injury Prevention (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Slips and falls are a leading cause of injury at work. Several studies have indicated that slip-resistant shoes can reduce the risk of occupational slips and falls. Few studies, however, have examined the determinants of slip-resistant shoe use. This study examined the individual and workplace factors associated with slip-resistant shoe use.

Methods

475 workers from 36 limited-service restaurants in the USA participated in a study of workplace slipping. Demographic and job characteristic information about each participant was collected. Restaurant managers provided information on whether slip-resistant shoes were provided and paid for by the employer and whether any guidance was given regarding slip-resistant shoe use when they were not provided. Kitchen floor coefficient of friction was measured. Slip-resistant status of the shoes was determined by noting the presence of a 'slip-resistant' marking on the sole. Poisson regression with robust SE was used to calculate prevalence ratios.

Results

320 participants wore slip-resistant shoes (67%). In the multivariate analysis, the prevalence of slip-resistant shoe use was lowest in 15-19-year age group. Women were more likely to wear slip-resistant shoes (prevalence ratio 1.18, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31). The prevalence of slip-resistant shoe use was lower when no guidance regarding slip-resistant shoes was given as compared to when they were provided by the employer (prevalence ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.79). Education level, job tenure and the mean coefficient of friction had no significant effects on the use of slip-resistant shoes.

Conclusion

Provision of slip-resistant shoes was the strongest predictor of their use. Given their effectiveness and low cost, employers should consider providing slip-resistant shoes at work.

### Flat flexible school shoes for adolescents with patellofemoral pain: a randomised, assessor-blinded, parallel-group feasibility trial [^e3049a25]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Minor adverse events were common and consistent with previous studies utilising flat, flexible footwear. In an RCT of 164 adults with knee osteoarthritis, 32% of participants allocated to a flat, flexible shoe reported an adverse event, compared with only 15% of those wearing a traditional stability shoe. In our study, more adverse events were reported in the flat, flexible school shoe group (50% of participants) than in the traditional school shoe group (33%). Several reasons may contribute to this. Almost all participants previously wore school footwear with low flexibility and high cushioning. The lack of cushioning in the flat, flexible shoe used in our study may have contributed to the ankle and foot pain reported by participants. Flat, flexible footwear has also increased the demand for calf musculature, possibly contributing to calf and foot pain. Prior studies indicate that most adverse events observed with flat, flexible footwear occur when transitioning from a traditional shoe. Almost all adverse events reported by our participants resolved within 2 weeks of wearing the shoe, suggesting that they are transient and likely to resolve quickly. The two participants lost to follow-up in this study received the traditional shoe, demonstrating no attrition with the flat, flexible footwear intervention. Longer term RCTs investigating flat, flexible footwear in older adults with knee osteoarthritis demonstrate no long-term adverse effects associated with their use. Flat, flexible school footwear appears to be a well-tolerated intervention for a PFP cohort.

Non-freezing cold injuries — Trench foot (or immersion foot) is a non-freezing cold-related injury after prolonged immersion of the feet in water 15°C (< 59°F), with stage 1 numbness and clumsiness during exposure that progresses on rewarming to stage 2 with mottling and color changes, stage 3 involving hyperemia and pain with or without tissue loss, and stage 4 that may leave the patient with intense sensitivity to repeated cold exposure and neuropathic pain; treatment includes passive rewarming, drying, elevation, and analgesics. Pernio (or chilblains) are purplish lesions that occur primarily on the skin of hands and earlobes after exposure to cold wet conditions, with pruritus and pain that are exacerbated by rapid rewarming; prevention (keeping skin warm and dry) is key; pharmacologic treatment with nifedipine shows promise; however, this use is considered off-label and warrants caution and clear instructions to the traveler because of the risk of hypotension with associated dizziness.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of lightning injuries: 2014 update [^56711b98]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lightning position for imminent strikes — the lightning position involves sitting or crouching with knees and feet close together to create only one point of contact with the ground; if standing, have feet touching, and if sitting, lift feet off the ground; take this position only when a lightning strike is imminent and when all other lightning prevention strategies have failed, attempt to minimize ground current injury by insulating from the ground by sitting on a pack, a dry coiled rope, or a rolled foam sleeping pad; this is a strategy of last resort and should not be relied on as primary prevention but may reduce injury risk (Recommendation grade: 2C).

### Patellofemoral pain [^0615796a]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) combined physical therapy interventions recommendation — Clinicians should combine physical therapy interventions for the treatment of individuals with PFP, which results in superior outcomes compared with no treatment, flat shoe inserts, or foot orthoses alone in the short and medium term. Exercise therapy is the critical component and should be the focus in any combined intervention approach, and interventions to consider combining with exercise therapy include foot orthoses, patellar taping, patellar mobilizations, and lower-limb stretching. While combined interventions were different across studies, exercise therapy was present in all successful combined intervention programs.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with Marfan syndrome [^9bc79759]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Joint laxity and foot alignment in Marfan syndrome — Some individuals will show reduced mobility of the elbow, whereas other joints may demonstrate ligamentous laxity; joint laxity may be more significant in the young but rarely leads to motor delays, and true joint dislocations are rare. Joint laxity can lead to muscle fatigue and overuse pain or injury; physical and/or occupational therapy can address these joint laxity issues with joint stabilization exercises, postural support, education, alternative strategies (eg, use of a laptop for notetaking), and bracing or resting splints if necessary. Inward rotation of the medial aspect of the ankle can result in pes planus with heel valgus, which may lead to foot, ankle, knee, hip, and/or low back pain; some will benefit from the use of shoe orthoses, such as an arch support and more supportive shoes, but surgical intervention is rarely indicated or fully successful.

### Epidemiology and individual, household and geographical risk factors of podoconiosis in Ethiopia: results from the first nationwide mapping [^3ddfe98f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Foot hygiene practices were associated with podoconiosis disease status. These findings further strengthen the importance of promotion of these behaviors in preventing podoconiosis. The role of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in neglected tropical disease (NTD) control has been gaining much attention recently. Studies have indicated the interplay between NTDs and WASH, and this study adds to the evidence. Shoe wearing was not found to be associated with podoconiosis. The explanation for this may be reverse causality, in that people with podoconiosis tend to start wearing shoes after developing the disease either to prevent progression of disease or to conceal the swelling. Living in a house with an uncovered (mud or earth) floor was associated with podoconiosis, which may reflect either the importance of indoor exposure in addition to outdoor exposure or the influence of socioeconomic status of the individual. Occupation was also found to be associated with podoconiosis. Occupation may be related to the underlying socioeconomic status of individuals, which in turn may affect individual access to shoes, water, and foot hygiene practices or more broadly access to information that leads to preventive behaviors. In our study, people with podoconiosis were less likely to be married or to have attended formal schooling. The interplay between podoconiosis stigma and mate selection has been described in qualitative studies. As a result of a widespread misconception that podoconiosis runs within families whatever the environmental exposure, people with podoconiosis experience great difficulty in finding a marriage partner, particularly one without podoconiosis. The interaction between podoconiosis and education may be bidirectional. People with podoconiosis may have less access to education because of a lack of finances, (itself caused by reduced productivity), attendant illness such as acute attacks, or dropout from school as a consequence of stigma and discrimination. Equally, more educated people may be more informed of how to prevent podoconiosis and may have more access to shoes and water.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: midportion achilles tendinopathy revision – 2024 [^51fec36d]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Foot orthoses in midportion Achilles tendinopathy — because contradictory evidence exists, no recommendation can be made for the use of orthoses in patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy. No new studies investigated the effectiveness of orthoses, and therefore, the recommendation is unchanged. For this CPG, foot orthoses are defined as off the shelf or custom (ie, fitted) shoe inserts that support the feet, influence motion of the foot, and alter the interface between the plantar surface of the foot and the shoe.

### Influence of footwear fitting on feet morphology in 9 year old girls [^27b72fb7]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

It is equally important to adjust the footwear width, mainly due to the comfort of its use. Chaiwanichsiri et al. pointed out that wearing too narrow shoes, especially in childhood, causes abnormal tension in the muscles and tendons of the feet, the formation of bunions and unsightly thickenings. Too narrow shoes compress the feet, hindering their natural development, as well as impede the work of the muscles. They cause distortion of the toes and stretching of the ligaments maintaining the transverse arch. In turn, wearing too wide shoes is the cause of instability during locomotion and resulting injuries. In our study appropriate fitting in terms of width was found only in 23% of the girls. More than half of the girls wore too wide shoes, and too narrow shoes were worn by 22–30% of the group. Obtained data indicate that in terms of width, indoor footwear was poorly adjusted to the feet of the surveyed girls, despite the fact that the participants reported very favourable perceptions of footwear fit. Such a discrepancy in the objective and subjective assessment of footwear fitting may result from the fact that the foot adjusts to the wrongly selected footwear. The wrong positioning of the foot in the shoe initially does not cause discomfort, but over time affects the formation or deepening of deformation and leads to microdamage of its delicate structures. It is noteworthy that 40–43% of girls wore too short shoes, while 55–47% of them wore too wide shoes. This suggests the need to raise children and, above all, their parents' awareness of the rules for the selection of footwear, as well as the need to constantly monitor its condition so that in the event of disorders, immediate replacement is made. Since this issue is occasionally undertaken in the literature of the subject, these results are difficult to refer to other reports.
