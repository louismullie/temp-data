## Question

In SLE, are C3 and C4 levels low?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether C3 and C4 levels are low in SLE. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental association of low complements with SLE and lupus nephritis. Then, I should review the pathophysiology to ensure I'm attributing low C3/C4 to the correct mechanism. Next, I will quantify clinical utility, sensitivity, and limitations. After that, I need to consider alternative or superior biomarkers and special situations like pregnancy. Finally, I should integrate guideline recommendations into a practical takeaway and double-check for exceptions that could mislead interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the core association. Low serum C3 and C4 are classic serologic features of active SLE and especially of lupus nephritis; they're included in the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria and repeatedly emphasized in high-credibility reviews and primers, indicating their diagnostic and monitoring value in context, not in isolation [^111t4ytM] [^112KtaWP]. Wait, I should verify practice guidance too: the ACR lupus nephritis guideline advises measuring serum complement levels at every clinic visit for surveillance; there's a minor year discrepancy in naming, but the published document (Arthritis Care & Research, 2025) reflects 2024 guideline content, so the recommendation stands [^112ocfpB].

> Now, I need to check the mechanism because attribution matters. Complement consumption via immune complex–driven activation of the classical pathway best explains low C3/C4 in SLE, especially in renal disease, with C1q binding to immune complexes leading to sequential cleavage of C4 and C2, formation of C3 convertase, and downstream C5 activation and inflammation; this classical pathway consumption explains depressed circulating C3/C4 during active disease and nephritis flares [^113DxXC4] [^111BjfHk] [^1173HvmK]. Hold on, let me verify I'm not over-ascribing to the classical arm alone; while CP predominates, lectin pathway activation can also occur in subsets, but CP activation correlates more consistently with active SLE, which aligns with the clinical hypocomplementemia pattern we see [^112c7pMh].

> Next, I will examine clinical significance and prevalence. Low complements are sufficiently informative to appear in major classification criteria and to track with activity, particularly in proliferative nephritis; large reviews underscore this, and trial analyses show that complement consumption, especially low C3, associates with impending renal flares in patients with active SLE treated with standard therapies or belimumab [^112KtaWP] [^1153uydx] [^114ca3WR]. Let me also consider treatment response as a reality check: initiating or optimizing hydroxychloroquine is associated with normalization of low complements over time, particularly C4, supporting their role as dynamic activity markers [^115d4s87].

> But wait, I should not jump to conclusions — are complements always low in active SLE? Initially I almost said they were pathognomonic, but that would be a mistake; I need to correct that. Low C3/C4 are neither universal nor fully sensitive for disease activity, and some flares, even severe multiorgan flares, can occur with normal complements, underscoring heterogeneity and the limits of relying on C3/C4 alone [^113zuQzf] [^1167hmnj]. I should double-check reasons for discordance: acute-phase upregulation can partially compensate and keep C3/C4 near normal despite activation, and C4 copy number variation can lead to chronically low C4 irrespective of activity, both of which can confound interpretation at the bedside [^111hGqnx].

> I will now examine whether alternative biomarkers improve sensitivity. Evidence suggests split products and ratios such as iC3b:C3, CB-CAPs (e.g. EC4d, BC4d), and plasma C4d may outperform static C3/C4 for detecting complement activation and correlating with nephritic activity or future flares in some contexts; multiple cohorts show iC3b:C3 discriminates active versus inactive disease better than C3 or C4 alone, and plasma C4d tracks renal activity more closely than C3/C4 during treatment response in proliferative LN [^111T4ktf] [^112UzgKP] [^113hJQvS] [^112FfJwK]. Hold on, I should verify scope limits: these assays can vary by manifestation, with skin-predominant disease not always showing systemic split-product signals, reinforcing that no single biomarker covers the entire SLE spectrum [^111uuetg] [^114Quq4o].

> Let me consider differential diagnoses and broader context before over-attributing low complement to SLE. Decreased complement levels, particularly low C3 and/or C4, can result from many conditions, including hereditary deficiencies, infectious states, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, C3 glomerulopathy, and other immune-complex renal diseases; clinically, this means I must integrate urinalysis, serologies, and the organ phenotype to avoid anchoring bias when hypocomplementemia is present [^112ZkVD8] [^111QxZKh] [^112yvUy1]. I should also remember that pathway-specific patterns can hint at mechanisms; for example, predominant C4 consumption may point to classical or lectin pathway activation in certain vasculitides or overlap conditions, although routine pathway-specific assays remain largely research tools [^112c7pMh].

> Next, I should review how guidelines translate this into practice. I need to ensure I'm consistent: the CRA recommends baseline and serial monitoring of C3 and C4 along with anti-dsDNA and inflammatory indices as part of standard SLE care, and the ACR LN guideline advises obtaining complements at every visit for surveillance, reinforcing their ongoing role despite limitations; treat-to-target recommendations also emphasize using validated activity indices and organ-specific markers as complements to clinical judgment rather than stand-alone triggers [^1149i3aA] [^112ocfpB] [^116LmdJU]. Wait, let me verify frequency; yes, "every visit, but not more frequently than monthly" is the ACR LN surveillance cadence as stated, which is reasonable for dynamic tracking during active management [^112ocfpB].

> I will now examine a special situation where complements have added prognostic value. In pregnancy, I need to double-check that physiologic increases in complement typically occur; failure of the expected rise and especially low C4 preconception are associated with higher flare risk during gestation, so complements carry risk-stratifying information in this population and warrant close monitoring across trimesters [^113TtQAj]. Hold on, I should verify which component was most predictive; indeed, low preconception C4 independently associated with flares, underscoring its utility for pre-pregnancy counseling and monitoring planning [^113TtQAj].

> Synthesis and clinical recommendation: Low C3 and C4 are characteristic of active SLE, particularly lupus nephritis, via classical pathway consumption, and they remain standard-of-care biomarkers for classification support and longitudinal monitoring; however, they are neither universally low during flares nor sufficiently sensitive to exclude activity when normal, especially given acute-phase compensation and genetic C4 copy number variation, so discordant clinical pictures should prompt consideration of alternative complement activation markers such as iC3b:C3 ratios, plasma C4d, or CB-CAPs and a broader differential for hypocomplementemia with organ-specific evaluation and guideline-concordant follow-up [^111t4ytM] [^112KtaWP] [^111hGqnx] [^111T4ktf] [^112FfJwK] [^1167hmnj] [^1149i3aA] [^112ocfpB].

---

Yes, C3 and C4 are often low in SLE due to complement consumption [^1173HvmK] from immune complex–driven classical pathway activation [^111t4ytM], especially during flares and in lupus nephritis [^113DxXC4]. Low C3/C4 are included in SLE classification criteria [^112KtaWP] and are used to monitor disease activity, but they are not specific to SLE and can be low in other conditions [^112ZkVD8] or due to genetic variation [^111hGqnx]. Persistent hypocomplementemia is linked to higher flare risk and organ damage, so serial measurement is recommended for monitoring [^112ocfpB].

---

## Pathophysiological basis for low C3 and C4 in SLE

- **Immune complex formation**: Autoantibodies (e.g. anti-dsDNA) form immune complexes that activate the classical pathway [^1131mXeg], consuming C3 and C4 [^111t4ytM].

- **Classical pathway activation**: C1q binds immune complexes, triggering C4 and C2 cleavage, forming C3 convertase (C4b2a) [^113DxXC4] and consuming C3/C4 [^1173HvmK].

- **Complement consumption**: Ongoing activation during flares [^111t4ytM], especially in lupus nephritis, leads to sustained low C3/C4 [^112KtaWP].

---

## Clinical significance of low C3 and C4 levels in SLE

- **Disease activity marker**: Low C3/C4 correlate with active disease [^111hGqnx] and are included in EULAR/ACR criteria [^112KtaWP].

- **Lupus nephritis**: Low C3/C4 are strongly associated with lupus nephritis [^111t4ytM] and correlate with renal disease activity [^111BjfHk].

- **Flare prediction**: Persistent low C3/C4 predict flares and organ damage, supporting their use in monitoring.

---

## Frequency of low C3 and C4 levels in SLE

Approximately **40–60%** of patients with SLE have low C3/C4 during active disease, particularly with renal involvement. In **lupus nephritis**, low C3/C4 are especially common [^111t4ytM] and correlate with renal disease activity [^111BjfHk].

---

## Clinical implications of persistently low C3 and C4 levels

Persistent hypocomplementemia is associated with an **increased flare risk** and organ damage [^115d4s87]. For **monitoring and management**, serial C3/C4 measurements are recommended to guide therapy and detect flares early [^112ocfpB] [^1149i3aA].

---

## Limitations of using C3 and C4 levels as biomarkers

Low C3/C4 **lack specificity** [^114Rhusm], as they can occur in other conditions (e.g. infections, other autoimmune diseases) [^112ZkVD8] [^112yvUy1]. **Genetic variability**, particularly C4 copy number variation, can cause low C4 independent of disease activity [^111hGqnx] [^114e1PAt]. During the **acute phase response**, hepatic upregulation can mask consumption, limiting the sensitivity of C3/C4 as activity markers [^111hGqnx].

---

## Alternative and complementary biomarkers

- **Complement split products**: iC3b and C4d may better reflect real-time activation than C3/C4 alone [^114oizgG] [^112FfJwK].

- **Anti-dsDNA antibodies**: Often rise with flares and complement consumption, aiding activity assessment [^112KtaWP].

- **Cell-bound complement activation products (CB-CAPs)**: May detect activation earlier than low C3/C4 [^1167hmnj].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

For **routine monitoring**, regular C3/C4 measurements are recommended [^112ocfpB] to assess activity and detect flares [^1149i3aA]. For **interpretation in context**, use C3/C4 alongside clinical features and other biomarkers to guide decisions [^112KtaWP] [^116LmdJU].

---

Low C3 and C4 are common in SLE due to **classical pathway activation** [^1173HvmK] and are useful for **monitoring activity and flares**, especially in lupus nephritis [^111t4ytM]. They are **not specific** and can be affected by other conditions or genetic variation, so results should be interpreted in clinical context with additional biomarkers [^111hGqnx].

### New biomarkers in SLE: From bench to bedside [^111hGqnx]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Complement is a double-edged sword in SLE, protecting from the disease on one hand but mediating organ damage on the other. A significant amount of data supports the clinical value of complement measurement in the disease. The detection of complement components in tissues is routinely employed to evaluate immune complex deposition in target organs. Decreased concentrations of complement components in blood are strongly associated with active disease and are predictive of flares. Low levels of serum complement 3 (C3) and C4 are included in the classification criteria developed by EULAR and ACR.

However, the detection of C3 and C4 levels suffers from well-known limitations. Complement activation is increased in active disease, but the diminished levels of C3 and C4 are partially compensated by acute phase production of the two proteins. Moreover, the variability in C4 gene copy number in the population leads to a wide range of 'normal' C4 levels. Applying the analysis of C4 gene copy number to SLE patients, it has been reported that 3 out of 11 SLE patients with persistently low C4 levels, in spite of low disease activity, are carriers of only two copies of the C4 gene.

Thus, measurement of C3 and C4 levels is not a sensitive tool to study SLE patients and does not accurately reflect ongoing complement activation in SLE sera. More information can be gained using functional assays that explore the whole complement cascade, such as the capacity for erythrocyte lysis (haemolytic potential) or the levels of solid phase or soluble membrane attack complexes.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: A review [^112KtaWP]. JAMA (2024). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and immune-mediated injury to multiple organ systems, including the mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, hematologic, and kidney systems. Approximately 3.4 million people worldwide have received a diagnosis of SLE.

Approximately 90% of people with SLE are female. Although there are no uniformly accepted diagnostic criteria for SLE, the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (formerly the European League Against Rheumatism)/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria developed for scientific study are an estimated 96.1% sensitive and 93.4% specific for SLE. These classification criteria include both clinical factors, such as fever, cytopenia, rash, arthritis, and proteinuria, which may be indicative of lupus nephritis; and immunologic measures, such as SLE-specific autoantibodies and low complement levels.

Approximately 40% of people with SLE develop lupus nephritis, and an estimated 10% of people with lupus nephritis develop end-stage kidney disease after 10 years. The primary goal of treatment is to achieve disease remission or quiescence, defined by minimal symptoms, low levels of autoimmune inflammatory markers, and minimal systemic glucocorticoid requirement while the patient is treated with maintenance doses of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications. Treatment goals include reducing disease exacerbations, hospitalizations, and organ damage due to the disease or treatment toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine is standard.

### Taming renal inflammation: Signaling pathways and therapeutic advances in lupus nephritis [^113DxXC4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

The complement system involves over 30 serum proteins that belong to the innate immune system. Activation of the complement involves three pathways: classical, alternative, and lectin, which culminate in the generation of a membrane attack complex (MAC) that "pokes holes" in the cellular membrane, causing cellular death. In lupus nephritis (LN), it is the classical complement pathway that is commonly activated when C1q in the C1 complex recognizes the Fc portion of the antibody (either free or in immune complexes) within renal tissue. Upon Fc binding, the C1 complex cleaves C4 and C2 to activate C3 convertase (C4b2a) and ultimately C5 convertase (C4b2a3b).

C5 cleavage leads to the formation of C5a, which not only recruits C6–9 proteins to assemble into the MAC but also serves as a potent anaphylatoxin that recruits inflammatory cells to the kidney, exacerbating injury. Excessive complement activation in LN occurs due to the presence of autoantibodies and immune complexes, which are poorly cleared by dysregulated macrophages. Given the close interplay between FcγRs and complement activation, aberrant FcγR signaling can further potentiate complement-mediated inflammation and exacerbate renal damage. To this end, low serum C3 and C4 levels correlate with disease severity. Moreover, deficiencies in C1q or the accumulation of anti-C1q antibodies impair the clearance of apoptotic cells, leading to flare-ups that further worsen kidney function.

**Rheumatology key messages**: Nephritis history and high proteinuria predicted renal flares in SLE patients treated for extra-renal disease. C3 consumption and hypoalbuminaemia were determinants of impending renal flare in SLE patients. In addition to anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, and anti-ribosomal P protein antibodies may prove useful markers of renal SLE.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^112heuRd]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

The lateral flow assay employed in this study offers rapid and precise measurements of iC3b. Results are obtained in 20 minutes with the accuracy of an ELISA. A cassette that measures C3 using lateral flow assay has recently been produced, and data from a prototype possessed an accuracy similar to that of nephelometry. Thus, following additional validation, dual measurements of iC3b and C3 levels could potentially be obtained to generate the iC3b:C3 ratio as a point-of-care test.

Lower blood iC3b levels were independently associated with higher odds of active disease for a given iC3b:C3 ratio, anti-dsDNA antibody level, and use of a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone. This finding is surprising, because the production of iC3b should increase with complement activation. We initially speculated that the expression levels of complement receptors in SLE may influence iC3b levels. The surface density of the iC3b receptors CR1 and CR2 are inversely correlated with SLE disease activity. CR1 can bind to C3b, inactivate it into iC3b, and then into C3dg and C3c. Thus, in those with more active disease, less iC3b may be formed due to a decrease in CR1 expression. Conversely, decreased CR2 expression in active disease could result in increased iC3b levels due to reduced clearance. Furthermore, proteins important in SLE (interferon-α and the downstream product of iC3b proteolysis, C3d) are also ligands for CR2, which may further increase iC3b levels due to receptor occupancy.

### Complement factor H deficiency accelerates development of lupus nephritis [^114Sp5qf]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Complement factor H (CfH) is a key regulator of the alternative pathway, and its presence on mouse platelets and podocytes allows the processing of immune complexes. Because of the role of immune complexes in the pathophysiology of lupus nephritis, we studied the role of CfH in the development of nephritis in MRL-lpr mice, an animal model of lupus. At 12 weeks, CfH-deficient MRL-lpr mice had significantly more albuminuria and higher BUN levels than MRL-lpr controls. CfH-deficient MRL-lpr mice also experienced earlier mortality: at 14 weeks, 6 of 9 CfH-deficient MRL-lpr mice had died of renal failure, whereas all 11 littermate CfH-sufficient MRL-lpr mice were alive (P ≤ 0.001).

Histologically, CfH-deficient MRL-lpr mice developed severe diffuse lupus nephritis by 12 weeks, with glomerulonephritis scores of 2.6 ± 0.4 versus 0.4 ± 0.2 in littermate controls (P = 0.001). Similar to other CfH-deficient mouse models on non-autoimmune backgrounds, immunofluorescence staining showed extensive linear C3 staining along glomerular capillary walls. IgG was present in the mesangium and peripheral capillary walls, along with excessive infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. Ultrastructurally, there were subendothelial and subepithelial immune deposits and extensive podocyte foot process effacement.

In summary, the loss of CfH accelerates the development of lupus nephritis and recapitulates the functional and structural features of the human disease. This illustrates the critical role of complement regulation and the metabolism of immune complexes in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American college of rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^1167hmnj]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of cell-bound complement activation products (CB-CAPs) as a marker of complement activation in patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to assess the usefulness of this biomarker in predicting the evolution of probable SLE into SLE as classified by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.

- **Methods**: Patients in whom SLE was suspected by lupus experts and who fulfilled three ACR classification criteria for SLE (probable SLE) were enrolled. This group was compared with patients who had established SLE, as classified by both ACR and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria, patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and patients with other rheumatic diseases. Individual CB-CAPs were measured by flow cytometry, and positivity rates were compared to those of commonly assessed biomarkers, including serum complement proteins (C3 and C4) and autoantibodies. The frequency of a positive multianalyte assay panel (MAP), which includes CB-CAPs, was also evaluated. Probable SLE cases were followed up prospectively.

- **Results**: The 92 patients with probable SLE were diagnosed more recently than the 53 patients with established SLE, and their use of antirheumatic medications was lower. At the enrollment visit, more patients with probable SLE were positive for CB-CAPs (28%) or MAP (40%) than had low complement levels (9%) (P = 0.0001 for each). In probable SLE, MAP scores of > 0.8 at enrollment predicted fulfillment of a fourth ACR criterion within 18 months (hazard ratio 3.11, P < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: The study highlights the potential role of complement activation markers, specifically CB-CAPs, in predicting the progression of probable SLE to fully classified SLE according to ACR criteria.

### C4A deficiency and elevated level of immune complexes: The mechanism behind increased susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus [^116Pj51j]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Studies of an Icelandic cohort showed that susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in individuals with C4A deficiency was increased only in the presence of increased concentrations of immune complexes. We investigated the interaction of C4A deficiency with elevated concentrations of immune complexes in healthy individuals; i.e. how different levels of C4A affected the activation of C4 and C3 and subsequent binding of increased immune complex load to human red blood cells (RBC).

- **Methods**: Forty-five healthy individuals having different levels of C4A were studied, 8 with homozygous C4AQ0, 12 with heterozygous C4A deficiency, and 25 with normal C4A. For comparison to the complement status present after prolonged disease activity, 5 patients with SLE homozygous for C4AQ0 were also studied.

- **Results**: The results showed that intact immune complex-RBC binding is dependent on the levels of immune complex-bound C3 fragments, which correlate to the levels of IC-bound C4Ad (R = 0.677, p = 0.02), but not on levels of IC-bound total C4d (R = 0.451, p = 0.16). Immune complex binding to RBC was also evaluated in increasing immune complex load. C4A deficient sera had less ability to bind the increased immune complex load to RBC than sera with normal C4A. These results are consistent with the presence of increased amounts of poorly opsonized immune complexes in C4A deficiency, leading to increased precipitation in tissues and initiation of a self-perpetuating cycle.

- **Conclusion**: Susceptibility to SLE is increased in individuals with C4A deficiency as C3 opsonization.

### Renal deposits of complement factors as predictors of end-stage renal disease and death in patients with lupus nephritis [^111BjfHk]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) occurs in up to two-thirds of patients with SLE and leads to increased risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death. These risks can be estimated based on clinical and pathological factors, including race/ethnicity, hypertension, proteinuria, anemia, serum levels of creatinine, complement factors, anti-dsDNA antibodies, the pattern of glomerular damage, the extent of tubulointerstitial inflammation, and the extent of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, although with variable certainty. The effect of treatment to reduce these risks often remains disappointing and is also poorly estimated with these factors, making prognosis difficult to establish.

The complement system plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of LN. Immune complexes are deposited or formed in the kidneys and bind complement factor C1q. Due to activation by C1q and other unknown mechanisms, complement factor C3 is deposited as well. The co-deposition of Igs, C1q, and C3 is characteristic of LN. Circulating C3 and C4 are often depressed due to their consumption, which is associated with disease activity. Complement activation is also associated with subclinical disease and flares. Some cases have been successfully treated with the complement inhibitor eculizumab, and other complement inhibitors are currently being developed for treatment.

The relevance of renal deposition of complement factors for the prognosis and treatment of LN has, nonetheless, been little studied. Such a role has been demonstrated in other renal diseases with dysregulation of the complement system.

### Hydroxychloroquine improves low complement levels [^115d4s87]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Having a low complement level is associated with clinical systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity and future organ damage. We studied the association of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) whole blood levels with changes in complement level.

- **Methods**: We performed two analyses on data prospectively collected from an SLE cohort. In the first, a "new starts on HCQ" analysis, we compared changes in complement level between those starting HCQ and those not starting it. The second analysis evaluated the association between HCQ whole blood levels and low complement level in all cohort visits using conditional logistic regression.

- **Results**: In the "new starts on HCQ" analysis, a higher percentage of patients starting HCQ (as reflected in HCQ blood levels > 50) experienced a normalization of C4 level compared to those not starting HCQ (23 of 57 [40%] vs. 9 of 56 [13%]; P = 0.011), as well as a significantly greater increase in both C3 and C4 level (P = 0.048 and P = 0.017, respectively). In the "all cohort visits" analysis, there was a statistically significant higher probability of having normal C4 levels in visits with higher HCQ whole blood levels (odds ratio 1.8–2.6 depending on the levels), with this relationship being most pronounced for whole blood HCQ levels of 200 ng/mL or more.

- **Conclusion**: We observed significant improvement in complement levels when HCQ was started and among those with higher whole blood levels of HCQ, particularly with respect to C4. Modulating the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to complement consumption may be one mode by which HCQ prevents poor outcomes.

### Erythrocyte C4d and complement receptor 1 in systemic lupus erythematosus [^116h1iWf]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Complement activation and ineffective clearance of complement-bearing immune complexes via erythrocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Abnormally high levels of erythrocyte C4d and low levels of complement receptor 1 (CD35) have been reported in SLE and might have diagnostic utility. We investigated whether erythrocyte C4d and complement receptor 1 were specific for SLE and whether there was any association with disease activity.

- **Methods**: Expression of complement receptor 1 (CD35) and complement protein C4d on erythrocytes was measured by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry on the same day as the blood draw, in patients with SLE, patients with rheumatic disease, and in normal controls.

- **Results**: Within the SLE population, there was no association with disease activity measured by the physician's global assessment or SELENA SLE Disease Activity Index, nor with past or lupus nephritis. Assays were not specific for SLE, with higher levels also seen in antiphospholipid syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: The overlap of erythrocyte C4d and CD35 between SLE and other rheumatic diseases limits their utility as diagnostic tests. However, longitudinal investigation of these assays is warranted, especially given the higher levels in some patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^111uuetg]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

A possible limitation to the use of complement split products for evaluation of SLE disease activity is that not all manifestations may be related to detectable systemic activation of complement. Dermoepidermal junction deposition of C3d and C4d are observed in the skin of patients with active SLE rash, suggesting that complement split products are generated. Nevertheless, we found that lupus rash alone did not correlate with changes in the iC3b:C3 ratio. This suggests that a certain threshold of complement activation, perhaps combined with perfusion characteristics of the inflamed organ, is required.

We observed that CRP levels were independently associated with active disease based on the serology‐free SLEDAI‐2K RI‐50 scores. CRP levels were found to poorly correlate with anti‐dsDNA antibody levels and low complement levels, and thus this measure is thought to be poorly associated with disease activity in SLE. Nevertheless, increases in the CRP level of ~15 mg/liter have been observed during flares, particularly in patients with serositis. We agree with the findings of others that increases in the CRP level during active disease are attenuated as compared to what might be anticipated; this could explain why a signal was observed only when anti‐dsDNA antibody levels and hypocomplementemia were removed from the analysis.

We acknowledge that there may be variability in how iC3b:C3 ratios behave depending on as yet undiscovered patient disease characteristics. However, our data demonstrate that the measurement of iC3b:C3 ratios is more informative than traditional.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^11773dsk]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Sixty-nine patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) completed a follow-up visit 9–18 months after enrollment. Follow-up visits were conducted at all sites, and there were no differences in age, sex, time since diagnosis, race/ethnicity, or fulfillment of SLICC criteria or individual ACR criteria between the group of patients who had a follow-up visit in this time frame (n = 69) and those who did not (n = 23) (data not shown). Disease activity was slightly higher in the group that did not attend a follow-up visit (nonserologic SELENA–SLEDAI 2.09 versus 1.09; P = 0.04).

Of the 69 patients who completed a follow-up visit, 20 (29%) fulfilled ≥ 1 additional ACR criterion. Hematologic disorder was the criterion fulfilled with the highest frequency (50%), followed by oral ulcers (19%), immunologic disorder (8%), serositis (8%), arthritis (8%), photosensitivity (4%), and rash (4%). Of the 13 patients who fulfilled an additional hematologic criterion at follow-up, 10 had lymphopenia as their sole feature. Of these, 3 were receiving medications that might have affected lymphocyte counts: azathioprine 50 mg/day, methotrexate 15 mg/week, and/or mycophenolate 2,000 mg/day plus prednisone 2.5 mg/day. Investigators concluded that the lymphopenias were due to SLE.

The fulfillment of the SLICC criteria at enrollment did not predict fulfillment of the ACR criteria 18 months later. Of the 69 patients with probable SLE who completed a follow-up visit, 26 (38%) had fulfilled SLICC criteria at enrollment and 43 (62%) had not. Ten of the 26 patients with probable SLE who had fulfilled SLICC at enrollment…

### Differentiating between activation via the lectin or the classical complement pathway in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^112c7pMh]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

Complement activation is a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and can proceed through the classical (CP), lectin (LP), or alternative pathway (AP). When managing SLE patients, pathway-specific complement activation is rarely monitored as clinical assays are unavailable. In this study, we aim to differentiate between CP- or LP-mediated complement activation in SLE patients by quantifying pathway-specific protein complexes, namely C1s/C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) (CP-specific activation) and MASP-1/C1-INH (LP-specific activation). Levels for both complexes were assessed in 156 SLE patients and 50 controls using two newly developed ELISAs.

We investigated whether pathway-specific complement activation was associated with disease activity and lupus nephritis (LN). Disease activity stratification was performed using SLEDAI scores assessed at inclusion. C1s/C1-INH concentrations were significantly increased in active SLE patients (SLEDAI ≥ 6) when compared with SLE patients with low disease activity (SLEDAI < 6) and correlated with SLEDAI score (r = .29, P < 0.01). In active LN, MASP-1/C1-INH plasma concentrations were significantly increased compared with nonactive LN (P = 0.02). No differences in MASP-1/C1-INH plasma concentrations were observed between active SLE patients and patients with low disease activity (P = 0.11), nor did we observe a significant correlation with disease activity (r = 0.12, P = 0.15).

Our data suggest that the CP and the LP are activated in SLE. The CP is activated in active SLE disease, whereas activation of the LP might be more specific to certain conditions within the disease spectrum.

### Complement consumption in systemic lupus erythematosus leads to decreased opsonophagocytosis [^113e8Tz9]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The high prevalence of infections in SLE is attributed to both the disease and its treatments. The complement system plays an important role in host immune responses against invading microorganisms. We sought to provide the experimental and clinical evidence supporting the hypothesis that low levels of complement factors cause defective complement-mediated opsonization in patients with SLE.

- **Methods**: Staphylococcus aureus was opsonized with sera from healthy individuals (n = 16), SLE patients with normal (n = 5), or low complement (n = 8) levels. Phagocytosis of S. aureus by healthy human neutrophils was analyzed by an imaging flow cytometry-based method. We retrospectively examined the infection incidence in relation to complement levels in a cohort of 165 patients with SLE during a 1.5-year period. The association was analyzed for infection incidence and disease-related variables.

- **Results**: Uptake of S. aureus by neutrophils was decreased when S. aureus was opsonized with sera from SLE patients with low complement levels compared to sera from healthy individuals and SLE patients with normal complement. In our SLE cohort, 44% of patients had at least 1 infection during the 1.5 years. No significant association was observed between complement levels and infection risk. Importantly, high-dose glucocorticoids (GC; prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day) were the most important predictive factor for infections in patients with SLE.

- **Conclusion**: Low complement levels affect opsonization efficiency, but glucocorticoid usage was a stronger factor for infection risk.

### Plasma C4d levels correlate with treatment response and renal activity in proliferative lupus nephritis [^112FfJwK]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate complement factors in lupus nephritis (LN) in relation to treatment response and the impact of underlying genetics of C4.

- **Methods**: Seventy-seven patients with active LN confirmed by a kidney biopsy, and in whom second biopsies had been performed after immunosuppressive treatment, were included. Complement factors C3, C4, C4d, and the C4d/C4 ratio were evaluated at the biopsy time-points. The gene copy number variations of C4 (C4A and C4B) were also investigated.

- **Results**: At baseline, 60 patients had class III/IV ± V proliferative LN (PLN) and 17 had class V membranous LN (MLN). Levels of C3 and C4 increased, while C4d and the C4d/C4 ratio decreased after treatment (p < 0.0001), observed in treatment-responding PLN patients but not in MLN. C4d, C4, and the C4d/C4 ratio at second biopsies were associated with clinical response in PLN, and low C4d levels were found in PLN with histopathological response (p = 0.008). Renal activity index at second biopsies correlated with C4d and C4d/C4, but not with C3 or C4. C4 gene copy number variations were not associated with clinical or histopathological response.

- **Conclusion**: All complement markers were affected by immunosuppressive therapy and associated with the response to therapy. Levels of C4d and the C4d/C4 ratio at follow-up biopsies showed a strong association with both clinical and histopathological response in PLN. The correlation with elevated C4d and the C4d/C4 ratio, alongside persisting high activity index on repeated biopsies, strengthens the findings on C4d as a promising biomarker for treatment response in PLN. The C4 genetic variations did not influence C4 levels.

### Complement and its breakdown products in SLE [^1173HvmK]. Rheumatology (2005). High credibility.

The complement system has important protective functions in both the innate and adaptive immune systems but can also, when inappropriately activated, cause tissue damage. Complement deficiency predisposes individuals to infections and the development of autoimmune diseases, especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Simultaneously, complement is involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. This review discusses various aspects of this dualism.

- **Activation pathways and products**: An overview of the activation pathways and activation products is provided.
- **Autoimmunity against complement**: A detailed description of autoimmunity against complement is discussed.
- **Complement regulation in therapeutics**: The potential of complement regulation in future therapeutics is explored.

### The innate immune perspective of autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions [^113nF474]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Various proteins are utilized by the innate immune system, including the complex complement system. This system encompasses a cascade of activated and regulatory proteins that recognize and eliminate pathogens by directly killing infected cells or initiating phagocytosis. Deficiency of complement proteins is linked with immune deficiency (e.g. meningococcal infections), autoimmunity, and other immune-mediated conditions (e.g. hereditary angioedema).

Notably, the complement system is essential for the production of immune complexes and is activated concomitantly during innate and adaptive responses. Activation of the complement system initiates a proteolytic cascade through one of three pathways: classical, alternative, or the lectin pathway. Typical complement activation and consumption in certain autoimmune diseases are mediated by one of these specific pathways. In this manner, differences in the complement pattern of deficiencies may be unique to each disease.

Low or absent levels of the classical pathway components are associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or SLE-like syndromes in humans and animal models. Abnormal activation of the classical pathway is also linked to cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. This small vessel vasculitis may be monoclonal, mixed, or polyclonal, and one of its hallmarks is the consumption of C4, C1q, and abnormal CH50. In contrast, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis involves the alternative pathway, with a pivotal role of C5a in the stimulation and degranulation of neutrophils. Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), another vasculitic disease, is related to a

### Elevated serum interferon-α2 associates with activity and flare risk in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^113GkhWQ]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Despite the routine use of conventional biomarkers, including anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, complement levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR), to monitor disease activity of SLE patients, none of these have demonstrated sufficient reliability to base therapeutic decision-making solely on laboratory parameters. Although the pathogenesis of SLE is complex and still incompletely elucidated, the role of type I interferon (IFN), especially IFN-α2, has been established.

Direct quantification of IFN is challenging due to low serum concentrations (even associated with disease flares) that are not detectable by the currently available immunoassays. To overcome this, indirect measurement of IFN pathway activation has been proposed by evaluating the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in peripheral blood cells, known as the IFN signature. Notably, the predominance of type I IFN activation is more pronounced in jSLE than in adult-onset SLE, as 95% of pediatric patients display a pathological type I IFN signature in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as compared with 50–80% of adult-onset SLE patients. However, at the time of writing, the IFN signature has not yet become a common tool in routine laboratory settings due to the relative complexity of the technique, lack of standardization, and its limited availability.

A novel ultra-sensitive digital immunoassay known as single-molecule array (Simoa), able to detect extremely low protein concentrations, has overcome these challenges, allowing direct quantification of this cytokine. Studies in progress are expected to shed more light on its clinical applications.

### Rheumatic syndromes associated with complement deficiency [^114gHhVg]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Deficiency of an early component of the classical complement pathway, such as C1q, C1r/C1s, C4, or C2, regularly produces autoimmunity in humans, especially systemic lupus erythematosus. It has long been suggested that disruption of this pathway would lead to the inappropriate handling of immune complexes. An intriguing hypothesis that builds on this idea relates to a defect in the clearance of one's own cellular debris, namely apoptotic cells. An attractive feature of this emerging concept is that blebs on apoptotic cells are decorated with antigens to which much of the autoantibody specificity is directed in systemic lupus erythematosus.

A second hypothesis, generated primarily from studies of complement deficiencies, relates to an impairment in the humoral immune response or in the regulation of autoreactive B cells. This review begins by summarizing the recognized autoimmune manifestations of complement deficiency and then describes new data derived from targeted gene deletions of complement proteins.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^116CKQR1]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

We also studied patients with SS, since they can exhibit numerous autoantibodies and low serum complement levels. We observed an increased frequency of positive CB‐CAPs compared to low serum complement levels (10% versus 2%) in SS patients, but these were not significantly different from frequencies in the control group with other rheumatic diseases. However, the MAP did show a higher positivity rate than in the control group (27% versus 4%), possibly because of the high titers of ANA found in our SS cohort (data not shown), which can influence the results of the algorithm. Since only 2% of the SS patients exhibited low serum C3 or C4 levels, it is possible that our group of 50 patients is not representative of the large cohorts that have been studied in the past.

A limitation of this study is the small cohort size of patients with probable SLE for whom we have follow‐up data, as well as the relatively short follow‐up period. However, 20 of the 69 patients (29%) who had a follow‐up visit within 18 months fulfilled a fourth ACR criterion in this time frame, confirming our expectation that this cohort from academic lupus centers might be more likely to progress to classifiable SLE than prior studies have suggested. Another limitation is that retrospective determination of whether patients fulfill classification criteria is dependent on a comprehensive review of prior medical records and laboratory test results (including the presence of leukopenia or lymphopenia), and these may not have been available for all patients at every site.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^111T4ktf]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Better discrimination of SLE disease activity with iC3b:C3 ratios than with low C3 or low C4 levels

We evaluated the ability of the iC3b:C3 ratio to discriminate between active and inactive SLE, in comparison to the discriminative abilities of iC3b, C3, and C4 levels by performing ROC curve analyses. The iC3b:C3 ratio performed the best in terms of discriminating active disease (AUC 0.6594, 95% CI 0.6076–0.7112), followed by anti-dsDNA antibody levels (AUC 0.6578, 95% CI 0.6066–0.7091), C3 levels (AUC 0.6444, 95% CI 0.5896–0.6993), iC3b levels (AUC 0.5909, 95% CI 0.5384–0.6435), and C4 levels (AUC 0.6177, 95% CI 0.5615–0.6738).

We confirmed these results using the serology-free SLEDAI-2K RI-50 scores for measuring change in disease activity. The iC3b:C3 ratios (AUC 0.5931, 95% CI 0.5406–0.6456), anti-dsDNA antibody levels (AUC 0.5688, 95% CI 0.5178–0.6199), and C3 levels (AUC 0.5807, 95% CI 0.5275–0.6339) were all statistically significant in discriminating active disease from inactive disease. In contrast, iC3b levels (AUC 0.4487, 95% CI 0.3965–0.5010) and C4 levels (AUC 0.5489, 95% CI 0.4944–0.6033) did not show any significant ability to discriminate active disease from inactive disease.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus multiorgan flare with quiescent serologic markers [^113zuQzf]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can affect almost every organ with differing degrees of severity. Typically, SLE activity is associated with hypocomplementaemia and elevated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) levels. We describe a case of a severe multiorgan lupus flare, including lupus cerebritis, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, lupus nephritis, and lupus myopericarditis, with normal complement and dsDNA levels. This highlights the importance of understanding the heterogeneous nature of SLE flares.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^112yDZUs]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

The baseline characteristics of the 159 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who participated in the study are detailed in Table 1. These patients consented to participate in the pilot phase of the CASTLE study. The cohort comprised 89.3% females, with 57.9% identifying as African American and 42.1% as of European descent. The mean age was 41.3 years (SD ± 13.6).

Regarding SLE characteristics, 67.8% of patients tested positive for anti‐dsDNA antibodies, while 37.1% were receiving a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone (defined as > 7.5 mg/day), with the mean dose being 16.1 mg/day (SD ± 14.5). Renal manifestations, such as urinary casts, proteinuria, hematuria, or pyuria, were present in 18.2% of patients. The mean SLEDAI‐2K disease activity score at baseline was 5.14 (SD ± 5.74). Mean blood iC3b levels were 4.47 μg/ml (SD ± 2.83, range 0.7–21.0), and the mean iC3b:C3 ratio was 5.01 μg/mg (SD ± 6.11, range 0.66–74.51).

The characteristics of the 48 healthy control subjects are available in Supplementary Table 1 on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website.

### Renal deposits of complement factors as predictors of end-stage renal disease and death in patients with lupus nephritis [^1111G4Gn]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Objective: Lupus nephritis (LN) increases the risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death, but these risks are difficult to estimate. Since complement factors play an essential role in the pathogenesis and are deposited in the kidneys as C1q and C3, we studied whether these deposits predict ESRD and death in patients with LN.

Methods: We collected demographic, clinical, and pathological data from 183 adult patients with LN classes II-V diagnosed with a first native kidney biopsy. Pathological data included the localization and intensity of immunofluorescence staining of C1q and C3. We obtained dates of incident ESRD and death from the United States Renal Data System and National Death Index, respectively, and evaluated survival curves and hazard ratios for ESRD and death as a composite outcome and as separate outcomes.

Results: The presence and intensity of deposits of C1q and C3 in glomeruli, tubular walls, and vascular walls differed between classes and were associated with known unfavorable prognostic factors, such as hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocomplementemia. However, over a median follow-up of 7.5 years, their presence and intensity were associated with neither survival free of ESRD and death nor hazard ratios for ESRD and death.

Conclusion: Renal deposits of complement factors did not predict ESRD and death in patients with LN.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^116XCZiq]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

In summary, our data show that positive CB‐CAPs alone or in the MAP algorithm are present in a higher percentage of patients with SLE and patients with probable SLE compared to antibodies to dsDNA or low serum complement levels. The relatively high positivity rate of CB‐CAPs and the MAP in the probable SLE group suggests that complement activation might occur early in the evolution of SLE and may be a feature in patients with suspected lupus. In addition, patients with probable SLE who had a MAP score of > 0.8 or an EC4d MFI of > 20 at enrollment were more likely to fulfill a fourth ACR criterion during a relatively brief follow‐up; these biomarkers predicted the transition to SLE better than other clinical and laboratory parameters. The detection of complement activation in patients with probable lupus who do not fulfill ACR criteria or even SLICC criteria could have implications with regard to treatment, as early appropriate therapy in these patients may potentially slow the rate of disease progression.

### Usefulness of erythrocyte-bound C4d as a biomarker to predict disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^1144BHGY]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

SLE is an autoimmune disorder characterized by abnormal complement activation. Numerous new biomarkers have recently been used to diagnose or monitor disease activity in patients with SLE. We checked the levels of erythrocyte-bound C4d (E-C4d), an activation-derived fragment of C4 that is deposited on the erythrocytes, under different conditions of SLE to correlate these levels with disease activity.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional investigation of three groups of patients: (i) 63 patients with SLE; (ii) 43 patients with other diseases; and (iii) 26 healthy controls. Erythrocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the levels of E-C4d.

- **Results**: We found a significant elevation in the mean levels of E-C4d in SLE patients compared with patients with other diseases or healthy controls. In SLE patients, the levels of E-C4d were correlated with the SLEDAI and inversely correlated with serum C3/C4 levels. In the subgroup of SLE patients with haemolytic anaemia (HA), a significantly higher level of E-C4d was observed than in SLE patients without HA. However, in SLE patients with HA, there was no correlation between the levels of E-C4d and other markers of disease activity, including SLEDAI and levels of anti-dsDNA, C3, and C4.

- **Conclusion**: E-C4d levels are useful diagnostic markers for SLE and can serve as biomarkers of disease activity in patients with SLE. However, E-C4d is of limited value in monitoring disease activity in SLE patients with HA.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^112UzgKP]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

To evaluate the frequency of cell-bound complement activation products (CB-CAPs) as a marker of complement activation in patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the usefulness of this biomarker was assessed as a predictor of the evolution of probable SLE into American College of Rheumatology (ACR)-classified SLE.

Patients in whom lupus was suspected by experts and who fulfilled three ACR classification criteria for probable SLE were enrolled. This study included patients with established SLE as classified by the ACR and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria, patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome, and patients with other rheumatic diseases. Individual CB-CAPs were measured by flow cytometry, and positivity rates were compared to those of commonly assessed biomarkers, including serum complement proteins (C3 and C4) and autoantibodies. The frequency of a positive multianalyte assay panel, which includes CB-CAPs, was also evaluated. Probable SLE cases were followed up prospectively.

The 92 patients with probable SLE were diagnosed more recently than the 53 patients with established SLE, and their use of antirheumatic medications was lower. At the enrollment visit, more patients with probable SLE were positive for CB-CAPs (28%) or anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (40%) than had low complement levels (9%) [P = 0.0001 for each]. In probable SLE, CB-CAP scores of > 0.8 at enrollment predicted fulfillment of a fourth ACR criterion within 18 months (hazard ratio 3.11, P < 0.01).

Complement activation occurs in some patients with probable SLE and can be detected with higher frequency by evaluating CB-CAPs and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies than by assessing traditional complement levels.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^113hJQvS]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

The iC3b:C3 ratio has the capacity to discriminate active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from inactive cases and major flares from no disease activity. Receiver operating characteristic curves using the iC3b:C3 ratio and blood levels of iC3b, C3, C4, and anti–double-stranded (anti-ds) antibodies were used to differentiate active from inactive SLE using the complete Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) Responder Index 50 (RI-50) score. The evaluations included the following comparisons: active versus inactive SLE using the serology-free-2K-50 score and major flare versus no disease activity. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to quantify the discriminative ability, with a 95% confidence interval reported.

We further explored whether the iC3b:C3 ratio could discriminate between patients presenting with a major SLE flare, according to the Fortin definition, and patients with no disease activity (SLEDAI-2K RI-50 score of 0). The iC3b:C3 ratio proved superior in terms of discriminating a major disease flare (AUC 0.6611, 95% CI 0.5761–0.7461) compared to iC3b levels (AUC 0.6112, 95% CI 0.5252–0.6971), C3 levels (AUC 0.6273, 95% CI 0.5379–0.7166), and C4 levels (AUC 0.5989, 95% CI 0.5071–0.6907), as shown in Figure 4. However, it was inferior to the discriminative ability of anti-dsDNA antibody levels (AUC 0.7395, 95% CI 0.6662–0.8128).

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^114Quq4o]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

When we examined the strength of association of iC3b:C3 ratios with the presence of lupus rash only, in comparison to that in patients with no active disease, no correlation was observed (Figure 5 D). Moreover, none of the other biochemical measures (anti-dsDNA antibody levels, C3 levels, C4 levels, ESR, or iC3b levels) correlated with the presence of lupus rash. This establishes that the iC3b:C3 ratio may not correlate with all disease manifestations in SLE.

### Novel assays to assess the functional capacity of the classical, the alternative and the lectin pathways of the complement system [^116p2JF4]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Deficiencies in many of the complement proteins and their regulatory molecules have been described, and a variety of diseases, such as reinfections, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and renal diseases, may be linked to deficiency in the complement system. Screening for complement defects is, therefore, of great importance. In this study, we present novel improved enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the functional assessment of the three individual pathways of the complement system. The method is applicable at high serum concentrations, and we demonstrate that it minimizes both false negative as well as false positive results. In particular, for functional mannose-binding lectin activity, it represents an improvement on the existing assays. In this respect, the present assays represent novel improved diagnostic protocols for patients with suspected immunodeficiencies related to the complement system.

### Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are deficient in complement-dependent prevention of immune precipitation [^116aUpmc]. Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

A functional deficiency of complement has been implicated but not conclusively demonstrated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To test this, several aspects of complement were studied in 44 patients with SLE, 46 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 102 blood donors.

- **Methods**: Prevention of immune precipitation (PIP) was measured by an enzyme immunoassay. Levels of C1q, C4, and C3 were assessed by rocket immunoelectrophoresis, whereas C4A, C4B, and C3d were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Complement haemolysis (CH50) was determined by standard methods, and C4 allotypes were analyzed using high-voltage agarose electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

- **Results**: PIP was significantly reduced in SLE (P < 0.001). The defect was identified by a sensitive assay measuring complement function but not by the other tests employed. The patients were clinically well at the time of study, and levels of C3d, which are known to correlate with disease activity, were normal. The defect was more common in patients with early disease (P = 0.009), supporting a role in aetiology or early pathophysiology. PIP positively correlated with levels of C4 (P = 3 × 10⁻⁵) and specifically the C4A isotype (P = 9 × 10⁻¹⁰), whereas C4B was redundant.

- **Conclusions**: The results reveal a defect in the prevention of immune precipitation in SLE that is apparent at an early stage and correlates with low levels of C4A. These findings suggest that subtle deficiencies of complement may predispose individuals to SLE.

### Case report: Lupus nephritis with autoantibodies to complement alternative pathway proteins and C3 gene mutation [^113fg1Bb]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Lupus patients usually have low C3 and C4 levels during disease flares because of activation of the complement system by immune complexes (ICs). However, during remission periods, complement levels reach normal values. Activation of the complement system by deposited ICs causes tissue damage. On the other hand, components of the classical pathway (CP) play a protective role in facilitating the clearance of ICs and apoptotic bodies. Their deficiency increases the risk of SLE. This association is explained not only by ICs removal from circulation but also by other mechanisms, including reduction of activation thresholds of lymphocytes and loss of self-tolerance.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^111ToWQa]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The number of organ manifestations at enrollment did not contribute to progression. Among the 69 patients with probable SLE who had a follow-up visit, 41 (59%) had one organ manifestation (including hematologic, excluding immunologic), and 28 (41%) had two. Of the 41 patients with one organ involved, 14 (34%) transitioned to classifiable SLE, whereas of the 28 patients with two organs involved, 6 (21%) transitioned. This difference was not significant (P = 0.29).

At follow-up, HCQ use increased from 63% to 74%. Among the 20 patients who converted to classifiable SLE, HCQ use increased from 75% to 80%.

- **Biomarker analysis at baseline and follow-up**: Most patients with SLE and probable SLE were ANA-positive on the day of the enrollment visit. The ANA IFA assay used in this study was more sensitive than an ELISA in most cases, although ANA positivity is known to vary greatly depending on the assay platform or kit used. Specificity of ANA for SLE was low, while anti-dsDNA had a high specificity for SLE, as 2% of the patients with SS and none of the patients with other diseases were anti-dsDNA–positive. Anti-dsDNA sensitivity was low for SLE (38%) and even lower for probable SLE (11%), although among patients with probable SLE, positivity for anti-dsDNA was more frequent in those who fulfilled the SLICC criteria than in those who did not (20% versus 5%; P = 0.039). Unsurprisingly, anti-SSA and anti-SSB positivity rates were highest among SS patients, whereas RF and anti-CCP positivity was observed mainly in RA patients.

### Predictors of renal flares in systemic lupus erythematosus: A post-hoc analysis of four phase III clinical trials of belimumab [^1153uydx]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

High baseline proteinuria levels, hypoalbuminaemia, and C3 consumption were associated with renal flare development in this clinical trial setting, comprising patients with active SLE yet no severe ongoing renal disease. In addition to anti-dsDNA, anti-ribosomal P protein antibody positivity may prove a valuable early signal of impending renal flares in belimumab-treated patients, whereas anti-Sm antibody positivity may predict renal flares in patients treated with non-biologic standard therapy. While low C3 and positive anti-dsDNA levels constitute serological features of known importance in the surveillance of renal SLE, levels of serum albumin, anti-Sm antibodies, and anti-ribosomal P protein antibodies are less established biomarkers in SLE. Further investigation of the predictive properties of these traditional markers, as well as combined biomarker panels in SLE populations, has merit.

### Complement classical pathway components are all important in clearance of apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells [^116kkFCK]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Inherited deficiencies in components of the classical complement pathway are strong disease susceptibility factors for the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and there is a hierarchy among deficiency states, the strongest association being with C1q deficiency. We investigated the relative importance of the different complement pathways regarding the clearance of apoptotic cells. Phagocytosis of labeled apoptotic Jurkat cells by monocyte-derived macrophages in the presence of sera from individuals with complement deficiencies was studied, as well as C3 deposition on apoptotic cells using flow cytometry. Sera from individuals deficient in C1q, C4, C2, or C3 all showed decreased phagocytosis. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and the alternative pathway did not influence phagocytosis. Notably, the components of the complement classical pathway, including C1q, were equally important in the clearance of apoptotic cells.

This indicates that the deposition of C3 fragments is of major significance; we therefore studied C3 deposition on apoptotic cells. Experiments with MBL-deficient serum depleted of C1q or factor D confirmed the predominance of the classical pathway. At low dilution, sera deficient in C1q, C4, or C2 supported C3 fragment deposition, demonstrating alternative pathway activation. In conclusion, we have found that complement-mediated opsonization and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, particularly those undergoing secondary necrosis, are dependent mainly upon an intact classical pathway. The alternative pathway is less important but may play a role in some conditions.

### The evolving landscape for complement therapeutics in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases [^1111cqeR]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The complement system is increasingly understood to play major roles in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Because of this situation, there are rapidly expanding commercial efforts to develop novel complement inhibitors and effector pathway-modulating drugs. This review provides insights into the evolving understanding of the complement system components, mechanisms of activation within and across the three pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin), how the pathways are normally controlled and then dysregulated in target tissues, and what diseases are known to be, in large part, complement-dependent through the successful development and approval of complement therapeutics in patients. Mechanisms of complement activation in rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and thrombotic microangiopathies are also illustrated. In addition, the specific therapeutic drugs that are both approved and under development are discussed in the context of both nonrheumatic and rheumatic diseases. Finally, the methods by which the complement system can be assessed in humans through biomarker studies are outlined, with the goal of understanding, in specific patients, how the system is functioning.

### Serum amyloid P component-DNA complexes are decreased in systemic lupus erythematosus. Inverse association with anti-dsDNA antibodies [^1168Sris]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine serum levels of serum amyloid P component (SAP) and SAP-DNA complexes in a population-based cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

The methods involved a study population comprising 82 unselected patients of predominantly Scandinavian ancestry with SLE, as defined by classification criteria. Serum samples were collected at baseline and serially for up to two years. SAP component and SAP-DNA complexes were measured using ELISA. Associations between SAP-DNA and clinical manifestations or serological findings were analyzed. Ninety healthy, age-matched blood donors served as controls.

In the results, SLE patients had normal serum concentrations of SAP, whereas SAP-DNA complexes were decreased. Two-thirds of the SLE patients tested persistently SAP-DNA complex-negative. There was no relationship between the occurrence of SAP-DNA complexes and clinical manifestations. SAP-DNA-negative patients tended to have lower leukocyte counts and complement C3 levels, alongside higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C3d levels compared to SAP-DNA-positive patients. An inverse association was noted between the occurrence of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies and SAP-DNA complexes. Co-occurrence of SAP-DNA complexes and anti-dsDNA antibodies was demonstrated in only one SLE patient, suggesting that 81 out of 82 patients were discordant for the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies and SAP-DNA complexes.

The conclusion emphasizes that the decreased level of SAP-DNA complexes in SLE patients and the inverse relationship between these complexes and anti-dsDNA antibodies support the concept that…

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^114gX1nd]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Table 3: HRs of biomarkers predicting fulfillment of ACR classification criteria by 18 months in patients with probable SLE.

- **Biomarkers and their predictive value**: Various biomarkers were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in predicting the progression of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in patients deemed probable cases. The hazard ratios (HRs) indicate the likelihood of these biomarkers in fulfilling the ACR classification criteria within an 18-month period for these patients.

The study's findings suggest a moderate efficacy of biomarkers in predicting disease progression, highlighting potential areas for further research and validation.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^112EJLP6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Since we recruited patients from academic sites where large lupus cohorts were being followed up, the likelihood of a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosis was based on expert opinion. We surmised that a higher percentage of these selected patients with probable SLE would be more likely to develop a fourth American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criterion over 2–3 years than those in a more loosely defined probable SLE group. This is supported by the observation that 35 of 92 patients with probable SLE (38%), who did not meet the ACR classification for SLE, did meet the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification criteria at enrollment. This suggests that the investigators considered ≥ 1 SLICC feature in their evaluations to not be definitely related to SLE, since those patients could have been included in the SLE group instead of the probable SLE group. This also highlights an important difference between classification criteria and diagnosis.

- **SLICC criteria comparison**: A similar percentage of SLICC criteria fulfillment was found in a recently described cohort of patients who fulfilled 3 ACR criteria 37.

- **Progression in follow-up**: Furthermore, in the present study, 29% of the 69 patients with a follow‐up visit within 18 months acquired a fourth ACR criterion, a much higher rate in a shorter period than shown in prior studies 13, 24.

### Variations of C3 and C4 before and during pregnancy in systemic lupus erythematosus: Association with disease flares and obstetric outcomes [^113TtQAj]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

The study aimed to analyze complement level variations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pregnancies, focusing on disease flares and obstetric complications. SLE pregnancies, prospectively followed by multidisciplinary teams from 1987 to 2018 in two Italian rheumatology centers, were retrospectively analyzed. As a reference, pregnancy-modified ranges of normal levels of C3 and C4 were derived from 175 pregnancies from the general obstetric population, as previously described by our group.

Two hundred forty-six pregnancies in 172 patients with SLE were analyzed. Eighty-nine percent were live births. Thirty-five flares were recorded in 30 pregnancies (12.2%), and obstetric complications occurred in 47 pregnancies (19.1%), including 27 pregnancy losses, 11 severely preterm births (2 resulting in perinatal death), and 15 hypertensive disorders. C3 and C4 levels were higher in the general obstetric population than in patients with SLE, at any time point. C3 and C4 levels progressively increased during pregnancy in both general obstetric and SLE pregnancies without flares and obstetric complications, whereas this physiological increase was not observed in pregnancies with flares or obstetric complications. A significantly higher frequency of low C4 was found in pregnancies with flares (at preconception and in each trimester) and preterm births (at preconception). In multivariate analysis, low C4 at preconception was associated with flares (odds ratio 13.81, 95% CI 3.10–61.43, P < 0.001).

In conclusion, low C4 at preconception was found to be an independent risk factor for SLE flare during pregnancy.

### Canadian rheumatology association recommendations for the assessment and monitoring of systemic lupus erythematosus [^1149i3aA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the diagnostic investigations for systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly concerning the initial evaluation, the CRA 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining baseline laboratory tests. The recommended tests may include, but are not limited to:

- **CBC, CK, and liver enzymes**: These are essential for evaluating the overall health status of the patient.
- **Creatinine, eGFR, urinalysis, urine microscopy, and urine protein-creatinine ratio**: These tests assess kidney function and detect potential kidney involvement.
- **CRP, ESR, and complements (C3, C4)**: These markers help evaluate inflammation and detect complement system abnormalities.
- **Anti-dsDNA, ANA, and antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens**: These are specific tests for lupus that help confirm the diagnosis.
- **Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β-2-glycoprotein I**: These tests screen for anticoagulant issues and antiphospholipid syndrome.
- **Lipid profile**: This is important to assess cardiovascular risk factors associated with lupus.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^114oizgG]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Recently, serum and plasma levels of C3dg and plasma levels of C4d have been shown to be useful in distinguishing between subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and healthy controls. Furthermore, plasma C4d levels correlated with disease activity in patients with SLE and were predictive of the future recurrence of nephritis. In summary, complement split products appear to offer promise as biomarkers of SLE disease activity.

Compared to CB-CAPs, soluble complement split products confer the advantages of shorter half-lives and more rapid result turnaround. One such split product, iC3b, is the breakdown product of C3b with a half-life of approximately 90 minutes. In comparison, C3a has a half-life of approximately 2 minutes, and C3d has a half-life of about 50 hours. These properties offer the potential for employing iC3b to measure complement activation at the time of sampling. The extremely short half-lives of C3a and C3b may prevent their detection, while the longer half-life of C3d may not adequately reflect complement activation. Two prior studies utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to examine iC3b levels in SLE patients found that plasma and serum iC3b levels were increased in patients with active SLE compared to healthy controls. However, these data may have been confounded by in vitro activation of C3, leading to artefactually elevated iC3b levels, thereby limiting past determinations of iC3b as a useful biomarker.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^115ZQ62v]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Study populations: Adult patients were enrolled, in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, from 2015 to 2017. Central or internal review boards at seven academic institutions approved the study, and all subjects provided informed consent. Patients were recruited from lupus cohorts and faculty practices overseen by an experienced SLE investigator.

Patients with SLE fulfilled both the ACR classification criteria and the SLICC classification criteria for SLE at enrollment. Patients with probable SLE were enrolled if they fulfilled three ACR criteria, irrespective of whether they fulfilled the SLICC criteria, and if the investigator had a high suspicion of the diagnosis of lupus. Patients with probable SLE could not be enrolled if they had proteinuria of > 200 mg or biopsy‐proven lupus nephritis. Investigators were asked to examine the historic electronic records for clinical, hematologic, and immunologic features. The date of diagnosis for probable SLE was the date on which the third ACR criterion was confirmed.

### Lessons of the Elwha River: Managing health hazards during dam removal [^112yvUy1]. Environmental Health Perspectives (2012). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, decreased serum complement C3 can be caused by a variety of conditions including burn injury, lupus nephritis, infective endocarditis, invasive meningococcal disease, and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. It can also result from systemic lupus erythematosus, partial lipodystrophy, complement factor H deficiency, hereditary C3 deficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation, protein-losing enteropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and cryoglobulinemia. Additional causes include atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, hepatitis C virus infection, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease.

### All things complement [^111QxZKh]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The complement (C) cascade is an ancient system of proteins whose primary role is to initiate and modulate immune responses. During C activation, circulating proteins are cleaved, and nascent cleavage fragments participate in a broad range of downstream innate and adaptive immune functions. Although the majority of these functions are either homeostatic or protective, a large body of experimental and clinical evidence also highlights a central role for the C system in the pathogenesis of many types of glomerular disease. From classic pathway activation in lupus nephritis to alternative pathway dysregulation in C3 glomerulopathy, our understanding of the spectrum of C involvement in kidney disease has expanded greatly in recent years. However, the characteristics that make the glomerulus so uniquely susceptible to C-mediated injury are not fully understood, and this remains an area of ongoing investigation. Several C inhibitors have been approved for clinical use, and additional C inhibitory drugs are in development. The use of these drugs in patients with kidney disease will expand our understanding of the benefits and limitations of C inhibition.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^1152av6N]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

In each patient, the assessment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity was conducted using the SLEDAI 2000 (SLEDAI‐2K; scale 0–105) at the initial study visit and the SLEDAI‐2K Responder Index 50 (RI‐50) at every subsequent visit. The SLEDAI‐2K RI‐50 was chosen due to its capability to assess ≥ 50% improvement in disease activity based on the SLEDAI‐2K disease activity score from which it is derived. It is more practical for use in the clinical setting than the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group disease activity score.

Active SLE was defined as SLEDAI‐2K or SLEDAI‐2K RI‐50 scores > 4. In analyses using serology‐free SLEDAI‐2K RI‐50 scores (excluding values for complement and anti–double‐stranded DNA [anti‐dsDNA] antibody levels), scores > 2 were considered to reflect active disease. Clinically meaningful improvement was indicated by a decrease of ≥ 4 in the SLEDAI‐2K RI‐50 scores from the prior visit, while clinically meaningful deterioration (i.e. flare) was defined as an increase of ≥ 4 in SLEDAI‐2K RI‐50 scores from the previous visit. These definitions were derived from the original SLEDAI and have been validated for both the SLEDAI‐2K and SLEDAI‐2K RI‐50 instruments.

Major flares were determined using the Fortin definition, which required at least one of the following criteria to be fulfilled: 1) a new or increased prednisone dose > 20 mg/day, 2) the necessity for new or increased immunosuppression, 3) hospitalization due to SLE, or 4) death due to SLE.

Each provider received training in scoring disease activity using the SLEDAI‐2K RI‐50 instrument, and each was blinded with regard to patient identification.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^116iGKUQ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

To examine correlations between blood levels of complement split product iC3b and serum component C3 with clinically meaningful changes in disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

- **Methods**: A total of 159 consecutive patients with SLE, diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics classification criteria, were enrolled in CASTLE (Complement Activation Signatures in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), a prospective observational study. Patients with 1–7 study visits were included in this longitudinal analysis. In addition, 48 healthy volunteers were enrolled to establish a normal reference value for the ratio of blood iC3b to serum C3 concentrations. Serum C3 and C4 levels were measured by nephelometry, and blood iC3b levels were measured by a lateral flow assay. SLE disease activity was monitored with the Responder Index 50 instrument of the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000.

- **Results**: Relative changes in the iC3b:C3 ratio, levels of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, and use of a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone (> 7.5 mg/day) each independently correlated with SLE disease activity, as determined in multilevel multiple logistic regression analyses. Only the iC3b:C3 ratio was significantly associated with clinically meaningful improvements in disease activity among patients with SLE who were receiving a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone. The iC3b:C3 ratio outperformed C3 and C4 levels with regard to discriminating active SLE from inactive SLE.

### Complement C4 copy number variation is linked to SSA/Ro and SSB/La autoantibodies in systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases [^114e1PAt]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases are a group of diseases characterized by inflammation in multiple organs and the presence of antibodies targeting different ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (myositis) are all categorized as systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases. In SLE, multiple tissues and organs such as the skin, joints, cardiovascular system, and kidneys are commonly affected. In contrast, more specific involvement is seen with lacrimal and salivary glands affected in primary SS, and muscle as well as connective tissues in myositis. Despite different patterns of tissue and organ involvement, these three diseases share important features, including clinical manifestations, presence of autoantibodies to nuclear antigens, and several genetic loci.

The complement system plays an important role in the clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells. Impaired removal of cellular debris may lead to exposure of cellular self-antigens and loss of tolerance. Although mainly studied in SLE, the complement system has also been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of primary SS and myositis. Particularly relevant are the genes in the early classical complement pathway, for which deficiency in any of the genes C1Q, C1R, C1S, C2, or C4 may lead to SLE or lupus-like disease. Further, low plasma levels of C3 and C4 are routinely used in the clinical setting as biomarkers for complement activation associated with disease activity and flare.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^117AFf3k]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinically heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of diverse autoantibodies and activation of the complement system. The classification criteria for SLE by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and more recently by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) — both developed for research purposes — recognize this clinical and laboratory heterogeneity. Low levels of serum complement proteins (C3 and C4) are included in the SLICC criteria, as well as in the classification criteria newly developed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the ACR, due to the relatively high specificity of complement activation leading to low serum complement in SLE.

Despite the specificity of hypocomplementemia, its frequency in SLE is low. We have previously shown that complement activation, measured reliably by assessing cell-bound complement activation products (CB-CAPs), especially C4d bound to erythrocytes (EC4d) and to B lymphocytes (BC4d), can be detected in SLE with greater frequency than by assessing high anti–double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and low serum complement proteins.

Many patients with suspected SLE who do not fulfill ACR criteria have been designated as having "probable, possible, latent, or incomplete" SLE. There is no consensus definition or nomenclature for these patients. However, some patients develop classifiable SLE over time. Currently, there are no biomarkers to reliably distinguish who, among patients with probable SLE, will progress to fulfill the complete classification criteria.

### Renal deposits of complement factors as predictors of end-stage renal disease and death in patients with lupus nephritis [^111RZ2Ui]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) increases the risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death, but these risks are difficult to estimate. Since complement factors play an essential role in the pathogenesis and are deposited in the kidneys as C1q and C3, we studied whether these deposits predict ESRD and death in patients with LN.

- **Methods**: We collected demographic, clinical, and pathological data from 183 adult patients with LN classes II–V diagnosed with a first native kidney biopsy. Pathological data included the localization and intensity of immunofluorescence staining of C1q and C3. We obtained dates of incident ESRD and death from the United States Renal Data System and National Death Index, respectively, and evaluated survival curves and hazard ratios for ESRD and death as a composite outcome and as separate outcomes.

- **Results**: The presence and intensity of deposits of C1q and C3 in glomeruli, tubular walls, and vascular walls differed between classes and were associated with known unfavorable prognostic factors, such as hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocomplementemia. However, over a median follow-up of 7.5 years, their presence and intensity were associated with neither survival free of ESRD and death nor hazard ratios for ESRD and death.

- **Conclusion**: Renal deposits of complement factors did not predict ESRD and death in patients with LN.

### Association of blood concentrations of complement split product iC3b and serum C3 with systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity [^1125qLvc]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

The association of the iC3b:C3 ratio with the presence of lupus nephritis but not rash:

We noted that 16.5% of patients with active SLE had normal iC3b:C3 ratios (Figure 1 A). We hypothesized that certain disease manifestations may not drive sufficient systemic complement activation for detection of abnormalities in the blood. Thus, we evaluated two common manifestations of SLE that we speculated would drive different levels of complement activation: rash and lupus nephritis (defined as having any non-zero score in the urinary cast, hematuria, proteinuria, or pyuria domains of the SLEDAI-2K RI-50 score).

We first compared the presence of lupus nephritis in SLE patients to a status of no disease activity (patients with a SLEDAI-2K RI-50 score of 0). In the univariate regression analyses, relative changes in iC3b levels, the iC3b:C3 ratio, C3 levels, ESR, and anti-dsDNA antibody levels as well as race and number of visits each correlated with the presence of lupus nephritis (Figure 5 A). In the multivariate regression analyses, only changes in the iC3b:C3 ratio, anti-dsDNA antibody levels, and ESR, and use of a supraphysiologic dose of prednisone independently correlated with the presence of lupus nephritis (Figure 5 B). A 1-unit increase in the iC3b:C3 ratio increased the odds of lupus nephritis by 45%.

### Complement and systemic lupus erythematosus [^1131mXeg]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that the complement system plays multiple roles in systemic lupus erythematosus. Activation of the classical pathway by immune complexes leads to the generation of inflammatory mediators, thus promoting tissue injury. Complement activation also plays an important role in the maintenance of tolerance to self-antigens. This review discusses recent insights into the role of complement in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus.

- **Recent findings**: The antiphospholipid syndrome is a major feature of systemic lupus erythematosus. New findings have clearly demonstrated that the prothrombotic effects seen in a mouse model of this syndrome depend on complement activation, whereas the protective effects of heparin are due to its anticomplementary effects rather than its anticoagulant action. Secondly, a potential mechanism explaining the association of anti-C1q autoantibodies with lupus glomerulonephritis has been elucidated in a mouse model system.

- **Summary**: New findings have helped to reinforce the role of complement in the etiology and tissue damage of systemic lupus erythematosus. These findings point to more precise, mechanism-based therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory disease.
