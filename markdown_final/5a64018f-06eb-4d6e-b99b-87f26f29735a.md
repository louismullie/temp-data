## Question

RSI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of repetitive strain injury (RSI), including definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, prognosis, and prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining RSI and its spectrum. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk factors. Next, I will examine pathophysiology and the role of imaging. After that, I need to check diagnostic approaches and the distinction between specific and non-specific entities. Then, I will review management, including exercise, ergonomics, medications, injections, and surgery, and I should confirm where evidence is strong versus uncertain. Finally, I will assess prognosis and synthesize prevention strategies, making sure to flag controversies and evidence gaps as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't overgeneralize. RSI is an umbrella term encompassing specific diagnoses such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, Guyon canal syndrome, lateral and medial epicondylitis, and wrist or hand tendonitis, as well as non-specific upper limb pain syndromes without clear pathoanatomy, which are often labeled as non-specific upper limb disorders or work-related complaints of the arm, neck, or shoulder (CANS) [^1175Hko8] [^116hcbJL].

> I need to check the epidemiology to frame burden and context. Wait, let me verify the most recent population data: in 2021, approximately 9.0% of men and 8.9% of women reported an RSI in the prior 3 months, with some racial/ethnic differences, and work-related upper limb disorders account for a substantial proportion of occupational disease in Europe, underscoring high societal impact and the need for workplace-focused strategies [^111dr8Fn] [^114jvf6H].

> Next, I should review risk factors and make sure I separate established from speculative. Occupational exposures such as repetitive tasks, awkward postures, forceful exertion, and vibration are consistently implicated; computer-intensive work, including PACS-era radiology, has been associated with increased pain and symptom burden, and age-related degeneration plus repetitive overhead or lifting activities heighten risk for rotator cuff pathology, while psychosocial factors and health beliefs likely modulate symptom expression and disability, though high-quality causal evidence remains limited [^114iSmgw] [^116K48oc] [^114kZVS5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms; I should confirm the pathophysiology spectrum. Specific entities reflect well-characterized tissue injury: median nerve compression in carpal tunnel, microtrauma and failed healing in lateral epicondylitis, and rotator cuff degeneration with repetitive overload, whereas non-specific CANS may involve nociceptive drivers, central sensitization, and psychosocial amplification; imaging studies increasingly detect tendon and nerve pathology, but many patients have normal studies, reinforcing a biopsychosocial model rather than a purely structural paradigm [^1175Hko8] [^115aHMHy] [^116hcbJL].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, and I need to ensure I don't overstate imaging utility. Diagnosis remains primarily clinical, grounded in history and examination; imaging is adjunctive when the diagnosis is uncertain, when red flags are present, or when procedural planning is needed, and although MRI and ultrasound can identify tendon and nerve pathology, their routine use for non-specific upper limb pain is not well supported by high-quality evidence, so I should be cautious not to over-order imaging in the absence of a specific indication [^1175Hko8] [^115aHMHy].

> Let me think about management, and I should double-check where evidence is strong versus weak. For carpal tunnel syndrome, immobilization with night splints and open carpal tunnel release have supportive evidence; for lateral epicondylitis, NSAIDs and corticosteroid injections can provide short-term relief; for non-specific upper limb disorders, exercise therapy shows benefit, though effect sizes are modest and heterogeneous; ergonomic interventions may reduce pain and sick leave in the long term but show little short-term benefit; behavioral and multimodal programs are plausible but evidence quality is low, so expectations should be tempered and individualized [^1175Hko8] [^114kZVS5].

> Wait, I should verify the role of rest versus activity because this often drives outcomes. The ARM trial and subsequent analyses suggest that advice to remain active while awaiting physiotherapy reduces disability more than advice to rest, and this aligns with contemporary shifts toward graded loading rather than passive rest; I initially thought strict rest might be necessary, but the better-quality evidence supports activity with load management, so I should correct that inclination and emphasize early, graded activation [^114jvf6H] [^114RKhR1].

> I need to ensure I cover medications and injections accurately. NSAIDs, both topical and oral, can reduce pain in lateral epicondylitis, and corticosteroid injections offer short-term relief for epicondylitis and are first-line for trigger finger; however, repeated steroid injections carry risks of tissue atrophy and rupture, so I should caution against routine repetition and tie injections to functional goals and time-limited use [^112M19wo] [^112k5TYj].

> Next, I should review surgical indications and not overgeneralize. Open carpal tunnel release is effective for persistent, severe carpal tunnel syndrome after conservative care; for rotator cuff tears, management is typically nonoperative initially, with surgery reserved for refractory cases or acute traumatic tears in appropriate candidates; for lateral epicondylitis, most cases resolve without surgery, reserving operative debridement for recalcitrant cases after exhaustive conservative therapy [^1175Hko8] [^112k5TYj].

> Let me consider prognosis and make sure I don't understate chronicity. Many patients improve with conservative care, but recurrence is common, especially if ergonomic and workload factors are not addressed; among community cohorts with distal arm pain, about half have persistent symptoms at 12 months and a substantial minority report severe disability, highlighting the importance of addressing psychosocial contributors and work participation early [^114jvf6H].

> I should confirm prevention strategies and distinguish evidence-based from common-sense. Primary prevention hinges on ergonomic optimization, task modification, load management, and conditioning; in radiology cohorts, ergonomic training and devices reduced pain, and in musicians, early symptom recognition with activity reduction is emphasized; exercise-based conditioning likely reduces risk, though high-quality prevention trials are sparse, so programs should be tailored and monitored for effectiveness [^114iSmgw] [^114zJz6s].

> But wait, what about controversies and evidence gaps; I need to be transparent. The construct of RSI remains debated, with some critics arguing it conflates diverse pathologies and risks medicalizing normal discomfort; high-quality randomized trials are limited, many interventions show only small, short-term benefits, and imaging's role outside specific diagnoses is unsettled; this means shared decision-making, careful diagnostic labeling, and expectation management are essential parts of care [^1175Hko8] [^114kZVS5].

> In summary, I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with the best available evidence. RSI spans specific entrapment neuropathies and tendinopathies alongside non-specific upper limb pain syndromes; diagnosis is clinical with selective imaging; management favors activity over rest, targeted exercise, ergonomic and workload modification, judicious medications and injections, and surgery for refractory or structurally significant disease; prognosis is variable with meaningful chronicity and disability in a subset, and prevention requires ergonomic and conditioning strategies embedded in the workplace and daily routines [^1175Hko8] [^114jvf6H] [^116hcbJL].

RSI refers to **repetitive strain injury**, a collective term for overuse injuries of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems caused by repetitive tasks, forceful exertions, vibrations, or sustained awkward postures [^114kZVS5]. RSI presents with pain, weakness, numbness, or tingling — most often in the upper limbs — and is diagnosed clinically; imaging is reserved for refractory or unclear cases [^115aHMHy]. Management is **conservative** [^114kZVS5], emphasizing activity modification, ergonomic adjustments, physical therapy, and analgesia; surgery is reserved for refractory cases or specific entrapment syndromes [^1175Hko8]. Prognosis is generally favorable with early intervention, but symptoms may persist if causative exposures continue or if psychosocial factors are unaddressed [^114jvf6H].

---

## Definition and clinical features

RSI encompasses a spectrum of disorders, including:

- **Carpal tunnel syndrome**: Median nerve entrapment causing pain, numbness, and weakness in the hand [^notfound].
- **Tendonitis**: Inflammation of tendons, commonly in the wrist, elbow, or shoulder [^notfound].
- **Epicondylitis**: Lateral or medial elbow pain due to repetitive wrist and forearm movements [^notfound].
- **Thoracic outlet syndrome**: Compression of neurovascular structures causing shoulder and arm pain, numbness, and weakness [^notfound].

Common clinical features include:

- Pain localized to the affected area, often worsened by repetitive activities [^notfound].
- Weakness or fatigue of the involved muscles [^notfound].
- Numbness or tingling, particularly in nerve entrapment syndromes [^notfound].
- Reduced range of motion and stiffness [^112vCaXQ].

---

## Risk factors and causes

RSI is **multifactorial**, with risk factors including:

- **Occupational factors**: Repetitive tasks, forceful exertions, prolonged static postures, and vibration exposure [^114kZVS5].
- **Individual factors**: Poor ergonomics, inadequate rest breaks, and pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions [^114iSmgw].
- **Psychosocial factors**: Stress, job dissatisfaction, and high work demands [^114iSmgw].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, based on history and examination [^1175Hko8]. Imaging (ultrasound, MRI) is reserved for refractory cases or when specific pathology is suspected, such as nerve entrapment or tendon rupture [^112k5TYj].

---

## Management

Management of RSI is **primarily conservative**:

- **Activity modification**: Identifying and modifying aggravating activities [^112k5TYj].
- **Ergonomic adjustments**: Workplace modifications to optimize posture and reduce repetitive strain [^114kZVS5].
- **Physical therapy**: Exercise programs focused on strengthening, flexibility, and posture correction [^116hcbJL].
- **Pharmacological treatment**: NSAIDs, topical analgesics, and corticosteroid injections for severe inflammation or pain [^1175Hko8].
- **Surgical intervention**: Reserved for refractory cases or specific entrapment syndromes (e.g. carpal tunnel release) [^112k5TYj].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with the severity of injury, adherence to treatment, and modification of occupational exposures. Early intervention and ergonomic adjustments generally lead to favorable outcomes, but chronic symptoms may persist if causative factors are not addressed [^114jvf6H].

---

## Prevention

Prevention strategies focus on **ergonomic education**, regular breaks, and workplace modifications. Early recognition of symptoms and prompt intervention are critical to preventing chronic disability [^114zJz6s].

---

RSI is a common occupational disorder characterized by repetitive tasks and poor ergonomics. Early diagnosis, conservative management, and prevention strategies are essential for optimal outcomes [^114kZVS5].

## References

### Repetitive strain injury [^1175Hko8]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Repetitive strain injury remains a controversial topic. The term repetitive strain injury includes specific disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, Guyon canal syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, and tendonitis of the wrist or hand. The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of history and clinical examination. Large high-quality studies using newer imaging techniques, such as MRI and ultrasonography are few. Consequently, the role of such imaging in diagnosis of upper limb disorders remains unclear. In many cases, no specific diagnosis can be established and complaints are labelled as non-specific. Little is known about the effectiveness of treatment options for upper limb disorders. Strong evidence for any intervention is scarce and the effect, if any, is mainly short-term pain relief. Exercise is beneficial for non-specific upper limb disorders. Immobilising hand braces and open carpal tunnel surgery release are beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome, and topical and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections are helpful for lateral epicondylitis. Exercise is probably beneficial for neck pain, as are corticosteroid injections and exercise for shoulder pain. Although upper limb disorders occur frequently in the working population, most trials have not exclusively included a working population or assessed effects on work-related outcomes. Further high-quality trials should aim to include sufficient sample sizes, working populations, and work-related outcomes.

### WITHDRAWN: biopsychosocial rehabilitation for upper limb repetitive strain injuries in working age adults [^116bFSqY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Upper limb repetitive strain injury is a common problem in western countries, causing human suffering and huge economical losses. Patients with prolonged pain associated with repetitive tasks in the work place can face both psychological and physical difficulties. Different treatment programmes, physical, psychological, behavioural, social and occupational treatments have been developed and used to help these patients.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review is to determine the effectiveness of biopsychosocial rehabilitation for upper limb repetitive strain injuries among working age adults.

Search Strategy

The reviewed studies for this structured Cochrane review were identified from electronic bibliographic databases, the Science Citation Index, reference checking and consulting experts in the rehabilitation field. The original search was planned and performed for a more broad area of musculoskeletal disorders. Trials on repetitive strain injuries were separated afterwards.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and controlled trials comparing biopsychosocial measures for the treatment of repetitive upper limb strain injury in working age adults

Data Collection and Analysis

Two experts in the field of rehabilitation evaluated the clinical relevance and applicability of the findings of the selected studies to actual clinical use. Two other blinded reviewers extracted the data and assessed the main results and the methodological quality of the studies using standardized forms. Finally, a qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate the level of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of biopsychosocial rehabilitation.

Main Results

We found only two relevant studies that satisfied our criteria. They assessed the effectiveness of two specific interventions and were both considered as low quality trials. The clinical relevance of the included studies was also unsatisfactory. The level of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of biopsychosocial rehabilitation for repetitive strain injuries was limited. One small trial found that hypnosis supplementary to comprehensive treatment can decrease the intensity of pain for acute RSI in six weeks follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

We conclude that presently there appears to be little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of biopsychosocial rehabilitation on repetitive strain injuries. As RCTs on more intensive and comprehensive biopsychosocial treatment programmes for RSI are lacking, there does not seem to be reliable data for these interventions. There is a need for high quality trials in this field.

### Conservative interventions for treating work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder in adults [^114kZVS5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Work-related upper limb disorder (WRULD), repetitive strain injury (RSI), occupational overuse syndrome (OOS) and work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder (CANS) are the most frequently used umbrella terms for disorders that develop as a result of repetitive movements, awkward postures and impact of external forces such as those associated with operating vibrating tools. Work-related CANS, which is the term we use in this review, severely hampers the working population.

Objectives

To assess the effects of conservative interventions for work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder (CANS) in adults on pain, function and work-related outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 31 May 2013), MEDLINE (1950 to 31 May 2013), EMBASE (1988 to 31 May 2013), CINAHL (1982 to 31 May 2013), AMED (1985 to 31 May 2013), PsycINFO (1806 to 31 May 2013), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro; inception to 31 May 2013) and the Occupational Therapy Systematic Evaluation of Evidence Database (OTseeker; inception to 31 May 2013). We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating conservative interventions for work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder in adults. We excluded trials undertaken to test injections and surgery. We included studies that evaluated effects on pain, functional status or work ability.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included studies. When studies were sufficiently similar, we performed statistical pooling of reported results.

Main Results

We included 44 studies (62 publications) with 6,580 participants that evaluated 25 different interventions. We categorised these interventions according to their working mechanisms into exercises, ergonomics, behavioural and other interventions. Overall, we judged 35 studies as having a high risk of bias mainly because of an unknown randomisation procedure, lack of a concealed allocation procedure, unblinded trial participants or lack of an intention-to-treat analysis. We found very low-quality evidence showing that exercises did not improve pain in comparison with no treatment (five studies, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.08 to 0.03), or minor intervention controls (three studies, SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.37) or when provided as additional treatment (two studies, inconsistent results) at short-term follow-up or at long-term follow-up. Results were similar for recovery, disability and sick leave. Specific exercises led to increased pain at short-term follow-up when compared with general exercises (four studies, SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.75)We found very low-quality evidence indicating that ergonomic interventions did not lead to a decrease in pain when compared with no intervention at short-term follow-up (three studies, SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.22) but did decrease pain at long-term follow-up (four studies, SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.16). There was no effect on disability but sick leave decreased in two studies (risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.76). None of the ergonomic interventions was more beneficial for any outcome measures when compared with another treatment or with no treatment or with placebo. Behavioural interventions had inconsistent effects on pain and disability, with some subgroups showing benefit and others showing no significant improvement when compared with no treatment, minor intervention controls or other behavioural interventions. In the eight studies that evaluated various other interventions, there was no evidence of a clear beneficial effect of any of the interventions provided.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low-quality evidence indicating that pain, recovery, disability and sick leave are similar after exercises when compared with no treatment, with minor intervention controls or with exercises provided as additional treatment to people with work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder. Low-quality evidence also showed that ergonomic interventions did not decrease pain at short-term follow-up but did decrease pain at long-term follow-up. There was no evidence of an effect on other outcomes. For behavioural and other interventions, there was no evidence of a consistent effect on any of the outcomes. Studies are needed that include more participants, that are clear about the diagnosis of work-relatedness and that report findings according to current guidelines.

### Repetitive stress and strain injuries: preventive exercises for the musician [^114zJz6s]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

There are many articles that support stretching, strengthening, good nutrition, hydration, rest, and ergonomics along with many other concepts that may be helpful in preventing repetitive stress injuries. The most conclusive literature proposes early recognition of onset symptoms, and immediate reduction or cessation of the casual activity. This is not well accepted by the musician, because this means an interruption of practice and performance. Just like any worker or athlete at risk for RSI, however, the musician must learn to recognise early signs and take the steps to limit damage to muscular and neural tissues. More studies are needed to provide evidence for effective treatment and prevention of RSI.

### Use of autologous platelet-rich plasma to treat muscle strain injuries [^116wqJgL]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Standard nonoperative therapy for acute muscle strains usually involves short-term rest, ice, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, but there is no clear consensus on how to accelerate recovery.

Hypothesis

Local delivery of platelet-rich plasma to injured muscles hastens recovery of function.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

In vivo, the tibialis anterior muscles of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were injured by a single (large strain) lengthening contraction or multiple (small strain) lengthening contractions, both of which resulted in a significant injury. The tibialis anterior either was injected with platelet-rich plasma, was injected with platelet-poor plasma as a sham treatment, or received no treatment.

Results

Both injury protocols yielded a similar loss of force. The platelet-rich plasma only had a beneficial effect at 1 time point after the single contraction injury protocol. However, platelet-rich plasma had a beneficial effect at 2 time points after the multiple contraction injury protocol and resulted in a faster recovery time to full contractile function. The sham injections had no effect compared with no treatment.

Conclusion

Local delivery of platelet-rich plasma can shorten recovery time after a muscle strain injury in a small-animal model. Recovery of muscle from the high-repetition protocol has already been shown to require myogenesis, whereas recovery from a single strain does not. This difference in mechanism of recovery may explain why platelet-rich plasma was more effective in the high-repetition protocol, because platelet-rich plasma is rich in growth factors that can stimulate myogenesis.

Clinical Relevance

Because autologous blood products are safe, platelet-rich plasma may be a useful product in clinical treatment of muscle injuries.

### Factors associated with repetitive strain, and strategies to reduce injury among breast-imaging radiologists [^114iSmgw]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the prevalence of repetitive strain injury (RSI) among breast-imaging radiologists, the factors associated with such symptoms, and strategies to reduce injury.

Methods

In 2012, an anonymous survey regarding RSI and work habits was administered to 2,618 physician members of the Society of Breast Imaging via e-mail. Analysis of 727 (27.8%) de-identified responses was completed using STATA 12.1. Pain levels before and after implementation of digital imaging were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The associations between RSI symptoms and work habits were assessed with logistic regression and test for trend.

Results

In the survey 438 of 727 (60.2%) respondents reported RSI symptoms, and 242 of 727 (33.3%) reported prior diagnosis/treatment. Results showed a statistically significant trend for the odds of RSI symptoms to increase with decreasing age (P = 0.0004) or increasing number of daily hours spent working (P = 0.0006), especially in an awkward position (P < .0001). Respondents recalled a significant increase in pain level after implementation of PACS, and a decrease in pain after ergonomic training or initiating use of an ergonomic mouse, adjustable chair, or adjustable table (P < .001, all comparisons). Only 17.7% (129 of 727) used an ergonomic mouse and 13.3% (97 of 727) had attended ergonomic training. Those with RSI symptoms or prior diagnosis of a Repetitive Strain Syndrome (RSS) were more likely to desire future ergonomic training compared with those without symptoms or injury (odds ratio 5.36, P < .001; odds ratio 2.63, P = 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

RSI is highly prevalent among breast-imaging radiologists nationwide and may worsen after implementation of PACS or with longer work hours. Ergonomic training and ergonomic devices may diminish or prevent painful RSI among radiologists.

### Repetitive strain injuries of the upper extremity: imaging of tendon pathology and compressive neuropathies [^115aHMHy]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) encompass a broad clinicopathologic spectrum which includes discrete patterns of tissue injury involving tendons, bursae and nerves although an element of subjective symptomatology may be contributory. Upper extremity RSIs include De Quervain's tenosynovitis, intersection syndromes, epicondylitis, ulnar, and median neuritis as well as other compressive neuropathies. It is estimated that RSIs cost the US economy over $60 billion annually and while detailed clinical examination remains the diagnostic mainstay, imaging can aid in diagnosis, guide management and reduce costs.

### Exercise therapy for bone and muscle health: an overview of systematic reviews [^112vCaXQ]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Shoulder pain

SP and shoulder disorders cover a broad spectrum of pain, symptoms, and diagnoses, including tendonitis, rotator-cuff disease, sub-acromial pain, impingement syndrome, and repetitive strain injury. As with NP, there is no general agreement on the classification of painful shoulder conditions. Clinically, patients often present with SP together with stiffness, reduced range of motion, and/or with pain, or other symptoms radiating to the more proximal part of the arm.

Marinko et al. included three studies on SP with pain as an outcome, and compared the effects of exercise versus other treatments on pain levels. Data were pooled by use of a random-effects model, which showed an overall SMD in favor of the exercise intervention (SMD -0.30; 95% CI -0.48 to -0.12). Four studies included function as an outcome, and compared the effect of exercise versus an alternative intervention or no intervention. Data were pooled by use of a random-effects model, with an overall SMD of 0.15 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.29), indicating a minimal positive effect over no care or alternative interventions. We were not able to identify any reviews exploring between-trial heterogeneity or the effect of exercise on pathogenesis.

### Bilateral changes in forearm oxygen consumption at rest and after exercise in patients with unilateral repetitive strain injury: a case-control study [^1164LeiP]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case-control study.

Objectives

To investigate whether oxygen consumption and blood flow at rest and after exercise are lower in the affected arm of patients with repetitive strain injury (RSI) compared to controls, and lower in the healthy nonaffected forearm within patients with unilateral RSI.

Background

RSI is considered an upper extremity overuse injury. Despite the local presentation of complaints, RSI may be represented by systemic adaptations. Insight into the pathophysiology of RSI is important to better understand the development of RSI complaints and to develop effective treatment and prevention strategies.

Methods

Twenty patients with unilateral RSI and 20 gender-matched control subjects participated in this study. Forearm muscle blood flow and oxygen consumption were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy at baseline and immediately after isometric handgrip exercises at 10%, 20%, and 40% of the individual maximal voluntary contraction.

Results

Unilateral RSI resulted in a lower oxygen consumption and blood flow in the affected forearm at baseline and lower oxygen consumption after incremental handgrip exercises compared to controls (P < .05). In addition, exercise-induced blood flow and oxygen consumption in the nonaffected forearm in patients with RSI were similarly reduced.

Conclusion

Blood flow and oxygen consumption after exercise are similarly attenuated in the affected and nonaffected arms of patients with unilateral RSI. Our findings suggest that, despite the unilateral character in clinical symptoms, RSI demonstrates systemic adaptations in forearm blood flow and oxygen consumption at rest and after exercise.

### Myofascial pain syndrome: an update on clinical characteristics, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^1134ENot]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Risk Factors

MPS is a multifactorial condition influenced by a range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which complicate both its diagnosis and management. These risk factors can be broadly categorized into physical, systemic, psychological, and lifestyle‐related factors, many of which interact synergistically, further contributing to the onset and persistence of MPS.

3.1 Physical and Mechanical Factors

Muscle overuse is one of the most well‐documented risk factors for MPS, particularly in individuals whose occupations or lifestyles require repetitive or sustained muscle contractions. These overuse patterns can lead to microtrauma in muscle fibers, resulting in the formation of MTrPs. This repetitive strain can occur in various settings, including manual labor, sports, and prolonged periods of poor posture, such as during desk work or driving. Additionally, acute muscle trauma, such as strains or tears, can initiate MTrP formation, setting off a cascade of pain and dysfunction that may persist long after the initial injury has healed.

Another significant contributor to MPS is postural imbalance, particularly when improper posture is sustained over long periods. For instance, forward head posture, commonly associated with prolonged computer use, can lead to increased stress on the cervical and shoulder muscles, promoting the development of MTrPs. Postural dysfunctions can also arise from musculoskeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis, where uneven muscle tension places certain muscle groups under constant strain, increasing their susceptibility to MTrP formation. Similarly, conditions such as osteoarthritis, particularly in the spine and major joints, can alter muscle recruitment patterns, causing compensatory overuse in adjacent muscle groups, which may contribute to chronic pain.

### Advice to remain active with arm pain reduces disability [^114jvf6H]. Occupational Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An estimated 4.4 million UK working days were lost 2019/20 because of 'work-related neck/upper limb disorders'. Indeed, upper limb disorders account for 45% of all occupational diseases in Europe. Moreover, arm symptoms are frequently attributed to work and have caused workplace epidemics including 'repetitive strain injury'. Some causes of arm pain have well-defined pathoanatomical features and diagnostic criteria (tenosynovitis), even if their aetiology is not fully understood but patients can present with pain and disability in the elbow, forearm wrist/hand without any distinct pathoanatomical features. Either way, rates of disability are high: amongst people consulting with pain affecting the elbow, forearm, wrist and/or hand in the community, 50% reported persistent symptoms 12 months later and 14% reported severely disabling symptoms.

Despite their frequency and impact, it is unknown how best to manage upper limb disorders. Injections, medication or physiotherapy might be effective in some conditions, but their clinical effect is inconsistent and any benefit from advice to rest the arm or avoidance of occupational activities has not been established. Although psychosocial interventions, such as addressing health beliefs and encouraging activity and remaining at work, are potentially useful in the management of arm pain, their effectiveness in a working population remains to be determined. For these reasons, the ARM pain trial was funded. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) recruited people with distal arm pain referred to physiotherapy and randomized to three groups: waiting-list physiotherapy and advice to rest; waiting-list physiotherapy and advice to remain active; or immediate physiotherapy. The main results showed that, while awaiting physiotherapy, advice to remain active was superior to advice to rest in terms of reducing disability 26 weeks later, with no additional benefit of early physiotherapy. However, eligibility for the ARM trial was not based on work status. Given the frequency and impact of arm pain in the workplace, it is important to establish whether there is a different effect of advice to remain active amongst working trial participants, and also whether there are selective differences in response amongst people with varying physical work demands. Therefore, we re-analysed the ARM pain trial data to address these questions.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^112ommnJ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Hamstring strain injury (HSI) clinical practice guideline (CPG) scope and outcome focus states that the CPG includes sports-related overloading and overstretching injuries to myofascial or musculotendinous structures in any combination of the 3 hamstring muscles and excludes isolated tendon injuries because tendon-only injuries differ in incidence, mechanism, pathoanatomy, clinical course, and treatment. Ultimate rehabilitation success is defined by return to sports participation while preventing reinjury, and only studies directly assessing time to return to play (RTP) and reinjury rates were included when discussing interventions for HSIs.

### Minimizing occupational hazards in endoscopy: personal protective equipment, radiation safety, and ergonomics [^113KCDLk]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

The ASGE Technology Committee provides reviews of existing, new, or emerging endoscopic technologies that have an impact on the practice of GI endoscopy. Evidence-based methodology is used, by using a MEDLINE literature search to identify pertinent clinical studies on the topic and a MAUDE (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health) database search to identify the reported complications of a given technology. Both are supplemented by accessing the "related articles" feature of PubMed and by scrutinizing pertinent references cited by the identified studies. Controlled clinical trials are emphasized, but in many cases, data from randomized, controlled trials are lacking. In such cases, large case series, preliminary clinical studies, and expert opinions are used.

Sports injuries are multifactorial and have a complex web of risk factors. Thus, identifying risk factors plays a central role in designing prevention strategies. Following evidence-based practice principles, clinicians use the best available evidence to guide decisions about injury prevention. Here, we share a scenario familiar to the sports medicine community-risk factors for hamstring strain injury-and highlight some of the pitfalls that clinicians should watch out for when applying research to practice.

### Review of musculoskeletal injuries and prevention in the endoscopy practitioner [^112FvP4u]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Proper procedural technique to minimize strain as mentioned has been documented in studies, but little instruction is provided at most institutions during training. This is important as procedural technique during training is likely to carry over long term during an endoscopist's career. Not only do fellowship programs need to focus on competency, but a trainee's emerging technique should be critiqued from an ergonomic standpoint in an effort to decrease the repetitive injuries than are associated with the work of an endoscopist. This has led for the call to establish ergonomic guidelines for GI endoscopy.

### Emerging concepts and spectrum of renal injury following intravesical BCG for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer [^112s63JA]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Repetitive injury

Almost all renal injury cases reported AKI during or after administration of standard or higher doses. Interestingly, our case shows that there might be a window of opportunity when interrupting therapy could lead to stabilization of renal function. A national shortage of IVBCG interrupted patient's therapy; renal function trend during this period demonstrated that eGFR plateaued. More intriguing was a decline in renal function again following readministration of IVBCG suggesting a cumulative dose related repetitive injury that could present as CKD rather than a one-hit process causing AKI (13, 14, 17–19)Fig 1. Therefore, early recognition of renal dysfunction during IVBCG treatment is vital.

Granuloma

Presence of renal granuloma in the context of IVBCG requires comprehensive patient evaluation for infectious, autoimmune and non-infectious causes such as sarcoidosis and medications. Case series analysis (n = 15) show that although the median numbers of instillations in granulomatous cases were non-significantly higher, serum creatinine at presentation was lower and had no fatalities compared to non-granulomatous presentation (Table. 2, Fig 2). This suggests complex immune-pathological mechanisms for renal injury that depends on strain virulence, toxicity and host response, which may already be low in this age group. However, as the data is limited formal conclusions cannot be drawn or generalised, highlighting need for urgent prospective studies.

### Exercise interventions for treating work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder in adults [^116hcbJL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Work‐related upper limb disorders, repetitive strain injuries, cumulative trauma disorders, occupational overuse syndromes or work‐related complaints of the arm (including wrist, hand and fingers), neck or shoulder (CANS) are frequently used terms for disorders that develop as a result of repetitive movements, awkward postures and impact of external forces such as when operating vibrating tools (Boocock 2009). Work‐related complaints can be divided into specific conditions with relatively clear diagnostic criteria and pathology, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, or non‐specific conditions, such as tension neck syndrome. Non‐specific conditions are usually defined by the location of complaint, with a pathophysiology that is less clearly defined or relatively unknown (Staal 2007).

In this review, we use CANS as a descriptor for work‐related upper‐limb musculoskeletal complaints. The use of the CANS classification was supported by a multidisciplinary Delphi study that provided a list of 23 specific CANS diagnoses and non‐specific CANS diagnoses (Huisstede 2007). Specific diagnoses include: bursitis of the elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, cervical disc hernia, complex regional pain syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, De Quervain's disease, frozen shoulder, Guyon canal syndrome, instability of the elbow, instability of the shoulder, glenoid labral lesion, lateral epicondylitis, local arthritis of a joint of the upper extremities, medial epicondylitis, Oarsman's wrist, radial tunnel syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, rotator cuff tears, subacromial impingement syndrome/rotator cuff‐related shoulder pain, suprascapular nerve compression, biceps tendon tendinitis and trigger finger (Huisstede 2007). People can also have non‐specific CANS where no specific diagnosis can be made (Armstrong 1993), and where no pathological, neurological or radiological characteristics can be found to support the diagnosis of CANS (Staal 2007). Non‐specific CANS includes non‐specific pain that is not listed as one of the 23 specific CANS diagnoses (Huisstede 2007). Using CANS as a descriptor allows for the grouping of a number of upper‐limb complaints that facilitate comparisons (Huisstede 2007).

### Behavioral aspects of trauma in children and youth [^113hwtoZ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Trauma is prevalent in the lives of children. It derives from many sources, and, depending on its characteristics, can produce transient or enduring and devastating consequences. Early trauma, if left untreated, can set the stage for chronic deficits in the behavioral repertoires of affected children, and thus shape personality development. Additionally, when trauma is repetitive and chronic, the developing brain may be affected in ways that impede otherwise effective intervention. Yet diagnosing traumatic stress in children requires a departure from exclusively adult-like considerations and attention must be devoted to the ongoing developmental processes. Trauma-associated clinical features in children are sharply distinct from those that are associated with adult traumatization and must be taken into account from screening and diagnosis through treatment and outcome evaluation. We suggest that a learning foundation for symptom development will best assist the identification and selection of efficacious treatments. Pediatricians should make use of validated screening procedures that effectively identify affected children to facilitate timely referral and ongoing monitoring of treatment outcomes for their patients. A representative list of such instruments can be found in Table 1. With respect to hospital-based trauma work, we suggest the following recommendations: Professionals must be alert to the presence of acute stress symptoms in any child or parent after all injury incidents. These symptoms may occur in any injured child regardless of age, gender, injury severity, mechanism of injury, or length of time since injury. Certain mechanisms of injury, (ie, pedestrian versus motor vehicle collision), place the parent at higher risk for symptomatology. All family members, including parents and siblings, must be considered at risk for acute and long-term functional abnormalities. It is important to educate patients and family members that acute stress symptoms are common after an injury incident and are likely to resolve as the patient's injuries heal. Yet despite this, before discharge from the hospital, parents must be taught to evaluate their traumatized child's behavior, as well as their own, for any evidence of posttraumatic stress disorder. Health care providers must anticipate potential strain upon family relationships and financial resources. Parent's posttraumatic stress symptoms may result in deterioration of their own ability to support their injured child. And finally, reassessment of patient and family members should occur within the first days, at 1 to 2 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year following injury to ensure proper recovery and optimization of psychosocial function.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common shoulder injuries in sport: grading the evidence-a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^116jXP9r]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Search

Three systematic searches covering diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the five selected shoulder injuries were performed in MEDLINE via PubMed and EMBASE via Ovid in April 2021 and updated August 2022, with no restrictions in the year of publication. Only publications in English were included. We searched individual text words in the title/abstract and supplemented them with Medical Subject Headings terms (MeSH). We combined anatomical region of interest (eg, 'Shoulder (MeSH)' OR 'rotator cuff' OR 'shoulder') AND the type of shoulder problem (eg, 'Athletic injury (MeSH)' OR 'injur' OR 'strain' OR 'impingement') AND outcome for diagnosis and prevention (eg, 'Physical examination (MeSH)' OR 'test' OR 'diagnostic' and 'Primary prevention (MeSH)' OR 'prevent', respectively) or intervention for treatment (eg, 'Physical therapy modalities (MeSH)' OR 'exercise' OR 'education' OR 'Shockwave'). For treatment and prevention, the search strategy also included research design (eg, 'Systematic review (MeSH)' OR 'meta-analysis' OR 'randomised controlled trial'). In addition, reference lists of the included studies were screened for potential eligible references. The complete search strategy for all searches is available in online supplemental file 1.

### Transarterial embolization for refractory overuse sports injury: pictorial case reports [^116YouR7]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Transarterial embolization for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal diseases is gaining increasing interest in the field of interventional radiology. Overuse sports injury is defined as an injury occurring in the absence of a single, identifiable traumatic cause. In the treatment of this condition, there is a need for reliable results and a quick return to activity. Minimally invasive treatments with short periods of missed practice are required. Intra-arterial embolization has the potential to meet this need. In this article, we describe cases of embolization for refractory overuse sports injuries including patellar tendinopathy, pes anserine, plantar fasciitis, triangular fibrocartilage complex injury, hamstring injury, infrapatellar fat pad inflammation, Achilles tendinopathy, delayed union metatarsal bone fracture, lumbar spondylolysis, and repetitive hamstrings strain.

### Muscle contusion injuries: current treatment options [^111KaTW1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

Muscle contusion is second only to strain as the leading cause of morbidity from sports-related injuries. Severity depends on the site of impact, the activation status of the muscles involved, the age of the patient, and the presence of fatigue. The diagnosis has traditionally been one of clinical judgment; however, newer modalities, including ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and spectroscopy, are becoming increasingly important in both identifying and delineating the extent of injury. Although controlled clinical studies are scarce, animal research into muscle contusions has allowed the description of the natural healing process, which involves a complex balance between muscle repair, regeneration, and scar-tissue formation. Studies are being performed to evaluate the effects of anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids, operative repair, and exercise protocols. Prevention and treatment of complications such as myositis ossificans have also been stressed, but recognition may improve the outcome of these ubiquitous injuries.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^1159vuTw]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Sprains and strains — supportive guidance notes that the mainstay of treatment is rest and limiting the use of the injured extremity. Cold application can acutely decrease pain and swelling in joint sprains and muscle strains; in an RCT of 74 patients with sports-related soft tissue injury, cold therapy to soft tissue injuries improved pain scores at weeks 1, 2, and 4 after injury, and cold therapy improved edema compared with heat therapy in the acute time period, although cold application has not been demonstrated to improve function or time to recovery. The greatest tissue cooling is achieved by using a bag filled with ice and water surrounded by a damp cloth; other modalities such as refreezable gel packs or ice alone can also be used but do not cool the area as effectively as an ice and water mixture; experts recommend limiting the duration of cold application to 20 to 30 minutes for 3 to 4 times daily, and to prevent cold injury, ice should not be placed directly on the skin.

### The snapping scapula: diagnosis and treatment [^114Ze8ox]. Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

As a largely under-recognized problem, snapping scapula stems from the disruption of normal mechanics in scapulothoracic articulation. It is especially common in the young, active patient population, and symptoms are frequently seen with overhead and throwing motions. Understanding the anatomy of the scapula and surrounding neurovascular structures is crucial in making a differential diagnosis and providing both nonoperative and surgical treatments. Common causes of snapping scapula include bursitis, muscle abnormality, and bony or soft-tissue abnormalities. Anatomic variations, such as excessive forward curvature of the superomedial border of the scapula, may also be a cause for snapping. Benign tumor conditions of the scapula can also predispose one to snapping scapula syndrome and should be thoroughly investigated during the course of treatment. Patients with snapping scapula syndrome typically present with a history of pain with overhead activities. Snapping scapula is associated with audible and palpable crepitus near the superomedial border of the scapula. Various imaging studies may be used to rule out soft-tissue and bony masses, which may cause impingement at the scapulothoracic articulation. In most cases nonoperative treatment is curative and includes physical therapy for scapular muscle strengthening and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Corticosteroid injections may also be used for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. In most cases overuse injuries and repetitive strains respond well to nonoperative treatments. When nonoperative measures fail, surgery is a proven modality, especially if a soft-tissue or bony mass is implicated. Both open and arthroscopic techniques have been described with predictable results.

### Collateral ligament strain is linearly related to coronal lower limb alignment: a biomechanical study [^1116F1Bs]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Despite advances in the surgical treatment of knee collateral ligament injuries, recurrent instability after lateral and medial collateral ligament reconstruction remains a major concern, with graft failure rates ranging from 10% to 37%. While the influence of surgical technique, graft isometry and overlooked collateral ligament injuries with subsequent rotatory knee instability have been extensively investigated, bony deformities have been widely neglected as a potential cause of treatment failures. In this context, however, it has been assumed that coronal lower limb malalignment may cause failure of lateral and medial collateral ligament reconstructions in about one‐third of the cases.

As the knee bears about three times the body weight during normal gait, the grafts of the reconstructed medial and lateral collateral ligaments (LCLs) are subjected to high forces, especially in case of varus or valgus malalignment. Over time, these repetitive excess forces across the malaligned knees may stretch out the grafts, resulting in secondary insufficiency or failure. As recent biomechanical studies have shown a relieving effect of realigning osteotomies on the knee ligaments, soft tissue balancing becomes more aware as a key factor in knee reconstructive surgeries to reduce failures. However, to date, there are no threshold values if and when a realigning osteotomy is indicated as an adjunct to a medial or LCL reconstruction to protect the graft and potentially improve patient‐reported outcomes.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the influence of coronal lower limb alignment on collateral ligament strain of the native knee to define thresholds for combined realignment and reconstructive procedures. It was hypothesized that (1) the strain within the native ligaments is linearly associated with lower limb alignment and (2) a lower limb malalignment of more than 5° is associated with strain values above 4%.

### Determinants of the repeated-bout effect after lengthening contractions [^1124WVmS]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Stresses to skeletal muscle often result in injury. A subsequent bout of the same activity performed days or even weeks after an initial bout results in significantly less damage. The underlying causes of this phenomenon, termed the "repeated-bout effect" (RBE), are unclear. This study compared the protective effect of two different injury protocols on the ankle dorsiflexors in the rat. We hypothesized that the RBE would occur soon after the initial injury and persist for several weeks and that the RBE would occur even if the second injury was performed under different biomechanical conditions than the first.

Design

In this controlled laboratory study, the dorsiflexor muscles in the left hind limbs of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 75) were subjected to ten repetitions of large-strain lengthening contractions or 150 repetitions of small-strain lengthening contractions.

Results

Both protocols induced a significant (P < 0.001) and similar loss of isometric torque (approximately 50%) after the first bout of contractions. The RBE occurred as early as 2 days after the injury and remained high for 14 days (P < 0.001) but diminished by 28 days and was lost by 42 days. The small-strain contractions offered a protective effect against a subsequent large-strain contraction, but not vice versa. Although the RBE did not occur sooner than day 2, the early recovery after a second large-strain injury performed 8 hrs after the first was 2-fold greater than after a single injury.

Conclusions

The RBE is both rapid in onset and prolonged, and some, but not all, injuries can protect against different types of subsequent injury.

### Traumatic muscle injury [^114RKhR1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Traumatic muscle injury represents a collection of skeletal muscle pathologies caused by trauma to the muscle tissue and is defined as damage to the muscle tissue that can result in a functional deficit. Traumatic muscle injury can affect people across the lifespan and can result from high stresses and strains to skeletal muscle tissue, often due to muscle activation while the muscle is lengthening, resulting in indirect and non-contact muscle injuries (strains or ruptures), or from external impact, resulting in direct muscle injuries (contusion or laceration). At a microscopic level, muscle fibres can repair focal damage but must be completely regenerated after full myofibre necrosis. The diagnosis of muscle injury is based on patient history and physical examination. Imaging may be indicated to eliminate differential diagnoses. The management of muscle injury has changed within the past 5 years from initial rest, immobilization and (over)protection to early activation and progressive loading using an active approach. One challenge of muscle injury management is that numerous medical treatment options, such as medications and injections, are often used or proposed to try to accelerate muscle recovery despite very limited efficacy evidence. Another challenge is the prevention of muscle injury owing to the multifactorial and complex nature of this injury.

### Evaluation of a diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm for finger epiphyseal growth plate stress injuries in adolescent climbers [^111YYSW7]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Finger epiphyseal growth plate stress injuries are the most frequent sport-specific injuries in adolescent climbers. Definitive diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines are pending.

Purpose

To evaluate a diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm for finger epiphyseal growth plate stress injuries in adolescent climbers.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

On the basis of previous work on diagnostics and treatment of finger epiphyseal growth plate stress injuries (EGPIs) in adolescent climbers, we developed a new algorithm for management of these injuries, which was implemented into our clinical work. During a 4-year period, we performed a prospective multicentered analysis of our patients treated according to the algorithm. Climbing-specific background was evaluated (training years, climbing level, training methods, etc); injuries were analyzed (Salter-Harris classification and UIAA MedCom score [Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]); and treatments and outcomes were recorded: union, time to return to climbing, VAS (visual analog scale), QuickDASH (shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand), and a climbing-specific outcome score.

Results

Within the observation period, 27 patients with 37 independent EGPIs of the fingers were recorded (mean ± SD age, 14.7 ± 1.5 years; 19 male, 8 female; 66.7% competitive athletes). Regarding maturity at time of injury, the mean age at injury did not differ by sex. Average UIAA climbing level was 9.5 ± 0.8, with 6 ± 4.6 years of climbing or bouldering and 14 ± 9.1 hours of weekly climbing-specific training volume. Among the 37 injuries there were 7 epiphyseal strains, 2 Salter-Harris I fractures, and 28 Salter-Harris III fractures (UIAA 1, n = 7; UIAA 2, n = 30). Thirty-six injuries developed through repetitive stress, while 1 had an acute onset. Twenty-eight injuries were treated nonoperatively and 9 surgically. Osseous union was achieved in all cases, and there were no recurrences. The time between the start of treatment and the return to sport was 40.1 ± 65.2 days. The climbing-specific outcome score was excellent in 34 patients and good in 3. VAS decreased from 2.3 ± 0.6 to 0.1 ± 0.4 after treatment and QuickDASH from 48.1 ± 7.9 to 28.5 ± 3.3.

Conclusion

The proposed management algorithm led to osseous union in all cases. Effective treatment of EGPIs of the fingers may include nonsurgical or surgical intervention, depending on the time course and severity of the injury. Further awareness of EGPI is important to help prevent these injuries in the future.

### Urogenital hiatus closure: facts, fallacies, and why a unified theory of hiatal failure is needed [^114wj51D]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Interaction Between Prolapse and the Urogenital Hiatus Over the Lifespan is Complex

In seeking to understand the factors involved in hiatal enlargement, stresses placed on the urogenital hiatus during a woman's lifespan should be kept in mind. The images in Fig. 8 show urogenital hiatus changes over 31 years. Panels a and b show the urogenital hiatus at rest and strain in a woman in 1991, a year after delivering her fourth baby (weighing 10 lb. 14 oz.), while panels c and d show its status three decades later (2022). No intervening treatment was undertaken. Note that in 1991, the slightly enlarged urogenital hiatus is expanded by straining. In 2022, the resting urogenital hiatus A-P diameter is about 60% larger at rest and 40% larger during strain.

Fig. 8
Hiatus at rest and strain in 1991 (a, b) compared to 2022 (c, d). The black line in a and b indicate hiatus size. In c and d, the 1991 dimension is shown in black and enlargement beyond that is indicated by red

Implications

The urogenital hiatus is typically evaluated at one point in time during a woman's lifespan, but aging effects need to be considered. There is a paradox between the progressive enlargement with advancing age seen in this figure and the small, tight urogenital hiatus found in many parous elderly women. So for the situation shown in the 1991 images with a slightly enlarged urogenital hiatus, the hiatus expands with advancing age (2022 images), but in other women without an injury, age does not result in hiatal enlargement. This observation calls attention to our superficial understanding of the dynamic interplay between age-related changes and changes that occur with advancing age in women who sustained injury during birth. We hypothesize that an enlarged urogenital hiatus allows the vaginal walls to descend and further stretch the surrounding muscles and connective tissue due to repetitive loading. This is supported by the observation that some women using a pessary experience significant reduction of their urogenital hiatus size when the dilating effect of the prolapse is eliminated.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport-grading the evidence: a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^113GrC7v]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lower extremity muscle injuries are frequent in sports involving explosive actions such as high-speed running, jumping, change of direction and kicking. In professional football, muscle injuries constitute up to half of all injuries, and in sports, such as American football, Australian football, rugby, basketballand track and field, the incidence is also high. The majority of muscle injuries in football occur during non-contact situations, classified as 'indirect muscle injuries' or 'muscle strains'. These are typically thought to occur in the muscle-tendon junctionwhen the force applied exceeds the tissue capacity.

In football, muscle strain injuries constitute up to 31% of all injuries, and up to 37% of players experience absence from training and/or match play during a season due to a muscle injury. Besides from significant financial costs at the professional level, the high injury burden of muscle injuriesalso have substantial implications on player availability, potentially affecting team performance. Up to 92% of all muscle strain injuries encountered in football are located in the hamstrings (37%), adductors (23%), rectus femoris/quadriceps (19%) and calf muscles (13%), with hamstring strain injuries also being the most common diagnosis in sports such as Australian footballand track and field.

The fact that incidence of muscle strain injury has remained constant during the last decades in footballand Australian footballwith slightly increased incidence for hamstringand calf muscle strains, highlights the ongoing challenge of muscle strain injuries in sport. Thus, to aid management of common muscle injuries in sport, the aim of this statement, commissioned by the Danish Society of Sports Physical Therapy, was to provide an overview of the existing literature. We identify, evaluate and grade the quality of evidence concerning the diagnostic effectiveness of clinical tests and the effect of preventive and treatment strategies for the most common lower limb muscle injuries including hamstring, adductor, rectus femoris/quadriceps and calf muscle injuries.

### Time trends in musculoskeletal disorders attributed to work exposures in Ontario using three independent data sources, 2004–2011 [^112VqHF7]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Work-related MSDs

We implemented a conceptually concordant case definition for work-related non-traumatic MSDs in each of the two administrative data sources. The case definitions required that the nature of the injury involved the musculoskeletal system and that the cause of injury excluded documentation of a traumatic cause. The implementation of the case definition in workers' compensation claims adopted standards established in Ontario to inform the development of a workplace MSDs prevention guideline. The eligible 'nature of injury' codes and 'injury event' codes are provided in online. In the emergency department data, the case definition for records with an eligible ICD-10-CA diagnostic code in the Injury classification family (S00-T99) required the absence of an accompanying ICD-10-CA code for a traumatic 'external cause' of injury (see online supplementary appendix 1). 'External cause' of injury coding is not applicable for records with an ICD-10-CA diagnostic code in the Musculoskeletal System classification family (M00–99). Eligible diagnostic codes in the Musculoskeletal System classification are listed in online supplementary appendix 1.

Workers' compensation claim records and emergency department records that did not meet the case definition for work-related MSDs were classified to a common category named 'other work-related conditions'.

Work-related repetitive strain injury (self-reported)

Respondents to the CCHS health interview survey were provided information that repetitive strain injury is "caused by overuse or by repeating the same movement frequently (for example, carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, or tendonitis)". Respondents were asked whether they had any injuries due to repetitive strain which was serious enough to limit their normal activities in the past 12 months. Respondents who reported a repetitive strain injury were asked to identify the activity to which they attributed the cause of the injury, where response categories included "working at a job or business (excluding traveling to and from work)". We operationalised work-related repetitive strain injury as respondents who reported having a repetitive strain injury in the past 12 months which was respondent-attributed to exposures arising from working at a job or business.

### Overuse injuries of the wrist [^1147oEf2]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Overuse is defined as repetitive microtrauma that overwhelms the tissues' ability to adapt. Microtrauma represents damage at molecular level and can be produced by either a tension or shear load. The wrist and hand are vulnerable to upper extremity overuse injuries related to work or sports activities that require repetitive movements, often coupled with weight bearing. These injuries create challenges for orthopedic surgeons and radiologists because of the demands on athletes and employees. A thorough understanding of the mechanism of injury, activities, and magnetic resonance imaging findings is necessary for accurate diagnosis, providing key information to perform adequate therapeutic planning.

### Proximal hamstring tears: endoscopic hamstring repair [^1155nciW]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Proximal hamstring tears are common among athletes, especially in sports involving eccentric lengthening during forced hip flexion and knee extension, such as hurdles or water skiing. Tears are described by timing (acute [< 1 month] or chronic) and severity (partial or complete). Complete tears are easily identified with magnetic resonance imaging; however, partial tears may be subtle and potentially missed. The spectrum of pathology associated with acute injuries ranges from minor strains to complete tears or avulsions. Acute tears commonly present as pain and bruising over the posterior thigh along with weakness with active knee flexion and often a sensation of instability of the lower extremity. Chronic injuries typically present with ischial pain associated with repetitive activities, and the spectrum includes chronic tendinopathies, ischial bursitis, partial tears, and nonoperatively treated complete tears. Nonoperative treatment is recommended in the setting of low-grade partial tears and insertional tendinosis. However, failure of nonoperative treatment of partial tears may benefit from surgical debridement and repair. Further, surgical repair of complete tears with retraction is usually recommended for active patients. Historically, surgical treatment has been limited to open surgical approaches, although endoscopic management of proximal hamstring tears and chronic ischial bursitis is an option. Our endoscopic technique employs the use of two anchors, double loaded with high-strength suture, and may support a faster recovery due to decreased surgical morbidity. It is important to note that some patients may not be candidates for this endoscopic repair as a result of several factors, including prior chronic and retracted tears, as well as those with altered regional tissue planes due to prior surgical repair.

Introduction

In spite of all the research and additional understanding of hamstring muscle injures over the past 20–30 years, we have not reduced the incidence of first-time injuries and the recurrence rate is still extremely high. While research published over the past couple of years has led to an increased understanding of these challenging injuries, we still have a long way to go in the management of hamstring muscle injuries.

### Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury and transcription factor modulation [^112C3DJA]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Medium credibility.

The worldwide incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is ∼0.5% per year and the frequency is significantly higher among military personnel and athletes. Repetitive TBIs are associated with military and athletic activities, and typically involve more severe consequences. The majority of TBIs are mild; however, these still can result in long-term cognitive deficits, and there is currently no effective treatment. tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) and pioglitazone can activate the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) transcription factors, respectively, and each has been shown to be neuroprotective in various model systems. We examined behavioral and gene expression changes after repetitive mild TBI followed by simultaneous treatment with both factors. We used a repetitive closed head injury of mice involving five injuries with a 1-week interval between each TBI. We found that memory performance was significantly reduced by the injuries, unless the TBIs were followed by the tBHQ and pioglitazone administrations. Certain genes; for example, growth hormone and osteopontin, were downregulated by the injury, and this was reversed by the treatment, whereas other genes; for example, a tumor necrosis factor receptor, were upregulated by the injury and restored if the post-injury treatment was administered. Analysis of gene expression levels affected by the injury and/or the treatment point to potential mechanisms that could be exploited therapeutically.

### Concussion susceptibility is mediated by spreading depolarization-induced neurovascular dysfunction [^117AsKwm]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The mechanisms underlying the complications of mild traumatic brain injury, including post-concussion syndrome, post-impact catastrophic death, and delayed neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. This limited pathophysiological understanding has hindered the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and has prevented the advancement of treatments for the sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury.

We aimed to characterize the early electrophysiological and neurovascular alterations following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury and sought to identify new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of individuals at risk of severe post-impact complications. We combined behavioural, electrophysiological, molecular, and neuroimaging techniques in a rodent model of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. In humans, we used dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to quantify blood–brain barrier dysfunction after exposure to sport-related concussive mild traumatic brain injury.

Rats could clearly be classified based on their susceptibility to neurological complications, including life-threatening outcomes, following repetitive injury. Susceptible animals showed greater neurological complications and had higher levels of blood–brain barrier dysfunction, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signalling, and neuroinflammation compared to resilient animals. Cortical spreading depolarizations were the most common electrophysiological events immediately following mild traumatic brain injury and were associated with longer recovery from impact. Triggering cortical spreading depolarizations in mild traumatic brain injured rats (but not in controls) induced blood–brain barrier dysfunction. Treatment with a selective TGFβ receptor inhibitor prevented blood–brain barrier opening and reduced injury complications. Consistent with the rodent model, blood–brain barrier dysfunction was found in a subset of human athletes following concussive mild traumatic brain injury.

We provide evidence that cortical spreading depolarization, blood–brain barrier dysfunction, and pro-inflammatory TGFβ signalling are associated with severe, potentially life-threatening outcomes following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. Diagnostic-coupled targeting of TGFβ signalling may be a novel strategy in treating mild traumatic brain injury.

Risk factors for rotator cuff tears — Because most rotator cuff tears are largely caused by the normal wear and tear that goes along with aging, people over 40 are at greater risk. People who do repetitive lifting or overhead activities, e.g. painters and carpenters, are also at higher risk for rotator cuff tears. Athletes are especially vulnerable to overuse tears, particularly in the setting of repetitive microtrauma as observed in tennis players and baseball pitchers. Although overuse tears caused by sports activity or overhead work also occur in younger people, most tears in young adults are caused by a traumatic injury, like a fall or shoulder dislocation.

### An interpretable machine learning tool for in-home monitoring of agitation episodes in people living with dementia: a proof-of-concept study [^114yDx52]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Agitation is a neuropsychiatric symptom that affects more than 30% of people living with dementia (PLwD), and is characterised by a 93% recurrence rate. Agitation in individuals with cognitive impairment or dementia is defined as persistent behaviours that indicate emotional distress, can lead to significant disability, and are not solely attributable to another disorder. Agitation manifests as excessive motor activity and verbal or physical aggression. However, agitation is not synonymous with aggression; it is also characterised by non-aggressive actions, such as wandering and repetition. Such episodes are associated with adverse healthcare events, including fall-related injuries. Current clinical practice for managing agitation in PLwD primarily relies on pharmaceutical interventions, such as prescribing antipsychotic drugs. However, these medications may cause severe side effects, including pneumonia, acute kidney injury, venous thromboembolism, and stroke. Agitation could also affect the emotional and mental well-being of carers. Identification and appropriate treatment of agitation are essential for mitigating associated risks, lowering healthcare expenses, and alleviating carer strain.

### Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in collaborative cross (CC) mice recapitulates individual cardiotoxicity in humans [^1174aicF]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

Serum biomarkers

Alteration in serum cardiac troponin I (cTNI), myosin light chain 3 (MYL3), fatty acid binding protein 3 and serum troponin 1 in acute and chronic phases were evaluated (S3 Table 3). Only cTNI (pg/ml) and MYL3 (pg/ml) exhibited significant treatment effects across multiple strains (Figure 7 and S4 Table 4). Both cTNI and MYL3 tended to decrease between acute and chronic phases, in contrast to cardiac scores which increased over time. These data indicate that serum levels of these biomarkers are highest during acute cardiac injury, and decline during the chronic phase, despite ongoing or worsening of cardiac injury. The exception to this was strain CC 37, in which cTNI and MYL3 levels increased over time. cTNI exhibited a significant treatment effect in almost all strains, compared to a similar finding in 5/10 strains for MYL3, indicating that cTNI is the more sensitive indicator of acute cardiac injury. We employed a linear model based test to assess whether troponin levels in the acute phase predict the ultimate extent of cardiac injury (as quantified by cardiac scores in the chronic timepoint). We evaluated each sex separately to allow for potential sex-specific differences. The significance for cTNI was quite low (P = 0.42 and P = 0.30 for females and males, respectively) indicating that cTNI values in the acute phase do not reliably predict the ultimate extent of cardiac injury. When MYL3 is combined with cTNI, the predictive power remained poor for both biomarkers in females (P = 0.14 and P = 0.13 for cTNI and MYL3, respectively). However in males, MYL3 appeared to be predictive for extent of ultimate cardiac injury in the chronic phase (P = 0.15 and P = 0.94 for cTNI and MYL3, respectively).

### Distal hamstring injuries and disorders [^112CqsDw]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Among athletes, the most commonly injured muscle group is the hamstring muscle group, comprising 12% to 29% of all sports-related injuries. – Most hamstring injuries are noninsertional injuries sustained at the myotendinous junction as strain injuries, with the proximal musculotendinous junction being the most common location of injury. Proximal tendinous avulsions represent the next most commonly encountered area of injury. There is a large amount of literature discussing the diagnosis, workup, and treatment of both hamstring myotendinous junction/muscle strains and proximal avulsion injuries. Distal hamstring injuries occur less frequently, and at this time, there are only a limited number of case series and case reports discussing evaluation and treatment of distal hamstring pathology. For the sake of this review, we are defining distal hamstring pathology as problems that occur distal to the distal myotendinous junction of the hamstring tendons.

Broadly speaking, distal hamstring pathology can be categorized as traumatic or atraumatic lesions. Acute, traumatic injuries of the distal hamstrings most commonly involve the biceps femoris tendon and most often occur as part of a mult-ligamentous injury of the knee in which the posterolateral corner is involved. However, isolated biceps femoris avulsions do occur and have been reported in the setting of preexisting tendinopathy and in young athletes involved with running, jumping, kicking, and/or rapid acceleration in their sport. – Distal hamstring avulsions can occur on the medial side as well, although less commonly than with the biceps femoris. These injuries most often occur as an avulsion of the semitendinosus with retraction proximal to the level of the knee joint, resulting in a painful mass. – In addition, patients can present with "snapping" distal hamstring tendons that can be difficult for the treating physician to treat if they are not aware of the condition and may predispose the patient to wrong diagnoses or treatments. – It is the intent of this literature review to discuss the hamstring anatomy and explore further the literature currently present on evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of distal hamstring pathology to better educate the treating physician on these conditions.

### Categorising sports injuries in epidemiological studies: the subsequent injury categorisation (SIC) model to address multiple, recurrent and exacerbation of injuries [^115VH87K]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

A better understanding of the nature, causes and outcomes of subsequent injuries will have major implications for sports medicine clinical practice because returning players to preinjury function, ensuring recovery of their physical functioning and preventing future injuries are the major goals of treatment. From the preventive health, clinical treatment and injury management perspectives, subsequent injuries are problematic for players, as well as for the coaches who need to manage their training and participation workloads and the clinicians who manage the rehabilitation and recovery from those injuries. Importantly, just because an injured player has no symptoms does not mean that they have had full tissue recovery.

In conclusion, the recognition and handling of subsequent sports injuries pose a substantial challenge for the sports medicine field — both in terms of injury treatment and in epidemiological research to quantify them. This study has found that about one in six (or 15.6%) of all subsequent sports injuries should be coded to categories representing injuries that are directly related to previous index injuries. Moreover, injured sports participants can sustain both recurrent injuries and the same injury again, and either can be dependent upon earlier index injuries. Importantly, this study has also shown that it is likely to be inappropriate to use the same index (eg, only the first injury in a chronological sequence) for all subsequent injuries. Together, this justifies the applicability of the SIC model through its ability to allow for multiple different injury types within players that recognises that the within-player dependencies are likely to be stronger for recurrent (exact same) injuries or injury exacerbations, rather than multiple (different but new) injury outcomes.

In summary, this paper sets out a holistic way of reviewing subsequent injuries that has strong clinical application and relevance. The SIC model needs further evaluation through application to other datasets, but the only way to do that is to put it out for evaluation by other epidemiologists. There will still be challenges in knowing how to best analyse the data classified according to the SIC model, but the frailty survival model approach recently advocated by Ullah and colleaguesand multistate process survival models show promise.

What are the new findings?

This paper presents a new model to categorise subsequent (multiple, recurrent, exacerbation or new) sports injuries, derived from statistical considerations of dependencies between different injuries and sports medicine clinical considerations.
Greater capacity to classify subsequent injuries will allow improved understanding of the effect of initial injury on reinjury and injury exacerbations for both clinical management and injury prevention.

### Mouse strain modulates the role of the ciliated cell in acute tracheobronchial airway injury-distal airways [^112xHStD]. The American Journal of Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Understanding cellular repair mechanisms in vivo has been advanced through the use of well-defined injury and repair models and their application to knockout and transgenic animals, primarily mice generated in a variety of background strains. However, little is known concerning the effect that mouse strain itself has on the interpretation and comparability of observations when the strain used for genetic manipulation is not the strain used to develop the model. We compared acute bronchiolar injury and repair in three strains of mice used in knockout mouse development (C57BL/6, 129/TerSv, and 129/SvEv) to the model strain (Swiss Webster) after treatment with the same dose of naphthalene and sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 days after treatment. Extent of Clara cell toxicity and exfoliation was identical in the distal airways of all strains. There were significant strain-related differences in ciliated cell squamation, initiation and duration of proliferation, epithelial differentiation, and time to completion of epithelial repair. We conclude that ciliated cells play a prominent role in repair of distal airway injury, but that all phases of the repair process differ by strain. In addition, our findings reinforce that control animals must be of the same strain, ideally litter mates, when transgenic or knockout mice are used for the study of airway repair processes and mechanisms.

### Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in collaborative cross (CC) mice recapitulates individual cardiotoxicity in humans [^113wCAPr]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiac disease scoring

Scores for each anatomical region were summed to obtain a total cardiac score for each animal. Lesions occurred in all compartments of the heart, with higher scores indicating increasing severity across all anatomical locations. Cardiac severity scores were higher in the majority of doxorubicin-treated animals (Figure 3). These treatment effects reached statistical significance in 6 strains (CC011, CC019, CC032, CC040, CC042, CC051) (Table 1). In CC011, significance was driven by consistently low scores in controls, as scores in treated animals were relatively low at both time points. Thus we did not consider CC011 to be a strain with a strong adverse treatment effect. More severe cardiac pathology was noted in most chronically treated animals, timepoint (acute vs. chronic) was statistically significant for strain CC032, and the interaction of treatment with timepoint was significant in four strains (CC001, CC019, CC041, CC042). Susceptibility to doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury varied by sex with greater injury occurring in either males (CC010, CC037, CC041) or in females (CC001). No strain was immune to some degree of cardiac damage, however varying strain susceptibility to cardiac toxicity induced by doxorubicin could be discerned. Overall, three strains appeared relatively resistant to chronic cardiac injury (CC011, CC037 and CC051), with all remaining strains experiencing chronic injury, most severe in CC019 and CC032, CC041 and CC042 (note that most animals in CC040 had died by the chronic stage, and are absent from the analysis). These animals had high renal scores in the acute stage and are likely to have died from combined cardiac and renal toxicity – pathology was not available. Rare vehicle treated animals experienced myofiber vacuolation, disintegration and focal fibrosis - these clustered by strain and were considered a manifestation of mild strain-specific cardiac pathology unrelated to doxorubicin exposure (CC001, CC019, CC041).

### Increased microglial exosomal miR-124–3p alleviates neurodegeneration and improves cognitive outcome after rmTBI [^114swnxp]. Molecular Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of neurodegeneration in repetitively injured neurons after exosome treatment was evaluated by three aspects. (1) To assess neurite outgrowth of injured neurons, the neurite branches were labeled with the neuron-specific beta III-tubulin by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 3 A). We quantified the neurite branch numbers and total neurite length under a microscope and found that the repetitive injury induced a decrease of the branch numbers and neurite length, while EXO-124 treatment reversed the change (Figures 3 B and 3C). In addition, hopping probe ion conductance microscopy (HPICM) continuous topological scanning was performed to further observe the microscopic changes in injured neurons after successive transfection of miR-124–3p mimics and miR-124–3p inhibitor. It suggested that the branch numbers and neurite length of injured neurons were restored by transfection with miR-124–3p mimics for 12 h but decreased after transfection with miR-124–3p inhibitor for another 12 h (Figure 3 D). From this, we could draw the conclusion that EXO-124 treatment contributed to promoting neurite outgrowth after cell injury via transferring miR-124–3p into neurons. (2) To detect the expression of neuroprotective factors and neurodegenerative indicators, the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurogranin, and VILIP-1 in neurons after injury and exosome treatment were quantified. BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family, which contributes to supporting the survival of existing neurons, encouraging the growth and differentiation of newborn neurons, and enhancing the synaptic plasticity. It is a classic neuroprotective factor, as its disruption is considered to be a significant risk factor for AD and age-related cognitive decline. Neurogranin is a calmodulin-binding protein primarily expressed in dendritic spines. It exerts a neuroprotective effect in the pathological development of cerebral ischemia. As a postsynaptic protein, it also acts as an indicator of mild TBIand AD. VILIP-1 is a neuron-specific calcium sensor protein that modulates intracellular signaling pathways by directly or indirectly regulating the activity of adenylyl cyclase. It has been identified to be a potential neurodegenerative biomarker with an elevated level in ischemic stroke, TBI, and early-stage AD patients. Western blot results have shown that the repetitive injury induced a decreased expression of BDNF and neurogranin and an increased expression of VILIP-1 in neurons. In addition, these expression changes were reversed by EXO-124 treatment (Figures 3 E and 3G), suggesting that the neurodegeneration led by repetitive injury could be inhibited by microglial exosomal miR-124–3p. (3) The Aβ abnormalities were evaluated in injured neurons after exosome treatment. Aβ is the main component of the amyloid plaques (senile plaques) that are found in the brain of AD patients. Its deposition also occurs at an early age and at an accelerated rate in rmTBI patients, which is associated with increased clinical and pathological severity. In addition, Aβ is derived from its precursor protein, APP, and aggregates to form soluble oligomers Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42, which are toxic to nerve cells. Therefore, the expression levels of APP and Aβ in neurons, and those of Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 in the culture medium, were assessed. We found that all of their expressions were promoted after injury and were suppressed after EXO-124 treatment (Figures 3 F and 3H–3J), indicating that the Aβ abnormalities in neurons induced by repetitive injury can be inhibited by microglial exosomal miR-124–3p. Taken together, these results suggested that microglial exosomal miR-124–3p could alleviate neurodegeneration in repetitive injured neurons via their transfer by exosomes.

### Managing painful shoulder after neurological injury [^112M19wo]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Management

The physical management of all presentations involves appropriate manual handling and a plan for the 24-hour positioning of the affected limb (Box 3). In all cases, management should ideally be led by a multi-disciplinary team and be tailored to the individual's functional status, quality of life, goals, and expected progress. Management should follow a stepwise approach and the effectiveness of each intervention should be reviewed at regular intervals. Specific physiotherapy and medical management recommendations of the four clinical presentations are outlined in Box 4. We recommend that first line treatments are continued alongside treatment escalations.

Steroid injections may be considered primarily for the management of acute exacerbations of pain not responding to first line treatments and simple analgesia, and/or in the context of meeting particular functional goals in the rehabilitation setting. They should not be considered routinely, nor do we advocate regularly repeated injections due to the potential risks of muscle atrophy and/or damage (for example tear or rupture). There are large variations between practitioners regarding how often and how many injections should be offered. A rough guide would be to repeat up to twice in total in the same location in cases of chronic intractable shoulder pain. Where steroids are mentioned in this paper, treatment is expected to show an effect 1-week post injection and to last 6–8 weeks.

When considering referral to the orthopaedic team, it is important to consider the background neurological injury and degree of functional recovery, hence the likelihood that surgery would offer benefit.

### Common occupational upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders [^112k5TYj]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Family physicians play a valuable role in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders that result from occupational exposures, including overexertion, repetitive motion, and vibration. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome often identified in workers whose jobs require repetitive hand motion. Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome includes splinting, rehabilitation exercises, and oral or injected corticosteroids; surgical release is considered in patients for whom conservative treatment has failed or who have severe symptoms. Lateral epicondylitis is an elbow disorder resulting from overuse; it is diagnosed clinically and managed with bracing, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. Rotator cuff tendinopathy is a degenerative disorder of the rotator cuff musculature and tendons and is often identified in people who perform repetitive work overhead. Rotator cuff tendinopathy is diagnosed clinically and generally managed nonoperatively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and corticosteroid injections; imaging may be considered to confirm the diagnosis after initial conservative treatment. Trigger finger is a stenosing tenosynovitis of the flexor ten-dons of the hand and occurs among people whose jobs require repetitive gripping. Corticosteroid injection is a first-line treatment for trigger finger. A careful history can assist the clinician in determining whether an injury is work related. Providing appropriate work restrictions for injured workers to allow a safe return to work may expedite recovery.

### Descriptive study on injuries and illness in Dutch female adolescent and young adult handball players [^117SHmqB]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Injury and illness definitions

All injuries and illnesses that required medical attention from a physiotherapist or physician were registered in the database. In retrospect, injuries and illnesses were classified according to the guidelines of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Injuries were defined as concerns due to tissue damage that resulted from a handball-related activity. Illnesses were defined as concerns that were not related to injury, including physical and mental problems. The IOC guidelines were also used to classify the anatomical location, injury type and mode of onset. The registered injuries were classified as either acute or repetitive, based on the injury type and medical report. Acute injuries were defined as injuries resulting from a single and clearly identifiable event. Repetitive injuries were defined as injuries resulting from the accumulation of repetitive trauma with a sudden or gradual onset. In addition, acute injuries were divided into practice-related and competition-related injuries. As we only had availability of medical records, the severity of injuries and illnesses had to be defined as the duration in days of the injury being under treatment. This is the number of days between the date of reporting the injury to the medical staff and the date of the final consultation for that same injury. This duration does not necessarily reflect the severity in days of time-loss.

Exposure

Total training exposure was estimated based on standard training schedules within the Handball Academy. Exposure hours were estimated by multiplying the number and average duration of training sessions at group level per season, excluding the total missed training sessions at group level due to injury. For the competition exposure, an approximation was made based on the average weekly competition exposure at individual level of the last available season, assuming that this was representable for earlier seasons.

Study parameters and study endpoints

The magnitude of injuries and illnesses was expressed in prevalence proportions, and for acute injuries also in the incidence rate of injuries per 1000 handball hours. The prevalence proportions and incidence rates were calculated for the entire period as well as per season, by anatomical location and by injury type.

The severity was expressed as the duration of the injury or illness being under treatment in days, and the burden of injuries and illnesses was consequently defined as the number of days injuries being under treatment per 1000 hours of exposure.

### Athletic hand injuries [^1172pHd1]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Hand injuries are among the most common injuries arising from athletic participation. Suboptimal outcomes from poorly treated athletic hand injuries can produce functionally disabling injuries. Careful assessment and, when needed, radiographic studies are critical for the accurate and complete diagnoses of hand injuries. Carefully thought out modifications may accelerate the time for return to competition. A thorough understanding of these many variables can enable the physician to minimize time lost without compromising care.

### Statement on methods in sport injury research from the 1st METHODS MATTER meeting, copenhagen, 2019 [^115VUvfF]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The choice of sports injury definition should also be guided by the research question. For example, studies of workload and injury risk have typically recorded only non-contact injuries, based on an assumption that workload is unrelated to contact injuries. On the other hand, studies of overuse injuries in general require broad definitions, as athletes often continue to participate in training and competition despite being injured. In addition, we need to consider how to capture a sports injury when it originates from sport, from an activity of daily living or from a combination of the two. A continued discussion on these (and other) aspects related to injury definitions is needed.

### Randomized trial of sedative choice for intubation (RSI) [^1161tDvY]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Each year more than 1. 5 million critically ill adults receive invasive mechanical ventilation in the United States, at a cost of nearly $30 billion dollars annually. Recent research has dramatically improved patient safety during the maintenance, weaning, and liberation stages of invasive mechanical ventilation. In contrast, the optimal approach to the initiation of mechanical ventilation remains an important knowledge gap in the care of adults with respiratory failure. Among critically ill adults, life-threatening complications during tracheal intubation and initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation remain common. One in five patients experiences hypotension and one-in-forty experiences cardiac arrest during the two-minute tracheal intubation procedure. Cardiovascular collapse is a peri-procedural outcome defined as severe hypotension, new or increased vasopressors, cardiac arrest or death.

The occurrence of cardiovascular collapse during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults increases patients' risk of in-hospital mortality. Randomized trials examining intubation technique commonly target cardiovascular collapse as an outcome. Rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation, the most common method of intubation for critically ill patients, is the nearly simultaneous administration of a sedative medication and neuromuscular blocking medication. The ideal sedative agent for rapid sequence intubation would rapidly provide a deep state of unconsciousness and analgesia without causing hemodynamic side effects. Two randomized trials have directly compared ketamine to etomidate for RSI among critically ill adults. The Ketased trial, published in 2009, was a 469-patient trial conducted across 12 emergency medical services and emergency departments in France.

Because many patients were enrolled in the pre-hospital setting without continuous blood pressure monitoring, peri-procedural outcomes such as cardiovascular collapse were not collected, and the results were indeterminate, in regards to the primary outcome, average Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores in the 72 hours after intubation. The conclusion of this single-center trial was that "there was no significant difference in survival by Day 28", however it was noted that this "could represent a small but durable long-term survival effect, one which our trial was under-powered to detect". Experts have pointed out that the currently available data on sedative choice during tracheal intubation of critically ill patients are inadequate and have called for additional randomized clinical trials.
