## Question

Best anxiety med for hospice outside of Ativan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication is the best alternative to lorazepam (Ativan) for treating anxiety in hospice care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why lorazepam is typically used. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and evidence say about alternatives. Next, I will examine the pharmacologic options with rapid onset and practical routes, especially midazolam. After that, I need to weigh risks, including respiratory depression and delirium, and consider special populations like dementia. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline dosing, monitoring, and when to avoid benzodiazepines altogether.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why lorazepam is common in hospice. Anxiety in hospice is often acute, severe, and intertwined with dyspnea, delirium, or existential distress, so clinicians prioritize rapid-onset, titratable agents with multiple routes; lorazepam fits this profile with SL, IV, and IM options and a relatively intermediate half-life, which is why it appears frequently in hospice order sets and prehospital protocols [^5bbffb83] [^db974b85].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for pharmacologic treatment of anxiety specifically in palliative care. The Cochrane reviews repeatedly conclude there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about drug therapy for anxiety in adult palliative care, underscoring that practice is largely consensus- and guideline-driven rather than supported by robust RCTs, which means I need to be cautious and align with guideline consensus rather than overstate any single agent's superiority [^2b0b801f] [^3cbfe70d] [^8a5bea98].

> I will now examine the most plausible alternative with rapid onset and flexible routes: midazolam. Guidelines and practice patterns consistently list midazolam as a first-line anxiolytic in hospice alongside lorazepam, with dosing such as 4 mg IV every 30 minutes PRN for anxiety or respiratory distress, and infusion options for refractory symptoms; its water solubility, rapid IV/SC/IM onset, and short half-life make it highly titratable at end of life, including for dyspnea-related anxiety and palliative sedation when indicated [^db974b85] [^cd4241ee] [^e9fbf2b6] [^a872edd1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy. I initially thought midazolam had stronger evidence for anxiety per se, but I should double-check. The ASCO dyspnea guideline supports short-acting benzodiazepines for dyspnea-related anxiety after opioids and nonpharmacologic measures, and ESMO suggests benzodiazepines with caution for breathlessness with anxiety; however, a randomized intranasal midazolam trial for dyspnea showed no benefit over placebo, reminding me that evidence is mixed and patient selection matters, especially regarding baseline anxiety and the anxiolytic component of breathlessness relief [^e9fbf2b6] [^50544b5d] [^c8c83253].

> Next, I should review safety and drug–drug interactions. Benzodiazepines carry boxed warnings with opioids for profound sedation and respiratory depression; thus, if used with opioids, I need to use the lowest effective doses, minimize duration, and monitor closely, which is particularly salient in frail older adults and those with compromised respiration; observational data in hospice cohorts suggest combined use can be safe when carefully titrated, but I must balance this against guideline cautions and individual risk [^8b6edab3] [^7e3e4122] [^a7362874].

> But wait, what if the patient has dementia or is not imminently dying. I need to ensure I consider mortality and functional trade-offs. Recent high-quality data associate benzodiazepine initiation in hospice-enrolled patients with dementia with increased 180-day mortality, and clinicians report that sedation can impair communication and independence earlier in the trajectory; therefore, I should prefer nonpharmacologic strategies and reserve benzodiazepines for refractory distress or the final days, documenting goals of care and revisiting decisions frequently [^61f1dc88] [^4c675973] [^30c9d5e8].

> Let me consider other pharmacologic options when benzodiazepines are undesirable or ineffective. Haloperidol is often used for agitation and delirium and can be combined with lorazepam for severe agitated delirium; gabapentin may help anxiety with neuropathic pain or restlessness; and in selected cases, low-dose antipsychotics or even psychostimulants can be considered for comorbid symptoms, though evidence in terminal-phase anxiety is limited and onset may be too slow for acute relief, so these are second- or third-line adjuncts rather than replacements for rapid-onset anxiolysis [^403ed111] [^c441fb59].

> I should confirm practical dosing and monitoring if midazolam is chosen. Typical PRN dosing uses 2–5 mg IV/SC/IM every 30–60 minutes with careful titration, and for refractory symptoms, continuous infusions around 2 mg/hour IV can be used with close observation; given rapid onset and redistribution, I need to reassess frequently, avoid stacking doses, and de-escalate as soon as symptoms permit, especially in combination with opioids [^db974b85] [^cd4241ee].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation matches the clinical realities. Outside of lorazepam, midazolam is the most defensible first-line alternative for rapid anxiolysis in hospice because of its pharmacokinetics, guideline endorsement, and real-world utility, but I should frame this as a consensus-based choice with limited direct comparative evidence and emphasize nonpharmacologic measures, careful opioid co-prescribing, and individualized risk–benefit review, particularly in dementia or when prognosis extends beyond weeks [^db974b85] [^e9fbf2b6] [^8a5bea98].

> Final synthesis: Midazolam is the best-supported alternative to lorazepam for anxiety in hospice when rapid-onset, titratable anxiolysis is needed, with typical PRN dosing of 2–5 mg IV/SC/IM every 30–60 minutes or infusion at 2 mg/hour for refractory symptoms, used cautiously with opioids and reserved for significant distress or the final days of life; I should document goals, monitor for oversedation and delirium, and pivot to nonpharmacologic strategies whenever feasible, especially in patients with dementia or longer expected survival [^db974b85] [^cd4241ee] [^e9fbf2b6] [^61f1dc88].

Midazolam is the **best alternative to lorazepam** for anxiety in hospice, with rapid onset, short duration, and multiple routes (IV, SC, IM, SL, buccal) for flexible titration [^db974b85] [^c8c83253]. It is **first-line in many hospice protocols** for anxiety and dyspnea-related anxiety, especially when rapid effect is needed [^db974b85] [^e9fbf2b6]. Diazepam is less favored due to longer half-life and active metabolites, and haloperidol is reserved for agitation or delirium rather than pure anxiety. Non-benzodiazepine options (e.g. gabapentin, hydroxyzine) are slower and less effective for acute anxiety, so midazolam remains the preferred alternative when lorazepam is not suitable [^c441fb59].

## Pharmacological alternatives to lorazepam

Key characteristics of benzodiazepine alternatives:

| **Aspect** | **Midazolam** | **Diazepam** | **Haloperidol** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | Benzodiazepine with rapid onset and short duration; GABA-A agonist | Long-acting benzodiazepine; GABA-A agonist | Antipsychotic; dopamine D2 antagonist |
| Clinical considerations | Preferred for rapid anxiolysis; multiple routes; minimal active metabolites; titratable infusion | Less favored due to long half-life and active metabolites; risk of accumulation and oversedation | Reserved for agitation, delirium, or refractory anxiety; not first-line for pure anxiety |
| Evidence/guideline support | First-line in hospice protocols; strong guideline support for anxiety and dyspnea-related anxiety | Limited hospice-specific support; less favored in current practice | Used for agitation/delirium; modest evidence for anxiety alone |

---

### Midazolam

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Rapid onset (1–3 min IV), short duration (20–30 min), minimal active metabolites, and multiple routes (IV, SC, IM, SL, buccal) [^c8c83253].
- **Clinical use**: First-line in hospice for anxiety and dyspnea-related anxiety; titratable infusion for refractory symptoms [^db974b85] [^cd4241ee].
- **Guideline support**: Strong endorsement in hospice protocols and dyspnea guidelines for anxiety-related breathlessness [^db974b85] [^e9fbf2b6].

---

### Diazepam

Diazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with a prolonged half-life and active metabolites, which increases the risk of accumulation and oversedation. It is **less favored in hospice** due to these pharmacokinetic limitations and has limited hospice-specific support compared with midazolam.

---

### Haloperidol

Haloperidol is an antipsychotic used primarily for agitation, delirium, or refractory anxiety; it is **not first-line for pure anxiety** and has modest evidence for anxiety alone. It is best reserved for cases with prominent psychotic features or delirium.

---

## Non-benzodiazepine alternatives

Non-benzodiazepine options such as gabapentin and hydroxyzine have **slower onset and less robust evidence** for acute anxiety in hospice. They may be considered for chronic anxiety or when benzodiazepines are contraindicated, but they are not ideal for rapid relief.

---

## Clinical considerations and recommendations

- **Patient-specific factors**: Renal/hepatic function, respiratory status, and comorbidities guide selection and dosing [^74a12c8c].
- **Monitoring**: Close observation for sedation, respiratory depression, and delirium, especially with opioids or other CNS depressants [^8b6edab3].
- **Nonpharmacologic interventions**: Environmental modifications, reassurance, and mindfulness should be used alongside medications [^5bbffb83].

---

Midazolam is the **preferred alternative to lorazepam** for anxiety in hospice due to its rapid onset, short duration, and flexible administration, with diazepam and haloperidol reserved for select scenarios. Non-benzodiazepine options are slower and less effective for acute anxiety, reinforcing midazolam's role as the best alternative.

### Lorazepam [^e4eec8e9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Lorazepam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety or anxiety associated with depressive symptoms. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.

The effectiveness of lorazepam in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

Background

Anxiety is common among patients with advanced disease. It can be a natural response to impending death, but may also result from an underlying anxiety disorder, pain, or other untreated or poorly managed symptoms.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to identify and evaluate studies examining medications used to treat patients suffering from anxiety during the terminal phases of disease.

Search Strategy

We searched the following sources: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2003), EMBASE (1980 to July 2003), CINAHL (1982 to July 2003), PsycLit (1974 to July 2003), PsycInfo (1990 to July 2003), and the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2003) for literature pertaining to this topic published in any language using a detailed search strategy.

Selection Criteria

Prospective, randomized trials with or without blinding involving the use of pharmacological agents for the treatment of anxiety at the end of life were sought.

Data Collection and Analysis

Six potential studies were identified by the search strategy but none met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Two of these studies assessed the effectiveness of alprazolam in patients with a diagnosis of cancer, but who would not be considered in the end-stage of life.

Main Results

No data were available to enable an assessment to be made of the effectiveness of drugs to treat anxiety in palliative care patients.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There remains insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for anxiety in terminally ill patients. To date no studies were found that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Prospective controlled clinical trials are necessary in order to establish the benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of anxiety in palliative care.

Theme 3: Discrepancies in perceived effectiveness of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics in treating behavioral symptoms

When asked about the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics in managing behavioral symptoms at end of life, most caregivers perceived medication treatment options as largely effective:

"It was very effective. I was shocked how it just settled her down and didn't knock her out. It just took that edge away".

Furthermore, agitation as well as anxiety were frequently cited by caregivers as the behavioral symptoms that were most helped by medications:

"She just calmed down, you could see it, she just was not as agitated and not as nervous. She was no longer aggressive towards other people".

In contrast, most clinicians described benzodiazepines and antipsychotics as only somewhat effective, noting the unpredictable nature of treatment and the challenge of finding the right dose for a given individual:

"It's just quite variable. You wish that you could say that certain patients will respond better than others with certain medication and extremely idiosyncratic in how these patients are going to respond. So, that variability in response makes it very challenging to use any of these medications".

"I never get good luck with benzodiazepines. They sleep or they're angry — I just don't like them because they're not that effective literature‐wise, and anecdotally I have yet to find them horribly effective".

### Drug therapy for symptoms associated with anxiety in adult palliative care patients [^3cbfe70d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of the review published on 'Drug therapy for anxiety in adult palliative care patients' in Issue 1, 2004 of The Cochrane Library. Anxiety is common in palliative care patients. It can be a natural response to impending death, but it may represent a clinically significant issue in its own right. It may also result from pain, or other untreated or poorly managed symptoms. When anxiety is severe or distressing drug therapy may be considered in addition to supportive care.

Objectives

This review aimed to identify and evaluate randomised controlled trials examining the effectiveness of drug therapy for symptoms of anxiety in adult palliative care patients.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012), CINAHL (1982 to 2012), PsycLit (1974 to 2000) and PsycInfo (1990 to 2012) for literature pertaining to this topic published in any language using a detailed search strategy.

Selection Criteria

We sought prospective, randomised trials, with or without blinding, involving the use of drug therapy for the treatment of symptoms of anxiety in adult palliative care patients. Pharmacological agents included 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, anxiolytic agents, antiepileptic agents, antidepressive agents, antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines, butyrophenones, phenothiazines, antihistamines, barbiturates, sedative hypnotics, antiepileptic drugs and beta-blockers.

Data Collection and Analysis

We identified and excluded six studies using the original search strategy, with a further two studies being identified and excluded for this 2012 update. We therefore identified a total of eight potential studies but none met the criteria for inclusion in this review.

Main Results

No data were available to enable an assessment to be made of the effectiveness of drugs to treat symptoms of anxiety in palliative care patients.

Authors' Conclusions

There remains insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of drug therapy for symptoms of anxiety in adult palliative care patients. To date no studies have been found that meet the inclusion criteria for this review. Prospective controlled clinical trials are required in order to establish the benefits and harms of drug therapy for the treatment of anxiety in palliative care.

### Should benzodiazepines be used for reducing dyspnea in patients with advanced illnesses? [^125a6267]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2023). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea is a common and highly distressing symptom in patients with advanced illnesses. Many patients continue to experience chronic dyspnea despite optimal management of underlying disease(s) and various non-pharmacologic interventions, necessitating the consideration of pharmacologic therapies for palliation of dyspnea. One commonly asked question by clinicians is whether benzodiazepines have a role in the palliation of dyspnea. In this "Controversies in Palliative Care" article, three groups of thought leaders independently answer this question. Specifically, each group provides a synopsis of the key studies that inform their thought processes, share practical advice on their clinical approach, and highlight the opportunities for future research. All three groups suggest that benzodiazepines alone do not confer a benefit for dyspnea in advanced illnesses based on existing data. They also expressed concerns about the potential adverse effects such as delirium and drowsiness and recommended against benzodiazepines as first line pharmacologic therapy. Some groups suggest that benzodiazepines may be used in highly selected patients with severe anxiety associated with dyspnea. Some investigators may also consider the adjunctive use of benzodiazepines in patients with severe dyspnea despite opioids, particularly if life expectancy is limited. Benzodiazepines also have a role in palliative sedation for refractory dyspnea in the last days of life. More research is needed to confirm the benefit of benzodiazepines in these populations.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^5bbffb83]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

End-of-life care/hospice care — prehospital management outlines anxiolysis, agitation/delirium options, secretion control, and hydration. Anxiolytic if needed for anxiety, lorazepam 1 mg SL (pediatric 0.1 mg/kg); if not avail, consider the administration of diazepam or midazolam. If the patient has nausea [See Nausea-Vomiting Guideline]. If the patient has excessive secretions or aspiration, provide suctioning. If the patient is anxious or has delirium, in addition to nonpharmacologic interventions such as creating a quiet environment, frequent reassurance, touch and verbal orientation, consider benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam) or haloperidol 5 mg PO/IM/IV (pediatric: 0.5–1 mg) or ziprasidone 20 mg IM (pediatric 5 years old or older 0.2 mg/kg IM). If the patient appears dehydrated, encourage PO fluid intake if patient can swallow, if available offer ice chips and swabs soaked in ice water, and consider administration of normal saline at 10–20 mL/kg IV. In collaboration with hospice or end-of-life care clinician, coordinate with guardian, power of attorney, or other accepted healthcare proxy if non-transport is considered.

### Benzodiazepine or antipsychotic use and mortality risk among patients with dementia in hospice care [^30c9d5e8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

While the Medicare hospice benefit was originally designed around a cancer care model, the population it serves has changed in recent decades. Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) are now the most common hospice-qualifying diagnoses, rising from less than 1% of all hospice admissions in 1995 to 25% in 2023. However, unlike cancer, ADRD follows a prolonged and unpredictable disease trajectory, including gradual functional and cognitive decline. This makes it difficult for clinicians to determine when someone with ADRD is at the end of life and eligible for hospice enrollment. Individuals with ADRD have the longest lengths of stay of all patients with hospice-qualifying diagnoses, and 20% of those with ADRD will outlive the 6-month prognosis required for hospice eligibility and be discharged from hospice. Moreover, approximately 30% of hospice decedents enrolled for a condition other than ADRD also have a diagnosis of ADRD, meaning many individuals may not have advanced-stage ADRD at enrollment.

This uncertainty is particularly relevant to decisions about medication use at the end of life. Benzodiazepines and antipsychotics are commonly used in hospice to manage symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, and terminal delirium in people with ADRD, often in response to behaviors that are distressing not only to the patient but also to family caregivers and staff. While these medications can offer symptom relief, they carry risks, including falls, sedation, and confusion. The benefits of these medications may outweigh the risks for individuals in the final days or weeks of life. For patients earlier in the hospice trajectory — who may have months to live — the sedating effects of these drugs may compromise quality of life, impair communication, and interfere with functional independence. Furthermore, patients and families may prioritize alertness and interaction during this time. Despite these concerns, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics remain among the most commonly prescribed medications in hospice, and previous work has shown that individuals with ADRD enrolled in hospice are 3 times more likely to receive these medications than those not enrolled.

### Dyspnoea associated with anxiety – symptomatic therapy with opioids in combination with lorazepam and its effect on ventilation in palliative care patients [^a8aefb0b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Opioids are used for symptomatic therapy of dyspnoea, and benzodiazepines if dyspnoea is associated with anxiety. When given at the same time, the risk of respiratory depression will increase. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of this treatment regimen in palliative care patients.

Methods

In a prospective non-randomised study, 26 patients were included. All patients suffered from moderate to severe dyspnoea associated with anxiety. Transcutaneous measurement (tm) of carbon dioxide partial pressure (paCO₂), pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SaO₂) and pulse frequency (PF) were monitored with SenTec Digital Monitor (SenTec AG, Therwill, CH); consecutive measurement of respiratory rate (f). Baseline values at admission, and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after the first application of the opioid and anxiolytic (O + A) were compared.

Results

Hypoxic and non-hypoxic patients showed no significant paCO₂ increase or SaO₂ decrease after opioid application in combination with lorazepam. At admission, mean SaO₂ was 95.0 ± 4.6% (85.0–100) and mean paCO₂ was 38.1 ± 6.0 mmHg (26.0–48.0) vs. SaO₂ 95.2 ± 3.5% (87.0–100.0), paCO₂ 37.7 ± 5.5 (24.0–47.0) 120 min after the first O + A application. Also, f decreased significantly high from 40.6 ± 4.8/min (32.0–50.0/min) to 32.0 ± 4.0/min (20.0–32.0/min; p < 0.001) after 120 min. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in the intensity of dyspnoea at rest and on exertion (6.2 ± 2.0 (4–10)/7.4 ± 2.3 (4–10) vs. 1.2 ± 0.8 (0–3)/2.5 ± 1.2 (1–5) after 120 min (p < 0.0001)).

Conclusions

Our results showed that the use of O + A was a safe and effective treatment option in this patient group. Signs of respiratory depression were not found.

### Benzodiazepines for cancer dyspnoea: a nationwide survey of palliative care physicians [^cdd2f803]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2020). High credibility.

Objectives

It is unclear whether patients with non-specific dyspnoea are suitable candidates for studies investigating the effectiveness of benzodiazepines against dyspnoea. The objective of this survey was to investigate suitable subjects for studies of benzodiazepines for cancer dyspnoea.

Methods

A nationwide questionnaire survey was conducted among 536 Japanese-certified palliative care physicians. We randomly selected 268 physicians and inquired about their approach to dyspnoea management in patients with cancer, with and without anxiety, as follows: (1) Administration of a benzodiazepine. (2) Administration or titration of an opioid. We also asked them to consider their approach in the following situations: (1) Opioid-naïve. (2) Low-to-moderate baseline opioid dose. (3) High baseline opioid dose. We assessed the use of specific benzodiazepines separately.

Results

Overall, 192 physicians responded to the questionnaire (71.6%). For patients without anxiety, the proportion of participants reporting that they frequently or very frequently 'administer a benzodiazepine' increased with baseline opioid dose (opioid-naïve: 5.2%, low-to-moderate: 11.5%, high: 26.0%). The proportion of participants reporting that they frequently or very frequently 'administer or titrate an opioid' decreased with baseline opioid dose (opioid-naïve: 83.3%, low-to-moderate: 73.4%, high: 41.1%). The pattern was similar for patients with anxiety, although more respondents said they prescribe benzodiazepine for these patients (naïve: 22.4%, low-to-moderate: 34.4%, high: 45.8%) and fewer prescribed an opioid. Alprazolam and lorazepam are frequently used.

Conclusion

Patients with anxiety or receiving a high baseline opioid dose could be potential candidates for future studies investigating the effectiveness of benzodiazepines against cancer dyspnoea.

### Drug therapy for symptoms associated with anxiety in adult palliative care patients [^8a5bea98]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004 (Issue 1) and previously updated in 2012 (Issue 10). Anxiety is common in palliative care patients. It can be a natural response to the complex uncertainty of having a life-limiting illness or impending death, but it may represent a clinically significant issue in its own right.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of drug therapy for treating symptoms of anxiety in adults with a progressive life-limiting illness who are thought to be in their last year of life.

Search Methods

We ran the searches for this update to May 2016. We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsychLIT (Silver Platter) and PsycINFO (Ovid). We searched seven trials registers and seven pharmaceutical industry trials registers. We handsearched the conference abstracts of the European Association of Palliative Care.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials which examined the effect of drug therapy for the treatment of symptoms of anxiety in adult palliative care patients, that is, people with a known progressive life-limiting illness that is no longer responsive to curative treatment, including advanced heart, respiratory and neurological diseases (including dementia). Comparator treatments included placebo; another drug therapy or different dose schedule; or a non-drug intervention such as counselling, cognitive behaviour therapies or relaxation therapies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant papers for inclusion in the review. We sought full-text reports for all papers retained at this stage and two reviews authors independently assessed these for inclusion in the review. We planned to assess risk of bias and extract data including information on adverse events. We planned to assess the evidence using GRADE and to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

In this update, we identified 707 potentially relevant papers and of these we sought the full-text reports of 10 papers. On examination of these full-text reports, we excluded eight and two are awaiting classification as we have insufficient information to make a decision. Thus, in this update, we found no studies which met our inclusion criteria. For the original review, we identified, and then excluded, the full-text reports of six potentially relevant studies. For the 2012 update, we sought, and excluded, two full-text reports. Thus, we found no studies that assessed the effectiveness of drugs to treat symptoms of anxiety in palliative care patients.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of evidence to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of drug therapy for symptoms of anxiety in adult palliative care patients. To date, we have found no studies that meet the inclusion criteria for this review. We are awaiting further information for two studies which may be included in a future update. Randomised controlled trials which assess management of anxiety as a primary endpoint are required to establish the benefits and harms of drug therapy for the treatment of anxiety in palliative care.

### Symptom management in people dying with COVID-19: multinational observational study [^d1beeef4]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Palliative care services that prescribed oxygen were less likely to have hospital palliative care teams (χ² = 9.16, p = 0.002).

Fifty seven services indicated how quickly medicines worked, with 43 (75.4%) responding that they worked within 30 min and 13 (22.8%) over 31 min (table 1).

All respondents on the perceived effectiveness of these medicines considered them to be either effective or as having some effect. Perceived effectiveness depended on the patient's condition and route of drug administration (online supplemental appendix 2d).

In context of COVID-19 we found opioids to be very effective in relieving distressing dyspnoea, particularly when given SC if severe symptoms. In some instances with severe symptoms multiple SC doses were needed to gain symptom control. MR Morphine (MST, Zomorph) preparations were helpful for patients to better tolerate CPAP/Venturi masks etc. Addition of benzodiazepines was helpful where anxiety component. In most instances good relief within 30mins — 1hr if given Midazolam SC or Lorazepam SL (hospital palliative care team, UK).

Although medicines tended to be effective, this was challenging to predict with an acknowledgement that patients sometimes required high doses.

Benzos and opioids tend to work in 10–20 minutes. Most people need small doses, but some need bigger doses (inpatient palliative care unit/hospital palliative care team/home palliative care team, UK).

Further, services reported reluctance to prescribe opioids.

… Not quite effective in some cases, it's difficult due to some senior physicians afraid of opioids. (hospital palliative care team/home palliative care team, rest of the world).

### Behavioral symptoms and treatment challenges for patients living with dementia: hospice clinician and caregiver perspectives [^14b64617]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dementia affects one in three older adults over age 85 and nearly 60% will utilize hospice services at end of life. Even though the Medicare hospice care benefit was originally developed to meet the care needs of terminally ill cancer patients, dementia is currently the leading principal diagnosis among patients enrolling in Medicare hospice services, and individuals with dementia constitute the fastest growing population of patients entering hospice care in the United States. While cognitive impairment is the hallmark of dementia, behavioral and psychological symptoms such as agitation (i.e. physical and verbal aggression, irritability, and anger), psychosis, sleep disturbance, anxiety, or apathy are reported in nearly all patients with advanced dementia, contributing to the complexity of end‐of‐life medical and nursing care, as well as caregiver burden. Such behavioral symptoms are routinely treated off‐label with use of psychotropic medications including benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, which can pose side effects for patients living with dementia, including falls, sedation, and worsening confusion.

Despite the growth in Medicare beneficiaries receiving hospice care for dementia, little is known about how hospice clinicians and caregivers balance the risks and benefits of medication treatment options when attempting to manage behavioral symptoms at end of life. In this qualitative analysis, we examined family caregiver and hospice clinician perspectives regarding the most challenging behavioral symptoms of dementia observed in hospice settings. Because these behavioral symptoms are routinely treated with off‐label use of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, we also inquired regarding the perceived effectiveness of medications for behavioral symptom management and attitudes toward treatment side effects.

### Part I. benzodiazepines-side effects, abuse risk and… [^2eb2acf1]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

There is little doubt of the therapeutic efficacy of benzodiazepines in reducing anxiety, inducing sleep and quelling panic symptoms. As noted in a 1990 report by the American Psychiatric Association on benzodiazepine dependence, toxicity and abuse, 1 the anxiolytic and hypnotic efficacy of benzodiazepines has been well established by numerous placebo-controlled studies. Benzodiazepine Alternatives The problems with benzodiazepine dependence, tolerance, withdrawal, rebound and abuse limit their use for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders in patients with alcohol or drug addiction. A growing body of literature now supports the anxiolytic efficacy of numerous other agents. Antidepressants, anticonvulsants, buspirone, certain antihypertensive agents and newer neuroleptics all have been shown to be effective in subsets of patients with anxiety.
32.

Most addiction medicine specialists believe that benzodiazepines are relatively contraindicated in patients with current alcohol or drug abuse problems and in patients who are in recovery. To choose an appropriate alternative to a benzodiazepine, physicians should be able to delineate which subtype of anxiety disorder exists in a particular patient. Patients should be encouraged to understand that the onset of action of antidepressants, buspirone and anticonvulsants is not as immediate as that of benzodiazepines. Therapy may require patience and, because of side effects, a low dosage may be required initially. Nonbenzodiazepine pharmacotherapies for the management of insomnia include the sedating antidepressant trazodone, tertiary tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and doxepin, and newer antidepressant agents such as nefazodone and mirtazapine.

Final Comment Although benzodiazepines are effective in a wide range of medical and psychiatric conditions, caution must be exercised with their use, particularly when these agents are prescribed to patients with an active or remote history of substance abuse or addiction. Their greatest asset is also their greatest liability: drugs that work immediately tend to be addictive. Compared with benzodiazepines, antidepressants have a longer onset of action but are the best agents for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders. Anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, antihypertensives and buspirone also are effective but have an intermediate onset of action.

### Repurposing medications for hospice / palliative care symptom control is No longer sufficient: a manifesto for change [^660bc79c]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2017). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization essential medications list for hospice/palliative care reflects that, with the judicious use of currently available medications, the majority of symptoms can be lessened, and some controlled completely. Even with optimal use of current medications, symptom control is still unacceptable for many people. Currently available medications offer great benefit to a minority of patients, some benefit to an additional group, and no benefit or harms to others. In symptom control, development of new drugs is advancing at a glacial pace, contrasting to the rapid advances seen in many other disciplines. Specialists in palliative care should agree on several principles consequently: 1) Access to symptom-control drugs codified in the World Health Organization Essential Medicines list deserves the strongest support from national policies and professional guidelines, especially in resource-challenged countries. 2) The optimal use of currently available symptom-control drugs cannot yield acceptably high rates of net benefits. 3) There is a compelling need to identify patient subgroups that are likely to benefit from available medications and provide rigorous empirical support for indications, dosing, and route of administration for clinical practice. 4) New therapies are needed requiring an accelerated effort to investigate further the pathophysiology, neurobiology, and pharmacogenetics of distressing symptoms, and factors contributing to variations in drug response. This development requires a lengthy lead time. 5) Smarter ways to promote new knowledge into practice are needed as no drug will be suitable for all patients. We need to improve clinical characterization and biomarker technology to bring the best drugs to the right patients every time.

### Lorazepam stimulates IL6 production and is associated with poor survival outcomes in pancreatic cancer [^e2a51868]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The role of palliative care medicine in influencing the TME and cancer patient outcomes is also vitally important. Cancer is a devastating diagnosis, associated with emotional distress, anxiety, and depression. Harsh surgical, radiologic, and chemotherapeutic interventions can induce numerous side effects, including nausea, anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia. To combat these cancer-associated effects, patients are frequently prescribed an array of palliative care drugs such as aspirin, cannabinoids, antihistamines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, opioids, and benzodiazepines (BZD). There is a growing appreciation that many commonly prescribed drugs can either positively or negatively impact cancer risk, tumor progression, and chemotherapeutic efficacy. Many of these interactions are being tested experimentally, providing insight into clinical observations, and opening new avenues to improve patient outcomes. This is a highly significant problem due to the vast majority of patients who are taking these medications, and our general lack of knowledge regarding their impact on the cancer phenotype.

In this study, we report the novel discovery that lorazepam (LOR, Ativan) and alprazolam (ALP, Xanax), BZDs frequently prescribed to cancer patients to treat anxiety, affect patient survival outcomes across the cancer spectrum. We use a combination of in vivo and in vitro models to mechanistically determine the effects of LOR and ALP on the PDAC TME. Specifically, we find that LOR promotes IL6 secretion from CAFs and drives ischemic necrosis and desmoplasia in mouse models of PDAC. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that the commonly prescribed BZD lorazepam modifies the TME and has potential clinical implications when prescribing BZDs to cancer patients.

### Benzodiazepine or antipsychotic use and mortality risk among patients with dementia in hospice care [^4c675973]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this case-control study, initiation of benzodiazepine and antipsychotic use among nursing home residents with ADRD was associated with increased 180-day mortality. These medications are often used in hospice to manage agitation, anxiety, or physical symptoms such as nausea, but their known adverse effects — sedation, falls, aspiration, worsening cognition — combined with our finding of increased mortality risk reinforces concerns about their use in this population. This is particularly important in hospice given that decedents with ADRD in hospice are 3 times more likely to receive these medications compared with those not in hospice. Together, these data underscore the need for dementia-specific hospice prescribing guidelines, investment in nonpharmacologic alternatives, and Medicare policy reform to track and inform safe medication use in hospice.

### Palliative pharmacological sedation for terminally ill adults [^15fca90e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Terminally ill people experience a variety of symptoms in the last hours and days of life, including delirium, agitation, anxiety, terminal restlessness, dyspnoea, pain, vomiting, and psychological and physical distress. In the terminal phase of life, these symptoms may become refractory, and unable to be controlled by supportive and palliative therapies specifically targeted to these symptoms. Palliative sedation therapy is one potential solution to providing relief from these refractory symptoms. Sedation in terminally ill people is intended to provide relief from refractory symptoms that are not controlled by other methods. Sedative drugs such as benzodiazepines are titrated to achieve the desired level of sedation; the level of sedation can be easily maintained and the effect is reversible.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the benefit of palliative pharmacological sedation on quality of life, survival, and specific refractory symptoms in terminally ill adults during their last few days of life.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2014), and EMBASE (1974 to December 2014), using search terms representing the sedative drug names and classes, disease stage, and study designs.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, non-RCTs, and observational studies (e.g. before-and-after, interrupted-time-series) with quantitative outcomes. We excluded studies with only qualitative outcomes or that had no comparison (i.e. no control group or no within-group comparison) (e.g. single arm case series).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of citations, and full text of potentially eligible studies. Two review authors independently carried out data extraction using standard data extraction forms. A third review author acted as arbiter for both stages. We carried out no meta-analyses due to insufficient data for pooling on any outcome; therefore, we reported outcomes narratively.

Main Results

The searches resulted in 14 included studies, involving 4167 adults, of whom 1137 received palliative sedation. More than 95% of people had cancer. No studies were randomised or quasi-randomised. All were consecutive case series, with only three having prospective data collection. Risk of bias was high, due to lack of randomisation. No studies measured quality of life or participant well-being, which was the primary outcome of the review. Five studies measured symptom control, using four different methods, so pooling was not possible. The results demonstrated that despite sedation, delirium and dyspnoea were still troublesome symptoms in these people in the last few days of life. Control of other symptoms appeared to be similar in sedated and non-sedated people. Only one study measured unintended adverse effects of sedative drugs and found no major events; however, four of 70 participants appeared to have drug-induced delirium. The study noticed no respiratory suppression. Thirteen of the 14 studies measured survival time from admission or referral to death, and all demonstrated no statistically significant difference between sedated and non-sedated groups.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence about the efficacy of palliative sedation in terms of a person's quality of life or symptom control. There was evidence that palliative sedation did not hasten death, which has been a concern of physicians and families in prescribing this treatment. However, this evidence comes from low quality studies, so should be interpreted with caution. Further studies that specifically measure the efficacy and quality of life in sedated people, compared with non-sedated people, and quantify adverse effects are required.

### End-of-life care in patients with cancer 16–24 years of age [^c441fb59]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Opiates are considered the first-line medication for end-of-life dyspnea. Psychostimulants (modafinil and methylphenidate) are sometimes used and may be beneficial for end-of-life fatigue. Steroids are another viable option; however, neither class of medication has been extensively studied for this indication. Blood transfusions can also be used to increase energy levels in those with low platelets.

Psychostimulants may also be used at the end of life in order to elevate mood, counter opioid-induced sedation, increase appetite, improve cognition, and potentiate the analgesic effect of opioids.

Psychotropic medications FDA approved for mood and anxiety symptoms (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs) may be used in this setting, recognizing that some of them require weeks before reaching full efficacy. Thus, faster acting agents (such as stimulants) might be required at the end of life. Ketamine can be used for depressive symptoms as well. Not yet commercially available, psilocybin appears to have a positive impact on mood, anxiety and cancer-related psychiatric distress.

Benzodiazepines can be effectively used in patients with seizures, catatonia, air hunger, or severe treatment-resistant nausea, assuming there is no adverse reaction. Despite little data supporting the use of benzodiazepines as an anxiety treatment, they are often prescribed for this indication as well. Some individuals dislike the effects and find it difficult to use coping skills while under their influence, others report paradoxical, agitated reactions. Additional concerns include increased risk for dependence, decreased slow wave (most restorative) sleep, anterograde amnesia, delirium, and worsening of PTSD, such as medical trauma. Given these risks and lack of supporting data for their use for anxiety, benzodiazepines are not recommended for this indication unless other approaches have failed, patient prefers this medication, and/or patient is expected to survive only a few weeks or less.

### Benzodiazepine or antipsychotic use and mortality risk among patients with dementia in hospice care [^61f1dc88]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this national case-control study of nursing home residents with ADRD enrolled in hospice, initiation of benzodiazepine or antipsychotic use during hospice care was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality within 180 days. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to specifically examine the survival outcomes associated with the initiation of use of these medications in hospice care for individuals with ADRD, a population for whom evidence-based prescribing guidance remains limited. The increased mortality risk associated with initiation of benzodiazepine use was substantial (41%), while that associated with initiation of antipsychotic use was more modest (16%), with findings consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses adjusting for treatment propensity and number of prescription fills. While hospice care often prioritizes comfort over longevity, these findings suggest that medication use — particularly earlier in the hospice course — may in some cases, contribute to shortened survival.

Benzodiazepines and antipsychotics are commonly used in hospice to manage agitation, anxiety, and delirium. However, both classes are associated with significant risks in older adults with ADRD. Antipsychotics carry a US Food and Drug Administration boxed warning for increased mortality in patients with ADRD, and benzodiazepines have been linked to respiratory suppression, sedation, falls, and aspiration. Our findings reinforce the need for careful, individualized risk-benefit evaluation prior to initiating use of these agents, particularly in patients in whom death is not imminent. While this study was not designed to estimate national prevalence, it is worth noting that nearly half of the cohort initiated use of a benzodiazepine (47.8%), and 13.4% initiated use of an antipsychotic during hospice. Initiation of antipsychotic use was lower than previously reported in other hospice settings (eg, home hospice), likely reflecting nursing home policies that monitor and penalize antipsychotic prescribing, even among hospice-enrolled residents, consistent with previous work.

### State variation in antipsychotic and benzodiazepine prescribing among hospice beneficiaries in the United States [^457c9e60]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are common components of the hospice toolkit prescribed for both physical and behavioral symptom management. Despite their routine use in hospice, there are currently limited guidelines or consensus on best prescribing practices. Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are often utilized to treat distressing symptoms at end of life, however, these medication classes are not without risk when prescribed to older adults including side effects such as sedation, falls, and increased mortality. Hospice represents an increasingly heterogenous population, including many with non‐cancer diagnoses, some of whom will outlive and be discharged from the hospice benefit. For those patients who are not imminently dying, patients and their care partners may prefer avoiding such medications in order to maintain function and minimize sedation.

Given a clear lack of clear evidence to inform antipsychotic and benzodiazepine prescribing best practice for patients enrolled in hospice, there may be variation or inconsistent utilization of these medications. The goal of this study is to describe the variation in the prevalence of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine prescribing among beneficiaries enrolled in hospice across states. Understanding variation in practice patterns may help to inform appropriate prescribing in hospice and to clarify the current standard of care.

### Enhancing communication related to symptom management through plain language [^d22fd921]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Symptom management is a key dimension of palliative care. In addition to aspects such as assessment and pharmacological management of symptoms, professionals also require communication skills to effectively manage symptoms in serious illness.

Objectives

Application of the Plain Language Planner for Palliative Care(©), a provider tool for communicating about medication and symptoms using plain language, was tested.

Methods

Approximately 75% of the 155 health care professionals, mostly nurses, who participated in a before-and-after educational activity about the tool, provided written communication explanations using one of three medication-symptom pairs: senna for constipation, amitriptyline for nerve pain, and lorazepam for anxiety. Responses were coded for plain language characteristics: active voice, second person, use of jargon, brief sentences, reading level, and easy to understand data phrasing. Frequency counts for coding categories were calculated and compared across medication-symptom pairs before and after the education session.

Results

A comparison between written responses before and after the education session showed improvement in the use of plain language. Overall, plain language scores were highest for communication about senna (81%), followed by amitriptyline (72%) and lorazepam (77%). Across all three medication-symptom pairs, the greatest improvement in the use of plain language occurred in the use of jargon.

Conclusion

Provider training with the tool produced increased plain language. Use of the tool in provider education shows promise in increasing the health literacy for patients and families regarding symptom management.

### Lorazepam (Ativan) [^026bc0eb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ativan (lorazepam) is administered orally. For optimal results, dose, frequency of administration, and duration of therapy should be individualized according to patient response. To facilitate this, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets are available.

The usual range is 2 to 6 mg/day given in divided doses, the largest dose being taken before bedtime, but the daily dosage may vary from 1 to 10 mg/day.

For anxiety, most patients require an initial dose of 2 to 3 mg/day given two times a day or three times a day.

For insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime.

For elderly or debilitated patients, an initial dosage of 1 to 2 mg/day in divided doses is recommended, to be adjusted as needed and tolerated.

The dosage of Ativan (lorazepam) should be increased gradually when needed to help avoid adverse effects. When higher dosage is indicated, the evening dose should be increased before the daytime doses.

Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Ativan

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Ativan or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

### Lorazepam [^7e3e4122]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Lorazepam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Lorazepam concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of Lorazepam than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking Lorazepam, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Lorazepam is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined (see PRECAUTIONS, Clinically Significant Drug Interactions).

Pre-existing depression may emerge or worsen during use of benzodiazepines including lorazepam. Lorazepam is not recommended for use in patients with a primary depressive disorder or psychosis.

### Acute adverse effects of therapeutic doses of psilocybin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^78d42cee]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Anxiety

Three studies identified anxiety as an adverse effect. According to 1 study, anxiety was reported in 4% of participants administered high-dose psilocybin, 8% with a moderate dose, and none with a low dose. However, another study stated 26% of participants with high-dose psilocybin and 15% with low-dose psilocybin experienced an anxiety episode. All 3 studies identifying anxiety stated that, similar to nausea, anxiety resolved between 24 and 48 hours. While the severity of anxiety was not thoroughly discussed in any of the studies, the studies mentioned that anxiety was not serious. In the data set reviewed, 1 case was identified in which a patient received a pharmacologic intervention (ie, lorazepam, 2 mg) after taking high-dose psilocybin and experiencing acute anxiety. In general, the study protocols discussed using medications to treat anxiety not resolving after nonpharmacologic interventions (eg, guidance from therapist). For example, Goodwin et alnoted benzodiazepine anxiolytics, such as lorazepam or alprazolam, given orally may be preferred due to rapid onset, short duration of action, and the possibility that another route (eg, intravenous injection) may exacerbate anxiety. Two additional studies listed oral diazepam, 5 to 10 mg, and oral olanzapine, 5 to 10 mg, as rescue medications for severe adverse psychological distress or severe anxiety in the protocols. Another study mentioned diazepam and risperidone as rescue medications for anxiety or psychosis, with no dosing range. Carhart-Harris et allisted lorazepam (oral or injectable) as a rescue medication for treating events of severe panic that would place people at risk after not responding to psychological intervention. Perhaps having the therapist present may assist in decreasing or managing anxiety through simple arm-holding for patients experiencing anxiety; however, given the increase in anxiety, there may be a need to provide such pharmacologic transparency on protocols designed to manage anxiety not controlled by the therapist.

### Drug therapy for delirium in terminally ill adult patients [^19e5e17f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a syndrome characterised by a disturbance of consciousness (often fluctuating), cognition and perception. In terminally ill patients it is one of the most common causes of admission to clinical care. Delirium may arise from any number of causes and treatment should be directed at addressing these causes rather than the symptom cluster. In cases where this is not possible, or treatment does not prove successful, the use of drug therapy to manage the symptoms may become necessary. This is an update of the review published on 'Drug therapy for delirium in terminally ill adult patients' in The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 2 (Jackson 2004).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of drug therapies to treat delirium in adult patients in the terminal phase of a disease.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012), CINAHL (1982 to 2012) and PSYCINFO (1990 to 2012).

Selection Criteria

Prospective trials with or without randomisation or blinding involving the use of drug therapies for the treatment of delirium in adult patients in the terminal phase of a disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality using standardised methods and extracted trial data. We collected outcomes related to efficacy and adverse effects.

Main Results

One trial met the criteria for inclusion. In the 2012 update search we retrieved 3066 citations but identified no new trials. The included trial evaluated 30 hospitalised AIDS patients receiving one of three agents: chlorpromazine, haloperidol and lorazepam. The trial under-reported key methodological features. It found overall that patients in the chlorpromazine group and those in the haloperidol group had fewer symptoms of delirium at follow-up (to below the diagnostic threshold using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) and that both were equally effective (at two days mean difference (MD) 0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.58 to 5.32; between two and six days MD -0.21; 95% CI -5.35 to 4.93). Chlorpromazine and haloperidol were found to be no different in improving cognitive status in the short term (at 48 hours) but at subsequent follow-up cognitive status was reduced in those taking chlorpromazine. Improvements from baseline to day two for patients randomised to lorazepam were not apparent. All patients on lorazepam (n = 6) developed adverse effects, including oversedation and increased confusion, leading to trial drug discontinuation.

Authors' Conclusions

There remains insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the role of drug therapy in the treatment of delirium in terminally ill patients. Thus, practitioners should continue to follow current clinical guidelines. Further research is essential.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^8e3d0368]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP opioid prescribing guidelines — patients with mental health conditions and concurrent benzodiazepine use: Patients with mental health conditions may require therapy of comorbidities with anti-anxiety medications as well as antidepressants, but patients taking benzodiazepines for anxiety should be warned of the elevated risks for respiratory depression with concomitant opioid use, and physicians should be judicious with opioid initiation and monitoring in these patients. Due to established risks with the combination of opioids and benzodiazepines and psychiatric instability including suicide risk, clinicians should cautiously provide chronic opioid therapy with or without benzodiazepines and antidepressant therapy in this group, and clinicians should consider behavioral health consultations, specifically in those with uncontrolled psychological disorders and suicide risk. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be useful in patients on long term opioid therapy to reduce opioid exposure and associated risks to patients, families, and communities while offering patients an alternative for managing pain.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^c03281aa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendations for Considerations for Tapering Benzodiazepines

Clinicians should ideally assess the risks and benefits of ongoing BZD prescribing at least every 3 months for each patient taking BZD medications (see Tables 2 and 3; Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a At a minimum, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits with each new BZD prescription or BZD prescription renewal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). b Clinicians should review the information in the relevant prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) as part of the risk–benefit assessment (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Table 2
Potential Benefits and Risks of Continued BZD Use and BZD Tapering

A list of some of the potential benefits and risks to BZD use and tapering when considering whether to taper the medication. Clinicians should consider the likelihood of each benefit and risk for the individual patient. The narrative notes risk/hazard ratios available in the published literature

*Including compassionate use for end of life or palliative care

† Including risks associated with counterfeit BZDs from the illicit drug market, such as contamination with HPSOs (e.g. fentanyl) and novel synthetic substances

Risk of Clinically Significant BZD Withdrawal

This table summarizes estimates of risk of experiencing clinically significant withdrawal depending on the dose, duration, and frequency of BZD use. This table is based on clinical consensus of the CGC. It is intended to provide general guidance and should not replace clinical judgment

*Many factors influence the risk of physical dependence and BZD withdrawal syndrome, including but not limited to age, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, other substance use, and prior history of withdrawal

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^34a2480e]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Dementia — agitation and psychosis management emphasizes first addressing reversible causes [I], using environmental measures if symptoms are not causing significant danger or distress [I], and considering behavioral measures [III]; if these are unsuccessful or behaviors are dangerous or distressing, judicious pharmacologic treatment may be used [II] with ongoing reevaluation and documentation [I]. Antipsychotic medications are recommended for psychosis [II] and agitation [II], can provide modest improvement in behavioral symptoms [I], and have evidence based mostly on 6–12-week trials with limited research beyond 12 weeks though clinical experience supports use [II]. Antipsychotics must be used with caution at the lowest effective dosage [I], with patients and families advised about potential benefits and risks, particularly mortality [I]; second-generation agents have a black box warning for increased mortality in elderly patients and first-generation agents carry at least a similar risk, with selection based on side-effect profile and patient characteristics [I]. Benzodiazepine benefit is modest but they may have a role for prominent anxiety [III] or on an as-needed basis for infrequent agitation or procedural sedation [II], with lorazepam and oxazepam preferable to longer half-life agents such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide [III]. Anticonvulsants, lithium, and beta-blockers have minimal evidence and are generally not recommended except after other treatments have failed [III]; trazodone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not well studied for non-depressive symptoms but may be appropriate for nonpsychotic patients with agitation, especially with mild agitation or prior antipsychotic sensitivity [III].

### International committee on mental health in cystic fibrosis: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and European Cystic Fibrosis Society consensus statements for screening and treating depression and anxiety [^b033b7eb]. Thorax (2016). Medium credibility.

Anxiety in relation to medical procedures — management of moderate-to-severe episodic anxiety that has not responded to behavioural approaches may include the benzodiazepine lorazepam, which may be considered for short-term use, with benzodiazepines preferable to SSRIs primarily when rapid onset of action is needed or when serotonergic agents are contraindicated. Use of benzodiazepines requires additional caution and monitoring for those with a history of substance abuse, depression or an elevated risk for respiratory depression. Lorazepam is available in both oral and intravenous forms, its duration of action is short enough to avoid a prolonged period of sedation following a procedure, and it is renally excreted with no hepatic metabolism, which reduces medication interactions and may be useful in the context of CF liver disease; however, dose reduction may be necessary in patients who develop renal insufficiency.

### Benzodiazepines for treatment of patients with delirium excluding those who are cared for in an intensive care unit [^066335da]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a very common condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Current critical care guidelines recommend first and foremost the use of nonpharmacological strategies in both the prevention and treatment of delirium. Pharmacological interventions may augment these approaches and they are currently used widely in clinical practice to manage the symptoms of delirium. Benzodiazepines are currently used in clinical practice to treat behavioural disturbances associated with delirium but current guidelines do not recommend their use for this indication. The use of these medicines is controversial because there is uncertainty about whether they are effective for patients or have the potential to harm them.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium (excluding delirium related to withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines) in any healthcare settings other than intensive care units (ICU).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register up to 10 April 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries (including national, international and pharmaceutical registries), and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in healthcare settings that ranged from nursing homes and long-term care facilities to any hospital setting except for ICUs, involving adult patients with delirium excluding those with delirium related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Included RCTs had to assess the effect of benzodiazepines, at any dose and given by any route, compared with placebo or another drug intended to treat delirium.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We decided whether or not to pool data on the basis of clinical heterogeneity between studies. We used GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We identified only two trials that satisfied the selection criteria. We did not pool the data because of the substantial clinical differences between the trials. In one trial, participants (n = 58) were patients in an acute palliative care unit with advanced cancer who had a mean age of 64 years. All of the participants had delirium, were treated with haloperidol, and were randomised to receive either lorazepam or placebo in combination with it. Due to very serious imprecision, all evidence was of low certainty. We were unable to determine whether there were clinically important differences in the severity of delirium (mean difference (MD) 2.10, 95% CI -0.96 to 5.16; n = 50), length of hospital admission (MD 0.00, 95% CI -3.45 to 3.45; n = 58), mortality from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.02; participants = 58) or any of a number of adverse events. Important effects could not be confirmed or excluded. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode. In the other trial, participants (n = 30) were patients in general medical wards with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who had a mean age of 39.2 years. Investigators compared three drug treatments: all participants had delirium, and were randomised to receive lorazepam, chlorpromazine, or haloperidol. Very low-certainty evidence was identified, and we could not determine whether lorazepam differed from either of the other treatments in the effect on severity of delirium, any adverse event, or mortality from all causes. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode or the length of hospital admission.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no enough evidence to determine whether benzodiazepines are effective when used to treat patients with delirium who are cared for in non-ICU settings. The available evidence does not support their routine use for this indication. Because of the scarcity of data from randomised controlled trials, further research is required to determine whether or not there is a role for benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium in non-ICU settings.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^6851fba6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Appendix N — medications for managing intoxication: Benzodiazepines (BZDs) (first line) are GABAergic and indicated for excitatory symptoms, anxiety/agitation, neuromuscular excitation, and seizures. Initial dosing includes lorazepam 1–2 mg IV based on clinical signs and symptoms and duration of effects; diazepam 5–10 mg PO for less severe symptoms based on patient parameters; and midazolam 5 mg IM or 0.01–0.05 mg/kg IV for acute agitation in adult patients, and redosing frequency and dose should be guided by the degree and duration of the clinical effects of the initial dose. Other considerations note parenteral vs. PO administration based on signs and symptom severity and drug availability (eg, parenteral BZD shortages), and IM administration allows for administration in agitated patients without IV access; lorazepam has very slow IM onset (15–30 min); midazolam has very rapid IV onset, allowing for easy titration, and a relatively fast IM onset; if psychosis is primary symptom, antipsychotics should be considered primarily or adjunctively.

### Lorazepam (Loreev xr) [^93bd895c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe LOREEV XR concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of LOREEV XR than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking LOREEV XR, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when LOREEV XR is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Breathlessness

The three most common prescribed medicines for breathlessness were opioids (n = 273 of 282 (96.8%) services), benzodiazepines (n = 205 of 282 (72.7%) services) and oxygen (n = 76 of 282 (27%) services) (table 1, online supplemental appendix 2a).

Table 1
Characteristics of palliative care and hospice services that managed patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 by region

The level of opioid prescribing by services in different world regions and palliative care settings were similar (figure 1A and B, online supplemental appendix 2a, 2b). Morphine was the most prescribed opioid, representing 172 (54.1%) of the 318 prescribed opioids. Others included oxycodone (n = 26 (8.2%)), fentanyl (n = 9 (2.8%)), hydromorphone (n = 4 (1.3%)), diamorphine (n = 3 (0.9%)), alfentanil (n = 3 (0.9%)), buprenorphine (n = 3 (0.9%)) and sufentanil (n = 1 (0.3%)) (online supplemental appendix 2c). Some services reported prescribing opioids but did not state the type of opioid (n = 97 (30.5%)).

Figure 1
Percentage of prescribing by services in different settings and world regions.

Prescribing of benzodiazepines for breathlessness was significantly higher in the UK (83%) than the rest of Europe (48%) and the world (44%) (figure 1A, online supplemental appendix 2a) (χ² = 38.42, p < 0.001). Among benzodiazepines, midazolam (n = 126 (48.6%) of 259) was the most prescribed. Others included lorazepam (n = 58 (22.4%)), diazepam (n = 3 (1.2%)), oxazepam (n = 2 (0.8%)), clonazepam (n = 1 (0.4%)). The type of benzodiazepines prescribed was not stated in 69 (26.6%) cases (online supplemental appendix 2c).

### A focused update to the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^9944a8be]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Research agenda for PADIS and patient-important outcomes — priorities include anxiety studies with further development and testing of instruments to detect and quantify anxiety in critically ill adults; RCTs testing the safety and effectiveness of benzodiazepines and other medications for anxiety in critically ill adults; and RCTs examining nonpharmacologic and/or multimodal approaches. Sedation priorities include the role of dexmedetomidine in alcohol withdrawal; the role of sedative medications in an analgesia-first approach or to supplement analgesia-sedation; studies evaluating the value of patient communication with family members during ICU care and patient perceptions while on propofol vs. dexmedetomidine; the role of dexmedetomidine in patients requiring deep sedation; and RCTs addressing possible heterogeneity of dexmedetomidine treatment effect by age (over or under 65 yr old). Delirium priorities include RCTs examining the use of an antipsychotic in hypoactive delirium, hyperactive delirium, and other subtypes; RCTs examining long-term cognitive effects of antipsychotics in ICU patients with delirium; and RCTs examining the use of antipsychotics in progressive delirium severities.

### Pharmacologic interventions for breathlessness in patients with advanced cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9db59e2e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that opioids were not associated with more effectiveness than placebo and not more effective than other pharmacologic interventions for improving breathlessness for patients with advanced cancer. Anxiolytics were not associated with more effectiveness than placebo for these outcomes, with low SOE. Furthermore, there was limited or insufficient evidence that pharmacologic therapies impacted other outcomes, including anxiety, HRQOL, or exercise capacity.

Existing guidelines emphasize the use of opioids and benzodiazepines for management of breathlessness in patients with advanced cancer. The findings of the current study differ somewhat from previously published reviews, and several factors may contribute to these differences. The results of this review must be interpreted within the context of the included RCTs. First, this study includes 19 studies, 10 of which have been published since the Cochrane review and were not included in previous guidelines. Many of those more recent studies, are randomized and placebo controlled and evaluate opiates for breathlessness, with most studies demonstrating improvement in the placebo groups. This active placebo effect may have contributed to the lack of benefit over placebo that was found in the current study.

Second, at least half of the studies evaluated in the Cochrane review were in populations other than cancer, whereas this review includes studies in which most patients had advanced cancer. This difference is important because breathlessness in patients with advanced cancer may have unique features and considerations. The patterns and physiologic mechanisms of breathlessness in patients with advanced cancer may be different from those without cancer and can be associated with the cancer itself or with treatments or adverse effects of treatments. Breathlessness in patients with cancer may also be associated with concurrent symptoms, such as anxiety, fatigue, or pain. Thus, it is important to focus on this patient population.

Third, the included studies differed widely in the patient populations (medical comorbidities, concurrent opioid or other supportive medications, concurrent interventions to relieve, or prognosis), outcomes evaluated, and measurement instruments used. For example, management of breathlessness in patients with a long-term prognosis compared with those at the end stages of advanced cancer may have different contributing factors and interventions for those factors. The heterogeneity limited the ability to synthesize results.

### Benzodiazepine or antipsychotic use and mortality risk among patients with dementia in hospice care [^6dbe3cb7]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Our results suggest more standardized hospice prescribing guidance in ADRD may be useful. Hospice prescribing varies significantly across hospice agencies: benzodiazepine prescribing rates range from 12% to 80%, and antipsychotic prescribing rates range from 6% to 62%, even after adjusting for patient characteristics. Whether a patient receives a benzodiazepine or an antipsychotic in hospice may depend more on agency practice norms than clinical presentation, which is concerning, especially in light of our findings that such exposure may adversely affect survival. Hospice clinicians have conflicting views about the effectiveness and appropriateness of these medications; in a national survey of hospice clinicians, 40% of hospice physicians believed that benzodiazepines were overused in their hospice, compared with only 8% of hospice nurses. Establishing national guidelines for hospice prescribing in ADRD could help to reduce unwarranted variation, promote safer practices, and ensure consistent care.

Guideline development is especially important given the challenge of prognostication in ADRD. Unlike cancer, ADRD often follows a prolonged and uncertain trajectory. Nearly 20% of hospice enrollees with ADRD outlive the 6-month prognosis required for eligibility, and the mean length of stay in our study exceeded 130 days. For patients who are not actively dying, patients and families may prioritize preserving cognition, communication, and function — goals that may be compromised by sedating medications. This further underscores the need for dementia-specific hospice interventions to help offer scalable, nonpharmacologic approaches, to equip hospice clinicians with effective alternatives.

From 2014 to 2018, Medicare briefly required hospice agencies to report medications billed to the hospice benefit; that program has now expired, leaving hospice medication use entirely unmonitored. This represents a blind spot in oversight of end-of-life care and a gap in research and quality monitoring. Renewed efforts to track and evaluate medication use in hospice are essential to guide evidence-based practice, inform policy, and protect patient safety.

### Behavioral symptoms and treatment challenges for patients living with dementia: hospice clinician and caregiver perspectives [^acc70d93]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Study findings can help to inform dialogue between hospice clinicians and caregivers regarding anticipated behavioral changes and limitations of treatment options for dementia hospice care. While agitation was identified as the most concerning symptom for both caregivers and clinicians, recognizing caregiver distress caused by change in the personality of the person living with dementia can help clinicians to prepare caregivers for potential behavioral symptoms and the distress associated with these behaviors. Similarly, given the discordance of concern for sedation as a primary side effect of antipsychotic and benzodiazepines medications between caregivers and clinicians, it would be important for clinicians to anticipate these concerns and address sedation during discussions of risks and benefits of treatment options or as part of supportive psychoeducational interventions. Lastly, hospice clinicians were less likely to report perceiving medication treatment as effective in managing behavioral symptoms at end of life, however, felt limited in implementing non‐pharmacologic interventions due to lack of staffing and caregiver burden. Despite the rapid growth of hospice enrollment for dementia, few hospice professionals receive dementia specific training. To better address the needs of a growing population of patients with dementia utilizing hospice care, further work is needed to understand the appropriate level of use of psychotropic medications for end‐of‐life dementia care and strengthen training in both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological approaches to behavioral symptom management among providers specializing in hospice and palliative medicine.

### Palliative use of midazolam in acute geriatric units: a multicenter ambispective study [^eb4575ee]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Midazolam is often considered to be an "end-of-life (EOL) drug" associated with the limitation and withdrawal of active treatment; hence, some people may fear that the initiation of treatment with midazolam will hasten death. However, midazolam's sedative effect makes it the most strongly recommended drug for the management of refractory symptoms at the EOL. The European definition of sedative practices was restated by the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) in 2022: "palliative sedation aims to relieve refractory suffering through the monitored proportional use of medications intended to reduce consciousness in patients with life-limiting disease". There is a continuum in EOL practices, as evidenced by the name of the latest draft guidelines from the EAPC: "From anxiolysis to deep continuous sedation - development of recommendations for sedation in palliative care". The benzodiazepine drug midazolam is used as a first-line sedative in palliative care (PC) and can also be prescribed in an anxiolytic indication.

EOL care is common in acute geriatric units (AGUs), and a transition to comfort care only (comfort measures only, comfort-focused care, or hospice care) is sometimes decided during the hospital stay. Comfort care only has been defined as the set of the most basic PC interventions that provide immediate relief of symptoms in a patient who is very close to death. AGUs specialize in the treatment of frail older adults (generally aged 75 or over) following an acute event, such as a fall, delirium, pneumonia, another severe infection, heart failure, an acute cardiovascular event, or an adverse drug reaction. A PC team can be asked for advice or assistance by the patient's family, nurse or physician, although this is not systematic. The deployment of PC in geriatrics remains limited and faces many obstacles. Geriatricians may be less familiar or less comfortable with managing EOL symptoms or sedation practices. To the best of our knowledge, there are no guidelines on palliative sedation (PS) practices in the frail older adult. However, good sedation practice contributes to the quality of EOL care.

Although midazolam prescribing has been investigated in EOL situations such as oncology and PC, midazolam use in AGUs has (somewhat surprisingly) not been studied previously. Hence, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the frequency and conditions of midazolam administration for palliative purposes in four AGUs in France.

### State variation in antipsychotic and benzodiazepine prescribing among hospice beneficiaries in the United States [^c4733174]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Among hospice enrollees in 2017, we found marked variation in prescribing of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines between states. This variation in prescribing may reflect the limited evidence base to guide end of life psychotropic prescribing, and is consistent with other work evaluating differences in practice patterns when there is not consensus regarding treatment appropriateness. These regional differences may reflect prescribing choices informed by provider beliefs about the effectiveness of medications or organizational norms influencing order‐set defaults rather than individualized assessment of patient needs. However, the limited correlation between antipsychotic and benzodiazepine prescribing suggests these medications are not being uniformly prescribed to all hospice enrollees through comfort kits.

Among our study's limitations, medications prescribed may not be taken by the patient and we are not able to ascertain the appropriateness of prescribing because prescription claims do not include indication for use. Our adjusted prescribing models do not account for all state‐level variables that may influence prescribing such as access to inpatient hospice facilities.

Future work is needed to understand the sources of state variation and the associated patient outcomes. A better understanding of the factors that influence hospice prescribing culture can help inform guidelines and best practices for medication use to balance relief of distressing symptoms while avoiding medication‐related harms.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^63496ced]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — post-discontinuation follow-up states that a patient's adjustment to benzodiazepine discontinuation and need for clinician support may last well beyond the time it takes for the drug to be eliminated; although gradual dose reductions and slow tapers may help prevent protracted withdrawal, clinicians should follow up after discontinuation to monitor for and manage symptoms; patients with long-term use may struggle to avoid returning to use and may benefit from ongoing monitoring; clinicians should educate patients with protracted withdrawal symptoms and reassure them that symptoms are likely to resolve as their brains adjust, which may take months; psychosocial support may be helpful; clinicians should avoid reinstating the benzodiazepine but can consider prescribing non-benzodiazepine medications for symptom management when patients are unable to tolerate withdrawal management.

End-of-life management — severe refractory symptoms and proportional medication use states that once a decision is made to forgo life-sustaining treatment, physicians have an ethical obligation to minimize subsequent suffering; in some cases symptoms may require doses that result in unconsciousness (palliative sedation) or respiratory depression, and under the principle of double effect and proportionate reason, it is ethical to treat pain or suffering for relief and not to hasten death; under such circumstances, physicians should be willing to administer adequate doses of opiates or benzodiazepines to reduce distress, conferring with specialist palliative care clinicians for titration and dosing advice, while physicians may not initiate or escalate morphine or other medications out of proportion to symptoms with the intention of speeding up dying, and it is critical to educate patients and families on this point.

### A focused update to the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^00fe1b21]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepines for anxiety in adult ICU patients — Recommendation 1 states: "There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of benzodiazepines to treat anxiety in adult patients admitted to the ICU", and the panel adds, "Due to a lack of evidence, the panel cannot currently make a recommendation regarding the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety in ICU patients", noting that "no studies directly answered our PICO with the exception of one before-and-after cohort study conducted in burn patients which presented limited evidence". Special considerations report that "Severe anxiety is experienced by more than one quarter of intubated patients 6 hours after the interruption of midazolam or propofol, while ten of 16 patients reported anxiety about the endotracheal tube at hospital discharge regardless of sedation", and caution that "abrupt cessation of benzodiazepines prescribed for baseline chronic anxiety may precipitate acute withdrawal; hence, continuation of the chronic benzodiazepines upon admission to the ICU should be considered".

### Guidance for pediatric end-of-life care [^0cfbefab]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Symptom management in pediatric end-of-life care emphasizes recognizing common symptoms, partnering with families, and balancing treatments with goals of care. Most pediatric research regarding end-of-life symptoms is from oncology, with most common symptoms being pain, dyspnea, anxiety, agitation or delirium, fatigue, nausea or vomiting, and poor appetite. Parents and some patients may benefit from hearing which physical signs are part of the natural dying process and which suggest pain or distress, and concerns can be explored with questions like "Please tell me if anything you are seeing makes you worried". Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic techniques can be combined to reduce suffering and mitigate adverse effects, and opioids and benzodiazepines are useful classes of medications to address symptoms at the end of life for children of all ages. Some families and clinicians may worry that medications will cause oversedation or hasten death, while other families and patients may request medication administration to expedite the dying process, so the balance of adequate symptom control with sedation side effects should be routinely assessed and discussed in relation to the patient and family's goals. Whenever possible, the preferences of children and adolescents regarding symptom control and sedation should be elicited and prioritized.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: systematic review and meta-analysis [^d8f1f6b9]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

To facilitate interpretation, we calculated the risk differences per 1000 patients for all dichotomous outcomes by multiplying the risk ratio obtained from meta-analyses with an estimate of the risk of the outcome in the control group. For the control group risk, we used the median risk reported in standard care groups across trials. The parallel BMJ Rapid Recommendations guideline panel provided input on the applicability of the control group risks.

We report results using GRADE simple language summaries (for example, describing high certainty evidence with declarative statements, moderate certainty evidence with "probably", low certainty evidence with "may", and very low certainty evidence with "very uncertain"). In the main manuscript, for comparisons and outcomes with multiple measures of the same outcome, we prioritise reporting results from the measure with the highest certainty. If certainty ratings are comparable, we report results from the most commonly used measure.

Patient and public involvement

The parallel BMJ Rapid Recommendations guideline panel, which included three patient partners, provided input on the scope of the systematic review, including the outcomes of interest.

### Lorazepam [^74a12c8c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

In patients with depression, a possibility for suicide should be borne in mind; benzodiazepines should not be used in such patients without adequate anti-depressant therapy.

Lorazepam should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g. COPD, sleep apnea syndrome).

Elderly or debilitated patients may be more susceptible to the sedative effects of lorazepam. Therefore, these patients should be monitored frequently and have their dosage adjusted carefully according to patient response; the initial dosage should not exceed 2 mg.

Paradoxical reactions have been occasionally reported during benzodiazepine use. Such reactions may be more likely to occur in children and the elderly. Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued.

The usual precautions for treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed. As with all benzodiazepines, the use of lorazepam may worsen hepatic encephalopathy; therefore, lorazepam should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency and/or encephalopathy. Dosage for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency should be adjusted carefully according to patient response; lower doses may be sufficient in such patients.

In patients where gastrointestinal or cardiovascular disorders coexist with anxiety, it should be noted that lorazepam has not been shown to be of significant benefit in treating the gastrointestinal or cardiovascular component.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^492907ec]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine–opioid co-prescribing — core recommendations: Because all patients co-prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) and opioids are at increased risk of respiratory depression, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing with every related clinical encounter or prescription renewal and at least every 3 months (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should offer to provide or prescribe opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g., naloxone) for all patients co-prescribed BZDs and opioids (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should consider additional strategies for mitigating risks, including using the lowest effective doses of BZD and opioid analgesic medications and optimizing non-opioid interventions to manage pain.

### The impact of combined use of opioids, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics on survival in the hospice setting [^a7362874]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Opioids and sedatives are the cornerstone of symptom management in the end-of-life patients, but undertreatment is a common problem. Although several studies explored the individual effect of opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics on survival, not much is known regarding their combined use. As these drugs share similar and potentially fatal side effects, primarily respiratory depression which occurs more often during night-hours, it is crucial to explore whether their interaction poses a danger for fragile hospice patients.

Objectives

To analyze the relationship of a combination of opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics on survival and the change of night-time death percentage.

Methods

A retrospective study of 765 consecutive patients admitted to hospice in Croatia over the period of four years (2013–2017). The main outcome was the total length of survival of hospice patients regarding different drug combination, along with night-time death percentage.

Results

Different combinations of opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics were associated with longer survival in hospice compared with patients using no such drugs. When we included different parameters which affected overall survival into a multivariate analysis, only the patients who had the combination of both opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics in their regular therapy were associated with longer survival in hospice (11 vs. five days, hazard ratio 0.54, P < 0.001). No combination of opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics significantly changed the night-time death percentage.

Conclusion

This research supports the safety of opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics in the hospice setting when used both individually as well as in combination.

### Behavioral symptoms and treatment challenges for patients living with dementia: hospice clinician and caregiver perspectives [^563ea471]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional findings of this study, namely clinicians' attention to physical safety and approach to sedation as a means to maintain safety, potentially explain the nationwide high prescribing rates among patients with dementia in hospice across the United States, with decedents with dementia enrolled in hospice more than twice as likely to receive benzodiazepines and antipsychotics compared to those not hospice enrolled. However, one may wonder why prescription rates remain so high despite clinicians reporting low perceived effectiveness of the pharmacologic treatment options, a belief consistent with empiric data showing limited or no efficacy of psychotropic medications in behavioral symptom management in dementia and end‐of‐life settings, with adverse effects at times offsetting potential benefit of treatment. One explanation for the high prescription rates could be that clinicians' awareness of the caregivers' distress prompts them to prescribe benzodiazepines and antipsychotics for agitation and other behavioral symptoms of dementia, with sedation as a potential intended outcome. Many of the clinician responses in this study highlighted maintaining physical safety and minimizing psychological stress of caregivers as a significant factor influencing prescription practices, which is consistent with previous work. However, clinicians should always consider that the need for maintaining safety using pharmacological interventions can be mitigated with the use of noninvasive behavioral techniques and environmental interventions, while caregiver distress can be reduced with psychoeducation, empathic listening, or referral to appropriate resources in the community. Moreover, hospice clinicians should actively collaborate with family caregivers, assess their values, needs and concerns, and treat them as co‐decision‐makers whenever introducing significant changes to the care plan.

### Pain care for patients with epidermolysis bullosa: best care practice guidelines [^7a118e11]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Breakthrough pain medication at the end of life

Even when good baseline pain relief has been achieved, most patients will require occasional ' ' doses of analgesia. Uniformly effective breakthrough dosing protocols have not been determined for children with EB at end of life, although there are general recommendations from several international sources, and data to support the use of up to 20% of total daily opioid consumption, in adults with cancer. In general, a short-acting, immediate release form of opioid should be given at approximately 10% to 15% of the total background opioid dose of the previous 24 hours. If rescue dosing is used frequently and consistently, then the baseline opioid dosing needs to be increased. Individual patient factors should be taken into consideration (including prior opioid exposure, renal and hepatic function, other medication use) and consultation with an expert in pain management and/or palliative care is recommended. The same principle is recommended for opioids given via all routes of administration. When very rapid onset is needed, transmucosal administration of opioids may be preferable (see Box 9). Commercially available transmucosal preparations of fentanyl are available in doses likely to be suitable for older children and adults. Evidence supports the use of transbuccal fentanyl for breakthrough pain in cancer patients. An additional benefit of fentanyl is that it is not dependent on renal excretion. In some centers, the injectable formulations of morphine or diamorphine have been used buccally at around a third of the standard enteral dose (equivalent to the intravenous dose), allowing more flexibility of dosing. It is also important to remember that extreme anxiety may confound pain perception or expression and that there may be benefit in offering additional doses of buccal midazolam where this is felt to be a significant factor. Therapy should be targeted at specific symptoms whenever possible, although combination therapy is not unusual. Breakthrough analgesia should be offered in the face of unexplained ' ' in case of undiagnosed pain, after which medication for primary agitation/anxiety may be considered. While it is likely that both of these would cause a degree of sedation at higher doses, this should not be the primary aim of treatment.

Good practice points

Palliative pain care is an expected part of care for EB, which in many cases is life-limiting in nature. All basic principles of palliative care apply as they do for other terminal disease states.

### A randomised, double-blind controlled trial of intranasal midazolam for the palliation of dyspnoea in patients with life-limiting disease [^c8c83253]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Anxiety is a major component of breathlessness and is often palliated with benzodiazepines. Midazolam is a short-acting water-soluble benzodiazepine with a rapid onset of action and short half-life. Intranasal midazolam had been shown to be of marked clinical benefit in an uncontrolled pilot study for the control of dyspnoea. A blinded randomised controlled study was therefore undertaken across four Australasian palliative care services.

Methods

All participants received six numbered study nasal spray (SNS) bottles, three of which contained midazolam and three placebo. They were instructed to use one SNS bottle on each day they were breathless, for 6 days within 2 weeks. Dyspnoea scores were recorded before and at set time intervals following the first use of each SNS bottle.

Results

Across all SNS bottles, the maximum change of 2.1 on an 11-point numerical rating scale was seen at 60 min. There was no difference in dyspnoea score between the two arms. Approximately 50% of participants in each arm had a positive response (i.e. ≥ 2 point change in dyspnoea score from baseline). Anxiety scores at baseline were low. The most common adverse event was local nasal reactions.

Conclusion

Intranasal midazolam had no clinical benefit over intranasal placebo for the control of dyspnoea. The low level of anxiety at baseline and dose of active drug delivered may have been important factors. Many participants found the SNS bottles to be a challenging mode of drug delivery. This study confirms the importance of placebo-controlled trials for defining best clinical practise.

### Suitable support for anxious hospice patients: what do nurses' know", do' and' need'? An explanatory mixed method study [^c77fc8b3]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2020). High credibility.

Objective

To provide insight into what nurses know, do and need to provide support to anxious patients in hospice care (HC).

Methods

A mixed method study consisted of an online survey and focus groups (FGs) about what nurses know, do, and need was conducted. 336 HC nurses were invited to participate. Descriptive statistics were computed using SPSS. The χ² and t-tests were conducted to compare. The FGs were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed.

Results

The survey was completed by 265 nurses (79%), and five FGs (n = 25) were conducted. Most nurses had > 10 years working experience; mean age was 52. The majority (59%) felt that they were equipped with sufficient knowledge; however, lack of knowledge (31%) as well as lack of time (50%) were hampering factors. Identification of anxiety was difficult due to the variety of its expression. Tools for identifying were used by 37%. Interventions were generally chosen intuitively. A major responsibility was experienced in caring for patients with panic attacks during late night shifts, making immediate decisions necessary.

Conclusion

This study highlights the struggles of nurses caring for anxious patients in HC. Anxiety management is dependent on the competencies and preferences of the individual nurse. One-third of the nurses require additional training. According to HC nurses, the intervention set should include guidelines for applying assessment tools, effective communication strategies and decision models as well as prediction models in order to select tailored interventions. Future research should focus on patients' perspectives in order to understand crucial measures for anxiety management.

### Deprescribing benzodiazepines among hospitalised older adults: quality improvement initiative [^baed38d0]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

We were able to deprescribe or decrease the dosage of benzodiazepines in the majority of hospitalised patients enrolled in the project. Results indicated that using a combination of medication review, patient education and brief counselling can empower patients, as well as support appropriate benzodiazepine usage that is well tolerated and acceptable. Clinicians, however, need to anticipate the management of anxiety, a common side effect. Although small, our study showed significant potential for improvement of benzodiazepine deprescribing among hospitalised seniors.

The most commonly encountered side effects were worsening anxiety; better screening of patients for the presence of underlying anxiety could help prescribers predict the development of this complication and minimise its occurrence through premedicating or coadministration of a more suitable agent. The low incidence of other more worrying complications, such as withdrawal symptoms, supports and justifies feasibility of encouraging and prompting the deprescribing of benzodiazepines in this patient population, where such use is inappropriate.

### What are the best medications for panic disorder?… [^6f711504]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Jennifer Middleton, MD, MPH Posted on February 28, 2022 The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to worsen mental health around the world; early studies from 2020 were already showing an increased prevalence of depression, anxiety, and panic disorder, and studies from 2021 demonstrate continued increasing rates of these mental health disorders. With several Food and Drug Administration approved medications for panic disorder currently available in the United States, choosing an initial medication for patients with a new diagnosis can feel overwhelming. A newly published systematic review and network meta-analysis sought to identify the most effective medications for panic disorder and found that sertraline and escitalopram had the best balance of benefit and adverse events. They identified 87 studies with a total of 12, 800 participants and followed appropriate systematic review methodology to extract and synthesize the data.

Most of the studies compared medication treatment to placebo, so the authors conducted a network meta-analysis to compare outcomes among the various medication classes and medications identified in the systematic review: Our network meta-analysis identified 11 current drug classes for the treatment of panic disorder, highlighting benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs as the highest ranked treatments for remission based on SUCRA values. Although benzodiazepines were associated with the lowest probability of dropout, they were also associated with the highest risk of adverse events. Overall, SSRIs provided high benefit with low risk of adverse events. Across individual SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram were identified as the most efficacious agents with low risk of adverse events.

Medications are a useful tool for treating panic disorder, but cognitive behavioral therapy is very effective as well. Accessing support resources can be beneficial; I included a list of mental health resources developed during the pandemic in this blog post from 2020, and I especially like this one from the World Health Organization that emphasizes the importance of simple self-care habits. It's also important to precisely diagnose patients to guide treatment recommendations. This 2015 AFP article on "Diagnosis and Management of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder in Adults" includes diagnostic criteria for both Generalized Anxiety Disorder and panic disorder along with an overview of treatment options
- both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical
- to discuss with patients. There's also an AFP By Topic on Anxiety Disorders if you'd like to read more.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^45e8c4b3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering guideline — intended audience and implementation notes that the intended audience is clinicians — including behavioral health professionals, physicians, advanced practice providers, and pharmacists — who prescribe BZDs or provide or support treatment for indications for which BZDs are often prescribed, and it is relevant to diverse settings such as primary care offices, ambulatory care clinics, EDs, hospitals, and outpatient and residential addiction and mental health treatment settings. It adds that some recommendations only apply to specific settings and that clinicians in palliative and end-of-life care are not the intended audience. It clarifies that this Guideline is not intended to be a source of rigid laws, regulations, or policies related to BZD prescribing or tapering and that the recommendations support flexible, patient-centered care. It also states that clinicians should make every effort to promote patients' understanding of and adherence to prescribed and recommended treatment services to improve outcomes, that patients should be informed of the risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options and welcomed as active partners to shared decision-making, and that recommendations in this Guideline do not supersede any federal or state regulations.

### Zopiclone versus placebo for short-term treatment of insomnia in patients with advanced cancer-a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical multicenter phase IV trial [^640e5c54]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sleep disturbances are frequent in patients with advanced cancer, with insomnia being the most prevalent sleep disorder. The cancer disease and cancer treatments place patients at increased risk for disruption of normal behaviors and physiological states that are associated with restful sleep. Insomnia may occur at various points in the patient's disease and treatment trajectory.

Treatment for sleep disturbances in advanced cancer should address the multifactorial and manageable causes of sleep disturbances. However, relief of symptoms such as pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression does not necessarily lead to improvement of insomnia. Thus, in cancer patients as in other populations, sleep specific interventions must be considered. The recommended therapy for sleep disturbances is a stepwise approach starting with non-pharmacological intervention with cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). If these are ineffective, pharmacological sleep interventions are a next step. A limitation for the implementation of CBT-I in cancer clinics is the lack of health professionals formally trained in these techniques. In addition, the number of CBT-I sessions, usually four to eight, might be too demanding for patients during cancer treatment. Thus, for patients with advanced cancer, pharmacological therapy is often used because of its rapid and relatively immediate effects.

Several classes of sleep medications are used to treat sleep disturbances in cancer patients. In a multicenter European study, the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent, zopiclone, was used by 348 of 2282 patients and was the most frequently used hypnotic agent in these patients with advanced cancer. Zopiclone is one of the currently available therapies of insomnia. However, there is limited data from randomized controlled trials about the efficiency of hypnotic drugs in patients with advanced cancer, indicating a lack of evidence-based knowledge in the pharmacological treatment of insomnia in this group. Patients with advanced cancer are in a different clinical situation than other patients with sleep disturbances, due to the limited life expectancy and the complexity of symptoms. Thus, findings from other patient populations cannot be extrapolated. In this group of patients, a well-designed randomized controlled trial is needed to determine the effectiveness of zopiclone on sleep quality to advise the clinical management of insomnia in palliative care populations.

### Hospice agency characteristics associated with benzodiazepine and antipsychotic prescribing [^20a88f75]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Benzodiazepine and antipsychotic medications are routinely prescribed for symptom management in hospice patients, but have significant risks for older adults. We explored the extent to which patient and hospice agency characteristics are associated with variations in their prescribing.

Methods:

Cross-sectional analysis of hospice-enrolled Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥ 65 years in 2017 (N = 1,393,622 in 4219 hospice agencies). The main outcome was the hospice agency-level rate of enrollees with benzodiazepine and antipsychotic prescription fills divided into quintiles. Rate ratios were used to compare the agencies with the highest and lowest prescription across patient and agency characteristics.

Results:

In 2017, hospice agency prescribing rates varied widely: for benzodiazepines, from a median of 11.9% (IQR 5.9,22.2) in the lowest-prescribing quintile to 80.0% (IQR 76.9,84.2) in the highest-prescribing quintile; for antipsychotics, it ranged from 5.5% (IQR 2.9,7.7) in the lowest to 63.9% (IQR 56.1,72.0) in the highest. Among the highest benzodiazepine- and antipsychotic- prescribing hospice agencies, there was a smaller proportion of patients from minoritized populations (benzodiazepine: non-Hispanic Black rate ratio [RR] [Q5/Q1] 0.7, 95% CI 0.6–0.7, Hispanic RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3–0.5; antipsychotic: non-Hispanic Black RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6–0.8, Hispanic RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3–0.5). A greater proportion of rural beneficiaries were in the highest benzodiazepine-prescribing quintile (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2–1.4), whereas this relationship was not present for antipsychotics. Larger hospice agencies were over-represented in the highest prescribing quintile for both benzodiazepines (RR 2.6, 95% CI 2.5–2.7) and antipsychotics (RR 2.7, 95% CI 2.6–2.8), as were for-profit agencies (benzodiazepine: RR 2.4, 95% CI 2.3–2.4; antipsychotic: RR 2.3, 95% CI 2.2–2.4). Prescribing rates varied widely across Census regions.

Conclusions:

Prescribing in hospice settings varies markedly across factors other than the clinical characteristics of enrolled patients.

### Terminal sedation in palliative medicine – definition and review of the literature [^56d30c3a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the reported use of nonopioid medications for terminal sedation. To provide a summary of the available literature, an electronic database search was performed. Thirteen series and 1 4 case reports were identified. Various symptoms, including agitation, pain, and confusion, required terminal sedation. Eleven drugs were used in 342 patients. Most patients were also treated with concurrent opioids and received terminal sedation in an inpatient hospice unit. Midazolam was the most common sedative employed. A good response — defined as adequate sedation — ranged between 75% and 100%. The median time to death following the introduction of terminal sedation was greater than 1 day. No agent appears to have superior efficacy or limiting toxicity.

### Symptom management in people dying with COVID-19: multinational observational study [^ac2dd4e8]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

This study is limited by its cross-sectional design. Given that services sometimes did not state the type of medicine they prescribed in a particular class, we could not make comparisons between different types of medicines (eg, comparing use of different types of benzodiazepines). Assessment of treatment benefit by service leads was a subjective impression of effectiveness, including reports from team members. These responses were then categorised into different levels of effectiveness by our team.

As randomised controlled trials may be impractical, further research, involving observational studies are needed to understand from patient level data whether these medicines, including doses, duration and route, are effective in improving patient outcomes.

Furthermore, there may be non-response, sample and other biases. We cannot tell if the prescribing practices of services that did not respond are different to those of respondents. The survey was distributed through organisations that were mainly based in the UK and Europe, and most respondents were UK services. The survey was offered only in English and some countries were not represented. When we carried out the survey, countries were at varying stages in the pandemic, which may have affected responses. These limit the interpretation of our international comparisons.

### Management of anxiety and depression in adult survivors of cancer: ASCO guideline update [^5431ec83]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Depression — Recommendation 2.4 (pharmacologic management): Treating clinicians may offer a pharmacologic regimen for depression in patients without access to first-line treatment, those expressing a preference for pharmacotherapy, or those who do not improve following first-line psychological or behavioral management; pharmacotherapy should also be considered for patients with a history of treatment response to medications, severe symptoms, or accompanying psychotic features (Type: Evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: Low; Strength of recommendation: Weak). Qualifying statement: Despite the limitations and weak evidence for pharmacologic management, empirically there is some evidence of benefit to warrant their inclusion as an alternative option.
