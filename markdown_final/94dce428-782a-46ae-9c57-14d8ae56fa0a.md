## Question

Postherpetic neuralgia pain treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) pain treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining PHN and confirming diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic options and their evidence. Next, I will review second-line and adjunctive therapies, including topical agents and opioids. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidity-driven choices. Then, I will examine interventional and neuromodulation options for refractory cases. I should also integrate emerging therapies and prevention strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the condition and diagnostic framework. PHN is best defined as neuropathic pain persisting at least 90 days after the onset or healing of herpes zoster rash, with a pathophysiology driven by peripheral and central sensitization, ectopic discharges, and neuroinflammation, which explains the heterogeneous pain phenotypes including burning, allodynia, and electric shock-like sensations [^111gDGVZ] [^114XXcnk].

> I need to check first-line oral therapies and their regulatory status. Gabapentin and pregabalin are FDA-approved for PHN and supported by multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses showing clinically meaningful pain reduction and responder rates; gabapentin typically requires titration to 1,800–3,600 mg/day, and pregabalin is dosed at 150–600 mg/day with renal adjustment, with both demonstrating onset within days and durable benefit over 8–13 weeks in trials [^114nwM8F] [^116myF36] [^117KTB7r] [^117VnYff] [^112Dqn4w] [^111dyx2h].

> Hold on, I should verify antidepressant options and their positioning. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as nortriptyline and desipramine are guideline-endorsed first-line options with strong historical evidence and favorable NNTs around 2–3 for moderate pain relief, though anticholinergic and cardiotoxic risks require caution in older adults; duloxetine, an SNRI, is now recommended by AAFP 2025 for PHN and can be considered when TCAs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated [^113TBBqE] [^116PdoQc] [^115tKmHY].

> Next, I should review topical therapies and their practicalities. The 5% lidocaine patch is FDA-approved and guideline-supported, particularly attractive in older adults due to minimal systemic absorption; a 2–4 week trial is reasonable, and network meta-analysis suggests favorable efficacy and tolerability compared with other topicals, though absolute benefit is modest and application-site reactions are common [^111TyMi6] [^115JUDzq] [^113ythzA] [^1144oXgQ]. The capsaicin 8% patch is also FDA-approved and produces clinically meaningful pain reduction after a single 60–90 minute application, with durability up to 12 weeks and acceptable tolerability even in older adults; pretreatment with topical anesthetic mitigates application-site pain, and repeat applications are feasible at ≥ 12-week intervals [^111WzfCJ] [^1171GZMy] [^1144oXgQ] [^116j8xTY] [^1132nwcf].

> Wait, let me verify the role of opioids so I don't overstate their place. Strong opioids are generally second-line due to misuse, dependence, and adverse effects; nonetheless, randomized data and meta-analyses show that opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol can reduce PHN pain without cognitive impairment in controlled settings, and ASIPP provides Level 2 evidence supporting their use when indicated with careful risk mitigation and monitoring [^111LaCxE] [^113eHoQT] [^1134A9TQ].

> I should double-check combination therapy principles. Because PHN involves multiple pain mechanisms, combining agents with different targets (for example, a gabapentinoid with a TCA or SNRI, or with a topical) can improve analgesia while allowing lower individual drug doses to mitigate adverse effects; expert consensus and Delphi processes endorse this approach when monotherapy is inadequate or poorly tolerated [^111umiFu] [^1119fhmC].

> Let me consider special populations and comorbidity-driven choices. In older adults, I should prioritize topical lidocaine or capsaicin and avoid TCAs with anticholinergic burden; in patients with cardiac disease, avoid TCAs and consider duloxetine or gabapentinoids; in renal impairment, dose-adjust pregabalin and consider gabapentin encarbil; in patients with substance use disorder risk, avoid opioids and favor non-opioid combinations; in immunocompromised patients, tailor to interactions and tolerability while maintaining vigilance for adverse effects [^111TyMi6] [^115tKmHY] [^117KTB7r].

> Next, I should review interventional options for refractory PHN and verify the strength of evidence. Intrathecal methylprednisolone with lidocaine produced significant pain reduction in a large NEJM RCT, but concerns about rare infectious and neurologic complications mandate selective use in expert hands; botulinum toxin A injections, stellate ganglion or paravertebral blocks, and pulsed radiofrequency have supportive but lower-level evidence and may be considered before destructive procedures; spinal cord stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation are promising for intractable cases, supported by case series and systematic reviews suggesting durable benefit in selected patients [^114817Xz] [^114PZFxy] [^113sAf6L].

> But wait, what about emerging therapies and recent approvals. Crisugabalin, a novel α2δ-1 ligand, demonstrated superiority to placebo in a phase 3 RCT with clinically meaningful reductions in average daily pain and higher responder rates, offering a new oral option with flexible dosing; mirogabalin has also shown efficacy in Asian populations and may expand the gabapentinoid class options [^116bmgwy] [^11631ibe] [^112nJQnQ].

> I need to ensure prevention is integrated, because preventing PHN is preferable to treating it. Vaccination with recombinant zoster vaccine reduces PHN incidence by about 67% and is the most effective preventive strategy; during acute zoster, prompt antiviral therapy within 72 hours reduces acute pain and may modestly reduce PHN risk, though evidence for PHN prevention is mixed and not definitive; corticosteroids during acute zoster do not prevent PHN and should not be used for that purpose [^111gDGVZ] [^114a7FKX] [^111SuPHt].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and verify alignment with guidelines. Start with gabapentin or pregabalin and titrate to an effective dose, or choose a TCA such as nortriptyline or desipramine if appropriate; in older adults or those with systemic intolerance, consider a topical lidocaine patch as first-line or in combination; if inadequate after 4–6 weeks, add a second agent with a different mechanism or switch class; reserve opioids for refractory cases with careful risk assessment; for persistent pain despite optimized pharmacotherapy, consider capsaicin 8% patch, interventional nerve blocks, or neuromodulation in specialized centers; throughout, reassess pain, function, sleep, mood, and adverse effects every 2–4 weeks and adjust the plan accordingly [^1152TVJQ] [^111TyMi6] [^111umiFu] [^114PZFxy].

> Hold on, I should verify real-world pitfalls so we don't jump to conclusions about adherence. Undertreatment is common due to premature discontinuation, failure to titrate to therapeutic doses, and underuse of evidence-based combinations; communication gaps between clinicians and patients about expectations, side effects, and duration of therapy further degrade outcomes, underscoring the need for explicit counseling and follow-up plans [^116Fg1Ga] [^1166up4P] [^115DaERZ].

> Finally, I will distill key takeaways and make sure they are reference-anchored. No single therapy works for all patients, so a mechanism-based, sequential, and sometimes combination approach is essential; gabapentin, pregabalin, TCAs, duloxetine, lidocaine patch, and capsaicin patch constitute the core evidence-based options; opioids are second-line with risk mitigation; interventional and neuromodulation therapies are reasonable for refractory cases; and prevention via vaccination and timely acute zoster care remains foundational to reducing PHN burden [^112Dqn4w] [^111dyx2h] [^113TBBqE] [^115tKmHY] [^1171GZMy] [^111gDGVZ].

---

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is best managed with a **stepwise, mechanism-based approach** [^1119fhmC], starting with first-line agents (gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, topical lidocaine, or duloxetine) [^1152TVJQ] [^113TBBqE] [^111TyMi6] [^115tKmHY] and escalating to combination therapy or second-line options (opioids, capsaicin 8% patch, or interventional procedures) if pain persists [^111LaCxE] [^114PZFxy]. Gabapentin and pregabalin are **FDA-approved** [^114nwM8F] [^117KTB7r] and reduce pain by ~30–50% in many patients, with duloxetine and topical lidocaine as well-supported alternatives [^113J3HNe] [^111dyx2h] [^115JUDzq] [^115tKmHY]. Combination therapy is often needed for refractory cases, and interventional options (e.g. spinal cord stimulation) are reserved for intractable pain [^111umiFu] [^113sAf6L]. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbidities, side effects, and patient preference, with regular reassessment and dose titration to optimize control [^111qEzjf].

---

## First-line pharmacological treatments

### Gabapentinoids

- **Gabapentin**: FDA-approved for PHN; typical dose 1,800–3,600 mg/day; reduces pain by ~30–50% in many patients [^115XdNRm] [^113J3HNe].
- **Pregabalin**: FDA-approved; typical dose 150–600 mg/day; similar efficacy to gabapentin with faster onset [^117KTB7r] [^111dyx2h].
- **Crisugabalin**: a novel α2δ-1 ligand; phase 3 trial showed significant pain reduction vs placebo, offering a new option [^116bmgwy].

---

### Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

Among TCAs, **amitriptyline and nortriptyline** are first-line for PHN, with an NNT ~2–3 for moderate pain relief [^116PdoQc]. However, anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects limit use in older adults [^115S2toq].

---

### Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

Among SNRIs, **duloxetine** is recommended by AAFP 2025 for PHN and offers an alternative to TCAs with fewer anticholinergic effects [^115tKmHY].

---

### Topical agents

- **Lidocaine 5% patch**: FDA-approved; reduces pain with minimal systemic absorption; preferred in elderly or those with systemic intolerance [^111TyMi6] [^115JUDzq].
- **Capsaicin 8% patch**: single 60-minute application provides sustained relief for up to 12 weeks; effective in older adults [^1171GZMy] [^116j8xTY].

---

## Second-line and adjunctive therapies

### Opioids

Strong opioids (morphine, oxycodone, tramadol) are **second-line** due to risks of dependence and side effects; use cautiously with close monitoring [^111LaCxE] [^115S2toq].

---

### Interventional therapies

- **Spinal cord stimulation**: for refractory PHN; case series report sustained pain relief [^113sAf6L].
- **Peripheral nerve stimulation**: promising in small series; further research needed [^113sAf6L].
- **Intrathecal methylprednisolone**: effective in RCT for intractable PHN; invasive and reserved for specialists [^114817Xz].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy using agents with different mechanisms (e.g. gabapentinoid + TCA/SNRI or topical) is often **superior to monotherapy**, allowing lower doses and fewer side effects [^111umiFu] [^1119fhmC].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological options include **acupuncture**, which has evidence of pain reduction and improved quality of life with minimal adverse effects [^116hTjd5] [^112dhSb9], and **psychological therapies** such as CBT and mindfulness, which may improve coping and quality of life, though evidence is limited.

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

- **Age**: older adults may have more side effects; prefer topical agents or duloxetine.
- **Comorbidities**: cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, depression guide selection.
- **Patient preference**: shared decision-making improves adherence and outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular reassessment of pain, function, mood, sleep, and side effects is essential; adjust therapy based on response and tolerability [^1119fhmC].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging directions include **novel agents** such as crisugabalin and mirogabalin, which may expand options [^116bmgwy] [^112nJQnQ], and **personalized medicine**, with biomarker-driven selection to optimize outcomes [^114XXcnk].

---

PHN management is **stepwise and individualized**: start with first-line agents, escalate to combination therapy, and consider interventional options for refractory pain. Regular reassessment and patient-centered care are key to optimizing outcomes.

### Up-date on clinical management of postherpetic neuralgia and mechanism-based treatment: new options in therapy [^117Q7A4r]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with postherpetic neuralgia may experience various sensory signs and symptoms of pain. Despite this, the recommendations for medicinal treatment do not differ accordingly. In order to find the appropriate treatment options for postherpetic neuralgia, several attempts have been made in the past. The crucial obstacle to these attempts was insufficient or no subgrouping of patients according to their sensory phenotype, mostly resulting in an unsatisfactory treatment response. Recently, a new concept of retrospective stratification according to the patients' sensory phenotype has been made in a large cohort of pain patients. This new stratification tool allows a predictive validity for treatment response in subgroups of patients and might be of potential value in determining the optimal treatment in postherpetic neuralgia patients.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^111qEzjf]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

An estimated one million individuals in the US are diagnosed with herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) each year. Approximately 20% of these patients will develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complex HZ complication characterized by neuropathic pain isolated to the dermatome that was affected by the HZ virus. PHN is debilitating, altering physical function and quality of life, and commonly affects vulnerable populations, including the elderly and the immunocompromised. Despite the availability of an immunization for HZ prevention and several approved HZ treatments, the incidence of PHN is increasing. Furthermore, management of the neuropathic pain associated with PHN is often suboptimal, and the use of available therapeutics may be complicated by adverse effects and complex, burdensome treatment regimens, as well as by patients' comorbidities and polypharmacy, which may lead to drug-drug interactions. Informed and comprehensive assessments of currently available pharmacological treatment options to achieve effective pain control in the primary care setting are needed. In this article, we discuss the situation in clinical practice, review currently recommended prevention and treatment options for PHN, and outline practical considerations for the management of this neuropathic pain syndrome, with a focus on optimal, individual-based treatment plans for use in the primary care setting.

### Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: a review of therapeutic options [^1119fhmC]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a disabling consequence of the reactivation of the varicella zoster infection. The observation that patients with PHN experience various types of pain suggests that multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms are involved, which may include the peripheral and central nervous systems. A reasonable initial strategy would involve selecting from among multiple agents that have complementary mechanisms of action and that have been proven effective in controlled clinical trials, such as the lidocaine patch 5%, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, and opioids. Based on initial assessment and ongoing reassessment, sequential trials should be undertaken until adequate pain relief is achieved. This may ultimately lead to therapy with more than one medication. Safety and tolerability are important considerations in choosing initial therapy, particularly in older patients. Physicians can either add another agent to the current regimen or switch to a new type of monotherapy if there is inadequate response to initial therapy. Alternative therapies, (i.e., ketamine, intrathecal corticosteroid injections) have not been adequately studied. Well-designed, multicenter, controlled clinical trials are needed to develop a treatment algorithm that provides an evidence-based, rational approach to treating PHN.

### Is acupuncture an effective postherpetic neuralgia treatment? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hTjd5]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This review has several limitations. Although we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, we found few English language studies of acupuncture for PHN. Furthermore, there have been persistent discrepancies in the definition of PHN. Some have reported that pain persisting 30 days or more after rash onset can be defined as PHN, while others have used persistent pain for 120 days as their definition. Although similar reviews have published evidence for the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for PHN, we sought more information, focusing on the advantages of acupuncture therapy over pharmacologic therapy. Through our review, there is a need for more studies to conduct subgroup analyses on pain persistence.

Clinical implications

This review finds that acupuncture is beneficial for PHN, especially for associated pain relief. It can provide a treatment option for clinicians worried about adverse effects of drugs, and evidence-based evidence for acupuncturist. The findings of this review support the view that acupuncture is an effective PHN treatment.

### Is treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in the community consistent with evidence-based recommendations? [^116Fg1Ga]. Pain (2012). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined the extent to which treatment of patients with neuropathic pain in the community is consistent with evidence-based treatment recommendations. U.S. health care claims were used to identify patients who received a diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The initial pharmacologic treatments and changes to these treatment regimens were categorized according to the International Association for the Study of Pain Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group recommendations for first-, second-, and third-line treatment of neuropathic pain. The results indicated that the treatment of PHN was only partially consistent with these treatment recommendations. Of the patients diagnosed with PHN who were not already on a specified treatment, 70% began treatment with either a first-, second-, or third-line treatment or a not-recommended treatment, and 30% did not begin treatment with any of these medications. Only one-quarter of patients began treatment with a first-line medication, the same percentage that began treatment with either a third-line medication or a not-recommended treatment. There was a wide range of initial treatment durations, but the means and medians suggest that patients and clinicians often decide to change the initial treatment within 2 months, either by discontinuing it, replacing it with a new medication, or adding a new medication. Although there were generally shorter treatment durations with opioid analgesics and tramadol, these medications were more frequently used in beginning treatment than the other treatments. The results suggest that a considerable number of patients with PHN in the community are not receiving evidence-based treatment.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^11498de3]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Optimal management of pain in PHN patients is complex and difficult. Although there are several therapeutic options, PHN treatment is often inadequate, leaving patients undertreated. Better utilization of available options and multimechanistic approaches to PHN management based on the patient's individual characteristics may be the most beneficial. Primary care plays a crucial role in the development and implementation of the PHN treatment plan, and establishing effective communication with patients. Well-devised and well-executed PHN therapy will not only ensure sufficient pain relief but will also facilitate improvements in patients' physical and psychosocial functions.

We conducted a comprehensive literature search for peer-reviewed articles about HZ and PHN using the PubMed search engine and relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords. Identified studies included those that evaluated the treatment of HZ and/or PHN in terms of efficacy and safety. The same search was repeated for review articles, including meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Additional searches included bibliographies of the retrieved articles, and Medline searches using the names of authors who had published several articles on HZ or PHN. We first reviewed titles and abstracts for relevance, and selected articles were then reviewed on their entirety. Included articles were English-language studies, addressed epidemiology and burden of HZ, were prospective or retrospective studies that provided clinical information on treated patients, provided detailed methodology and clear outcome measures, demonstrated treatment/prevention of HZ or PHN as a primary purpose, and described treatments feasible for an outpatient setting approved by the FDA or adhering to current guidelines on the care of PHN patients.–Studies and reviews that included other conditions were only included if results were reported separately for each condition. Studies that described case reports or case series were excluded.

### Interleukin-2: a potential treatment option for postherpetic neuralgia? [^114vP4V9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia is a chronic pain syndrome that is often difficult to treat and can lead to a disabling disease if it is resistant to therapy. Presented here is the case of a 46-year-old patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection and chronic, treatment-resistant neuralgia. Postherpetic pain resolved after treatment with 1 cycle of subcutaneous recombinant interleukin-2.

### Postherpetic neuralgia: from preclinical models to the clinic [^112az39q]. Neurotherapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a common complication of herpes zoster, which results from reactivation of varicella zoster virus, is a challenging neuropathic pain syndrome. The incidence and severity of herpes zoster and PHN increases with immune impairment or age and may become a greater burden both in terms of health economics and individual suffering. A clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this disease and translation of preclinical outcomes to the clinic may lead to more efficacious treatment options. Here we give an overview of recent findings from preclinical models and clinical research on PHN.

### EFNS guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain: 2010 revision [^111TyMi6]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for postherpetic neuralgia, more specifically with respect to topical anesthetics, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend to consider offering topical lidocaine as first-line therapy in elderly patients with PHN, especially if there are concerns regarding the CNS side effects of oral medications. Attempt a trial of 2–4 weeks before starting other therapy.

### Peripheral nerve surgery for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia [^117JtrDM]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia is a chronic pain condition that develops in some patients after the resolution of herpes zoster, and has no medical cure. Medications used to treat chronic pain do not hasten resolution of the disorder and may impair function. In this brief case report, we describe our experience with excision and implantation to muscle of peripheral sensory nerves in the affected dermatomes as a novel surgical treatment to reduce pain and improve quality of life for patients with this condition. Of the 3 treated patients, all had resolution of chronic pain after surgery. It is concluded that peripheral nerve surgery offers a promising option to improve pain and quality of life in postherpetic neuralgia patients, without affecting systemic functioning.

### Interventional treatments for postherpetic neuralgia: a systematic review [^114PZFxy]. Pain Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia, a persistent pain condition often characterized by allodynia and hyperalgesia, is a deleterious consequence experienced by patients after an acute herpes zoster vesicular eruption has healed. The pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia can severely affect a patient's quality of life, quality of sleep, and ability to participate in activities of daily living. Currently, first-line treatments for this condition include the administration of medication therapies such as tricyclic antidepressants, pregabalin, gabapentin, and lidocaine patches, followed by the application of tramadol and capsaicin creams and patches as second- or third-line therapies. As not all patients respond to such conservative options, however, interventional therapies are valuable for those who continue to experience pain.

Objective

This review focuses on interventional therapies that have been subjected to randomized controlled trials for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; local botulinum toxin A, cobalamin, and triamcinolone injection; intrathecal methylprednisolone and midazolam injection; stellate ganglion block; dorsal root ganglion destruction; and pulsed radiofrequency therapy.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Setting

Hospital department in Taiwan.

Methods

Search of PubMed database for all randomized controlled trials regarding postherpetic neuralgia that were published before the end of May 2017.

Results

The current evidence is insufficient for determining the single best interventional treatment. Considering invasiveness, price, and safety, the subcutaneous injection of botulinum toxin A or triamcinolone, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, and stellate ganglion block are recommended first, followed by paravertebral block and pulsed radiofrequency. If severe pain persists, spinal cord stimulation could be considered. Given the destructiveness of dorsal root ganglion and adverse events of intrathecal methylprednisolone injection, these interventions should be carried out with great care and only following comprehensive discussion.

Limitations

Although few adverse effects were reported, these procedures are invasive, and a careful assessment of the risk-benefit ratio should be conducted prior to administration.

Conclusion

With the exception of intrathecal methylprednisolone injection for postherpetic neuralgia, the evidence for most interventional procedures used to treat postherpetic neuralgia is Level 2, according to "The Oxford Levels of Evidence 2". Therefore, these modalities have received only grade B recommendations. Despite the lack of a high level of evidence, spinal cord stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation are possibly useful for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.

Key Words

Interventional treatment, postherpetic neuralgia, botulinum toxin, steroid, stellate ganglion block, peripheral nerve stimulation, paravertebral block, radiofrequency, spinal cord stimulation.

### Corticosteroids for herpes zoster: what do they accomplish? [^114jyUjx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

For some patients, herpes zoster infections not only result in acute pain but serious consequences, including postherpetic neuralgia and damage to ocular tissues. Some authors have recommended corticosteroids for the treatment of these acute symptoms and complications. The literature concerning the use of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, however, either provides conflicting results or includes recommendations based on clinical experience rather than clinical trials. The author performed a search of the literature to address the question of whether corticosteroids are well tolerated and effective for the treatment/prevention of the acute pain of herpes zoster, postherpetic neuralgia, and/or the ocular complications resulting from herpes zoster. While smaller trials found oral corticosteroids beneficial for preventing postherpetic neuralgia, larger, better designed trials have not found oral corticosteroids to be more efficacious than placebo in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. Trials investigating the effect of oral corticosteroids for the acute pain of herpes zoster have found that corticosteroids provide a statistically significant improvement. Whether these improvements are clinically significant is uncertain. Thus, oral corticosteroids may confer a slight benefit for initial symptoms as long as the patient is not at risk for complications resulting from corticosteroid therapy. Most trials of topical and injectable corticosteroids are limited by several shortcomings. Therefore, topical and most forms of parenteral corticosteroids have yet to be proven effective for the treatment of acute pain or prevention of complications. Two controlled, blinded trials investigating the use of intrathecal corticosteroid administration for intractable postherpetic neuralgia suggest that corticosteroid administration results in a significant improvement in pain. Despite this, several authors have voiced concern over possible serious adverse events with the intrathecal administration of corticosteroids. Intrathecal corticosteroids may provide a benefit for intractable postherpetic neuralgia, but because of risks of serious complications, this is a last-line option and should only be administered by experienced personnel.

### Management of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^1159fuFc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with herpes zoster experience severe pain and potential lasting complications such as postherpetic neuralgia, ophthalmic disease/damage, and, rarely, skin complications (eg, infection of rash area). Treatment for acute zoster aims to accelerate healing, control pain, and, when possible, reduce the risk of complications. Early intervention with antivirals can accelerate rash healing, reduce rash severity, and reduce the risk of some complications. The addition of corticosteroids to antiviral medication may further alleviate short-term zoster pain, but is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse effects, especially among older adults. If a patient does develop postherpetic neuralgia, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine patch 5%, and capsaicin may all be considered as palliative treatments. For individuals with treatment-refractory postherpetic neuralgia, nonpharmacologic approaches may be considered and a pain-management specialist should be consulted. There is a need for more effective agents to treat herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia.

### The evidence for pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain [^114BTr2o]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on neuropathic pain treatment are accumulating, so an updated review of the available evidence is needed. Studies were identified using MEDLINE and EMBASE searches. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) values were used to compare the efficacy and safety of different treatments for a number of neuropathic pain conditions. One hundred and seventy-four studies were included, representing a 66% increase in published randomized, placebo-controlled trials in the last 5 years. Painful poly-neuropathy (most often due to diabetes) was examined in 69 studies, postherpetic neuralgia in 23, while peripheral nerve injury, central pain, HIV neuropathy, and trigeminal neuralgia were less often studied. Tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin, and opioids are the drug classes for which there is the best evidence for a clinical relevant effect. Despite a 66% increase in published trials only a limited improvement of neuropathic pain treatment has been obtained. A large proportion of neuropathic pain patients are left with insufficient pain relief. This fact calls for other treatment options to target chronic neuropathic pain. Large-scale drug trials that aim to identify possible subgroups of patients who are likely to respond to specific drugs are needed to test the hypothesis that a mechanism-based classification may help improve treatment of the individual patients.

### Treatment and prevention of postherpetic neuralgia [^116cVRGM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

There have been 4 recent major advances in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) that are based on the results of randomized, controlled trials. These advances are the demonstrations that gabapentin, the lidocaine patch 5%, and opioid analgesics are efficacious in patients with PHN, and the report that nortriptyline and amitriptyline provide equivalent analgesic benefits for patients with PHN but that nortriptyline is better tolerated. The results of these clinical trials are briefly reviewed, and their implications for the treatment of patients with PHN are discussed. Despite these treatment advances, many patients remain refractory to current therapy, and the prevention of PHN has therefore become an important focus of current research. Research on administration of the varicella-zoster vaccine to prevent herpes zoster and on treatment of patients who have herpes zoster with combined antiviral and analgesic therapy to prevent PHN is discussed.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^111SuPHt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, serious, painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory properties, and might be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2008, and previously updated in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Methods

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registers (June 2022). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors, and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages, with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified potential articles, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of each trial, and the certainty of the evidence. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors. We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified five trials with a total of 787 participants that met our inclusion criteria. No new studies were identified for this update. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection in preventing postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of herpes (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.99; 2 trials, 114 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)). The three other trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were not included in the meta-analysis because they did not provide separate information on the number of participants with PHN at six months. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no observed differences in serious (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.29; 5 trials, 755 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)), or non-serious adverse events (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.87; 5 trials, 755 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and serious imprecision)) between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. One of these trials was at high risk of bias because of incomplete outcome data, two were at unclear risk of bias, and the other was at low risk of bias. The review was first published in 2008; no new RCTs were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates in 2010, 2013, and 2023.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the current available evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection on preventing postherpetic neuralgia. Corticosteroids given orally or intramuscularly may result in little to no difference in the risk of adverse events in people with acute herpes zoster. Some researchers have recommended using corticosteroids to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of the disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life, as well as updated measures of pain.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^113qEk27]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Practical considerations for management of PHN

For primary care providers, PHN may not present as a distinct entity but rather an extension of the original HZ infection, and monitoring for a global condition affecting multiple aspects of patients' lives rather than for a localized post-HZ pain is paramount. Thus, practical management of PHN can be divided into prevention and treatment of HZ, and the more challenging task of managing the neuropathic pain syndrome and its consequences once PHN has developed (Figure 2).

To date, no cure for PHN exists, only treatments that are palliative and that may shorten the duration and severity of the pain. Therefore, vaccinations to prevent initial chicken pox and thus VZV from ever gaining a foothold in the body in the first place, or vaccinations to prevent reactivation of VZV already present in the body remain a priority; however, there are uncertainties about the vaccines' duration of protection and/or how frequently booster can be given.–For patients who were exposed to VZV and who contracted acute HZ, the primary care provider may use antivirals, analgesics, or corticosteroids to decrease acute pain and possibly decrease the risk of developing PHN.

### Communication gaps between physicians and patients with postherpetic neuralgia: results from a national study on practice patterns [^1166up4P]. Journal of Pain Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to identify differences in perceptions of care regarding postherpetic neuralgia, including communication patterns between patients and physicians and levels of satisfaction with therapies and care.

Methods

A survey was developed for physicians (neurologists, internists, and family physicians) and patients with postherpetic neuralgia in order to determine their perspectives on its management.

Results

A total of 142 eligible patient respondents were included in the study, and responses were compared with those of 150 primary care physicians and 76 neurologist respondents. Few patients and physicians indicated satisfaction with the currently available treatments for postherpetic neuralgia. While nearly all physicians responded that they discuss the cause of postherpetic neuralgia with a patient, one in four patients indicated that their physician did not discuss the cause. Similarly, one in four patients were not aware of the duration of postherpetic neuralgia, the treatment side effects, or what to expect from treatment. Patients may be less likely to discuss treatment side effects and quality of life issues than physicians perceive.

Conclusion

Physicians and patients have similar perceptions regarding treatment options for postherpetic neuralgia; however, certain gaps in communication were evident, which may be attributable to physician knowledge and communication skills with patients. Strategies to improve issues of expected outcomes and side effects of treatment may be useful to physicians.

### Is acupuncture an effective postherpetic neuralgia treatment? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1121ddqa]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic refractory neuropathic pain syndrome. It is characterized by the invasive nerve distribution area maintaining persistent, severe pain after herpes zoster lesions are gone.–18–41% of patients suffering from herpes zoster experience intense pain, the most common chronic complication after the healing of the rash.–The pain persists for months or even years, during which physical, emotional and social function may suffer. Increasing age is a risk factor for PHN, and it has been reported that immunosuppression, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes and recent trauma can also increase risk.

The current pharmacological treatment for PHN is tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine and maprotiline), gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids and topical lidocaine patches.–However, the anticholinergic side effects of tricyclic antidepressants have cardiovascular and renal comorbidities which limit their use. Occasionally, despite the administration of complex drug combinations, analgesia is still ineffective.

In recent years, clinical and scientific attention to acupuncture has increased. Acupuncture is a reliable and reproducible treatment for acute and chronic pain.–Reports have shown the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic pain and that the treatment effects persist for weeks.–Many reports have confirmed the therapeutic effects of acupuncture on PHN. These have included case reports and pilot studies which have identified acupuncture as a therapy with promising results for relieving pain without significant adverse reactions.–As more and more PHN treatments are developed, acupuncture might have an advantage for analgesia and reducing adverse reactions. However, this statement lacks evidence. Thus, we have collected and summarized published evidence on acupuncture for PHN.

### Efficacy and safety of crisugabalin (HSK16149) in adults with postherpetic neuralgia: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^116bmgwy]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the efficacy of crisugabalin, an oral calcium channel α2δ-1 subunit ligand, for postherpetic neuralgia?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 366 adults, crisugabalin, 40 mg/d, and crisugabalin, 80 mg/d, for 12 weeks yielded a least squares mean difference of −1.1 (95% CI, −1.6 to −0.7) and −1.5 (−95% CI, −2.0 to −1.0) vs placebo in the change from baseline in the average daily pain scores, establishing superiority of crisugabalin over placebo.

Meaning

Crisugabalin, 40 mg/d, or crisugabalin, 80 mg/d, caused significantly greater pain reduction over placebo, offering a flexible dose selection depending on individual patient response and tolerability.

### Antiviral treatment for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^114a7FKX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a painful and refractory complication of herpes zoster. Treatments are either partially or totally ineffective for many people with PHN. Antiviral agents, used at the time of the rash, have been proposed as an intervention to prevent the development of PHN. This is the first update since the first publication of the review in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antiviral agents in preventing PHN.

Search Methods

On 26 April 2013, we updated the searches in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System. We checked the references of published studies to identify additional trials, and contacted authors to obtain additional data. We searched other databases in The Cochrane Library for information for the Discussion and two clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antiviral treatment given within 72 hours after the onset of herpes zoster for preventing PHN. There were no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, evaluated the risk of bias in included trials, and extracted and analysed data.

Main Results

Six RCTs with a total of 1211 participants were eligible; five trials evaluated oral aciclovir, and one, with 419 participants, evaluated oral famciclovir. We were able to conduct meta-analyses as there were sufficient similarities in the included studies, such as the reporting of the presence of PHN, duration of rash before treatment initiation and treatment regimen. For our primary outcome, based on three trials (609 participants) we found no significant difference between the aciclovir and control groups in the incidence of PHN four months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.11), nor was there a significant difference at six months (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.27, two trials, 476 participants). In four of the trials (692 participants), there was some evidence for a reduction in the incidence of pain four weeks after the onset of rash. In the trial of famciclovir versus placebo, neither 500 mg nor 750 mg doses of famciclovir reduced the incidence of herpetic neuralgia significantly. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and headache for aciclovir, and headache and nausea for famciclovir. For neither treatment was the incidence of adverse events significantly different from placebo. None of the studies were at high risk of bias, although the risk of bias was unclear in at least one domain for all but one study. We found no new RCTs when we updated the searches in April 2013.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high quality evidence that oral aciclovir does not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of other antiviral treatments; therefore, further well-designed RCTs are needed to investigate famciclovir or other new antiviral agents in preventing PHN. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^1134dbCo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia is a common serious complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and might be beneficial.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Strategy

Search for randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials for corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in MEDLINE (1950 to 2006), EMBASE (1980 to 2006), LILACS (1982 to 2005), the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to 2006) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006). Date of most recent search: September 2006.

Selection Criteria

Types of studies: quasi-randomised or randomised controlled trials.

Types Of Participants

people of all ages with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset. Types of interventions: all kinds of corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular or intravenous routes during the acute stage (starting within one week of onset of the rash) compared with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments. We also included trials which compared corticosteroids plus routine treatment with placebo plus routine treatment. Types of outcome measures: Primary: the presence of postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash. Secondary: pain severity measured by a validated visual analogue scale or numerical descriptive scale after three, six and 12 months; quality of life measured with the short form 36 questionnaire after six months; adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by two independent reviewers.

Main Results

Five trials were included with altogether 787 participants. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group studies. Our primary outcome measure was the presence of postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash. There was no significant difference between the corticosteroid and control groups for the primary outcome (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.20 to 7.97). There was also no significant difference between the corticosteroid plus antiviral agents and placebo plus antiviral agents groups for the primary outcome (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.03). No included trials evaluated pain severity with a validated visual analogue scale or numerical descriptive scale and also no trials measured quality of life with the Short Form 36 questionnaire. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported by all five included trials, but after meta-analysis, there was no significant difference in any serious adverse event (death, acute cardiac insufficiency, rash dissemination, bacterial pneumonia or haematemesis) or non serious adverse event (dizziness, nausea, vomiting, hypertension or hyperglycaemia).

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to conclude that corticosteroids are safe or effective in the prevention of postherpetic neuralgia. More randomised controlled trials with a greater number of participants are needed to determine reliably whether there is real benefit (or harm) from the use of corticosteroid therapy to prevent postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should measure function and quality of life.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^111GEksi]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The recognizable appearance and the dermatomal distribution of herpes zoster lesions usually enable a clinical diagnosis to be made easily. Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia occur mainly in older patients. The role of the varicella vaccine in preventing herpes zoster is uncertain, but is being studied. There is evidence to support using antiviral therapy and possibly low-dose tricyclic antidepressants to prevent postherpetic neuralgia. There is good evidence that treating herpes zoster with antiviral medication is beneficial, particularly in patients older than 50 years with severe outbreaks. The use of steroids has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. In patients who develop postherpetic neuralgia, there is good evidence to support treatment with gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants. More evidence for treatment with capsaicin cream, lidocaine patch, and opioids is needed. Intrathecal methylprednisolone is an option for patients with persistent pain.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy, safety, and tolerability data from randomized controlled trials of drugs used to treat postherpetic neuralgia [^115M5Krs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review of available data from reports of randomized controlled trials on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of drugs used to treat postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a common type of neuropathic pain.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE (1950-June 30, 2009) and EMBASE (1974-June 30, 2009) databases were used to identify source studies, in conjunction with a review of reference citations from identified published reports.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

We selected all English-language reports of randomized placebo-controlled trials of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of drugs (oral or transdermal) used for treatment in patients with PHN. Studies with treatment duration less than 4 weeks were excluded. From each identified trial, we extracted information on (1) placebo-corrected percentage reductions in pain intensity from randomization to end of active treatment; (2) relative risks of withdrawal due to lack of efficacy; (3) relative risks of various adverse events; and (4) relative risks of withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Synthesis

Twelve reports of randomized controlled trials in patients with PHN were identified, involving 8 different agents (amitriptyline, capsaicin, divalproex sodium, gabapentin, morphine, nortriptyline, pregabalin, tramadol). Most studies were small, involving fewer than 200 patients. Pain intensity was reported to have been reduced significantly with all drugs (range: 13.8% [tramadol] to 42.4% [amitriptyline]); data were pooled using techniques of meta-analysis when information was available from more than 1 trial. No clinical trial reported a significant reduction in risk of withdrawal as a result of lack of efficacy. Analysis of adverse events was greatly limited by erratic and inconsistent reporting and wide variation in sample sizes.

Conclusions

While available literature establishes the efficacy of 8 drugs in treatment of PHN, it does not provide adequate guidance as to which agents are best to treat this condition, in part because of inadequate reporting of data on tolerability and safety.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^113GFono]. American Family Physician (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to pain management, postherpetic neuralgia, AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend to offer capsaicin 8% patches applied for 30–90 minutes for pain relief in patients with postherpetic neuralgia.

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study of NGX-4010, a high-concentration capsaicin patch, for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia [^117TV6kJ]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To confirm the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of NGX-4010, an 8% capsaicin dermal patch (capsaicin 640 µg/cm²), in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN is a chronic pain disorder that can be difficult to treat and for which current treatment options are often limited by poor tolerability.

Design

A total of 418 patients were randomized to receive a single 60-minute application of NGX-4010 or a 0.04% capsaicin control patch (3.2 µg/cm²) in a multicenter, double-blind, confirmatory, phase 3 study.

Patients

Patients were 18–90 years old with a diagnosis of PHN, pain for at least 6 months, and an average baseline Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score of 3–9.

Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy end point was the percentage change in NPRS score from baseline to weeks 2–8.

Results

NGX-4010 recipients had a significantly greater mean reduction from baseline in pain during weeks 2–8 compared with the control group (32.0% vs 24.4%; P = 0.011). A ≥ 30% reduction in mean NPRS scores was achieved in 46% of NGX-4010 recipients compared with 34% of controls (P = 0.02). Pain was significantly lower in NGX-4010 recipients than controls by week 2, and greater pain reduction was maintained throughout the remaining 12-week study period. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were application site specific (notably erythema and pain), transient, and generally mild to moderate in severity.

Conclusions

In patients with PHN, a single 60-minute application of NGX-4010 produced significant reduction in pain that was maintained over a 12-week period.

### Gabapentin (Neurontin) [^114nwM8F]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Postherpetic Neuralgia

NEURONTIN was evaluated for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of a total of 563 patients with pain for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash (Table 6).

Each study included a 7- or 8-week double-blind phase (3 or 4 weeks of titration and 4 weeks of fixed dose). Patients initiated treatment with titration to a maximum of 900 mg/day gabapentin over 3 days. Dosages were then to be titrated in 600 to 1200 mg/day increments at 3- to 7-day intervals to the target dose over 3 to 4 weeks. Patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). A mean pain score during baseline of at least 4 was required for randomization. Analyses were conducted using the ITT population (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication).

Both studies demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo at all doses tested.

The reduction in weekly mean pain scores was seen by Week 1 in both studies, and were maintained to the end of treatment. Comparable treatment effects were observed in all active treatment arms. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling provided confirmatory evidence of efficacy across all doses. Figures 1 and 2 show pain intensity scores over time for Studies 1 and 2.

The proportion of responders (those patients reporting at least 50% improvement in endpoint pain score compared to baseline) was calculated for each study (Figure 3).

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^115XdNRm]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of vaccination, a communication gap between primary medical providers and patients hinders satisfactory prevention of VZV and HZ. PHN incidence is on the rise, the effective management of PHN remains an ongoing challenge, and no single best therapy has yet been identified. Current guidelines for management of PHN pain recommend gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), opioids, topical agents, and combination therapies with different mechanisms of action (Figure 2).–However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved four oral systemic medications, all of which are gabapentinoids, and two topical analgesics specifically for the management of pain associated with PHN (Figure 2).

A carefully devised, individually based treatment plan is critical to ensure optimal outcomes in the management of PHN. Pain and its interference with daily activities are subjective symptoms and difficult to manage effectively, even more so in older patients, who are predominantly afflicted with PHN, and who are more likely to have multiple chronic health issues and declining function and frailty. A significant number of patients who develop chronic pain associated with PHN do not receive evidence-based, recommended treatment modalities, leaving many patients undertreated and dissatisfied with the treatment. To ensure optimal results, the initial choice of PHN pain therapy should be guided not only by drug efficacy but also by the patient's comorbidities, severity of PHN pain, the drugs' adverse-event and drug-interaction profiles, titration regimen, and patient preference, especially since no single therapy has demonstrated superior effectiveness. Because PHN is a complex condition and should not be simplified to a localized area of pain, the most practical therapeutic approach may involve a systemic medication or combination therapy rather than topical analgesics alone. Finally, clear communication with the patient and frequent monitoring of adverse reactions and patient satisfaction with the treatment should be established.

### Topical lidocaine for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia [^115JUDzq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The cause of postherpetic neuralgia is damage to peripheral neurons, dorsal root ganglia, and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, secondary to herpes zoster infection (shingles). In postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral neurons discharge spontaneously and have lowered activation thresholds, and exhibit an exaggerated response to stimuli. Topical lidocaine dampens peripheral nociceptor sensitisation and central nervous system hyperexcitability, and may benefit patients with postherpetic neuralgia.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy and safety of topical lidocaine in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS, SIGLE for conference proceedings, Citation Index, the reference lists of all eligible trials, key textbooks, and previous systematic reviews. We also wrote to authors of all identified trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing all topical applications of lidocaine, including gels and patches in patients of all ages with postherpetic neuralgia (pain persisting at the site of shingles at least one month after the onset of the acute rash).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data, and a third checked them. We obtained some missing data from the US Food and Drugs Administration.

Main Results

Three trials involving 182 topical lidocaine treated participants and 132 control participants were included. Two trials gave data on pain relief, and the remaining study provided data on secondary outcome measures. The largest trial published as an abstract compared topical lidocaine patch to a placebo patch and accounted for 150 of the 314 patients (48%). A meta-analysis combining two of the three studies identified a significant difference between the topical lidocaine and control groups for the primary outcome measure: a mean improvement in pain relief according to a pain relief scale. Topical lidocaine relieved pain better than placebo (P = 0.003). There was a statistical difference between the groups for the secondary outcome measure of mean VAS score reduction (P = 0.03), but this was only for a single small trial. There were a similar number of adverse skin reactions in both treatment and placebo groups. The highest recorded blood lidocaine concentration varied between 59 ng/ml and 431 ng/ml between trials. The latter figure is high and the authors of the study suggest that the sample had been contaminated during the assay procedure.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to recommend topical lidocaine as a first-line agent in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia with allodynia. Further research should be undertaken on the efficacy of topical lidocaine for other chronic neuropathic pain disorders, and also to compare different classes of drugs (e.g. topical anaesthetics versus anti-epileptics).

### New findings on risk factors for postherpetic neuralgia from 2014 to 2024: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1136riwa]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a common complication of herpes zoster (HZ), is characterized by chronic pain persisting or developing 3 months after the initial rash or HZ diagnosis. The incidence of HZ is approximately 30%, with PHN occurring in about 12.5% of cases. Patients often describe PHN as burning, pricking, or otherworldly pain, which can persist for months or years, leading to psychiatric symptoms like depression and anxiety. Current treatments, including both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, are often limited in efficacy and accompanied by significant adverse effects. On the pharmaceutical front, pregabalin and gabapentin are the only FDA-approved first-line oral treatments for PHN, dizziness, and edema. On the non-pharmaceutical side, interventions such as nerve root injection and spinal cord electrical stimulation are widely used but suffer associated with significant limitations including suboptimal efficacy, complications, and high expense.

PHN imposes a substantial health economic burden globally, including in Italy, Sweden, China, Spain, and the U.S. Early prediction of PHN is crucial for implementing timely clinical interventions. A previous review summarized risk factors for PHN from 1950 to 2014 (such as old age, severe rashes, etc). However, given the dynamic nature of medical research and changes in population health over the past decade, an updated analysis is warranted. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis of literature from 2014 to 2024 to identify recent and emerging risk factors for PHN. We aim to provide clinicians with a contemporary evidence base to improve early prediction, facilitate timely intervention, and ultimately reduce the incidence and burden of PHN.

### Lidocaine plasters for postherpetic neuralgia? [^113JU3qM]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK, about 1 in 2,500 people experiences neuropathic pain that is still present 3–6 months after acute herpes zoster (shingles). This condition, known as postherpetic neuralgia, is the most common complication of herpes zoster and can be chronic, intractable and distressing. Treatments used in an attempt to reduce postherpetic neuralgia include tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline — an unlicensed indication), antiepileptics (e.g. gabapentin) and opioid analgesics, as well as topical treatments such as capsaicin. However, such treatments may only provide partial pain relief, and tolerability can be a problem, particularly in older patients. Versatis (Grunenthal Ltd), a topical preparation of lidocaine formulated in a plaster, has recently been licensed for treating patients with postherpetic neuralgia. Does it offer useful benefit?

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^115iUfkY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) is diagnosed clinically by recognition of the distinctive, painful vesicular rash appearing in a unilateral, dermatomal distribution. An estimated 1 million cases occur in the United States each year, and increasing age is the primary risk factor. Laboratory testing, including polymerase chain reaction, can confirm atypical cases. Treatment with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir decreases the duration of the rash. Adjunct medications, including opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, or corticosteroids, may relieve the pain associated with acute herpes zoster. There is conflicting evidence that antiviral therapy during the acute phase prevents postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia in the cutaneous nerve distribution may last from 30 days to more than six months after the lesions have healed. Evidence supports treating postherpetic neuralgia with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, long-acting opioids, or tramadol; moderate evidence supports the use of capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch as a second-line agent. Immunization to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is recommended for most adults 60 years and older.

### Is acupuncture an effective postherpetic neuralgia treatment? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112dhSb9]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

This systematic review includes eight prospective studies containing 498 patients. The meta-analysis showed that pain, the primary outcome, was lower in the acupuncture group than in the control group. Subgroup analysis of the different types showed that EA, fire needling, bloodletting and cupping each relieved more pain than the controls. When the sample size was greater than 60, the acupuncture group showed better relief (ie, VAS score) than the control group. However, there was no significance for sample sizes less than 60. Subgroup analysis showed that the sample size could have affected statistical heterogeneity.

Based on these results, less literature was included in the secondary outcome. In the HAMA outcome, acupuncture was shown to relieve anxiety. These results were significant with a high I² and a low P -value. Only one study was included for QOL, and in it, the acupuncture group had better QOL than the control group. No adverse reactions occurred in the acupuncture groups of the two studies that reported on them.

Interpreting the findings

It is believed that acute zoster infection in nerve damage results in persistent pain which is the main symptom of PHN. Depression and social communication disorder are also associated with pain in postherpetic neuralgia patients. The European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) recommends tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and gabapentin/pregabalin as first-line treatments for PHN. However, their side effects must be taken into consideration, particularly with elderly patients. China's guidelines for treatment of PHN recommend acupuncture because of its clinical effects. A search of the clinical trial registries showed that large-sample randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for PHN are lacking. Additionally, no rigorous systematic reviews were found either.

This review includes studies of acupuncture treatment for PHN. The meta-analysis shows that acupuncture can reduce pain intensity, relieve anxiety and improve QOL among PHN patients. In the acupuncture group, the incidence of adverse effects was lower than in the control group. These results are similar to those of existing published studies. The VZV Pain Study Group reported that acupuncture could play a role in relieving acute herpetic pain, and no serious treatment-related adverse events were observed in the study.

### NMRAL1 as a causal factor in postherpetic neuralgia: a proteome-wide mendelian randomization study [^114XXcnk]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most prevalent and debilitating complication of herpes zoster (HZ), defined by persistent pain lasting 90 days or more after the resolution of the rash. PHN disproportionately affects elderly individuals and those with compromised immune function, with pain regions often extending beyond the rash-affected area, commonly involving the unilateral chest or trigeminal nerve regions. The pain is heterogenous in nature, manifesting as burning, electric shock-like, stabbing, needle-like, or tearing sensations. Multiple pain modalities often coexist, with one type predominating. Epidemiological data reveal that approximately 13% of individuals aged 50 years or older with HZ develop PHN, with incidence rates increasing markedly with age. Notably, around 60% of HZ patients aged ≥ 60 years progress to PHN, with this proportion rising to as high as 75% in those aged ≥ 70 years.PHN is a chronic and refractory condition, characterized by severe, relapsing pain that significantly disrupts patients' sleep, mood, and social interactions, often leading to anxiety, depression, and, in extreme cases, suicide.

Despite the significant clinical impact of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), its underlying pathogenesis remains poorly understood, which complicates the identification of high-risk populations and the implementation of effective prevention strategies. Furthermore, no single treatment has been shown to consistently alleviate pain in all patients, and existing therapies are limited in their efficacy. Current treatment options include pharmacological interventions, minimally invasive procedures (such as nerve blocks and spinal cord stimulation), acupuncture, and psychotherapy. However, medications often exhibit limited efficacy and are associated with high relapse rates upon discontinuation. Minimally invasive procedures, such as pulsed radiofrequency treatments, typically require CT guidance, which not only increases costs and necessitates specialized equipment but also exposes patients to significant radiation. Additionally, spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal drug delivery carry risks of complications, including physical trauma, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and infection, and are less tolerable in elderly patients due to their invasive nature and cost. Selective nerve destruction, which involves surgical, chemical, or physical damage to affected nerves, results in irreversible nerve injury. Given the absence of effective, targeted therapies, the outcomes of current treatments remain suboptimal, leading to both poor patient outcomes and inefficient use of healthcare resources. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PHN is imperative for advancing its management and alleviating the considerable burden it imposes on patients and healthcare systems.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^115DaERZ]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice

Primary care is essential and frequently the front line in the diagnosis and treatment of PHN. Drug costs and insurance plans are an unfortunate reality in clinical practice, and are often major considerations and limiting factors in the management of PHN. Thus, because of cost, generic immediate-release gabapentin is often the first-choice medication. Unfortunately, the most effective dosage of 1,800 mg/day is frequently not attained, which may leave patients undertreated. This may occur because treatment is terminated if any adverse events occur, or because in their attempt to avoid such adverse events as dizziness and somnolence, practitioners are tentative in the titration regimen they use. Although in certain patients, significant reductions in pain can be achieved at immediate-release gabapentin dosages lower than 1,800 mg/day, regular evaluations are crucial to ensure these patients continue to receive an adequate therapeutic response with lower dosages over time.

With failure of generic immediate-release gabapentin, other formulations of gabapentin are usually considered (most insurance plans will cover gastroretentive gabapentin or pregabalin). At this point, the most optimal choice should be based not just on costs but also on the profile of adverse events and ease of titration. The lidocaine 5% patch may be used in combination with any gabapentinoid for better management of pain, although it is expensive. The lidocaine 5% patch seems a better choice than the capsaicin 8% patch, which is not only expensive but also painful and not practical, as its application takes several hours of medical providers' and patients' time. Patients who have failed attempts at treatment may be referred to a specialty pain practice, where the approach is often to retry medications at lower dosages to avoid adverse events, or to get patients to therapeutic dosages to evaluate whether they had a true therapeutic failure or an inadequate trial leading to unsuccessful treatment. However, only a small proportion of patients suffering from PHN consult specialty care, so many of them remain undertreated and dissatisfied with the treatment. Thus, the ideal therapeutic approach may be better utilization of available treatment options and careful evaluation of PHN management at the level of primary care.

### NGX-4010, a high-concentration capsaicin patch, for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: a randomised, double-blind study [^1171GZMy]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

The limitations of current treatments for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) have led to the investigation of localised, non-systemic alternatives. NGX-4010, a high-concentration (8%) capsaicin dermal patch, was developed to treat patients with neuropathic pain. We report the results of a randomised, double blind, 12-week study of the efficacy and safety of one application of NGX-4010 in patients with PHN.

Methods

In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group trial, 402 patients were randomly assigned to one 60-min application of NGX-4010 (640 microg/cm² [8% capsaicin]) or a low-concentration capsaicin control patch (3.2 microg/cm² [0.04% capsaicin]). Patients were aged 18–90 years, had had postherpetic neuralgia for at least 6 months, and had an average baseline numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) score of 3 to 9. The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change in NPRS score from baseline to weeks two to eight. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00115310.

Findings

Patients who were randomly assigned to NGX-4010 (n = 206) had a significantly greater reduction in pain during weeks two to eight than did patients who had the control patch (n = 196). The mean changes in NPRS score were -29.6%vs -19.9% (difference -9.7%, 95% CI -15.47 to -3.95; p = 0.001). 87 (42%) patients who received NGX-4010 and 63 (32%) controls had a 30% or greater reduction in mean NPRS score (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.37; p = 0.03). The patients who had NGX-4010 had significant improvements in pain during weeks two to 12 (mean change in NPRS score -29.9%vs -20.4%, difference -9.5, -15.39 to -3.61; p = 0.002). Transient blood pressure changes associated with changes in pain level were recorded on the day of treatment, and short-lasting erythema and pain at the site of application were common, self-limited, and generally mild to moderate in the NGX-4010 group and less frequent and severe in the controls.

Interpretation

One 60-min application of NGX-4010 provided rapid and sustained pain relief in patients with postherpetic neuralgia. No adverse events were associated with treatment except for local reactions at the site of application and those related to treatment-associated pain.

Primary Outcome

The primary outcome measure will be the weekly average change in ADPS from baseline (visit 2) to the end of treatment (visit 5). The participants evaluated the average degree of pain within the previous 24 hours in the daily diary using NRS, which is defined as ADPS. The NRS ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst imaginable pain) and is chosen to assess merely pain severity.

### Is the capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/ w) cutaneous patch an appropriate treatment option for older patients with peripheral neuropathic pain? [^116j8xTY]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Capsaicin 179 mg (8% weight per weight) cutaneous patch ("capsaicin patch") is a recommended topical treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP). In older patients, topical treatments may be preferred over systemic treatments, but data specific to the older population are scarce.

Methods

We conducted pooled analyses of multiple clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety of capsaicin patch in older patients. The analysis of efficacy included four randomized, double-blind, 12-week studies with similar trial design comparing a single treatment of capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch vs low-dose control patch in post-herpetic neuralgia. For the safety evaluation, data were pooled from 18 interventional studies in which capsaicin patch was used in PNP with varying etiologies.

Results

Capsaicin patch had similar analgesic efficacy in elderly (n = 582) and non-elderly patients (n = 545) in terms of change from baseline to 2–12 weeks in the 11-point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) score for average pain over the previous 24 hours. In both age groups, decrease in NPRS score was significantly greater with capsaicin patch vs control. Older patients treated with capsaicin patch were significantly more likely than those in the control group to achieve responder status (ie mean decrease in NPRS score from baseline to week 2–12 of at least 30% or ≥ 2 points): 36.1% vs 27.1% (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI] 1.52 [1.06, 2.18]; P = 0.0231) and 33.1% vs 20.9% (OR [95% CI] 1.90 [1.30, 2.78]; P = 0.0009) for active treatment vs control group, respectively. Similar proportions of non-elderly patients (n = 2,311) and elderly patients (n = 537) treated with capsaicin patch experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (81.6% and 78.1%, respectively) and serious TEAEs (8.2% and 7.2%), with application-site reactions the most common TEAEs in both groups.

Conclusion

The capsaicin patch was equally efficacious and well tolerated in older patients as in younger patients.

### NGX-4010, a high-concentration capsaicin patch, for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: a randomized, double-blind, controlled study with an open-label extension [^1132nwcf]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of NGX-4010, a high-concentration capsaicin dermal patch (capsaicin 640 microg/cm², 8%) in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

Methods

Patients were randomized to receive NGX-4010 or control patch in a 4-week, double-blind study. This was followed by an open-label extension phase (up to 48 weeks total) where patients could receive up to three additional treatments no sooner than 12 weeks after initial treatment. The primary efficacy variable was mean change from baseline in mean morning and evening numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) scores.

Results

During days 8–28 after the double-blind treatment, NGX-4010 patients had a mean change in NPRS scores from baseline of -32.7% compared with -4.4% for control patients (P = 0.003). Mean NPRS scores decreased from baseline during week 1 in both treatment groups, remained relatively stable through week 12 in NXG-4010 patients, but returned to near baseline during weeks 2–4 in controls. Mean change in NPRS scores from baseline during weeks 2–12 was -33.8% for NGX-4010 and +4.9% for control recipients. A similar decrease in NPRS scores from baseline was maintained with subsequent NGX-4010 treatments, regardless of the number of treatments received. Transient increases in application site pain were adequately managed with analgesics. No increases in application site reactions or adverse events were observed with repeated treatments. No patients discontinued the study due to an adverse event.

Conclusion

NGX-4010 is a promising topical treatment for PHN patients, which appears to be tolerable, generally safe, and effective.

### Use of gabapentin for postherpetic neuralgia: results of two randomized, placebo-controlled studies [^117TPu17]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which affects up to 70% of elderly persons with herpes zoster, can have debilitating effects, including physical and social disability and significant psychological distress. A variety of agents have been used, either singly or in combination, to control PHN, including topical and oral analgesics, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). However, PHN often proves refractory to these therapies.

Objective

This article reviews available data on the use of the newer AED gabapentin for the control of PHN.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was undertaken to identify all randomized, placebo-controlled trials on the use of gabapentin in PHN. The search terms were gabapentin and postherpetic neuralgia.

Results

The literature search identified 2 published studies of the efficacy of gabapentin in a total of 563 patients with PHN that had persisted for at least 3 months after the healing of herpes zoster rash. The studies employed multiple outcome measures, including visual analog and Likert scales for pain intensity, and quality-of-life and functional measures that included the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Profile of Mood States. At maximum target dosages of 1800 to 3600 mg/d, gabapentin produced significant reductions in mean daily pain scores compared with placebo on both visual analog(P < 0.001) and Likert scales (P < 0.01). Improvements were also seen on the SF-36 subscales for physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, and mental health(P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Gabapentin may provide benefits in terms of alleviation of pain and overall quality of life in patients with chronic PHN.

### Assessing the reporting quality in randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for postherpetic neuralgia using the CONSORT statement and STRICTA guidelines [^1163vN2K]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study revealed suboptimal reporting qualities for RCTs using acupuncture for PHN management. Most trials failed to mention crucial methodological data, registration information, the rationale behind the choice of acupuncture or comparable treatments, the acupuncturist qualification, and the treatment context. However, the findings indicated higher reporting quality in RCTs with funding sources or published after 2010. Therefore, more effort is needed for strict adherence to the CONSORT statement and STRICTA guidelines.

### Postherpetic neuralgia and recalcitrant cystic lesions following herpes zoster: a case report and review of treatment options [^113mUivY]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute herpes zoster lesions in most cases are self-limited except in older and immunocompromised patients, wherein the pain can cause significant suffering. Postherpetic neuralgia is a painful situation for patients that can compromise the quality of life. Here, we report a 30-year-old healthy young man who developed treatment-resistant postherpetic neuralgia after herpes zoster (fourth/fifth thoracic segment) without any underlying immunocompromised state. He also developed some cystic lesions, which were removed by aspiration and surgery. The skin lesions improved 2weeks after the surgery and postherpetic neuralgia was completely cured after 5 months, however cystic lesions recurred multiple times and were excised completely during each visit. Postherpetic neuralgia has a significant impact on the health-care cost borne by the society and affected individual, hence, it is essential to select appropriate treatment to manage the pain of postherpetic neuralgia.

### Is the capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/ w) cutaneous patch an appropriate treatment option for older patients with peripheral neuropathic pain? [^116awHsS]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Capsaicin 179 mg (8% weight per weight) cutaneous patch ("capsaicin patch") is a recommended topical treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP). In older patients, topical treatments may be preferred over systemic treatments, but data specific to the older population are scarce.

Methods

We conducted pooled analyses of multiple clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety of capsaicin patch in older patients. The analysis of efficacy included four randomized, double-blind, 12-week studies with similar trial design comparing a single treatment of capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch vs low-dose control patch in post-herpetic neuralgia. For the safety evaluation, data were pooled from 18 interventional studies in which capsaicin patch was used in PNP with varying etiologies.

Results

Capsaicin patch had similar analgesic efficacy in elderly (n = 582) and non-elderly patients (n = 545) in terms of change from baseline to 2–12 weeks in the 11-point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) score for average pain over the previous 24 hours. In both age groups, decrease in NPRS score was significantly greater with capsaicin patch vs control.

Similar proportions of non-elderly patients (n = 2,311) and elderly patients (n = 537) treated with capsaicin patch experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (81.6% and 78.1%, respectively) and serious TEAEs (8.2% and 7.2%), with application-site reactions the most common TEAEs in both groups.

Conclusion

The capsaicin patch was equally efficacious and well tolerated in older patients as in younger patients.

### Gabapentin (gaba 300-EZS) [^116myF36]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

14.1 Postherpetic Neuralgia

Gabapentin was evaluated for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of a total of 563 patients with pain for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash (Table 6).

Each study included a 7- or 8-week double-blind phase (3 or 4 weeks of titration and 4 weeks of fixed dose). Patients initiated treatment with titration to a maximum of 900 mg/day gabapentin over 3 days. Dosages were then to be titrated in 600 to 1,200 mg/day increments at 3- to 7-day intervals to the target dose over 3 to 4 weeks. Patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). A mean pain score during baseline of at least 4 was required for randomization. Analyses were conducted using the ITT population (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication).

Both studies demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo at all doses tested.

The reduction in weekly mean pain scores was seen by Week 1 in both studies, and were maintained to the end of treatment. Comparable treatment effects were observed in all active treatment arms. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling provided confirmatory evidence of efficacy across all doses. Figures 1 and 2 show pain intensity scores over time for Studies 1 and 2.

The proportion of responders (those patients reporting at least 50% improvement in endpoint pain score compared to baseline) was calculated for each study (Figure 3).

### Expert consensus on ion channel drugs for chronic pain treatment in China [^117MNYKF]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Ion Channel Drugs in the Treatment of Chronic Pain Diseases

Chronic Neuropathic Pain

Postherpetic Neuralgia

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common type of neuropathic pain, defined as pain lasting ≥ 1 month after Herpes Zoster (HZ) onset or healing, and is the most common complication of HZ. Meta-analysis data show that the annual incidence of PHN in the population ranges from 3.9 to 42.0/100,000, with PHN occurring in 9–34% of patients with HZ. At present, it is believed that peripheral sensitization and central sensitization are important mechanisms of PHN, and the up-regulation of voltage-gated calcium channel α2-δ subunit and sodium channel is the main reason for central sensitization. Therefore, ion-channel drugs can be used as treatment options for patients with PHN. Compared with oral administration, topical administration can directly act on the target with better tolerance and compliance and fewer adverse gastrointestinal tract reactions. The therapeutic status of ion channel drugs (gabapentin, pregabalin, and lidocaine plaster) in PHN has been clarified by the expert consensus.

### Price of pain: population-based cohort burden of disease analysis of medication cost of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^1174oWbk]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Concerns have been raised about the use of opioids in noncancer pain. These include the risk of dependency, the development of tolerance, and the potential for abuse, and are part of the rationale for listing opioids as second-line PHN treatment options. However, opioids were used frequently to treat HZ–PHN episodes (Figure 2). While the high rate of use may be concerning, the median of duration of opioid treatment (Figure 3) reveals generally short-term use, possibly reflecting appropriate opioid stewardship.

### Pharmacologic management part 1: better-studied neuropathic pain diseases [^114Mgqoe]. Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain impacts millions of people in the United States and around the world. Patients experience one of many symptoms, such as pain, paresthesia, dysesthesia, hyperalgesia, and allodynia, for many years because of unavailable or inadequate treatment. One of the major challenges in treating patients with neuropathic pain syndromes is a lack of consensus concerning the appropriate first-line treatment options for conditions associated with neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and trigeminal neuralgia. This review summarizes the published results of randomized trials involving treatment for neuropathic pain conditions. Anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, and tricyclic antidepressants, including amitriptyline and desipramine, have demonstrated efficacy in relieving pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and trigeminal neuralgia, in several studies. However, the lack of head-to-head comparison studies of these agents limits the conclusions that can be reached. Clinicians who must make decisions regarding the care of individual patients may find some guidance from the number of randomized trials with a positive outcome for each agent. Using quality-of-life study outcomes, treatment strategies must encompass the impact of therapeutic agents on the comorbid conditions of sleep disturbance and mood and anxiety disorders associated with neuropathic pain. Looking to the future, emerging therapies, such as pregabalin and newer N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor blockers, may provide physicians and patients with new treatment options for more effective relief of pain.

### Bee stings – a remedy for postherpetic neuralgia? A case report [^115NDpPo]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This case report describes the effects of bee stings on painful postherpetic neuralgia in a 51-year-old man.

Case Report

The patient was stung by 3 bees in the distribution in which he had been experiencing postherpetic neuralgia. One day after the bee stings, the patient's painful postherpetic neuralgia was completely relieved, and the relief lasted for 1 and a half months. Subsequently, the patient's pain returned, but at significantly less intensity and frequency than what he had experienced prior to the bee stings.

Conclusions

Bee venom and bee sting therapy have been shown to have both antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties, which may explain why the bee stings relieved the patient's postherpetic neuralgia. Bee sting or bee venom therapy should be further investigated as a potential treatment modality for postherpetic neuralgia.

### Neuromodulation in postherpetic neuralgia: case reports and review of the literature [^113sAf6L]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is common in the United States. Current treatment options for PHN are fairly limited. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) are considered mostly experimental and still rarely performed in patients with PHN.

Design

Two case reports and a review of the literature.

Setting

Tertiary academic medical center.

Methods

1) Pubmed, Ovid, and EBMR databases were searched for all reports that had the following key words: postherpetic neuralgia, spinal cord stimulation, and peripheral nerve stimulation. 2) A retrospective chart review was performed for all the patients that underwent PNS for PHN at Mayo Clinic Florida (MCF).

Results

There were 20 original reports that described 309 patients with PHN who were treated with SCS. Sixteen reports had a permanent implantation of SCS, with a total of 255 patients, out of which 120 had long-term pain relief. There were six reports of subcutaneous PNS for PHN (in a thoracic area). Four reports provided data on success rates where all five patients received complete pain relief. In our practice, two patients underwent subcutaneous PNS for PHN (in the thoracic area) with good pain relief for 10months and 2.5years, respectively.

Conclusions

Based on our review of the literature and the two cases at MCF, subcutaneous PNS seems to be a promising intervention in the treatment of PHN.

### Post-herpetic neuralgia case study: optimizing pain control [^115fcDkr]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic pain syndrome associated with the reactivation of a primary infection with varicella zoster virus (chicken pox), which leads to a chronic infection of the dorsal root ganglia. Under various clinical circumstances, including immunosuppressive diseases or treatments and certain cancers, reactivation of the infection can occur in adults as shingles. Other factors such as psychological distress and stressful life events also appear to play a role in the onset of shingles and the development of PHN. The most common risk factor for shingles and its potential sequela, PHN, is advanced age. For a significant number of patients, the pain following healing of shingles can persist for months to years; this pain is classified as PHN if it persists longer than 3 months. PHN often leads to depression, disrupted sleep, decreased functioning and increased healthcare utilization. Prompt use of antiviral therapy appears to reduce the period of pain following an episode of shingles by about half and may possibly reduce the overall incidence of PHN. Damage to a variety of neurologic pathways as a result of herpes zoster reactivation suggests that intervention with multiple agents having divergent mechanisms of action is an appropriate treatment approach. Current treatment options aimed at relieving the symptoms of PHN include antidepressants, opioids, anticonvulsants and topical analgesics. It is important for the clinician to establish a baseline pain intensity and character as well as quality of life measures against which to judge the effectiveness of any treatment. This review article features a case study of a patient with PHN to illustrate current diagnostic and treatment approaches.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^112dKczR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) after gabapentin — pregabalin option: "If patients have an inadequate response to gabapentin for post-herpetic neuralgia, clinicians might consider a trial of pregabalin". Evidence includes that "In 2 parallel-group placebo-controlled trials of pregabalin for HIV-negative persons with PHN, pregabalin was found to be superior over placebo", although "1 of these studies excluded patients who had failed to respond to previous treatment for PHN with gabapentin at doses ≥ 1200 mg/day".

### Efficacy and safety of crisugabalin (HSK16149) in adults with postherpetic neuralgia: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^11631ibe]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

The study HSK16149 (high-dose) was published by Daying Zhang and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Dermatol. This study is related to the following diseases: Postherpetic neuralgia. In the HSK16149 (high-dose) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of crisugabalin in patients with postherpetic neuralgia? In the HSK16149 (high-dose) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the HSK16149 (high-dose) study, the population was: 245 patients (115 female, 130 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with postherpetic neuralgia. The key exclusion criteria were peripheral neuropathy or pain unrelated to postherpetic neuralgia or any other conditions that could confound assessment; previous use of pregabalin ≥ 300 mg daily or gabapentin ≥ 1,200 mg daily with lack of effect; uncontrolled diabetes; history of substance or alcohol abuse; any active infections. In the HSK16149 (high-dose) study, the interventions were: n = 121 crisugabalin (at a dose of 40 mg BID for 12 weeks) n = 124 placebo (matching placebo BID for 12 weeks). In the HSK16149 (high-dose) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in least squares mean average daily pain score at week 12 (2.6 points vs. 1.1 points; MD 1.5, 95% CI 1 to 2). In the HSK16149 (high-dose) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving at least 30% reduction in average daily pain score at week 12 (54.5% vs. 35.5%; OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.58 to 5.44) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving at least 50% reduction in average daily pain score at week 12 (38% vs. 20.2%; OR 3.84, 95% CI 1.88 to 7.87) Significant increase in reduction in least squares mean Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire Present Pain Intensity scores at week 12 (1.2 points vs. 0.5 points; MD 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.9). In the HSK16149 (high-dose) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious treatment-emergent adverse events. In the HSK16149 (high-dose) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with postherpetic neuralgia, crisugabalin was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in least squares mean average daily pain score at week 12.

14.2 Postherpetic Neuralgia

The efficacy of pregabalin for the management of postherpetic neuralgia was established in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. These studies enrolled patients with neuralgia persisting for at least 3 months following healing of herpes zoster rash and a minimum baseline score of greater than or equal to 4 on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Seventy-three percent of patients completed the studies. The baseline mean pain scores across the 3 studies ranged from 6 to 7. Patients were permitted up to 4 grams of acetaminophen per day as needed for pain, in addition to pregabalin. Patients recorded their pain daily in a diary.

Study PHN 1: This 13-week study compared pregabalin 75, 150, and 300 mg twice daily with placebo. Patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) between 30 to 60 mL/min were randomized to 75 mg, 150 mg, or placebo twice daily. Patients with creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min were randomized to 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg or placebo twice daily. In patients with creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min treatment with all doses of pregabalin statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain score and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain score from baseline. Despite differences in dosing based on renal function, patients with creatinine clearance between 30 to 60 mL/min tolerated pregabalin less well than patients with creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min as evidenced by higher rates of discontinuation due to adverse reactions. For various levels of improvement in pain intensity from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 3 shows the fraction of patients achieving that level of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as Week 1, which persisted throughout the study.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^116JJCSf]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

6. Conclusions

Neuropathic pain is a term used for a group of conditions with a wide range of causes and different pain distributions. However, all these conditions are characterized by a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system peripherally or centrally. The grading system represents a tool to determine the level of certainty that the pain in an individual is neuropathic in nature. Such grading is naturally based on clinical judgment. Therefore, it relies heavily on the experience, skills, and resources available for assessment.

We anticipate that the rephrasing and reordering of the 4 criteria of the grading system will facilitate its use by both neurologists and non-neurologists. The level "probable" should usually be sufficient to initiate treatment according to neuropathic pain guidelines. The level "definite" is useful in specialist contexts and when a causal treatment of the underlying lesion or disease is an option. In some cases, sensory signs in the painful area may be difficult to demonstrate, although the nature of the lesion or disease is confirmed (eg, trigeminal neuralgia, channelopathies, postherpetic neuralgia); for these cases, the level "probable" continues to be appropriate if a diagnostic test confirms the lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system.

This paper includes an update of the grading system published in 2008. The goal of this update is to provide a revised grading system that is clinically useful, internally consistent, and allows appropriate treatment decisions in the face of uncertainty. We anticipate that the revised grading system will be incorporated into the "content model" of neuropathic pain in the upcoming 11th version of the International Classification of Diseases. We have also identified a range of important research topics that will further improve the classification and grading of neuropathic pain in the future.

### Pregabalin for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^111HecY8]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

Methods

The authors conducted a multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week, randomized clinical trial in PHN, defined as pain for 3 or more months following herpes zoster rash healing. Patients (n = 173) were randomized to treatment with pregabalin or placebo. Patients randomized to pregabalin received either 600 mg/day (creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min) or 300 mg/day (creatinine clearance 30 to 60 mL/min). The primary efficacy measure was the mean of the last seven daily pain ratings. Secondary endpoints included additional pain ratings, sleep interference, quality of life, mood, and patient and clinician ratings of global improvement.

Results

Pregabalin-treated patients had greater decreases in pain than patients treated with placebo (endpoint mean scores 3.60 vs 5.29, p = 0.0001). Pain was significantly reduced in the pregabalin-treated patients after the first full day of treatment and throughout the study, and significant improvement on the McGill Pain Questionnaire total, sensory, and affective pain scores was also found. The proportions of patients with ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% decreases in mean pain scores were greater in the pregabalin than in the placebo group (63% vs 25% and 50% vs 20%, p = 0.001). Sleep also improved in patients treated with pregabalin compared to placebo (p = 0.0001). Both patients and clinicians were more likely to report global improvement with pregabalin than placebo (p = 0.001). Given the maximal dosage studied, pregabalin had acceptable tolerability compared to placebo despite a greater incidence of side effects, which were generally mild to moderate in intensity.

Conclusions

Treatment of PHN with pregabalin is safe, efficacious in relieving pain and sleep interference, and associated with greater global improvement than treatment with placebo.

### Post-herpetic neuralgia: a review of advances in treatment and prevention [^1145mmBU]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is primarily a disease of the elderly and often refractory to treatment. Randomized and controlled trials have yielded several significant advances in the treatment and prevention of this disease. Treatment advances include the lidocaine patch, opioid analgesics, nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and gabapentin. However, no treatment regimen fully eliminates the pain. Improvements in prevention include prompt recognition and treatment of high-risk herpes zoster (HZ) patients with antiviral and analgesic therapies. Even with these advances, PHN remains a debilitating and painful disease. Vaccines offer the greatest promise of relief. The childhood vaccine against varicella zoster virus offers long-lasting immunity, largely preventing HZ and PHN. But most adults have already had varicella and are at risk for HZ and PHN as they age. Therefore, a more potent vaccine against varicella has been developed for use in adults. This vaccine offers a new and significant advance in the prevention of HZ and its most noteworthy complication, PHN.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^1155go63]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of HZ

Although still controversial, early treatment of HZ with antiviral agents may decrease the risk of developing or duration of PHN. Three antiviral agents are approved in the US for the treatment of HZ: acyclovir (Zovirax®; GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK), famciclovir (Famvir®; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA), and valacyclovir (Valtrex®; GlaxoSmithKline).–To limit the amount of viral replication and reduce the duration of the HZ rash, antivirals should be administered within 72 hours of rash onset. They may be beneficial as long as new lesions are actively being formed, which is important to note, since in clinical practice the diagnosis of HZ is rarely made within 72 hours. However, the safety and efficacy of antivirals in treating HZ or preventing PHN more than 72 hours after rash onset have not been established.–

Antivirals alone are not sufficient to relieve the acute pain associated with HZ. Mild-to-moderate pain can be controlled with a short-acting opioid with acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, and gabapentinoids, followed by a TCA, can be added for more severe acute pain. Furthermore, the combination of gabapentin and valacyclovir administered acutely in patients with HZ may reduce the incidence of PHN. Although not recommended routinely for treatment of HZ and most likely ineffective in preventing PHN, corticosteroids are often considered in clinical practice for HZ patients with limited contraindications.

Introduction

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is one of the intractable chronic pain syndromes, characterized by persistent pain for more than one month after the resolution of the herpes zoster rash. Patients with PHN experience several types of pain: persistent pain without a stimulus (often described as burning, aching, throbbing), intermittent pain without a stimulus (often described as stabbing, shooting, or electric shock-like), and pain caused by a stimulus but is disproportionate to the stimulus. In addition, it affects the quality of life by causing abnormal sensations (dysesthesias or paresthesias), depression, insomnia, and anorexia.

Clinical guidelines for the management of PHN recommended tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), gabapentin, pregabalin, and topical lidocaine 5% patch as first-line therapies for patients with PHN. Although effective, TCAs have been associated with anticholinergic adverse events or cardiotoxicity, and calcium channels α2-δ ligands such as gabapentin and pregabalin have risks of dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, weight gain, asthenia, dry mouth, and vertigo. In addition, topical lidocaine 5% patch may increase the incidence of adverse effects, such as blisters, bruising, burning sensation, dermatitis on the application site, confusion, disorientation, headache, and nervousness.

### EFNS guidelines on pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain [^115Qk8L2]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain treatment remains unsatisfactory despite a substantial increase in the number of trials. This EFNS Task Force aimed at evaluating the existing evidence about the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain. Studies were identified using first the Cochrane Database then Medline. Trials were classified according to the aetiological condition. All class I and II controlled trials (according to EFNS classification of evidence) were assessed, but lower-class studies were considered in conditions that had no top level studies. Only treatments feasible in an outpatient setting were evaluated. Effects on pain symptoms/signs, quality of life and comorbidities were particularly searched for. Most of the randomized controlled trials included patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and painful polyneuropathies (PPN) mainly caused by diabetes. These trials provide level A evidence for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin and opioids, with a large number of class I trials, followed by topical lidocaine (in PHN) and the newer antidepressants venlafaxine and duloxetine (in PPN). A small number of controlled trials were performed in central pain, trigeminal neuralgia, other peripheral neuropathic pain states and multiple-aetiology neuropathic pains. The main peripheral pain conditions respond similarly well to tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and pregabalin, but some conditions, such as HIV-associated polyneuropathy, are more refractory. There are too few studies on central pain, combination therapy, and head-to-head comparison. For future trials, we recommend to assess quality of life and pain symptoms or signs with standardized tools.

### Pregabalin for neuropathic pain in adults [^111dyx2h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane Review titled "Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults", and considers only neuropathic pain (pain from damage to nervous tissue). Antiepileptic drugs have long been used in pain management. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug used in management of chronic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2009 to April 2018, online clinical trials registries, and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and biases. Primary outcomes were: at least 30% pain intensity reduction over baseline; much or very much improved on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale (moderate benefit); at least 50% pain intensity reduction; or very much improved on PGIC (substantial benefit). We calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 45 studies lasting 2 to 16 weeks, with 11,906 participants - 68% from 31 new studies. Oral pregabalin doses of 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg daily were compared with placebo. Postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and mixed neuropathic pain predominated (85% of participants). High risk of bias was due mainly to small study size (nine studies), but many studies had unclear risk of bias, mainly due to incomplete outcome data, size, and allocation concealment. Postherpetic neuralgia: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (50% vs 25%; RR 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6 to 2.6); NNTB 3.9 (3.0 to 5.6); 3 studies, 589 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (32% vs 13%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.4); NNTB 5.3 (3.9 to 8.1); 4 studies, 713 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (62% vs 24%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.2); NNTB 2.7 (2.2 to 3.7); 3 studies, 537 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 15%; RR 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.5); NNTB 3.9 (3.1 to 5.5); 4 studies, 732 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 16% versus 5.5%, 600 mg 25% versus 5.8%; dizziness 300 mg 29% versus 8.1%, 600 mg 35% versus 8.8%. Painful diabetic neuropathy: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (47% vs 42%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.2); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 8 studies, 2320 participants, moderate-quality evidence), more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (31% vs 24%; RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 11 studies, 2931 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had PGIC much or very much improved (51% vs 30%; RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0); NNTB 4.9 (3.8 to 6.9); 5 studies, 1050 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (63% vs 52%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.4); NNTB 9.6 (5.5 to 41); 2 studies, 611 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 28%; RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.7); NNTB 7.8 (5.4 to 14); 5 studies, 1015 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 11% versus 3.1%, 600 mg 15% versus 4.5%; dizziness 300 mg 13% versus 3.8%, 600 mg 22% versus 4.4%. Mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (48% vs 36%; RR 1.2 (1.1 to 1.4); NNTB 8.2 (5.7 to 15); 4 studies, 1367 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (34% vs 20%; RR 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9); NNTB 7.2 (5.4 to 11); 4 studies, 1367 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence (12% vs 3.9%) and dizziness (23% vs 6.2%) were more common with pregabalin. Central neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (44% vs 28%; RR 1.6 (1.3 to 2.0); NNTB 5.9 (4.1 to 11); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence) and at least 50% pain intensity reduction (26% vs 15%; RR 1.7 (1.2 to 2.3); NNTB 9.8 (6.0 to 28); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence (32% vs 11%) and dizziness (23% vs 8.6%) were more common with pregabalin. Other neuropathic pain conditions: Studies show no evidence of benefit for 600 mg pregabalin in HIV neuropathy (2 studies, 674 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and limited evidence of benefit in neuropathic back pain or sciatica, neuropathic cancer pain, or polyneuropathy. Serious adverse events, all conditions: Serious adverse events were no more common with placebo than with pregabalin 300 mg (3.1% vs 2.6%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 17 studies, 4112 participants, high-quality evidence) or pregabalin 600 mg (3.4% vs 3.4%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.5); 16 studies, 3995 participants, high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence shows efficacy of pregabalin in postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuralgia, and mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain, and absence of efficacy in HIV neuropathy; evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain is inadequate. Some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment. There were no substantial changes since the 2009 review.

### Successful use of topiramate in a patient with severe postherpetic neuralgia [^112BMhR6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the case of a patient with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) who had a marked response to topiramate despite failure of several previous therapies.

Case Summary

A 79-year-old white male with multiple medical comorbidities developed severe trigeminal territory PHN requiring treatment with opiates to maintain adequate pain relief. Topiramate was initiated after the patient failed treatment with 4 other antiepileptic medications due to various adverse events. After 3 months of topiramate therapy, with dosages up to 50 mg twice daily, PHN pain had decreased to the point that the patient was able to discontinue the use of opiates entirely. At time of writing, he continued to be maintained on topiramate 50 mg twice daily with good pain relief and no reported adverse effects.

Discussion

Topiramate exhibits a number of actions that may contribute to the relief of neuropathic pain, including modulation of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid inhibition, and blockade of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)/kainite glutamate receptors. Current evidence-based recommendations consider topiramate to be a third-line agent for the treatment of neuropathic pain based on studies of its use in painful diabetic neuropathy and chronic lumbar radicular pain. A comprehensive search of MEDLINE (1950-August 2008) using the terms postherpetic neuralgia, neuralgia, and topiramate revealed only one previously published case report evaluating the use of topiramate specifically for treatment of PHN.

Conclusions

While it is impossible to determine whether pain relief in this case was due to treatment with topiramate as opposed to spontaneous resolution of pain over time, this additional case report suggests that topiramate may be a useful treatment option for patients with PHN who have not responded to or are intolerant of other interventions. Further studies are needed to determine whether topiramate should receive a stronger recommendation for the treatment of PHN.

### A cost-effectiveness comparison of desipramine, gabapentin, and pregabalin for treating postherpetic neuralgia [^113xRfar]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the net health effects and costs resulting from treatment with different first-line postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) medications.

Design

Cost-utility analysis using published literature.

Participants

Hypothetical cohort of patients aged 60 to 80 with PHN.

Interventions

Desipramine 100 mg/d, gabapentin 1,800 mg/d, and pregabalin 450 mg/d.

Measurements

A decision model was designed to describe possible treatment outcomes, including different combinations of analgesia and side effects, during the first 3 months of therapy for moderate to severe PHN. The main outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Costs were estimated using the perspective of a third-party payer. Multivariate, univariate, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, and the time frame of the model was varied to 1-month and 6-month horizons.

Results

Desipramine was more effective and less expensive than gabapentin or pregabalin (dominant) under all conditions tested. Gabapentin was more effective than pregabalin but at an incremental cost of $216,000/QALY. Below $140/month, gabapentin became more cost-effective than pregabalin at a threshold of $50,000/QALY, and below $115/month gabapentin dominated pregabalin.

Conclusion

Desipramine appears to be more effective and less expensive than gabapentin or pregabalin for the treatment of older patients with PHN in whom it is not contraindicated. After its price falls, generic gabapentin will likely be more cost-effective than pregabalin.

For this update we searched CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2014 to January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trials registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing gabapentin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)), or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC). We performed a pooled analysis for any substantial or moderate benefit. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included four new studies (530 participants), and excluded three previously included studies (126 participants). In all, 37 studies provided information on 5914 participants. Most studies used oral gabapentin or gabapentin encarbil at doses of 1200 mg or more daily in different neuropathic pain conditions, predominantly postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy. Study duration was typically four to 12 weeks. Not all studies reported important outcomes of interest. High risk of bias occurred mainly due to small size (especially in cross-over studies), and handling of data after study withdrawal. In postherpetic neuralgia, more participants (32%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (17%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1); NNT 6.7 (5.4 to 8.7); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (46%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (25%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.0); NNT 4.8 (4.1 to 6.0); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence). In painful diabetic neuropathy, more participants (38%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (21%) (RR 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.3); NNT 5.9 (4.6 to 8.3); 6 studies, 1277 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (52%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (37%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.6); NNT 6.6 (4.9 to 9.9); 7 studies, 1439 participants, moderate-quality evidence). For all conditions combined, adverse event withdrawals were more common with gabapentin (11%) than with placebo (8.2%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.7); NNH 30 (20 to 65); 22 studies, 4346 participants, high-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were no more common with gabapentin (3.2%) than with placebo (2.8%) (RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 19 studies, 3948 participants, moderate-quality evidence); there were eight deaths (very low-quality evidence). Participants experiencing at least one adverse event were more common with gabapentin (63%) than with placebo (49%) (RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.4); NNH 7.5 (6.1 to 9.6); 18 studies, 4279 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Individual adverse events occurred significantly more often with gabapentin. Participants taking gabapentin experienced dizziness (19%), somnolence (14%), peripheral oedema (7%), and gait disturbance (14%).

Authors' Conclusions

Gabapentin at doses of 1800 mg to 3600 mg daily (1200 mg to 3600 mg gabapentin encarbil) can provide good levels of pain relief to some people with postherpetic neuralgia and peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Evidence for other types of neuropathic pain is very limited. The outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction is regarded as a useful outcome of treatment by patients, and the achievement of this degree of pain relief is associated with important beneficial effects on sleep interference, fatigue, and depression, as well as quality of life, function, and work. Around 3 or 4 out of 10 participants achieved this degree of pain relief with gabapentin, compared with 1 or 2 out of 10 for placebo. Over half of those treated with gabapentin will not have worthwhile pain relief but may experience adverse events. Conclusions have not changed since the previous update of this review.

### Opioids versus antidepressants in postherpetic neuralgia: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113eHoQT]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) provide less than satisfactory pain relief for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and the role of opioids is controversial.

Objective

To compare the analgesic and cognitive effects of opioids with those of TCA and placebo in the treatment of PHN.

Methods

Seventy-six patients with PHN were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Each subject was scheduled to undergo three treatment periods (opioid, TCA, and placebo), approximately 8 weeks' duration each. Doses were titrated to maximal relief or intolerable side effects. The primary outcome measures were pain intensity (0 to 10 scale), pain relief (0 to 100%), and cognitive function. Analyses included patients who provided any pain ratings after having received at least a single dose of a study medication.

Results

Fifty patients completed two periods, and 44 patients completed all three. Mean daily maintenance doses were morphine 91 mg or methadone 15 mg and nortriptyline 89 mg or desipramine 63 mg. Opioids and TCA reduced pain (1.9 and 1.4) more than placebo (0.2; p < 0.001), with no appreciable effect on any cognitive measure. The trend favoring opioids over TCA fell short of significance (p = 0.06), and reduction in pain with opioids did not correlate with that following TCA. Treatment with opioids and TCA resulted in greater pain relief (38 and 32%) compared with placebo (11%; p < 0.001). More patients completing all three treatments preferred opioids (54%) than TCA (30%; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Opioids effectively treat PHN without impairing cognition. Opioids and TCA act via independent mechanisms and with varied individual effect.

### Management of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia now and in the future [^113FJTFL]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) — a reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) — can cause significant morbidity. Its major complication is pain, particularly post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). We will review the current management strategies available for the treatment of both acute HZ and PHN, including antiviral drugs, analgesic agents, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants and topical therapies. New molecules in development that show improved activity against VZV are also covered, and new drug targets are outlined. The role of translational neuroscience in moving towards a goal of finding disease-modifying treatments will be examined.

### Evidence-based case report: the prevention and management of postherpetic neuralgia with emphasis on interventional procedures [^113NsH3G]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

A patient with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) did not respond to medications, either singly or in combination, or to intrathecal methylprednisolone but responded to intrathecal alcohol. This evidenced-based case management article evaluates and grades the evidence for the prevention and treatment of PHN.

Methods

A search of published English-language studies on the prevention and treatment of PHN was made.

Results

Randomized clinical studies showed the efficacy of antiviral agents in the prevention of PHN and the use of anticonvulsants, antidepressants, opioids, and Lidoderm patch in the treatment of PHN (level A evidence). The role of epidural local anesthetic and steroid injections in preventing PHN has not been completely established (level B evidence). Intrathecal steroid injections and topical capsaicin may be effective in PHN (level B evidence). No randomized controlled study supports the usefulness of spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal alcohol.

Conclusions

Postherpetic neuralgia should be managed pharmacologically. If not effective, intrathecal steroid injections or nerve blocks may be tried. Spinal cord stimulation or intrathecal alcohol should be used only as a last resort.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^1144oXgQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Topical therapies

Two FDA-approved topical therapies are available for PHN treatment: the lidocaine 5% patch (Lidoderm®; Endo, Chadds Ford, PA, USA)as a first-line therapy, and the capsaicin 8% patch (Qutenza®; Acorda Therapeutics, Ardsley, NY, USA)as a second-line therapy (Figure 2). The lidocaine 5% patch provides modest pain relief for some patients in comparison to oral therapies, but it has a favorable safety and tolerability profile (Table 1). The capsaicin 8% patch has shown only minimal analgesic efficacy in patients with PHN. Initial pain during treatment with the capsaicin patch is a significant problem, and topical anesthetic is recommended before application. Also, the capsaicin 8% patch needs to be administered by or under close supervision of a medical provider or trained personnel, as capsaicin is a highly irritant material.

Therapies not approved by the FDA

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^115Fk4sD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) — scope of evidence identified in prior systematic review. Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complication of acute herpes zoster infection that can occur in people with HIV, is distinct from painful distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathies associated with HIV. A 2005 systematic review of analgesic therapies for adults with more than 3 months of PHN and unspecified HIV status identified 31 placebo-controlled RCTs from 62 studies that were included in a metaanalysis.

### Assessing the reporting quality in randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for postherpetic neuralgia using the CONSORT statement and STRICTA guidelines [^114THZg4]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is one of the most common complications of herpes zoster. It is defined as neuropathic pain persisting for 90–120 days after the acute phase of VZV reactivation. It is estimated that 10–15% of patients who have shingles will experience PHN. However, the incidence of PHN could be as high as 83% among over 50 years old patients.PHN has been considered a health care problem due to its severity, chronicity, and the resulting poor quality of life. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are recommended as first-line treatments for PHN. However, a high incidence of adverse events such as dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, and ataxia remains refractory. Most importantly, the effectiveness of pharmacologic therapies remains limited, with satisfactory analgesia in only 50% of patients.

Owing to the significant health risks of PHN and the limitations of currently available conventional therapies, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), due to their significant analgesic effects, have received much attention worldwide.

As a widely-used CAM, acupuncture is generally considered to be safe and effective in different chronic pain conditions. Recent years have seen many clinical trials reporting the effects of acupuncture in PHN management. Among these clinical trials, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered to have the optimal study design. A meta-analysis of these RCTs reported that acupuncture is a safe and effective procedure for the management of PHN. However, inappropriate study methodology with incomplete reporting is the Achilles' heel of those RCTs, and significantly affect their reliability and validity.

The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, developed in 2001 and revised in 2010, provides guidelines for the identification of biased results and improvement of trial reporting. Its purpose is to facilitate the assessment and interpretation of RCTs. While as the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) guidelines, drafted in 2001 and revised in 2010, serve as an extension of the CONSORT statement. The combination of these two sets of guidelines has been used worldwide to assess the completeness as well as the transparency of RCTs for reporting acupuncture interventions.–

### Combination treatment of neuropathic pain: Danish expert recommendations based on a Delphi process [^111umiFu]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neuropathic pain (NeP) is triggered by a lesion or a disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system that alters its structure and function, so that pain occurs spontaneously and responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli are pathologically amplified. Peripheral causes of NeP are for example, polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, postoperative pain, and posttraumatic neuralgia, while causes of central NeP are spinal cord injuries, stroke, and so on. The current Danish treatment algorithms–are founded on the evidence-based recommendations provided by the international pain societies. The European guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of NeP issued by the European Federation of Neurological Societies recommend tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), gabapentin, and pregabalin as first-line treatment for the most common NeP conditions, including diabetic neuropathy where serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are also recommended. Finnerup et al, recently revised the worldwide applied NeP pharmacotherapy recommendations from the Special Interest Group on neuropathic pain concluding that there was a strong Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) recommendation for use and proposal as first-line treatment for TCA, SNRI, pregabalin, and gabapentin.

Combination therapy, that is, the combination of different pharmacological treatments, has not been a part of guidelines until recently. The combination of pregabalin or gabapentin with either TCAs or SNRIs is now mentioned as a treatment option if a patient cannot tolerate high-dose monotherapy. The idea of combination therapy using two drugs with different mechanisms of action is of great interest, as it is widely acknowledged that many patients have insufficient pain relief on monotherapy with the currently used drugs. Furthermore, the drugs used for treatment of NeP have severe dose-dependent side effects and tolerability issues, that often lead to discontinuation of high-dose monotherapies. Other fields of medicine apply combination therapy so as to avoid high-dose monotherapy such as for example, treatment of hypertension or diabetes. In a similar fashion, pain medicine could benefit from using lower dose combination therapies with different mechanisms of action. An example could be a moderate dose of a drug reducing calcium influx (pregabalin or gabapentin) combined with a moderate dose of a drug inhibiting the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake (duloxetine).

### Use of corticosteroids for adult chronic pain interventions: sympathetic and peripheral nerve blocks, trigger point injections-guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^117D53CH]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Paravertebral blocks for acute herpes zoster — block schedules and outcomes: A single-blinded randomized controlled trial compared twice weekly versus three times weekly paravertebral injections of 25 mg bupivacaine plus 8 mg dexamethasone and found no added benefit from repeating the blocks more than twice. In contrast, a repetitive paravertebral block regimen with local anesthetic (LA) and corticosteroids given every 48 hours for 1 week in addition to acyclovir and analgesics significantly reduced the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia compared with standard treatment alone.

### The treatment of topical drugs for postherpetic neuralgia: a network meta-analysis [^113ythzA]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a neuropathic pain that causes a reduction in patients' quality of life. There are many topical drugs for PHN, including topical lidocaine patch, topical application of capsaicin, and others.

Objectives

This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of topical drugs for PHN.

Study Design

Relevant studies were found by systemically searching for terms including "topical" and "Postherpetic neuralgia" in PubMed, Cochrane library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases (inception through June 12, 2019). The primary outcome was the percentage of change in the Numeric Rating Scale or the Visual Analog Scale scores from baseline. The secondary outcome was the number of adverse events.

Methods

The efficacy and safety of topical drugs for PHN was investigated by the pairwise meta-analysis and Bayesian network meta-analysis, applying Revman 5.3, the Stata 14.0 software, and GeMTC 0.14.3.

Results

Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, and eligible studies were selected for the ultimate meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis displayed 6 topical drugs for PHN. Lidocaine, high-concentration capsaicin, and aspirin/diethyl ether (ADE) had a higher possibility of bringing pain relief than placebo. Among them, lidocaine had the highest possibility of being the most effective drug for PHN and had the statistical significances compared with diclofenac, high-concentration capsaicin, indomethacin, low-concentration capsaicin, and placebo, and lidocaine was significantly preferable than other effective drugs in the aspect of safety.

Limitations

(1) The small number of included studies; (2) a small number of patients and short-term trials in progress, including lidocaine and ADE; (3) both randomized controlled trial and crossover randomized trial were included in our network meta-analysis; (4) only studies published in English were evaluated; (5) lack of head-to-head comparisons of some treatments; (6) different measurement methods were used in different trial, which may cause deviation; and (7) with the lack of cycles in the included trials, the inconsistency factors cannot be calculated, and node-splitting method cannot be performed in our network meta-analysis to check the inconsistency.

Conclusions

Compared with other topical drugs, lidocaine was the most effective and most tolerable drug to be recommended for PHN.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^111pVHjK]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

As the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is being implemented, a sizable physician shortage is predicted, and physician assistants and nurse practitioners are predicted to fill the gap in primary care. Therefore, more mid-level providers may coordinate the acute treatment of HZ in urgent-care settings or primary care offices, and they will be responsible for the surveillance and management of PHN. PHN is a complex condition, is difficult to treat, and requires a methodical therapeutic approach, and physician assistants and nurse practitioners are critical in coordinating team-based and patient-centered care.

Oral therapies

Tricyclic antidepressants

Although not approved by the FDA, TCAs have been commonly used for the treatment of pain associated with PHN since the early 1980s. Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine are antidepressants currently recommended as first-line therapies (Figure 2). Clinical experience indicates that TCAs can be efficacious in relieving neuropathic pain, although they display a relatively slow onset of action, and the medical literature shows that they do not work as well in patients with certain types of pain common in PHN (ie, burning pain or allodynia).TCAs are often poorly tolerated, and are associated with significant systemic adverse events and cardiac toxicity (Table 1), which require considerable caution when treating older patients, the population that is the most prevalent for developing PHN. Amitriptyline is the most widely prescribed TCA, but desipramine and nortriptyline are associated with fewer side effects.

Opioids

Natural and synthetic opioids (eg, oxycodone, morphine, methadone, and tramadol) are used in PHN management, although they are not approved by the FDA for that indication (Figure 2). They are available as fast-acting (2–6 hours of analgesia) or as long-acting (8–24 hours of analgesia). Great concern exists regarding the risks of side effects, the possibility of misuse, and potential for abuse or diversion associated with opioids, and they have been recommended as a second-line therapy for the treatment of pain associated with PHN (Table 1). Also, patients will develop physical dependence, and opioid analgesics must be used cautiously.

Topical therapy

Similarly to the capsaicin 8% patch, over-the-counter capsaicin 0.075% cream has shown minimal analgesic effect in patients with PHN, and it is recommended as a second- or third-line therapy (Figure 2). Initial pain during treatment with capsaicin cream, which has to be applied multiple times daily, is the leading cause of treatment discontinuations.

### Chronic pain and infection: mechanisms, causes, conditions, treatments, and controversies [^111gDGVZ]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Common viral related neuropathic pain conditions

Neuropathic pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system", and is recognized as being mechanistically distinct from nociceptive pain and nociplastic pain. Viral infections can lead to neuropathic pain by creating lesions in the peripheral or central nervous system, producing cytokines that sensitize nociceptors, or eliciting an immune response that attacks organ systems. Although viruses can also cause nociceptive pain (eg, arthritis), pathogenesis is varied and pathogen specific.

Varicella zoster virus

Varicella zoster virus is responsible for chickenpox and shingles. After a primary infection, it lies dormant in a dorsal root or cranial ganglion and reactivates upon a decline in immunity. Pain can be spontaneous, paroxysmal, or evoked (eg, allodynia), and acute reactivation typically causes nociceptive (vesicular rash) and neuropathic (acute radiculitis) pain.

Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common and one of the most serious complications of acute infection with varicella zoster virus, and is defined as pain persisting more than 90 days after the onset or healing of the vesicular rash. Mechanisms include nerve root inflammation and ectopic discharges, peripheral sensitization, and central sensitization (eg, loss of inhibitory neurons, glial cell activation), deafferentation in the affected dermatome, and central nervous system reorganization (eg, alterations in brain metabolism, decreased grey matter, and sympatho-afferent coupling).

Postherpetic neuralgia can eventually develop in approximately half of the individuals infected with varicella zoster virus. Risk factors include older age, prodromal pain, severe acute pain or rash, marked immunosuppression, and diabetes. Because greater acute pain and rash severity might indicate increased neural damage, treatment of varicella zoster virus and resultant acute pain could reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. Strategies have included antiviral treatment, steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, neuropathic analgesics, local anesthetics, epidural steroids, and neuromodulation. However, these treatments have yielded mixed results for the prevention and treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. Vaccination is the most effective means of preventing postherpetic neuralgia, reducing risk by up to 67%, and vaccinated patients who do develop the disorder have less severe symptoms.

### Antidepressants for neuropathic pain [^116PdoQc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

For many years antidepressant drugs have been used to manage neuropathic pain, and are often the first choice treatment. It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients.

Objectives

To determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain. Migraine and headache studies were not considered.

Search Strategy

Randomised trials of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2003); EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2003); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 1; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register (May 2002). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. Fifty trials of 19 antidepressants were considered eligible (2515 patients) for inclusion. Relative Risk (RR) estimates and Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects.

Main Results

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective treatments for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline has an NNT of 2 (95%CI 1.7 to 2.5) RR 4.1(95%CI 2.9–5.9) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs (SSRIs). There were insufficient data for an assessment of evidence of effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort, venlafaxine and L-tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95%CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4(95%CI 5.2–29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.2 (95%CI 1.7 to 3.1), RR 4.8(95%CI 2.5–9.5)(three studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV-related neuropathies. The number needed to harm(NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 16 (95%CI: 10–45). The NNH for minor adverse effects was 4.6 (95%CI 3.3–6.7)

Authors' Conclusions

Antidepressants are effective for a variety of neuropathic pains. The best evidence available is for amitriptyline. There are only limited data for the effectiveness of SSRIs. It is not possible to identify the most effective antidepressant until more studies of SSRIs are conducted.

### Intrathecal methylprednisolone for intractable postherpetic neuralgia [^114817Xz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2000). Excellent credibility.

Background

There is no effective treatment for intractable postherpetic neuralgia. Because there is evidence that postherpetic neuralgia has an inflammatory component, we assessed treatment with intrathecally administered methylprednisolone to reduce pain in patients with this disorder.

Methods

We enrolled 277 patients who had had intractable postherpetic neuralgia for at least one year, 270 of whom were followed for two years. The patients were randomly assigned to receive intrathecal methylprednisolone and lidocaine (3 mL of 3 percent lidocaine with 60 mg of methylprednisolone acetate, 89 patients), lidocaine alone (3 mL of 3 percent lidocaine, 91 patients), or no treatment (90 patients) once per week for up to four weeks. Each weekly dose was injected into the lumbar intrathecal space. Pain was evaluated before randomization, at the end of the treatment period, and then four weeks, one year, and two years later. Samples of cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for measurement of interleukin-8 before and at the end of the treatment period.

Results

There was minimal change in the degree of pain in the lidocaine-only and control groups during and after the treatment period. In the methylprednisolone-lidocaine group, the intensity and area of pain decreased, and the use of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug diclofenac declined by more than 70 percent four weeks after the end of treatment. No complications related to intrathecal methylprednisolone were observed. Before treatment, the concentrations of interleukin-8 in the cerebrospinal fluid were inversely related to the duration of neuralgia in all the patients (r = -0.49, P < 0.001). In the patients who received methylprednisolone, interleukin-8 concentrations decreased by 50 percent, and this decrease correlated with the duration of neuralgia and with the extent of global pain relief (P < 0.001 for both comparisons).

Conclusions

The results of this trial indicate that the intrathecal administration of methylprednisolone is an effective treatment for postherpetic neuralgia.

### Management of herpes zoster (shingles) and postherpetic… [^116LMb2C]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Treatment of Herpes Zoster The treatment of herpes zoster has three major objectives: treatment of the acute viral infection, treatment of the acute pain associated with herpes zoster and prevention of postherpetic neuralgia. Antiviral agents, oral corticosteroids and adjunctive individualized pain-management modalities are used to achieve these objectives. Treatment of Postherpetic Neuralgia Although postherpetic neuralgia is generally a self-limited condition, it can last indefinitely. Treatment is directed at pain control while waiting for the condition to resolve. Pain therapy may include multiple interventions, such as topical medications, over-the-counter analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants and a number of nonmedical modalities. Occasionally, narcotics may be required. Dosage recommendations are provided in. Patches containing lidocaine have also been used to treat postherpetic neuralgia.

One study found that compared with no treatment, lidocaine patches reduced pain intensity, with minimal systemic absorption. Although lidocaine was efficacious in relieving pain, the effect was temporary, lasting only four to 12 hours with each application. ANTICONVULSANTS Phenytoin, carbamazepine and gabapentin are often used to control neuropathic pain. A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed gabapentin to be effective in treating the pain of postherpetic neuralgia, as well as the often associated sleep disturbance. There are no specific contraindications to using anticonvulsants in combination with antidepressants or analgesics. However, the risk of side effects increases when multiple medications are used. Effective treatment of postherpetic neuralgia often requires multiple treatment approaches.

In addition to medications, modalities to consider include transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, biofeedback and nerve blocks. Final Comment Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia are relatively common conditions, primarily in elderly and immunocompromised patients. Although the diagnosis of the conditions is generally straightforward, treatment can be frustrating for the patient and physician. Approaches to management include treatment of the herpes zoster infection and associated pain, prevention of postherpetic neuralgia, and control of the neuropathic pain until the condition resolves. Primary treatment modalities include antiviral agents, corticosteroids, tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants.

### Postherpetic neuralgia-clinical evidence handbook… [^114nsUjn]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Oral antiviral agents. One systematic review of randomized controlled trials has found limited evidence that acyclovir given for seven to 10 days reduces pain at one to three months. One RCT found that famciclovir versus placebo significantly reduced pain duration after acute herpes zoster. One RCT has found that valacyclovir versus acyclovir significantly reduced the prevalence of postherpetic neuralgia at six months. What are the effects of treatments in established postherpetic neuralgia. BENEFICIAL Gabapentin One systematic review identified one RCT, which found that gabapentin versus placebo significantly relieves pain after eight weeks of treatment. One subsequent RCT found similar results. Tricyclic antidepressants Two systematic reviews have found that tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo significantly increase pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia after six weeks.

Topical counterirritants Two systematic reviews and one small RCT found limited evidence that capsaicin versus placebo may improve pain relief, but also causes painful skin reactions in some people. Tramadol One systematic review found limited evidence from one small RCT that tramadol reduced pain more than clomipramine after six weeks. LIKELY TO BE INEFFECTIVE OR HARMFUL Dextromethorphan One systematic review and one subsequent RCT found no evidence that dextromethorphan was more effective than placebo or lorazepam after three to six weeks. Epidural morphine One small RCT found that epidural morphine versus placebo reduced pain by more than 50 percent, but the reduction was not maintained beyond 36 hours. Epidural morphine caused intolerable opioid effects in 75 percent of people. 1 Prevalence of pain falls as time elapses after the initial episode.

Among 183 people older than 60 years in the placebo arm of a United Kingdom trial, the prevalence of pain was 61 percent at one month, 24 percent at three months, and 13 percent at six months after acute infection. 3 In a more recent RCT, the prevalence of postherpetic pain in the placebo arm at six months was 35 percent in 72 people older than 60 years. 4.

### Prevention and treatment of postherpetic neuralgia… [^117BWC8G]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia becomes permanent or persists for many years in about one half of those affected, and most cases are refractory to treatment. Watson reviews the management of postherpetic neuralgia. In summarizing studies of treatment for postherpetic neuralgia, the author emphasizes that total relief of symptoms is rarely achieved and that most patients report significant side effects from the analgesic or antidepressant medications studied. To date, studies have involved relatively small numbers of patients, and significant individual variation has been noted in response to treatment. Some antidepressants that have the ability to inhibit neurotransmitters for pain pathways have been studied for their analgesic effect in postherpetic neuralgia. Studies of amitriptyline resulted in reports of poor or no response to therapy in 33 to 53 percent of patients, compared with 84 to 100 percent of those receiving placebo.

A study in which amitriptyline was combined with maprotiline also resulted in a report of poor or no response in 53 percent of patients, but another study in which amitriptyline was combined with or substituted for nor-triptyline resulted in poor or no response in only 32 percent of patients. Desipramine given as sole therapy resulted in poor or no response in 54 percent of patients. It is recommended that antidepressant therapy for postherpetic neuralgia begin with small dosages and increase incrementally to achieve the optimal balance of benefit and adverse effects. Narcotic analgesics are frequently used in the management of postherpetic neuralgia. A study of oxycodone resulted in reports of poor or no response in 45 percent of those treated compared with 82 percent of patients who received placebo. Regional anesthesia may help to control acute pain but has not been systematically studied.

The author concludes that the best approach to minimizing the risk of postherpetic neuralgia is early, aggressive treatment of herpes zoster. Patients should be educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of the condition and should be made aware of the importance of early presentation for medical evaluation. Antiviral therapy with valacyclovir or famciclovir should begin within 72 hours of onset of pain or rash.
