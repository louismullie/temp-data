## Question

28(1104). Two motorcyclists set off simultaneously from $A$ to $B$ and from $B$ to $A$. The first arrived in $B$ 2.5 hours after the meeting, while the second arrived in $A$ 1.6 hours after the meeting. How many hours was each motorcyclist on the road?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many hours each motorcyclist was on the road, given that they start simultaneously from opposite ends, meet at some point, and then the first motorcyclist arrives at B 2.5 hours after the meeting while the second arrives at A 1.6 hours after the meeting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic meeting-point problem setup and the key variables. Then, I should verify the relationship between the time to meeting and the time after meeting for each rider. Next, I will derive the time to meeting using the geometric mean property. After that, I will calculate each rider's total time on the road. Finally, I will double-check the logic and ensure the units and arithmetic are correct.

> Let me first confirm the setup and variables. Let the distance between A and B be D, and let the motorcyclists meet after time t hours. Let v1 be the speed of the rider going from A to B, and v2 be the speed of the rider going from B to A. The total time for rider 1 is t + 2.5 hours, and for rider 2 it is t + 1.6 hours, since they each continue to their destinations after meeting [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the core relationship. In meeting-point problems, the time from start to meeting is the same for both riders, and the ratio of distances covered before meeting equals the ratio of their speeds. Also, the time each takes to cover the remaining distance after meeting is inversely related to their speed, which sets up a useful constraint on t [^notfound].

> I will now examine the constraint equations. Before meeting, rider 1 covers v1t and rider 2 covers v2t, so the meeting point divides the total distance in the ratio v1: v2. After meeting, rider 1 needs v2t / v1 hours to cover the remaining distance v2t at speed v1, and rider 2 needs v1t / v2 hours to cover the remaining distance v1t at speed v2. But wait, I should double-check that I'm assigning the correct remaining distances to each rider; yes, after meeting, rider 1 faces the distance rider 2 already covered, and vice versa, so the expressions are correct [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should equate the given post-meeting times to these expressions. That gives me two equations: v2t / v1 = 2.5 and v1t / v2 = 1.6. Multiplying these two equations together yields t^2 = 2.5 × 1.6, which simplifies to t^2 = 4, so t = 2 hours. I should confirm the arithmetic: 2.5 × 1.6 is indeed 4, and the positive root is appropriate for time, so t = 2 hours is correct [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the total times. Rider 1's total time is t + 2.5 = 2 + 2.5 = 4.5 hours, and rider 2's total time is t + 1.6 = 2 + 1.6 = 3.6 hours. Let me double-check that these totals are consistent with the speed ratio implied by the post-meeting times; since 2.5 / 1.6 = 1.5625, the speed ratio v1 / v2 should be about 1.25, and indeed v1 / v2 = sqrt(2.5 / 1.6) ≈ 1.25, which aligns with the constraint equations, so the totals are internally consistent [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I might need to solve simultaneous equations for v1 and v2 explicitly, but I should confirm whether that's necessary. Given that the product of the post-meeting times directly yields t^2, I don't actually need the individual speeds to answer the question about total times, so the geometric mean approach is sufficient and more efficient here [^notfound].

> Final answer: The first motorcyclist was on the road for 4.5 hours, and the second motorcyclist was on the road for 3.6 hours [^notfound].

---

The two motorcyclists were on the road for **4.5 hours** (rider A) and **3.6 hours** (rider B). This follows from the fact that the time from the meeting point to arrival is inversely proportional to speed, so the ratio of post-meeting times (2.5: 1.6) equals the inverse ratio of speeds. Using the harmonic mean relationship for meeting problems, the time to meeting is √(2.5 × 1.6) = 2 hours, giving total times of 2 + 2.5 = 4.5 hours and 2 + 1.6 = 3.6 hours, respectively.

---

## Step-by-step solution

Let:

- (t) = time until the two motorcyclists meet (hours)
- (v_A) = speed of motorcyclist A (km/h)
- (v_B) = speed of motorcyclist B (km/h)
- (D) = distance between A and B (km)

At the meeting point, the distances traveled are:

- **Distance traveled by A**: (d_A = v_A \\cdot t)
- **Distance traveled by B**: (d_B = v_B \\cdot t)

Since they meet, the sum of distances is the total distance: (d_A + d_B = D), so (v_A \\cdot t + v_B \\cdot t = D), or (t(v_A + v_B) = D).

After meeting, the remaining distances and times are:

- **Remaining distance for A**: (d_B = v_B \\cdot t)
- **Time for A to reach B**: (t_A = \\frac{d_B}{v_A} = \\frac{v_B \\cdot t}{v_A} = 2.5) hours
- **Remaining distance for B**: (d_A = v_A \\cdot t)
- **Time for B to reach A**: (t_B = \\frac{d_A}{v_B} = \\frac{v_A \\cdot t}{v_B} = 1.6) hours

From these, we get:

- (\\frac{v_B \\cdot t}{v_A} = 2.5) → (\\frac{v_B}{v_A} = \\frac{2.5}{t})
- (\\frac{v_A \\cdot t}{v_B} = 1.6) → (\\frac{v_A}{v_B} = \\frac{1.6}{t})

Multiplying these two equations: (\\frac{v_B}{v_A} \\cdot \\frac{v_A}{v_B} = \\frac{2.5}{t} \\cdot \\frac{1.6}{t}) → (1 = \\frac{4}{t^2}) → (t^2 = 4) → (t = 2) hours.

Thus, the total times are:

- **Total time for A**: (t + 2.5 = 2 + 2.5 = 4.5) hours
- **Total time for B**: (t + 1.6 = 2 + 1.6 = 3.6) hours

---

## Verification

We can verify the speed ratio and consistency. From (t = 2) hours:

- (\\frac{v_B}{v_A} = \\frac{2.5}{2} = 1.25) → (v_B = 1.25 v_A)
- (\\frac{v_A}{v_B} = \\frac{1.6}{2} = 0.8) → (v_A = 0.8 v_B)

These are consistent, confirming the solution.

---

## Final answer

The first motorcyclist was on the road for **4.5 hours**, and the second motorcyclist was on the road for **3.6 hours**.

### Motorcycle rider training for the prevention of road traffic crashes [^7fae7c3d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Riding a motorcycle (a two-wheeled vehicle that is powered by a motor and has no pedals) is associated with a high risk of fatal crashes, particularly in new riders. Motorcycle rider training has therefore been suggested as an important means of reducing the number of crashes, and the severity of injuries.

Objectives

To quantify the effectiveness of pre- and post-licence motorcycle rider training on the reduction of traffic offences, traffic crash involvement, injuries and deaths of motorcycle riders.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3), TRANSPORT, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, WHOLIS (World Health Organization Library Information System), PsycInfo, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences), ISI Web of Science: Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), ERIC, ZETOC and SIGLE. Database searches covered all available dates up to October 2008. We also checked reference lists of relevant papers and contacted study authors in an effort to identify published, unpublished and ongoing trials related to motorcycle rider training.

Selection Criteria

We included all relevant intervention studies such as randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, interrupted time-series and observational studies such as cohort and case-control studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently analysed data about the study population, study design and methods, interventions and outcome measures as well as data quality from each included study, and compared the findings. We resolved differences by discussion with a third review author.

Main Results

We reviewed 23 studies: three randomised trials, two non-randomised trials, 14 cohort studies and four case-control studies. Five examined mandatory pre-licence training, 14 assessed non-mandatory training, three of the case-control studies assessed 'any' type of rider training, and one case-control study assessed mandatory pre-licence training and non-mandatory training. The types of assessed rider training varied in duration and content. Most studies suffered from serious methodological weaknesses. Most studies were non-randomised and controlled poorly for confounders. Most studies also suffered from detection bias due to the poor use of outcome measurement tools such as the sole reliance upon police records or self-reported data. Small sample sizes and short follow-up time after training were also common.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the poor quality of studies identified, we were unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of rider training on crash, injury, or offence rates. The findings suggest that mandatory pre-licence training may be an impediment to completing a motorcycle licensing process, possibly indirectly reducing crashes through a reduction in exposure. It is not clear if training (or what type) reduces the risk of crashes, injuries or offences in motorcyclists, and a best rider training practice can therefore not be recommended. As some type of rider training is likely to be necessary to teach motorcyclists to ride a motorcycle safely, rigorous research is needed.

### Cycling infrastructure for reducing cycling injuries in cyclists [^f4d60f0d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cycling is an attractive form of transport. It is beneficial to the individual as a form of physical activity that may fit more readily into an individual's daily routine, such as for cycling to work and to the shops, than other physical activities such as visiting a gym. Cycling is also beneficial to the wider community and the environment as a result of fewer motorised journeys. Cyclists are seen as vulnerable road users who are frequently in close proximity to larger and faster motorised vehicles. Cycling infrastructure aims to make cycling both more convenient and safer for cyclists. This review is needed to guide transport planning.

Objectives

To:1. evaluate the effects of different types of cycling infrastructure on reducing cycling injuries in cyclists, by type of infrastructure;2. evaluate the effects of cycling infrastructure on reducing the severity of cycling injuries in cyclists;3. evaluate the effects of cycling infrastructure on reducing cycling injuries in cyclists with respect to age, sex and social group.

Search Methods

We ran the most recent search on 2nd March 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase Classic + Embase(OvidSP), PubMed and 10 other databases. We searched websites, handsearched conference proceedings, screened reference lists of included studies and previously published reviews and contacted relevant organisations.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies which evaluated the effect of cycling infrastructure (such as cycle lanes, tracks or paths, speed management, roundabout design) on cyclist injury or collision rates. Studies had to include a comparator, that is, either no infrastructure or a different type of infrastructure. We excluded studies that assessed collisions that occurred as a result of competitive cycling.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors examined the titles and abstracts of papers obtained from searches to determine eligibility. Two review authors extracted data from the included trials and assessed the risk of bias. We carried out a meta-analysis using the random-effects model where at least three studies reported the same intervention and outcome. Where there were sufficient studies, as a secondary analysis we accounted for changes in cyclist exposure in the calculation of the rate ratios. We rated the quality of the evidence as 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low' according to the GRADE approach for the installation of cycle routes and networks.

Main Results

We identified 21 studies for inclusion in the review: 20 controlled before-after (CBA) studies and one interrupted time series (ITS) study. These evaluated a range of infrastructure including cycle lanes, advanced stop lines, use of colour, cycle tracks, cycle paths, management of the road network, speed management, cycle routes and networks, roundabout design and packages of measures. No studies reported medically-attended or self-reported injuries. There was no evidence that cycle lanes reduce the rate of cycle collisions (rate ratio 1.21, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.08). Taking into account cycle flow, there was no difference in collisions for cyclists using cycle routes and networks compared with cyclists not using cycle routes and networks (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.05). There was statistically significant heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 75%, Chi² = 8.00 df = 2, P = 0.02) for the analysis adjusted for cycle flow. We judged the quality of the evidence regarding cycle routes and networks as very low and we are very uncertain about the estimate. These analyses are based on findings from CBA studies. From data presented narratively, the use of 20 mph speed restrictions in urban areas may be effective at reducing cyclist collisions. Redesigning specific parts of cycle routes that may be particularly busy or complex in terms of traffic movement may be beneficial to cyclists in terms of reducing the risk of collision. Generally, the conversion of intersections to roundabouts may increase the number of cycle collisions. In particular, the conversion of intersections to roundabouts with cycle lanes marked as part of the circulating carriageway increased cycle collisions. However, the conversion of intersections with and without signals to roundabouts with cycle paths may reduce the odds of collision. Both continuing a cycle lane across the mouth of a side road with a give way line onto the main road, and cycle tracks, may increase the risk of injury collisions in cyclists. However, these conclusions are uncertain, being based on a narrative review of findings from included studies. There is a lack of evidence that cycle paths or advanced stop lines either reduce or increase injury collisions in cyclists. There is also insufficient evidence to draw any robust conclusions concerning the effect of cycling infrastructure on cycling collisions in terms of severity of injury, sex, age, and level of social deprivation of the casualty. In terms of quality of the evidence, there was little matching of intervention and control sites. In many studies, the comparability of the control area to the intervention site was unclear and few studies provided information on other cycling infrastructures that may be in place in the control and intervention areas. The majority of studies analysed data routinely collected by organisations external to the study team, thus reducing the risk of bias in terms of systematic differences in assessing outcomes between the control and intervention groups. Some authors did not take regression-to-mean effects into account when examining changes in collisions. Longer data collection periods pre- and post-installation would allow for regression-to-mean effects and also seasonal and time trends in traffic volume to be observed. Few studies adjusted cycle collision rates for exposure.

Authors' Conclusions

Generally, there is a lack of high quality evidence to be able to draw firm conclusions as to the effect of cycling infrastructure on cycling collisions. There is a lack of rigorous evaluation of cycling infrastructure.

### Age, period and cohort effects on the incidence of motorcyclist casualties in traffic crashes [^8dc58c91]. Injury Prevention (2013). Low credibility.

As the 'baby boomers' age and decline in number, the population, as a whole, is getting older. Assuming the current level of motorcycle use by various age groups, the relative impact of the younger age groups which have the highest risk, will be less (ie, age effect).

Other explanations for the rise in motorcycle injuries include increased exposure (motorcycle miles driven) due to higher fuel prices, congestion and environmental awareness. These factors (period effects) impact on all age groups to varying degrees.

Age, period and cohort effects interact with one another. For example, for some of the baby boomers who used to ride in their youth, the price of fuel may have been the trigger which prompted them to return to motorcycling. Similarly, graduate loan debt (a relatively new phenomenon in NZ) and soaring unaffordability of housing (worst in the history of NZ), may prompt some young people to take up motorcycling in order that they are more able to save the deposit for a house or a first or second car.

For reasons of resource allocation, it is important that we determine, based on past experience, the independent impact on motorcycle injury crashes of age, cohort and period effects, and use this information to model various scenarios to forecast the future incidence of motorcyclist casualties.

We sought to:

Estimate age, period and cohort effects for motorcyclist traffic casualties covering 1979–2008 in NZ
Forecast the NZ incidence of motorcycle traffic casualties for 2019–1923, assuming future age, cohort and period effects, and compare these with an estimate based on simple linear extrapolation.

### The full moon and motorcycle related mortality: population based double control study [^0b173ee7]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

For the primary analysis we used a binomial test to evaluate the average number of fatal motorcycle crashes on full moon nights compared with control nights. Stratified analyses accounted for characteristics of the motorcyclist, vehicle, environment, and crash. All P values were two tailed, with relative risk estimates calculated using exact 95% confidence intervals. Hierarchical analyses that preserved the pair matching between each full moon and corresponding control nights yielded larger effects and are reported as conditional odds ratios. Sensitivity analyses that additionally included the night immediately before and after a full moon yielded a greater number of excess deaths associated with a full moon with a marginally attenuated relative risk estimate and are not reported.

Further replication

We repeated our analyses in three additional countries, with study protocols receiving approvals from the ethics board of the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and corresponding agencies in each country as needed. We chose the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia because each is similar to the United States in language, culture, demographics, healthcare, and technology. National traffic agencies provided available data for each country. Clock times were based on local hours for each time zone. The aggregated database included the United Kingdom (1 January 1986 to 31 December 2010, 309 full moons), Canada (1 January 1999 to 31 December 2014, 198 full moons), and Australia (1 January 1989 to 31 December 2013, 309 full moons).

Patient involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no prespecified plans to disseminate the results of the research to study participants or the relevant patient community.

### Database improvements for motor vehicle / bicycle crash analysis [^b11c0bdf]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

From 2000 to 2013, the number of commuting bicyclists in the USA increased by 61.6%. This may be due in part to the health benefits of bicyclingand the desire for a cleaner environment. While the health benefits outweigh the risks, including crashes, many individuals may still choose not to bicycle due to risk. If environments were safer for bicyclists, perhaps more individuals would bicycle. Having accurate crash data about bicyclists would be useful, especially since accurate motor vehicle crash (MVC) data produced better roadways and safer motor vehicles which, in turn, resulted in decreased crash-related morbidity and mortality.

Police have recorded bicycle crashes since the introduction of the bicycle in 1890 when crashes were written in police journals. Crash reports are now entered by police officers on a state crash report template that includes spaces for a written description of the crash and free drawn diagrams plus boxes for coded information. Some of the data on the template, including the coded information, is later entered by a police officer or a staff person into a spreadsheet about that individual crash. The information requested on the template, and thus the data entered later into the spreadsheet, focuses primarily on crashes between motor vehicles.

Diagrammatically, a motor vehicle most closely resembles a rectangle while a bicycle most closely resembles a line (figure 1). Consequently, the points of impact could be very different when two motor vehicles collide versus when a motor vehicle and a bicycle collide. For example, in a crash between a bicycle and a motor vehicle, a bicycle could strike an opened car door or a side mirror, or come alongside a motor vehicle in a narrow space between the motor vehicle and the road's edge. To describe a bicycle crash in a useful way, police crash report templates should be modified to include bicycle-crash-scene reporting fields. The current state crash report template does include a category for pedal cyclist/bicyclist, who is considered a non-motorist, but there are very few codes specific to bicyclists. Bicycle-crash-scene details can be found in the written crash description and drawing on the template but these details are not coded for entry into a spreadsheet. Therefore, when analyses require large existing data sets and the combining of many reports, bicycle-crash-scene details are not available.

### The use of non-standard motorcycle helmets in low-and middle-income countries: a multicentre study [^c1d62cf6]. Injury Prevention (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The use of non-standard motorcycle helmets has the potential to undermine multinational efforts aimed at reducing the burden of road traffic injuries associated with motorcycle crashes. However, little is known about the prevalence or factors associated with their use.

Methods

Collaborating institutions in nine low- and middle-income countries undertook cross-sectional surveys, markets surveys, and reviewed legislation and enforcement practices around non-standard helmets.

Findings

5563 helmet-wearing motorcyclists were observed; 54% of the helmets did not appear to have a marker/sticker indicating that the helmet met required standards and interviewers judged that 49% of the helmets were likely to be non-standard helmets. 5088 (91%) of the motorcyclists agreed to be interviewed; those who had spent less than US$10 on their helmet were found to be at the greatest risk of wearing a non-standard helmet. Data were collected across 126 different retail outlets; across all countries, regardless of outlet type, standard helmets were generally 2–3 times more expensive than non-standard helmets. While seven of the nine countries had legislation prohibiting the use of non-standard helmets, only four had legislation prohibiting their manufacture or sale and only three had legislation prohibiting their import. Enforcement of any legislation appeared to be minimal.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that the widespread use of non-standard helmets in low- and middle-income countries may limit the potential gains of helmet use programmes. Strategies aimed at reducing the costs of standard helmets, combined with both legislation and enforcement, will be required to maximise the effects of existing campaigns.

### Age, period and cohort effects on the incidence of motorcyclist casualties in traffic crashes [^f0821a36]. Injury Prevention (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

(1) Estimate age, period and cohort effects for motorcyclist traffic casualties 1979–2008 in New Zealand and (2) forecast the incidence of New Zealand motorcycle traffic casualties for the period 2019–2023 assuming future age, cohort and period effects, and compare these with an estimate based on simple linear extrapolation.

Methods

Age-period-cohort (APC) modelling was used to estimate the individual effects of age, period and cohort after adjusting for the other two factors. Forecasting was produced for three period-effect scenarios.

Results

After adjusting for cohort and period effects, 15-19-year-olds have substantially elevated risk. The period effect reduced in significance over time until the last period, 2004–2008, where the risk was higher than the preceding period. The 10-year cohorts born 1949–1958, 1954–1963, 1959–1968 and 1964–1973, had elevated risk. The forecasting, based on APC modelling, resulted in the lowest estimates of the future incidence being approximately one-third that of the highest estimate (6641).

Conclusion

Trends in motorcycle casualties have been influenced by significant independent age, period and cohort effects. These need to be considered in forecasting future casualties. The selection of the period effect has a significant impact on the estimates. Which period-effect scenario readers choose to accept depends on their views about a wide range of factors which might influence motorcycle use and crash risk over time.

### Motorcycle helmets save lives, but not limbs: a national trauma data bank analysis of functional outcomes after motorcycle crash [^0f6b9842]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of motorcycle fatalities over the last 10 y has nearly doubled. There is considerable evidence that motorcycle helmets save lives, but there are little data regarding the impact that helmets have on functional outcomes after a motorcycle crash. The objective of this study was to determine the difference between helmeted and non-helmeted motorcyclists in the odds of developing a functional deficit at discharge in three domains: speech, locomotion, and feeding.

Methods

Reviewed cases in the National Trauma Databank v7.0 involved in motorcycle collisions. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the effect of helmets on mortality and functional outcomes, adjusting for age, race, gender, insurance status, anatomic and physiologic injury severity, and head injury.

Results

The adjusted odds of mortality (0.75; 95% CI 0.65–0.86) and functional deficits in speech (0.82; 95% CI 0.69–0.97), locomotion (1.19; 95% CI 1.11–1.29), and feeding (0.96 95% CI 0.84–1.08) among helmeted riders was compared with non-helmeted motorcyclists with equivalent injuries.

Conclusion

Helmeted motorcyclists are less likely to die and develop a deficit in speech after a motorcycle collision. These data support that motorcycle helmets are important in preventing functional deficits related to head injury.

Table 1 shows the contribution of age groups and cohorts to the derivation of estimates for Scenarios A, B and C.

Table 1
Outcomes of the four steps in derivation of incidence for 2019–1923

Our forecast under Scenario A, based on the assumption that the period effect would remain at the level observed in 2004–2008 (figure 2B), resulted in an estimate of the incidence for 2019–2023 of 3596 casualties (range 20.5–20.6 per 100 000 population per year). Under Scenario B, where we assumed the period effect would continue to trend downward, as observed for 1984–2003 (figure 2B), we estimate there would be 2076 casualties (range 11.8–11.9 per 100 000 population per year). Under Scenario C, where we assumed the period effect would continue to trend upward, as observed for the period 1999–2008, we estimate 6641 casualties (range 37.8–38.1 per 100 000 population per year). Our highest estimate (Scenario D) of 8145 casualties (range 43.4–49.8 per 100 000 population per year) was produced by simple extrapolation based on the trend in incidence observed since 2002 (figure 1).

### Trauma and motorcyclists: born to be wild, bound to be injured? [^ff4a5ae1]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Regrettably motorcyclists frequently suffer related significant injuries. Doctors who manage trauma will encounter victims of motorcycle accidents and many aspects of care are unique to these patients due to the protective and performance enhancing equipment used by motorcyclists. This review examines the patterns of major injuries suffered by motorcyclists, the unique aspects of airway, circulatory and spine management, and suggests some interventions, which may allow primary injury prevention for the future.

Data Source

Literature searches of the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library with hand searches and author's experience.

Interventions

None.

Data Synthesis and Conclusions

The airway and (cervical and thoracolumbar) spine cannot be managed effectively in the helmeted patient with a speed hump in place and intubation by direct laryngoscopy is almost impossible with a speed hump in place. Helmets should be removed and the speed hump cut from the leathers. Leathers act as fracture splints, particularly for pelvis and lower extremities. Removal or extensive cutting away of the lower portion of leathers should be considered as part of "circulation", and only take place in a medical facility and in anticipation of circulatory deterioration. Motorcyclists sustaining thoracic spinal damage more frequently than cervical and spinal fractures at multiple levels are common. Back protectors are used commonly and these may be left in situ for extrication on a spinal board, but they should be removed in-hospital to allow full assessment. Injury prevention will require coordinated research and development of a number of key pieces of equipment and design in particular helmets, speed humps and clothing/textiles. In managing the injured motorcyclist in the pre or in-hospital settings, health professionals require greater awareness of the implications of such devices, which at the present time appears largely restricted to motorcycling enthusiasts.

### Bicyclist deaths associated with motor vehicle traffic-United States, 1975–2012 [^62aa1425]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

What is already known on this topic?

On a per trip basis, bicyclists are twice as likely as vehicle occupants to die on U.S. roads. About 1% of all trips are by bicycle, and bicycling has increased recently among adults while declining among children.

What is added by this report?

During 1975–2012, overall annual rates for cyclist mortality decreased 44%, with the steepest decline among children aged < 15 years. In contrast, cyclist mortality rates increased for adults aged 35–74 years, particularly men aged 35–54 years.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Multifaceted, integrated approaches to bicycling have improved safety while also promoting cycling. With cycling increasing in the United States, especially in urban areas, improving bicycle safety could prevent potential increases in cyclist mortality rates.

### Age, period and cohort effects on the incidence of motorcyclist casualties in traffic crashes [^5ef6b55a]. Injury Prevention (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results show that even after adjusting for cohort and period effects, the 15–19-year-olds have substantially elevated risk.

The reducing period effect to 2003 is most likely due to a reduction in exposure brought about by the reducing popularity of motorcycles as a mode of transport. In 1979, the start of the first period we studied, there were 111 653 motorcycles registered for use on public roads. By 2003, the end the declining period effect, the number had declined by 50%. In 2008, the number of registrations had increased 172% over the 2003 registrations to 97 042

The 1949–1958, 1954–1963 and 1959–1968 cohorts had high rates. These cohorts approximate the operational definition of a baby boomer. One reason put forward for the higher rates of baby boomers is that after an absence from motorcycling they return to riding larger and more powerful motorcycles than they did in their younger years. The lack of recent experience, coupled with the unfamiliar characteristics of modern and large motorcycles may place them at elevated risk. It should be noted, however, that the 1964–1973 and 1969–19*78 cohorts also had relatively high rates.

There was substantial variation in the forecasts for 2019–2023. Nevertheless, Scenario D, the simple extrapolation approach, produced the highest incidence by a considerable margin. This suggests that it is likely to be an overestimate. Elvik, in examining long-term trends in the number of fatalities in eight highly motorised countries stated: "… simple trend lines fitted to the count of traffic fatalities for a period of 10–30 years are completely worthless as a basis for predicting the future number of fatalities." Elvik (p.249).

The investigation has a number of strengths. It is highly likely to have captured all the cases of interest. The registering of deaths and their causes is comprehensive in NZ. Our source of injuries from non-fatal crashes was public hospital discharges which covers the entire population of NZ. In addition, injured persons requiring acute hospital inpatient treatment would rarely attend a private hospital in NZ. While our study was restricted to those aged 10–69 years, < 1% of motorcycle injury crashes resulting in hospitalisation (the majority of events in the analyses) involve those < 10 years of age and > 69 years of age.

### Comparison of cyclists' and motorists' utilitarian physical activity at an urban university [^49acf80f]. Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Preliminary comparison of cyclists and motorists on: (1) distance lived from campus and, (2) the impact of transportation mode on physical activity.

Methods

A purposive sample of students (n = 50; cyclists = 26, motorists = 24) living < 5 miles from Arizona State University campus wore an accelerometer and completed a travel log for two on-campus days during fall 2005-spring 2006. Residence distance to campus was calculated by geocoded addresses (n = 45; cyclists = 23 vs. motorists = 22). Final outcome variables were: distance lived from campus, accelerometer time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, steps/day, total time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (logged minutes cycling+accelerometer-derived moderate-to-vigorous physical activity), and minutes total active commuting (logged walking+cycling).

Results

Groups were significantly different for: distance lived from campus (cyclists = 0.6 ± 0.6 vs. motorists = 2.0 ± 1.1 miles; p < 0.000); steps/day (cyclists = 11,051 ± 4295 vs. motorists = 9174 ± 3319; p = 0.046); total time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (cyclists = 85.7 ± 37.0 vs. motorists = 50.3 ± 23.8 minutes; p < 0.001); minutes in motorized transport (cyclists = 24.9 ± 27.5 vs. motorists = 61.6 ± 32.9; p < 0.001); and total active transport (cyclists = 59.4 ± 32.4 vs. motorists = 29.5 ± 20.0; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Among students living within 5 miles of campus, cyclists lived relatively closer to campus, accumulated more minutes of physical activity, and spent more time in active transportation than students who used motorized means.

### Helmet use among cyclists and motorcyclists involved in media-reported road traffic crashes after implementation of the national'one helmet, one belt' campaign in China [^71b364d6]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

China implemented the 'One Helmet, One Belt' road safety campaign in April 2020 to improve helmet use among cyclists and motorcyclists. We evaluated its long-term effect.

Methods

We analysed crash data from 379 media sources that reported at least one road traffic crash per quarter between January 2019 and September 2024, as indexed by the Automated Road Traffic Crash Data Platform. The proportion of media-reported crashes involving helmeted motorcyclists and cyclists was compared before and after implementation of the national campaign. We calculated adjusted (aORs) using logistic regression, controlling for season and the COVID-19 pandemic period and fitted Joinpoint regression models to identify periods with significant changes.

Results

Among 20546 media-reported crashes involving motorcyclists and cyclists, the overall proportion of riders wearing helmets increased significantly following the campaign's implementation (aOR: 2.37; 95%CI: 2.08 to 2.72). However, this increase emerged only in the first 8months of the campaign (April-December 2020), after which proportions plateaued. Subgroup analyses detected distinct temporal patterns for motorcyclists (an initial increase followed by decline), professional delivery riders (no significant trends) and publicly shared vehicle riders (consistently increasing trends).

Conclusions

Our study documents an initial increase followed by stabilisation in proportion of media-reported crashes involving helmeted motorcyclists and cyclists following the national injury prevention campaign. The intervention's effectiveness varied across rider subgroups. These findings underscore the importance of sustaining and enhancing the national campaign while developing targeted interventions for distinct user groups in China, also suggesting similar initiatives might be effective in other international contexts.

### Age, period and cohort effects on the incidence of motorcyclist casualties in traffic crashes [^6fb3d063]. Injury Prevention (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Latest figures on road fatalities in 33 countries published by the International Transport Forum at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that the first 10 years of the 21st century were a record for road safety. The total number of road fatalities fell in 30 of the 33 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and, in many cases, the average annual drop in road deaths was dramatically higher than in previous decades. Despite the marked reduction in the number of overall road fatalities, the 2000–2009 decade saw motorcycle deaths increasing in 13 countries. A similar source of international trends for serious non-fatal motorcycle crashes does not exist, and statistics for individual countries are difficult to obtain. In New Zealand (NZ), the annual incidence of non-fatal motorcycle crashes reported to the police in the 1950s was approximately 1300 (60 per 100 000 population). Twenty years later, this had risen to a historic peak of approximately 4000 per annum (127 per 100 000 population). By 1995, the incidence had dropped to approximately 1500 (40 per 100 000 population), and continued to its lowest record level at the turn of the century at 669 incidents (17 per 100 000 population). Since then, the incidence has been steadily increasing; in 2009 the Ministry of Transport reported 1369 incidents (32 per 100 000 population). This increase in incidence over the last decade has also been reported for the USA.

### Bicyclist deaths associated with motor vehicle traffic-United States, 1975–2012 [^ac8efdeb]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Physical activity, including bicycling, is linked with multiple health benefits. However, although bicycles account for only about 1% of trips across all modes of transportation, on a per trip basis, bicyclists die on U.S. roads at a rate double that of vehicle occupants. In 2009, an estimated 392 billion trips (across all modes) were taken in the United States, including 4.1 billion bicycle trips, and 33,808 deaths occurred on U.S roadways (across all modes), including 630 bicyclist deaths. This report examines mortality trends among cyclists using national collision data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) for the period 1975–2012. Annual rates for cyclist mortality decreased 44%, from 0.41 to 0.23 deaths per 100,000 during this period, with the steepest decline among children aged < 15 years. In recent years, reductions in cyclist deaths have slowed. However, age-specific cyclist mortality rates for adults aged 35–74 years have increased since 1975. Multifaceted approaches to bicyclist safety have been shown to be effective in increasing bicycling while decreasing traffic injuries and fatalities. With U.S. adults choosing to walk and cycle more, implementation of these approaches might help counter recent increases in adult cyclist deaths.

At a Nigerian university hospital, none of the motorcyclists who presented over a 12 month period had been wearing a helmet, and of the eight patients who died, seven had head injuries. Of the five collision types described, the rate of motorcycle-other vehicle collisions was highest at 40.6%, while the motorcycle-pedestrian rate was 23.4%. Measures to prevent these collisions might reduce overall crashes by 64%; in addition, helmet law should be enforced.

### Age, period and cohort effects on the incidence of motorcyclist casualties in traffic crashes [^630814a3]. Injury Prevention (2013). Low credibility.

There are some limitations to our analyses. The modelling assumes that the members of the various cohorts are not differentially affected by emigration and immigration. We have no practical way of determining whether this is the case.

Figure 3 shows that using our model for the period 1979–2008, our predicted incidence provided a reasonable estimate of observed incidence. The obvious difference is that the predicted values follow more of a step function. This is because our model produced one rate for each of the 5-year periods, and that rate thus applies to each individual year in the period.

For the period that we wished to forecast (2019–2023), there were high-risk age groups (15–19, 20–24 years of age) from cohorts (1994–2003, 1999–2008, 2004–2013) that could not be included in our modelling for the period 1979–2008. We thus assumed these three cohorts have the same level of effect equal to the average effect of the four nearest cohorts. While this is less than ideal, the alternative would have been to restrict our forecasting to those aged 25–69. That would have seriously limited the usefulness of the forecasting, given we had established that those aged 15–19 had the highest casualty rate.

### Database improvements for motor vehicle / bicycle crash analysis [^8a48cc47]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Analysis was conducted using the new bicycle-crash-scene variables that were entered into the existing spreadsheet for the 300 NYC vehicle/bicycle crashes. This analysis provided the opportunity to begin to assess if having these bicycle-crash-scene variables might be worthwhile. Frequency of motor vehicle impact point, bicycle impact point, bicycle environments, bicycling inside or outside of the environments, motor vehicle type, and crash patterns (turn/impact diagrams) were analysed. Because the existing spreadsheet included the variables, as reported by the police, of bicyclists with minor injuries and bicyclists with severe injuries and it would be time-consuming to obtain bike counts for all the streets studied in NYC, bicyclists with minor injuries were used as the control group and bicyclists with severe injuries/fatalities as the case group. Based on injuries/fatalities, the groups then included: Group 1 (control group) — Minor injury included non-incapacitating injuries (n = 99); and Group 2 (case group) — Severe injury included incapacitating injuries, possible injuries and killed (n = 191). Variables were compared based on injury type by t test for quantitative variables and χ 2 tests for qualitative variables. Logistic regression was also performed for independent variables which had been estimated as strongly affecting injury; ORs with 95% CIs were reported. Two models were constructed to examine the association between motor vehicle potential impact points, in/out (whether the crash happened inside or outside a bike lane or cycle track) and injury severity. Model 1A and 1B are unadjusted models. In Model 2A, potential confounders were adjusted including age (years), gender, road surface condition (dry, wet, muddy, snow/ice, slush, flooded water, other), crash pattern, motor vehicle type (motorcycle, car/van/pick-up truck, bus, bicycle, pedestrian, other, unknown), light condition (daylight, dawn, dusk, dark-road lighted, dark-road unlighted) and intersection. We did a sensitivity analysis by excluding crashes for which the vehicle in the existing spreadsheet was listed as unknown (Model 1B and 2B). Thus, Model 2B did not include possible hit-and-run crashes in which the vehicle driver would have left the scene. All analyses used SPSS V.21 (Chicago, Illinois, USA).

Safe System approaches and PMVC

The Vision Zero and Sustainable Safety, also known as Safe System approaches, first introduced more than 20 years ago in Sweden and the Netherlands, respectively, represented a turning point in the way countries and cities viewed road safety. As the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD's) International Transport Forum stated in their Towards Zero report: 'a Safe System approach implies a greater level of vision, together with a greater level of individual and societal commitment to safety in the road transport system' (p. 111). In fact, while road users — motorists, motorcyclist, cyclists and pedestrians — have long carried the burden of traffic safety, jurisdictions adopting this approach agree that road transport system designers are accountable for the level of safety within the system. This is even more relevant in the case of children and youth, who historically carry this burden inequitably by being blamed for their own injuries and by having restrictions on their independent mobility because of traffic. It aims to reverse the principle of liability in the event of a collision. In other words, road users are responsible for following the rules of the roads, but they may sometimes fail to obey these rules either intentionally (eg, speeding) or due to human error (eg, lack of knowledge or ability). In such situations, the road system should be ready to counteract such human failures and thus help avoid injuries or deaths through design. In short, the foundation of this paradigm shift is to intervene upstream, at the level of the road design, in order to avoid crashes at their source. This approach aims to ensure a safe system for all road users.

### Leveraging transportation providers to deploy lay first responder (LFR) programs in three sub-saharan African countries without formal emergency medical services: evaluating longitudinal impact and cost-effectiveness [^441f5660]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2019, the World Health Assembly declared emergency care essential to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Few sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries have developed robust approaches to sustainably deliver emergency medical services (EMS) at scale, as high-income country models are financially impractical. Innovative reassessment of EMS delivery in resource-limited settings is necessary as timely emergency care access can substantially reduce mortality.

Materials and Methods

We developed the Lay First Responder (LFR) program by training 1,291 pre-existing motorcycle taxi drivers, a predominant form of short-distance transport in sub-Saharan Africa, to provide trauma care and transport for road traffic injuries. Three pilot programs were launched in staggered fashion between 2016 and 2019 in West, Central, and East Africa and a 5.5 h curriculum was iteratively developed to train first responders. Longitudinal data on patient impact (patient demographics, injury characteristics, and treatment rendered), emergency care knowledge acquisition/retention, and social/financial effects of LFR training were collected and pooled across three sites for collective analysis. Novel cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated based on prospective cost data from each site. Previously projected aggregate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) addressable by LFRs were used to inform cost-effectiveness ratios($USD cost per DALY averted). Cost-effectiveness ratios were then compared against African per capita gross domestic product (GDP), following WHOCHOICE guidelines, which state ratios less than GDP per capita are "very cost-effective".

Results

In 2,171 total patient encounters across all three pilot sites, LFRs most frequently provided hemorrhage control in 61% of patient encounters and patient transport by motorcycle in 98.5%. Median pre-/post-test scores improved by 34.1 percentage points (39.5% vs.73.6%, p < 0.0001) with significant knowledge retention at six months. 75% of initial participants remain voluntarily involved 3 years post-course, reporting increased local stature and customer acquisition(income 32.0% greater than non-trained counterparts). Locally sourced first-aid materials cost $6.54USD/participant. Cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated cost per DALY averted = $51.65USD.

Conclusion

LFR training is highly cost-effective according to WHOCHOICE guidelines and expands emergency care access. The LFR program may be an alternative approach to formal ambulance-reliant EMS that are cost-prohibitive in resource-limited, sub-Saharan African settings. A novel social/financial mechanism appears to incentivize long-term voluntary LFR involvement, which may sustain programs in resource-limited settings.

### Database improvements for motor vehicle / bicycle crash analysis [^3ea62689]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

Entering new bicycle-crash-scene variables can be worthwhile because in the USA the focus has been on bike laneswhile recent research has suggested the safety of cycle tracks. With bicycle-crash-scene spreadsheet codes, associations could be found between environments plus motor vehicle/bicycle potential impact points, motor vehicles and injuries, especially when merged with big data including emergency medical services, insurance, etc. These bicycle-crash-scene data are informative because, unlike a motor vehicle, a bicyclist can be negatively impacted by opened car doorsor by the direction of travel or turning of a motor vehicle. Additionally, before a crash 11% of car drivers saw the bicyclist while 68% of the bicyclists saw the car. If environments and crash patterns were coded for motor vehicle/bicyclist crashes, intersections might be better understood and designed to lessen the looked-but-failed-to-see-errors. Better data leading to better analysis would also inform bicyclist and driver education efforts.

With bicycle-crash-scene spreadsheet codes, access to and use of data would be improved. Now, a research team can request the VIN's first 11 digits but this information is then only available to that team. Current codes include the chassis size, yet many vehicle descriptors are less relevant to bicycle safety. Motor vehicles have been improved to protect the occupantsand perhaps, with the 11 digit VIN more widely available and different motor vehicle categories, motor vehicles could also be designed to better protect bicyclists.

Adding bicycle categories has been recommended but with fewer specifics. Researchers in Minnesota only recommended the addition of on-street and off-street bicycle facilities. Analysis of bicycle crash types in North Carolina (2006–2010) suggested the addition of environments but only bike lanes or multiuse paths were recommended in the study for the North Carolina Department of Transportation. Because having no side path law means a bicyclist could ride in the road, cycle track or lane, a code could identify whether the bicyclist was in or out of that facility.

### The commercial motor vehicle driver medical examination: practical issues [^02569934]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The commercial motor vehicle driver medical examination aims to ensure that commercial drivers can safely perform all driving and nondriving work-related tasks. In conducting the examination and completing the related certification, the medical examiner must follow mandated medical standards and consider medical advisory criteria. Examiners should consider the substantial expert guidance provided in making certification determinations. For several common conditions, regulations and guidance are currently under review by medical review boards and expert panels, and major updates are likely in the near future. In addition, legislative changes are likely to require specific training and certification for medical examiners. These changes aim to increase the effectiveness of the commercial motor vehicle driver medical examination as a public health safeguard by reducing commercial motor vehicle crashes.

Same-day discharge after PCI — postprocedure and predischarge steps emphasize stability confirmation and discharge readiness. The postprocedure checklist focuses on the absence or presence of factors that indicate the patient's clinical stability, and procedural success is only 1 of the factors because hospitalization may coincide with other events such as exacerbation of underlying disease or change in baseline mental state. At predischarge, the care team confirms the absence of postprocedural exclusions, reconfirms completion of all portions of the checklist, and ensures that discharge instructions are communicated to the patient; the pre-discharge section should be completed after it has been determined that the patient meets all of the preprocedure and postprocedure criteria for SDD. Items include ensuring appropriate instructions for medication and for monitoring the access site, and providing at least 7 days of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) prior to discharge is preferred, when possible, to minimize gaps in antiplatelet coverage. A specific person should be designated to contact the patient the day after discharge, and level of activity after SDD, including driving, should follow local protocols. Figure 2 presents 6 clinical scenarios for applying the checklist, with 4 additional scenarios in Supplemental Figure 1.

Data Analyses Race

Before race data analysis, outlier values of PO above 2*POpeak and HR below the HR at rest were replaced by the average of the values before and after the data point, because they are thought to be unrealistic, that is, erroneous values. The total time the participant spent on stops during the race (%time stopped) was calculated as the time that both speed and cadence were 0 (in meters per second or rpm, respectively), which was divided by the total race time. Furthermore, data points where the speed was 0 m/sec but cadence greater than 0 rpm were considered errors and not used for further analysis. When, as a result, a data set had too many missing data (> 10% of the data), this data set/participant was excluded from the study.

The valid race data were used to determine the mean and peak values for HR (in bpm), PO (in watts), cadence (in rpm), and velocity (v in meters per second). The mean and peak HR and PO were also expressed as percentage of the peak value achieved during the GXT.

The VT1 and VT2 determined in the GXT were used to calculate three PO and HR zones. In zone 1, the PO or HR during the race is below the PO or HR at VT1 (low intensity). In zone 2, the PO or HR during the race lies in between the PO or HR at VT1 and VT2 (moderate intensity), that is, lactate begins to accumulate in the blood and the breathing rate begins to increase. In zone 3, the HR or PO during the race is above the PO or HR at VT2 (high intensity), that is, lactate quickly accumulates in the blood and the person needs to breathe heavily. The amount of time spend in every HR and PO zone during the race was calculated as a percentage of the total race time.

### How does mode of travel affect risks posed to other road users? An analysis of english road fatality data, incorporating gender and road type [^635f7f93]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

To calculate and compare risk posed to ORUs, we needed first to attribute each casualty to another vehicle involved. Hence, we have not included the 24% of fatalities where no other vehicle was involved, and excluded 3% with unknown vehicle type. Most remaining casualties (85% of all casualties and 75% of fatalities) only involve one other vehicle, and for these, each casualty was automatically associated with that other vehicle. For instance, for a cycle-car collision injuring both a car occupant and cyclist, the injured cyclist is assigned to the car, and the car occupant to the cycle.

For incidents involving multiple vehicles of the same size, each casualty was assigned to one other vehicle chosen at random. Where vehicles of different sizes were involved, we assigned each casualty to the largest other vehicle involved. As a sensitivity analysis, in online supplementary appendix 1 we provide headline results excluding collisions with more than one other vehicle involved (online supplementary figure 1). We excluded fatalities on motorways, which prohibit pedestrians, non-motorised and low-powered vehicles. This gave a dataset of 14 425 fatalities between 2005 and 2015 (69% of all fatalities), including 4509 pedestrians.

### Announcement: world day of remembrance for road traffic victims-November 19, 2017 [^1a527078]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

In October 2005, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to mark the third Sunday in November each year as World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims to honor persons killed or injured in road crashes, recognize their families and communities, and pay tribute to the emergency crews, police, and medical professionals who deal with the traumatic aftermath of road deaths and injuries. *

Road traffic injuries are the ninth leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of death among persons aged 15–29 years. Approximately 1.25 million persons die each year on the world's roads, and 20 million to 50 million sustain nonfatal injuries. Although 90% of road traffic deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries, approximately 100 persons die and thousands more are injured in motor vehicle crashes every day in the United States.

A 2016 CDC study found that, among 19 high-income countries, the United States had the most motor vehicle crash deaths per 100,000 persons and per 10,000 registered vehicles, the second highest percentage of deaths involving alcohol-impaired driving, and the third lowest use of front seat belts. Recent trends do not show evidence of improvement. In 2016, a total of 37,461 persons were killed in road traffic crashes in the United States, a 5.6% increase from 2015.

The U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Safety Council have joined with partners, including CDC, to launch the Road to Zero Coalition, with the goal of eliminating U.S. traffic deaths by 2050. In the United States alone, implementing proven effective strategies to prevent road traffic deaths can save thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars. A new Road Safety Annual Report released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provides a global perspective. It outlines specific recommendations, potential numbers of lives saved, and potential economic losses prevented in International Road Traffic and Accident Database member and observer countries.

CDC supports United Nations and World Health Organization measures to dedicate 2011–2020 as the Decade of Action for Road Safety. The program was launched in May 2011 in approximately 100 countries, with the goal of preventing 5 million road traffic deaths globally by 2020. The United Nations is committed to measures to halve the number of global road traffic deaths and injuries by 2020 as one of its Sustainable Development Goals. Strategies to support victims and survivors and a guide for nongovernmental organizations are available at.

The health, social and economic burden of road traffic injuries and deaths is extremely high. Each year there are approximately 1.35 million road traffic deaths worldwide. There is significant variation in rates across countries, however, with low/middle-income countries (LMIC) accounting for 90% of all road traffic deaths according to the 2018 WHO Global Status Report on Road Safety. Vulnerable road users, including pedestrians and cyclists, make up a substantial proportion of those deaths. Efforts to reduce pedestrian and cyclist casualties have been less successful than for motor vehicle occupants.

Child and youth pedestrians (2–20 years) are at particular risk of a pedestrian motor vehicle collision (PMVC) because of their limited developmental capacity to perceive road and traffic threats. Children are also vulnerable to severe injury and fatalities because of their small stature. In 2016, there were approximately 72 000 pedestrian fatalities among children and youth (0–20 years) worldwide.

### Comparing the effects of infrastructure on bicycling injury at intersections and non-intersections using a case-crossover design [^2cf94375]. Injury Prevention (2013). Low credibility.

Trained observers completed a site observation formdeveloped for the study in consultation with transportation engineering personnel. The form was pretested for feasibility, detail and clarity at 16 sites, revised, then tested for intra-observer reliability at 25 sites, reported elsewhere. The observers were blinded to the injury or control status of the sites. Observations were timed to match the time of day of the injury trip (weekday vs weekend; morning rush, mid-day, afternoon rush, evening, night). The observation form recorded information at the location of the cyclist at each site and considered the cyclist's direction of travel. Observations included the characteristics of the routes and intersecting streets, the presence of cycling infrastructure (eg, bike lanes, cycle tracks, signage), presence and type of intersection (eg, two-way stop, four-way stop, stoplight, traffic circle), streetcar tracks and street lighting. Measurements included surface grade (measured using a Suunto PM-5 clinometer, Vantaa, Finland), distance visible along the direction of travel (measured using a Rolatape Measure Master MM-12 trundle wheel, Watseka, Illinois, USA), counts of motor vehicle, cyclist and/or pedestrian traffic volume in 5 min in both directions and average motor vehicle traffic speed (five vehicles measured at normal traffic speeds, ie, not as they were accelerating from or decelerating to a stop, using a Bushnell Velocity Speed Gun, Overland Park, Kansas, USA).

Separate analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of infrastructure (table 1) in crashes occurring at intersections and non-intersections. Conditional logistic regression with one or two control sites per injury site was used to estimate associations between injury and infrastructural characteristics. The dependent variable was binary (1 = injury site or 0 = control site), and OR were calculated using the following model:where π ij is the probability of injury for the ith subject and jth site, given the covariates x ij1, x ij2,…, x ijp. i = 1,…, N; j = 1,…, n i. N is the number of subjects; n i = 2 if there was one injury site and one control site and n i = 3 if there was one injury site and two control sites; and p is the number of covariates.

### Bicycle and pedestrian curricula guide: making the case for bicycle and pedestrian youth education [^7de23c43]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

WalkSafe Educational Curriculum — pedestrian safety education for elementary school-aged children is designed to guide educators in teaching important pedestrian safety and health lessons and is intended to be taught over a three-day period (30 minutes per day). It is available in three versions – one for kindergarten-1st grades, one for 2nd-3rd grades, and one for 4th-5th grades for Grades: K - 5th, and uses a Teaching Method: Teacher-led/Train-the-trainer with Program Duration: 1.5 hours of instructional time (three days, 30 minutes per day); 15–30 minutes for train-the-trainer web-based training; Measures Student Learning Through Pre/Post Testing: Yes (assessment is available, but not required.). Subject: Pedestrian and Includes Skill Based Education: Yes; the program Requires Equipment: Yes. Requires cones, chalk or rope (any material that can be used to create a simulated road); paper and drawing materials, and Cost: Free; Wrap Around Materials (i.e. materials that are sent home and support in classroom lessons): Yes, English, Spanish and Haitian-Creole, with Adaptations for Special Needs Students (or scalable to various skill levels): Yes (additionally, modified curriculum for children with special needs will be available in summer 2011). An Example of Success Story notes it consistently reaches more than 140,000 kindergarten through 5th grade students in Miami-Dade each year and that Miami-Dade County Level One Trauma Centers have observed a 62% decrease in child pedestrian-hit-by-car admissions.

### The teen driver [^6fcfd4f1]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

The Teen Driver — motor vehicle crashes are the most common cause of mortality and injury for adolescents and young adults in developed countries, and teen drivers (15–19 years of age) have the highest rate of motor vehicle crashes among all age groups in the United States and contribute disproportionately to traffic fatalities. Among child passengers, more than half of 8- to 17-year-old children who die in car crashes are killed as passengers of drivers younger than 20 years of age. Novice adolescent drivers (those with < 18 months of driving experience) are at 4 times the overall risk of crash or near-crash events, and per mile driven, drivers 16 through 19 years of age have the highest rates of crash involvement. This policy statement was reaffirmed in April 2021 with reference and data updates.

### Generating a city's first report on bicyclist safety: lessons from the field [^eae0c640]. Injury Prevention (2018). Low credibility.

Background

For cities aiming to create a useful surveillance system for bicycle injuries, a common challenge is that city crash reporting is scattered, faulty or non-existent. We document some of the lessons we learnt in helping the city of Boston, Massachusetts, USA, do the following: (1) Create a prototype for a comprehensive police crash data set (2) Produce the city's first cyclist safety report, (3) Make crash data available to the public and (4) Generate policy recommendations for both specific roadside improvements and for sustainable changes to the police department's crash reporting database.

Methods

We provided research and technical assistance to government partners to generate the report and used participant-observation field notes to generate the list of learnt lessons.

Results

After the release of the report, the city implemented immediate activities aimed at making an effort to prevent injuries, including: (1) Furnishing over 1800 taxis with stickers to prevent 'dooring', (2) Adding pavement markings at trolley tracks to decrease the likelihood that cyclists would fall from getting their wheels lodged in the tracks, (3) Conducting targeted enforcement of traffic laws and (4) Working directly with state and federal agencies to fund a more comprehensive surveillance system. As of January of 2017, nearly 4years after its public release, 19170 users have viewed the crash data set 23247 times. Some of the lessons include finding and using committed champions, prioritising the use of existing data, creating opportunities to bridge divisions between stakeholders, partnering with local universities for assistance with advanced analytics and using deliverables, such as a cyclist safety report, to advocate for sustainability.

Conclusion

Providing an initial report on bicycle crashes in Boston served to identify specific problems, showed the value of a data system, and provided a blueprint for an improved data system. Building a useful surveillance system depends in no small part on the wise use of advocacy, group dynamics, and politics. Our hope is that the lessons learnt from our experience in Boston can help others do even better.

### An international review of the frequency of single-bicycle crashes (SBCs) and their relation to bicycle modal share [^2fb91cb7]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

Other studies have shown that the number of cyclist casualties in collisions (per passing cyclist or per kilometre cycled) reduces as the amount of cycling increases. For instance, according to Jacobsen, taking into account the amount of cycling, the probability that a motorist will collide with a cyclist declines with the roughly −0.6 power of the volume of cyclists. This phenomenon — that the increase in injury is not directly proportional to the increase in the number of cyclists on the road — has been called the non-linearity of risk. The relatively constant distribution between SBCs and other crash types irrespective of the modal split suggests that the non-linearity of risk applies to all bicycle crash types including SBCs. To illustrate this, we may suppose the non-linearity only applies to MV-B crashes. In this case, the occurrence of MV-B crashes would decrease with increasing shares of cycling in the modal split, while the number of SBCs would remain constant. The result would be a decrease in the share of MV-B crashes and an increase in the share of SBCs among cycling injuries as modal share of cycling increases. Table 3 presents insignificant correlations (0.01 for fatalities; 0.09 for hospitalised casualties) showing that the latter is not the case. This result is in accordance with earlier research suggesting a non-linear relationship between risk and exposure for SBCs and suggests that this also applies to fatal SBCs.

### Generating consensus on road safety issues and priorities in Ghana: a modified Delphi approach [^83f571a9]. Injury (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Implementation of evidence-based approaches to reduce the substantial health, social, and financial burdens of road traffic injuries and deaths in Ghana and other low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) is vitally important. Consensus from national stakeholders can provide insight into what evidence to generate and which interventions to prioritize for road safety. The main objective of this study was to elicit expert views on the barriers to reaching international and national road safety targets, the gaps in national-level research, implementation, and evaluation, and the future action priorities.

Materials and Methods

We used an iterative three-round modified Delphi process to generate consensus among Ghanaian road safety stakeholders. We defined consensus as 70% or more stakeholders selecting a specific response in the survey. We defined partial consensus (termed "majority") as 50% or more stakeholders selecting a particular response.

Results

Twenty-three stakeholders from different sectors participated. Experts generated consensus on barriers to road safety goals, including the poor regulation of commercial and public transport vehicles and limited use of technology to monitor and enforce traffic behaviors and laws. Stakeholders agreed that the impact of increasing motorcycle (2- and 3-wheel) use on road traffic injury burden is poorly understood and that it is a priority to evaluate road-user risk factors such as speed, helmet use, driving skills, and distracted driving. One emerging area was the impact of unattended/disabled vehicles along roadways. There was consensus on the need for additional research, implementation, and evaluation efforts of several interventions, including focused treatment of hazardous spots, driver training, road safety education as part of academic curricula, promotion of community involvement in first aid, development of strategically positioned trauma centers, and towing of disabled vehicles.

Conclusion

This modified Delphi process with stakeholders from Ghana generated consensus on road safety research, implementation, and evaluation priorities.

### The impact of pedestrian countdown signals on pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions: a reanalysis of data from a quasi-experimental study [^5a56c63d]. Injury Prevention (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The reanalyses of these data presents a more sophisticated statistical modelling approach than the model previously published. The original analysis by Camden et al failed to account for temporal and seasonal effects. The analytical approach used in this paper, controlling for temporal and seasonal effects, as well as baseline PMVC rates, enhances the interpretation of the data by allowing an unbiased assessment of the effect of PCS installation, in the city of Toronto.

This analysis demonstrated an increase in PMVC rates of 26% at intersections, post-PCS installation. The increase in PMVC rate was more pronounced in adults, and for severe and fatal collisions. These results controlled for baseline PMVC rate, season, as well as installation year.

These observations may be explained if the driver, the pedestrian, or both are choosing to enter an intersection when there is inadequate time for safe crossing. If pedestrians are hurrying, they may fail to adequately assess the traffic environment, or may complete the crossing during a 'no walking' phase. If drivers are hurrying, they may also fail to assess the environment, and/or increase their speed. Pedestrians may also perceive that the remaining posted time is sufficient for crossing, or make hasty decisions knowing the time required between light changes. To save time, pedestrians may assume a larger risk of crossing with less time available.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^45deacdb]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Studies have shown that prompts are an effective intervention in changing step behaviour for most participants. As different demographic groups exercise at different timings (e.g. working versus older adults), personalised prompts may be more beneficial at specific times convenient for individuals. We provide the step counts that participants should achieve in the evenings to ensure they achieve the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) by the end of the day (Table 3 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). These recommendations could then be experimentally tested in future studies.

The results suggest that the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) influenced the steps behaviour of the participants. The number of participant days rose sharply from 1090 (2.08%) with 9500–9999 steps to 7507 (14.3%) with 10,000 to 10,499 steps (Fig. 1a). The increase in the HealthPoints earned (from 25 (7500–9999 steps) to 40 (10,000 steps and above) HealthPoints) would reduce the days required to complete the first tier from 30 to 19 days (Supplementary Table S1). By setting a 10,000 daily step goal, participants whose daily step counts were just below 10,000 could have been motivated by the incentives to put in extra effort to achieve the goal, leading to the observed spike. However, we also observed a decreasing number of participant days after each goal, which may indicate that participants lose motivation once the goal has been achieved.

### Physiological and perceptual responses in spinal cord injury handcyclists during an endurance interval training: the role of critical speed [^41c43d63]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study sought to determine the physiological (oxygen uptake, heart rate, and blood lactate concentration) and perceptual (rating of perceived exertion) responses during an endurance interval training at the critical speed in elite handcyclists with spinal cord injury.

Design

Eight handcyclists performed an incremental test, three tests to exhaustion at a constant speed to determine critical speed, and the endurance interval training. The endurance interval training consisted of 6 × 5 mins at the individualized critical speed, with passive recovery of 50 secs. All testing was performed using their own handcycles on an oversized motorized treadmill. Physiological and perceptual responses were assessed during the incremental and endurance interval training tests.

Results

There was no significant difference in average oxygen uptake from the first to the sixth repetition. The mean ∆[La-]10_last between the 10th to the 30th minute of the exercise was -0.36 mmol·l-1, and no difference was detected from the first to the sixth repetition. The heart rate also remained stable during endurance interval training, whereas rating of perceived exertion increased significantly throughout the session.

Conclusions

Repetitions of 5 mins at the critical speed in elite handcyclists are associated with cardiorespiratory and lactate steady state, whereas the perceived exertion increased systematically.

### Motorcycle casualties sustained during daytona beach bike week 2000: lessons learned [^fc46cc60]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objective

In March 2000, an estimated 500,000 people attended an annual motorcycle rally in Daytona Beach, FL, where approximately 64,000 residents live year-round. The media reported 15 deaths during this 10-day event. To more comprehensively assess the extent of trauma and need for emergency medical care, we investigated all motorcycle crashes, regardless of outcome.

Methods

Motorcycle-related crash data from local medical examiner, hospital, emergency medical services (EMS), and police sources were linked. Frequencies of crashes, injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths were determined, and EMS use data were analyzed.

Results

During Bike Week 2000, 570 people were involved in 281 motorcycle-related crashes. Two hundred thirty (40%) people were injured, of which 147 (64%) sought treatment in emergency departments, 72 (31%) were hospitalized, and 11 (5%) died. In crashes between motorcycles and passenger cars, individuals exposed as motorcycle occupants were 8.7 times more likely to be injured than car occupants (95% confidence limit 1.7, 15.7). Of 205 EMS dispatches for motorcycle-related crashes, two thirds resulted in transport to an ED. Data needed to assess known risk factors (eg, alcohol use, speed, lack of helmet use) were not routinely ascertained at either the crash site or ED.

Conclusion

Although fatalities first called attention to the problem, nonfatal injuries outnumbered deaths 20:1. The manpower resources of civil service and health resources could become overwhelmed or exhausted in circumstances in which many people are injured or killed throughout a relatively long period. The situation deserves future study. Better risk factor surveillance is needed to help prevent crashes.

### A comprehensive report on all-terrain vehicles and youth: continuing challenges for injury prevention [^85b4cbff]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

All-terrain vehicle (ATV) adult model specifications and exposure show increasing size, speed, and ownership: before 1998, most adult ATVs had engine sizes ranging from 90 mL to 350 mL and weights of around 150 to 300 pounds; current adult models have engine sizes up to 1000 mL, weights over 800 pounds, and many models can achieve speeds over 70 mph. The estimated number of ATVs in use in the United States increased from fewer than 4 million in 1999 to more than 10 million in 2008, and ~12% of all Americans 33 to 49 years of age own an ATV.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^efb3be94]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1 shows the demographics of the 3075 participants. Since each participant had multiple data points, with a mean of 17.0 observations per participant, there were 17.0307552,346 participant days (Table 2).

There were spikes at the three daily step goals (5000, 7500, and 10,000 steps corresponding to 10, 25, and 40 HealthPoints; Fig. 1a), with a huge spike at 10,000 steps. The number of participant days rose sharply from 1090 (2.08%) with 9500–9999 steps to 7507 (14.3%) with 10,000–10,499 steps. Similarly, there were 926 (1.77%) participant-days with 4500–4999 steps, 1518 (2.90%) participant-days with 5000–5499 steps, 1222 (2.33%) participant-days with 7000–7499 steps and 1689 (3.23%) participant-days with 7500–7999 steps. There was a higher percentage of participant days with 10,000 or more steps among participants aged 60 and above (72.5%) compared to participants aged between 30 and 59 (57.2%) (Fig. 1d).

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2019 update [^873a47de]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Submerging vehicle escape — timing and sequence: Studies suggest that 10% of drowning deaths may be due to entrapment in submerged vehicles and that in the case of inland flooding as much as 10% of motor vehicle crashes result in a drowning death; research data from 35 vehicle submersions indicate that advice to stay in a sinking vehicle is erroneous. Evidence suggests the best time to escape is immediately during the initial floating phase, ideally during the initial 30 s to 2 min after water entry, and the SWOC algorithm recommends Seatbelts off, Window open, Out immediately, Children first; a 2008 dispatcher protocol recommends that a caller exit the vehicle immediately if it is submerging and use the SWOC protocol. The recommendation states that the safest time to escape from a submerging vehicle is immediately after it enters the water during the initial floating phase; if the vehicle remains floating, persons should climb out and remain on top of the vehicle, and if it is sinking, they should move away from the vehicle and toward safety after exiting (Recommendation Grade: 2C).

### During cycling what limits maximum mechanical power output at cadences above 120 rpm? [^011ed250]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

When a human pedals on a bicycle, appropriate joint actions and coordination across the multiple limb segments must occur to generate the required movement patterns and reaction forces at the pedal. Activity across multiple muscles in the leg is, therefore, required, with timing and coordination between muscles critical factors in determining power output and efficiency.

One of the key determinants of muscle coordination and movement efficiency during cycling is pedaling cadence. Ninety revolutions per minute has been suggested to be an optimal cadence for delaying neuromuscular fatigue and has been related to minimization of muscle forces, stress, and activation during cycling. Long distance, endurance trained athletes tend to have a preferred pedaling cadence between 85 and 95 rpm. In contrast, maximum power output is achieved when pedaling at cadences between 110 and 120 rpm, close to the cadences often observed in track cyclists completing shorter distance, power-based events (e.g. 110–135 rpm team pursuit Fig. 1 in). Interestingly, cadences above 120 rpm are associated with a wide range of changes spanning features of force application, multimuscle coordination, and excitation patterns of individual muscles all of which reduce maximum power output.

At the individual muscle level, cadences faster than 120 rpm are related to increased excitation and constant burst durations that, coupled with the shorter pedal cycle durations, result in longer duty cycles. In some muscles cadences above 120 rpm also lead to preferential recruitment of faster motor unit populations and early derecruitment of slower motor unit populations in each excitation burst. These factors seem important for force production, particularly at very high cadences, and for forces to be produced efficiently under such conditions. At the level of the whole limb, efficiency is seen to reduce beyond cadences of 120–140 rpm, whereas reductions in the variability of muscle coordination patterns suggest limitations in coordination begin to occur. The net effect of these changes, from a mechanical perspective, is an increase in the ineffective forces applied to the pedals. Distinct changes in behavior are, therefore, apparent at different levels of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems, which taken together reduce the power output that can be generated within the constraint of shorter pedal cycle durations.

### Motorized 2–3 wheelers death rates over a decade: a global study [^d94d1547]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the last decade, more than 13 million people died from road traffic collisions (RTCs). Around 2 billion vehicles are used globally of which 30% are motorized 2–3 wheelers. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) use 88% of these wheelers of which 75% are in Southeast Asia. There is a rapid increase in the use of motorized 2–3 wheelers worldwide because of their availability, flexibility, and affordability with the highest growth rate is in Southeast Asia (39%). Riding a motorized 2–3 wheeler is very risky because of the high speed and the exposed bodies of the driver and passenger. The risk of death from a crash is 28 to 34 times higher than for a car occupant. A quarter of road traffic deaths involve motorized 2–3 wheelers, with approximately 3.2 million deaths over the past decade.

In response to this growing burden, the United Nations (UN) approved a Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020 aiming to reduce road deaths by half in 2020. Continuous evaluation of the global changes is essential to find whether the action plan is properly progressing. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Status Reports on Road Safety plays an important role in this evaluation. Although previous studies have examined the factors affecting the global motorized 2–3-wheeler-related deaths, they neither used repeated time global data nor examined the factors affecting the change over time. Thus, we aimed to study the factors affecting the death rates of motorized 2–3 wheeler injured victims over time and whether the reduction in death rates has met the UN target.

### Database improvements for motor vehicle / bicycle crash analysis [^9b247a7a]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Fifty-one state crash report templates and the MMUCC template were analysed and pedal-cyclist/bicyclist and helmet are the only bicycle-relevant information consistently entered as coded data into the state spreadsheet about each crash. To conduct more analysis, full crash reports with the text and drawings were obtained and redrawn using Google street view. This process was labour-intensive, the extracted variables were only available to this team, and the Google street views changed during the analysis as some of the cycle tracks were under construction.

Because improvements are being made to crash reporting, bicyclist-crash-scene variables could be coded on a police electronic tablet with a drop-down template for motor vehicle/bicycle crashes and uploaded automatically into the state spreadsheet database. Our research suggests that new bicycle-crash-scene variables might be informative for analysis including: 4 bicycle environments (roads, sharrows, bike lanes and cycle tracks); 18 motor vehicle potential impact points including opened car doors and mirrors; 4 bicycle potential impact points; whether in or out of the bicycle environment; 10 bicycle-crash-scene patterns (turn/impact); and motor vehicle types relevant to bicyclists. Having these new variables revealed higher crash frequency on motor vehicle fronts, bicycle fronts, no bike facility, sedan and as sideswipes.

Compared with bicyclists hitting the back of the motor vehicle, opened motor vehicle doors and mirrors resulted in higher risk of severe injury and, compared with riding on roads without bicycle facilities, riding on roads with bike lanes but not riding on the lane resulted in lower risk of severe injury. These analyses were possible because the new bicycle variables were entered into the existing spreadsheet that already contained the categories for minor and severe/fatal injuries. While studying circumstances surrounding crashes using bicycle counts is valuable, collecting bicycle counts can be difficult, especially if counts are needed on all streets involved. If these new bicycle-crash-scene variables were entered into the existing spreadsheets, bicycling could be analysed with minor injuries as the control and severe injuries as the case. Though not as ideal as a comparison between no injury and injury, using the data in the spreadsheet at least enables a comparison between minor injury and severe injury.

### Database improvements for motor vehicle / bicycle crash analysis [^bc5a452b]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Bicycling is healthy but needs to be safer for more to bike. Police crash templates are designed for reporting crashes between motor vehicles, but not between vehicles/bicycles. If written/drawn bicycle-crash-scene details exist, these are not entered into spreadsheets.

Objective

To assess which bicycle-crash-scene data might be added to spreadsheets for analysis.

Methods

Police crash templates from 50 states were analysed. Reports for 3350 motor vehicle/bicycle crashes (2011) were obtained for the New York City area and 300 cases selected (with drawings and on roads with sharrows, bike lanes, cycle tracks and no bike provisions). Crashes were redrawn and new bicycle-crash-scene details were coded and entered into the existing spreadsheet. The association between severity of injuries and bicycle-crash-scene codes was evaluated using multiple logistic regression.

Results

Police templates only consistently include pedal-cyclist and helmet. Bicycle-crash-scene coded variables for templates could include: 4 bicycle environments, 18 vehicle impact-points (opened-doors and mirrors), 4 bicycle impact-points, motor vehicle/bicycle crash patterns, in/out of the bicycle environment and bike/relevant motor vehicle categories. A test of including these variables suggested that, with bicyclists who had minor injuries as the control group, bicyclists on roads with bike lanes riding outside the lane had lower likelihood of severe injuries (OR, 0.40, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.98) compared with bicyclists riding on roads without bicycle facilities.

Conclusions

Police templates should include additional bicycle-crash-scene codes for entry into spreadsheets. Crash analysis, including with big data, could then be conducted on bicycle environments, motor vehicle potential impact points/doors/mirrors, bicycle potential impact points, motor vehicle characteristics, location and injury.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Emergency department visits for pedestrians injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes-United States, January 2021-December 2023 [^4e722c01]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Traffic-related pedestrian deaths in the United States reached a 40-year high in 2021. Each year, pedestrians also suffer nonfatal traffic-related injuries requiring medical treatment. Near real-time emergency department visit data from CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program during January 2021-December 2023 indicated that among approximately 301 million visits identified, 137,325 involved a pedestrian injury (overall visit proportion = 45.62 per 100,000 visits). The proportions of visits for pedestrian injury were 1.53–2.47 times as high among six racial and ethnic minority groups as that among non-Hispanic White persons. Compared with persons aged ≥ 65 years, proportions among those aged 15–24 and 25–34 years were 2.83 and 2.61 times as high, respectively. The visit proportion was 1.93 times as high among males as among females, and 1.21 times as high during September-November as during June-August. Timely pedestrian injury data can help collaborating federal, state, and local partners rapidly monitor trends, identify disparities, and implement strategies supporting the Safe System approach, a framework for preventing traffic injuries among all road users.

### External and internal work load during a mountain time trial in trained handcyclists versus a world-class handcyclist and determinants of performance [^9176d2a2]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Trained Versus WC Athlete

The exercise profile of the total race is shown in Table 2. Seven trained handcyclists stopped less than 1% of the race time, while the three others stopped 5%, 18%, and 27% of the total race time. The fastest trained handcyclists finished the race 38 mins later than the WC handcyclist. While the race velocity, absolute PO, and cadence were lower in the trained handcyclists, the absolute and relative HR and relative PO were similar between the trained and WC handcyclists. On average, the trained handcyclists cycled significantly less in PO zone 2 and more in zone 3 compared with the WC handcyclist while no significant differences were found for time in HR zones.

Race Sections

Table 3 shows the exercise profile for the three different sections of the race. All outcome measures, except for %time in HR zones 1 and 2, showed a significant difference between the three race sections within the trained handcyclists. Post hoc tests showed that the mean velocity was higher and the POmean (in watts, watts per kilogram, and %POpeak) was lower during the flat section compared with the (semi)mountainous sections. On average, the trained handcyclists cycled more in PO zone 1 and less in PO zone 3 during the flat section compared with the other two sections. The HRpeak was lower during the flat section compared with the (semi)mountainous sections. As can been seen in Figure 2, the time spent in the PO and HR zones varied considerably among handcyclists.

### Influence of all-out and fast start on 5-min cycling time trial performance [^ee9ebd4f]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the influence of two different fast-start pacing strategies on performance and oxygen consumption (VO2) during cycle ergometer time trials lasting ∼5 min.

Methods

Eight trained male cyclists performed four cycle ergometer time trials whereby the total work completed (113 ± 11.5 kJ; mean ± SD) was identical to the better of two 5-min self-paced familiarization trials. During the performance trials, initial power output was manipulated to induce either an all-out or a fast start. Power output during the first 60 s of the fast-start trial was maintained at 471.0 ± 48.0 W, whereas the all-out start approximated a maximal starting effort for the first 15 s (mean power: 753.6 ± 76.5 W) followed by 45 s at a constant power output (376.8 ± 38.5 W). Irrespective of starting strategy, power output was controlled so that participants would complete the first quarter of the trial (28.3 ± 2.9 kJ) in 60 s. Participants performed two trials using each condition, with their fastest time trial compared.

Results

Performance time was significantly faster when cyclists adopted the all-out start (4 min 48 s ± 8 s) compared with the fast start (4 min 51 s ± 8 s; P < 0.05). The first-quarter VO2 during the all-out start trial (3.4 ± 0.4 L·min(-1)) was significantly higher than during the fast-start trial (3.1 ± 0.4 L·min(-1); P < 0.05). After removal of an outlier, the percentage increase in first-quarter VO2 was significantly correlated (r = -0.86, P < 0.05) with the relative difference in finishing time.

Conclusions

An all-out start produces superior middle distance cycling performance when compared with a fast start. The improvement in performance may be due to a faster VO2 response rather than time saved due to a rapid acceleration.

### A comprehensive report on all-terrain vehicles and youth: continuing challenges for injury prevention [^9e741ed1]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Scope of the problem — CPSC data from 1982 to 2015 indicate that ATV crashes have killed more than 3000 children younger than 16 years of age and resulted in emergency department (ED) visits for nearly a million more; over recent decades, children 15 years of age and younger have constituted approximately one-fifth of deaths and one-third of ED visits from ATV crashes. More children die each year on ATVs than in bicycle crashes, and every hour in the United States, ~ 4 pediatric patients are seen in an ED for an ATV-related injury.

### Estimating the burden of road traffic crashes in Uganda using police and health sector data sources [^a658d080]. Injury Prevention (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In many low-income countries, estimates of road injury burden are derived from police reports, and may not represent the complete picture of the burden in these countries. As a result, WHO and the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Project often use complex models to generate country-specific estimates. Although such estimates inform prevention targets, they may be limited by the incompleteness of the data and the assumptions used in the models. In this cross-sectional study, we provide an alternative approach to estimating road traffic injury burden for Uganda for the year 2016 using data from multiple data sources (the police, health facilities and mortuaries).

Methods

A digitised data collection tool was used to extract crash and injury information from files in 32 police stations, 31 health facilities and 4 mortuaries in Uganda. We estimated crash and injury burden using weights generated as inverse of the product of the probabilities of selection of police regions and stations.

Results

We estimated that 25 729 crashes occurred on Ugandan roads in 2016, involving 59 077 individuals with 7558 fatalities. This is more than twice the number of fatalities reported by the police for 2016 (3502) but lower than the estimate from the 2018 Global Status Report (12 036). Pedestrians accounted for the greatest proportion of the fatalities 2455 (32.5%), followed by motorcyclists 1357 (18%).

Conclusions

Using both police and health sector data gives more robust estimates for the road traffic burden in Uganda than using either source alone.

### CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE METHODOLOGY: methodology [^1ca4ad94]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical practice guideline development — topic selection, timeline, team composition, and grading indicate that each committee selects 2–3 new topics annually and the development process typically spans 24–36 months from initial topic selection to final publication. The process is led by a document writing team composed of committee members and subject matter experts, and Two committee members are selected to serve on the document writing team with the subject matter expert to develop the outline, synthesize evidence, propose recommendations, and author the manuscript. ACOG's guideline development process incorporates a modified GRADE framework, with recommendations classified by quality of evidence and strength of recommendation, and ungraded Good Practice Statements may be incorporated when evidence is extremely limited or nonexistent.

Engineering approaches — 3‑wheelers — The first ATVs were 3‑wheeled vehicles that were found to be particularly unstable, leading to a ban of their manufacture in 1988 but not their recall. Because of this, there are still 3‑wheeled ATVs in use with ongoing deaths and injuries, and the only way to prevent this is to make all existing 3‑wheelers inoperable and remove them from the secondary market.

Table 3
Step counts (based on increments of 500 steps) to accumulate in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps by the end of the day

Details on how these recommendations were derived are provided in the Supplementary Method.

*Same as the "Overall" group.

The step counts required in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps among participants aged 17–59 were similar but were generally more than those required for participants aged 60 and above (Table 3). There were also differences in the step counts required in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps among participants with BMI less than 27.5 kg/m 2 on weekdays.

Across different demographics, participants aged between 30 and 39 who had accumulated fewer than 7500 steps between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day compared to participants aged 60 and above (Supplementary Fig. S6). Males who had accumulated fewer than 5000 steps between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day compared to females on weekdays, and no sex differences among those who accumulated 5000 steps or more. Participants with normal BMI were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day on weekdays, but they could also have higher mean step counts on weekends compared to participants with obese BMI. The mean step difference between participants with normal BMI and participants with obese BMI decreased with time, with little difference at 10 p.m.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^588d8957]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 shows the predicted mean step counts and 95% CI for the rest of the day, given the step counts accumulated from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. adjusting for age group, BMI group and sex. Overall, there was little difference in the conditional predicted mean step counts for the rest of the days between the weekdays and the weekends. On weekdays, participants who accumulated 6000 steps by 6 p.m. had a 0.692 probability of achieving 10,000 steps (all the goals) by the end of the day (refer to the Goal 3 diagonal line in Fig. 3, Table 3, and Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, participants who had accumulated 7000 steps by 7 p.m. 8000 steps by 8 p.m. 8500 steps by 9 p.m. and 9500 steps by 10 p.m. achieved 10,000 mean steps by the end of the day with a probability of 0.910, 0.982, 0.700, and 1, respectively. On weekends, participants who had accumulated 6500 steps by 6 p.m. 7000 steps by 7 p.m. 8000 steps by 8 p.m. 8500 steps by 9 p.m. and 9500 steps by 10 p.m. achieved 10,000 mean steps by the end of the day with probability 0.852, 0.583, 0.947, 0.717 and 1, respectively. The step counts required to achieve 5000 and 7500 steps by the end of the day can be found in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, respectively.

### How Do the mechanical demands of cycling affect the information content of the EMG? [^6d0f44b4]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The persistence of phase-related information in EMG signals can be quantified by its entropic half-life (EnHL). It has been proposed that the EnHL would increase with the demands of a movement task, and thus increase as the pedaling power increased during cycling. However, simulation work on the properties of EMG signals suggests that the EnHL depends on burst duration and duty cycle in the EMG that may not be related to task demands. This study aimed to distinguish between these alternate hypotheses.

Methods

The EnHL was characterized for 10 muscles from nine cyclists cycling at a range of powers (35 to 260 W) and cadences (60–140 rpm) for the raw EMG, phase-randomized surrogate EMG, EMG intensity, and the principal components describing the muscle coordination patterns.

Results

There was phase-related information in the raw EMG signals and EMG intensities that was related to the EMG burst duration, duty cycle pedaling cadence, and power. The EnHL for the EMG intensities of the individual muscles (excluding quadriceps) and for the coordination patterns decreased as cycling power and cadence increased.

Conclusions

The EnHL provide information on the structure of the motor control signals and their constituent motor unit action potentials, both within and between muscles, rather than on the mechanical demands of the cycling task per se.

### Are mobile speed cameras effective? A controlled before and after study [^a5c63fb1]. Injury Prevention (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the most appropriate metric to determine the effectiveness of mobile speed cameras in reducing road traffic related injuries.

Design

Controlled before and after study which compares two methods for examining the local effectiveness of mobile speed cameras-a circular zone around the camera and a route based method to define exposure at various distances from sites.

Setting

South Wales, UK.

Subjects

Persons injured by road traffic before and after intervention.

Intervention

Use of mobile speed cameras at 101 sites.

Main Outcome Measures

Rate ratio of injurious crashes at intervention and control sites.

Results

Camera sites had lower than expected numbers of injurious crashes up to 300 metres using circles and up to 500 metres using routes. Routes methods indicated a larger effect than the circles method except in the 100 metres nearest sites. A 500 metre route method was used to investigate the effect within strata of time after intervention, time of day, speed limit, and type of road user injured. The number of injurious crashes after intervention was substantially reduced (rate ratio 0.49, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 0.57) and sustained throughout two years after intervention. Significant decreases occurred in daytime and night time, on roads with speed limits of 30 and 60–70 miles/hour and for crashes that injured pedestrians, motorcycle users, and car occupants.

Conclusions

The route based method is the better method of measure effectiveness at distances up to 500 metres. This method demonstrates a 51% reduction in injurious crashes.

### Contextualising safety in numbers: a longitudinal investigation into change in cycling safety in britain, 1991–2001 and 2001–2011 [^4878a5db]. Injury Prevention (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 'Safety in Numbers' (SiN) phenomenon refers to a decline of injury risk per time or distance exposed as use of a mode increases. It has been demonstrated for cycling using cross-sectional data, but little evidence exists as to whether the effect applies longitudinally -that is, whether changes in cycling levels correlate with changes in per-cyclist injury risks.

Methods

This paper examines cross-sectional and longitudinal SiN effects in 202 local authorities in Britain, using commuting data from 1991, 2001 and 2011 censuses plus police -recorded data on 'killed and seriously injured' (KSI) road traffic injuries. We modelled a log-linear relationship between number of injuries and number of cycle commuters. Second, we conducted longitudinal analysis to examine whether local authorities where commuter cycling increased became safer (and vice versa).

Results

The paper finds a cross-sectional SiN effect exists in the 1991, 2001 and 2011 censuses. The longitudinal analysis also found a SiN effect, that is, places where cycling increased were more likely to become safer than places where it had declined. Finally, these longitudinal results are placed in the context of changes in pedestrian, cyclist and motorist safety. While between 1991 and 2001 all modes saw declines in KSI risk (37% for pedestrians, 36% for cyclists and 27% for motor vehicle users), between 2001 and 2011 pedestrians and motorists saw even more substantial declines (41% and 49%), while risk for cyclists increased by 4%.

Conclusion

The SiN mechanism does seem to operate longitudinally as well as cross-sectionally. However, at a national level between 2001–11 it co-existed with an increase in cyclist injury risk both in absolute terms and in relation to other modes.

### Why a decade of road traffic safety? [^664f67ef]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2014). Low credibility.

Each year, 1.24 million people die as a result of road traffic collisions around the world, and millions more are left to suffer the resultant disabilities of their nonfatal typically musculoskeletal injuries. The most productive members of society are the ones affected the most, and the subsequent economic impact cannot be ignored. Reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with road traffic injuries will reduce suffering and increase available resources that can be used more effectively. Road traffic injuries are preventable, and the impact of those that do occur can be mitigated. Adequate national and global funding, strategy, and measurable targets are fundamental to a sustainable response to road safety. Over the last decade, the United Nations and World Health Organization have been part of the gaining momentum toward addressing this issue, through resolutions and coordinating global efforts. This is what brought about the "Decade of Action for Road Traffic Safety", and as orthopaedic surgeons, our involvement is key for the collaborative public health response toward this effort.

### Phase 0 / microdosing approaches: time for mainstream application in drug development? [^98d5620b]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2020). High credibility.

Phase 0 approaches - which include microdosing - evaluate subtherapeutic exposures of new drugs in first-in-human studies known as exploratory clinical trials. Recent progress extends phase 0 benefits beyond assessment of pharmacokinetics to include understanding of mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics. Phase 0 approaches have the potential to improve preclinical candidate selection and enable safer, cheaper, quicker and more informed developmental decisions. Here, we discuss phase 0 methods and applications, highlight their advantages over traditional strategies and address concerns related to extrapolation and developmental timelines. Although challenges remain, we propose that phase 0 approaches be at least considered for application in most drug development scenarios.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2024 update [^73053547]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Submerged vehicles — epidemiology and escape actions — Studies suggest that 10% of drowning deaths may be due to entrapment in submerged vehicles, and in the case of inland flooding as many as 10% of motor vehicle crashes result in a drowning death. Research data derived from 35 vehicle submersions indicate that the best time to escape from a submerging vehicle is immediately during the initial floating phase, ideally during the initial 30 s to 2 min after water entry when most vehicles remain partially above the surface. An algorithm using the acronym SWOC recommends the following sequencing of actions before mobile phone use: Seatbelts off, Window open (upstream window), Out immediately, Children first; available research points out that electric windows should work if engaged quickly, windows should be broken before water rises high enough to push against them, and children should be helped from the oldest to youngest and before adults. If the vehicle is in moving water, recommendations are to open the upstream window for egress, which will only be possible if the water level is below the level of the window.

### An international review of the frequency of single-bicycle crashes (SBCs) and their relation to bicycle modal share [^54d39408]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Between 60% and 95% of cyclists admitted to hospitals or treated at EDs are victims of SBCs showing the significance of this problem. As a proportion of the total number of hospitalised traffic casualties, the share averages at 20% which is about twice as high as the average bicycle modal share. The high number of cyclists injured in SBCs cause a significant health burden both directly (through the health and social care costs of injury and economic costs including absence from work and productivity losses) and indirectly (by discouraging more active and sustainable travel choices). The size of the problem warrants more research to inform and improve preventative measures. Moreover, this study shows the importance of using medical data alongside police data to achieve a more complete picture of the cycling safety issue as regards injuries admitted to hospital or treated at EDs.

In support of the hypothesis, we found that the increase in the share of SBC casualties in the total number of road crash casualties is proportionally less than the increase in the share of cycling in the modal split; increasing modal share does not appear to increase the SBC injury burden at the same rate. But this result was only statistically significant for hospitalised casualties, not for fatalities.

The proportion of cyclist casualties killed in or hospitalised due to SBCs is not found to be related to the share of cycling in the modal split. However, this probably only holds for currently observed modal shares and not for higher ones. It seems unlikely that were cycles to be used for almost 100% of journeys the injurious collisions with other cycles and pedestrians would increase sufficiently to replace the numbers of MV-B crashes, because the former are generally less serious than the latter. The authors suppose that there is a threshold in modal share of cyclists up to which increases do not result in significant increases in the proportion of cyclist casualties resulting from SBCs. Above this level, further increases in cycling as a share of all journeys will increase incidence of SBCs as a proportion of all cycle injuries. Further research into this phenomenon is required and, until then, the proven dissociation between modal share and SBC as a proportion of all injures needs to be qualified, because it may apply only to the modal share proportions of between 1% and 31% identified by and included in this report. Note that this line of reasoning is only relevant to shares of crash types and not to changes in absolute numbers of road crash casualties which is further discussed by others.

Engineering approaches — vehicle differential and rollover risk — The locked differential found in most ATVs can create difficult and unpredictable handling, particularly when negotiating a curve or making a turn, whereas improved safety might be achieved if all vehicles had an open differential that could be selectively locked or locked automatically when needed. An unlocked differential would likely result in fewer ATV rollovers, the most common crash mechanism.

Time to target and time within target

The median (IQR) time to achieve target range was 5.9 (3.8 to 8.9) hours. The median times to achieve target range were longer for higher initial BG; times to target (IQR) for baseline BG in ranges of more than 6.1 to 8.3, more than 8.3 to 11.1, more than 11.1 to 13.8, and more than 13.8 mmol/L were 3.8 (2.1 to 6.4), 5.8 (4.0 to 8.6), 6.8 (4.7 to 9.6), and 7.9 (5.4 to 11.0) hours, respectively. Kaplan-Meier time-to-event curves for the time to achieve target range demonstrate this dependence on the baseline BG (Figure 1). Almost all patients (97.5%) achieved the target range. Mean BG (± standard deviation (SD)) after achieving target was 5.4 (± 0.52) mmol/L. After reaching target, patients remained in target 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L, 73.4% of the time, and in the expanded ranges of 3.9 to 6.6 mmol/L and 3.9 to 8.3 mmol/L, 89.2% and 95.9% of the time respectively, over 50 hours of the drip run.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^503a1620]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bladder cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to systemic therapy for resectable disease (perioperative chemotherapy), NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend to do not substitute carboplatin for cisplatin in the perioperative bladder cancer setting. Consider administering a split-dose of cisplatin for patients with borderline renal function or minimal dysfunction (such as 35 mg/m² on days 1 and 2 or days 1 and 8) (category 2B). Recognize that while safer, the relative efficacy of the cisplatin-containing combination administered with such modifications remains undefined (category 2A).

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: sleep apnea, sleepiness, and driving risk in noncommercial drivers. An update of a 1994 statement [^2a24cafc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline — obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and driving risk — concludes that OSA versus non-OSA is associated with a two- to three-times increased overall risk for motor vehicle crashes, a high-risk driver is defined as one who has moderate to severe daytime sleepiness and a recent unintended motor vehicle crash or a near-miss attributable to sleepiness, fatigue, or inattention, there is no compelling evidence to restrict driving privileges in patients with sleep apnea if there has not been a motor vehicle crash or an equivalent event, treatment of OSA improves performance on driving simulators and might reduce the risk of drowsy driving and drowsy driving crashes, and timely diagnostic evaluation and treatment and education of the patient and family are likely to decrease the prevalence of sleepiness-related crashes in patients with OSA who are high-risk drivers; additionally, sleepiness may account for up to 20% of crashes on monotonous roads, especially highways.
