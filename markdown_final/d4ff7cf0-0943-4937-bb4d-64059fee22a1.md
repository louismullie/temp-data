## Question

what are the guidelines for prostate cancer screening in someone whose father had prostate cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prostate cancer screening guidelines for a man whose father had prostate cancer, including how family history affects the recommended age to start screening, screening intervals, thresholds, counseling on benefits and harms, and when to consider genetic testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the risk category conferred by a first-degree family history and whether it justifies earlier screening. Then, I should verify the starting ages recommended by major guidelines and reconcile any discrepancies. Next, I will examine the evidence on absolute benefits and harms to frame shared decision-making. After that, I should define appropriate screening intervals and whether MRI or other tools modify the pathway. Finally, I need to check indications for germline testing and summarize practical counseling points that align with patient values and life expectancy considerations.

> Let me first confirm the risk category: a father with prostate cancer constitutes a first-degree family history, which places the patient in a higher-risk group for earlier screening discussions and may modestly increase baseline risk, although randomized data have not shown a different relative mortality benefit from screening compared with average-risk men. I should be careful not to overstate benefit solely due to family history while acknowledging that higher baseline risk can yield a larger absolute benefit from the same relative risk reduction [^114wj7Eu] [^116zVqjc] [^112V81V9].

> Now, I need to check the age to start screening discussions. The American Cancer Society recommends initiating an informed decision-making conversation at age 45 for men with a first-degree relative diagnosed before age 65, and even earlier at age 40 if multiple first-degree relatives were diagnosed before 65, so a single paternal history generally supports starting at 45, with individualized consideration if the father was young at diagnosis or if there are additional affected relatives [^1173wSMU] [^114e4VAA].

> Wait, let me verify consistency across guidelines. The USPSTF advises individualized decisions in ages 55–69 for average and higher-risk men and notes that men with a family history may benefit from earlier discussions, while AUA/SUO recommends offering screening beginning at age 40–45 for those with a strong family history, and ESMO recommends considering earlier PSA screening from age 45 in men with a family history. Given this, a reasonable approach is to start shared decision-making at 45 for a man with one affected father, and consider 40–45 if the father was diagnosed at a young age or if multiple relatives are affected [^112V81V9] [^117JmwAA] [^1125wafw] [^111Hd5nN].

> Hold on, I should verify what constitutes "strong" family history because that drives earlier starts. The AUA/SUO guideline frames strong family history as one brother or father or two or more male relatives with early-onset disease, metastatic disease, or death from prostate cancer, so a single paternal history qualifies as increased risk, but multiple relatives or early diagnoses push toward the 40–45 range for initiating screening discussions [^116dPYfz] [^1125wafw].

> Next, I should review the benefit–harm balance to guide counseling. Screening men aged 55–69 yields a small absolute reduction in prostate cancer mortality of about 1.3 fewer deaths per 1000 men screened over roughly 13 years, but at the cost of false positives, overdiagnosis, and treatment harms such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, so shared decision-making is essential to align choices with patient values and comorbidities that may limit benefit [^112V81V9] [^111rsE6o].

> I need to ensure we incorporate life expectancy. The net benefit of screening accrues only in men with at least a 10-year life expectancy, and the USPSTF recommends against routine screening at age 70 and older due to diminishing benefit and greater harms, so for older men or those with substantial comorbidity, the conversation should pivot toward avoiding screening or discontinuing if already underway [^112V81V9] [^112aReUs].

> Let me consider intervals. Many guidelines converge on a 2–4 year interval for PSA screening rather than annual testing, and if a baseline PSA is low, extending to every 2 years is reasonable, whereas if PSA is 2.5 ng/mL or higher, annual reassessment is often used in higher-risk men. I should double-check that AUA/SUO supports 2–4 year intervals and discourages PSA velocity alone as an indication for escalation, which it does [^1149of81] [^112MZbEk] [^1166p5fS].

> I should confirm thresholds and secondary testing. A PSA of 4.0 ng/mL has long been a conventional referral threshold, but for men at higher risk, many clinicians consider a lower threshold around 2.5–4.0 ng/mL, especially with other risk enhancers. Importantly, an initially elevated PSA should be repeated before proceeding to biomarkers, MRI, or biopsy, and MRI before biopsy reduces unnecessary biopsies and can improve detection of clinically significant disease, so MRI has become a key gatekeeper in modern diagnostic pathways [^116dPYfz] [^117JmwAA] [^117V7Q7Q].

> But wait, what if we want to individualize beyond PSA? Validated risk calculators that incorporate age, race/ethnicity, PSA, percent free PSA, PSA density, DRE, prior biopsy, and family history can refine the probability of high-grade disease and inform the need for biopsy, and emerging data suggest polygenic risk scores can complement family history to identify men at highest risk of aggressive disease, though integration into routine practice is evolving and should be framed as adjunctive rather than definitive [^112nznDX] [^112KqHof] [^112hibJX].

> I will now examine indications for germline testing. Although an unaffected man with a single affected father is not automatically indicated for germline testing, a detailed pedigree should be obtained to look for patterns suggesting hereditary risk such as multiple first-degree relatives, early-onset diagnoses, or related cancers in HBOC or Lynch spectra. If such red flags are present, referral to genetic counseling and consideration of testing for genes like BRCA1/2, ATM, CHEK2, HOXB13, and DNA mismatch repair genes is appropriate, and testing is broadly recommended for men with metastatic, regional, or high/very-high-risk localized disease regardless of family history [^116bWYai] [^116L17wx] [^1166pprE].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that all men with a family history should get genetic testing, but I should correct that. Current guidance reserves germline testing for men with specific personal or family history features that raise suspicion for a hereditary cancer syndrome, so a solitary paternal history alone typically does not meet criteria, though evolving evidence suggests under-recognition of pathogenic variants, reinforcing the need for careful pedigree review and updated criteria [^113gGfAc] [^11667CBi].

> Let me reconsider the counseling flow. The visit should include a structured discussion of absolute benefits and harms, documentation of family history and ages at diagnosis, consideration of baseline PSA if screening is chosen, and alignment with life expectancy and patient preferences. Decision aids can help, and the decision should be revisited periodically as health status, values, or family history evolve, given that clinically significant family history can change over time [^114a5coV] [^112ZuAqT].

> To synthesize practical recommendations: for a man whose father had prostate cancer, start a shared decision-making conversation at age 45 about the option of PSA-based screening, consider starting at 40–45 if the father was diagnosed before 60 or if there are multiple affected relatives, use 2–4 year PSA intervals tailored to PSA level and risk, repeat an initially elevated PSA before proceeding, consider MRI before biopsy to reduce harms, apply a lower biopsy threshold around 2.5–4.0 ng/mL in higher-risk men within an informed framework, avoid screening if life expectancy is under 10 years or age is 70 and older, and consider genetic counseling if the pedigree suggests hereditary risk or if the patient develops high-risk disease features [^111Hd5nN] [^112MZbEk] [^1179TzBJ] [^112V81V9] [^117JmwAA] [^117V7Q7Q] [^116bWYai].

---

For men with a father with prostate cancer, screening should start at **age 40–45** [^114hmhTx] with a baseline PSA and shared decision-making [^117JmwAA] about benefits and harms [^113TBkoF]. If PSA is elevated or risk is high, **repeat PSA in 6–12 months** and consider MRI [^117V7Q7Q] before biopsy. Routine screening is not recommended after age 70 or if life expectancy is under 10 years [^112V81V9]. Strong family history (≥ 2 first-degree relatives or early onset) warrants earlier discussion and may prompt genetic counseling [^1179TzBJ] [^116bWYai].

---

## Risk associated with paternal history

Men with a father with prostate cancer have a **2–3-fold increased risk** [^112VrAMM] compared with those without a family history, and the risk rises with more affected relatives or earlier age at diagnosis [^112VrAMM]. This elevated risk supports earlier and more frequent screening.

---

## Recommended screening guidelines

| **Organization** | **Recommendation for men with paternal history** |
|-|-|
| American Cancer Society (ACS) | - Start informed decision-making at age 45 [^1173wSMU] <br/> - Consider at 40 if multiple first-degree relatives or early onset [^114e4VAA] |
| American Urological Association (AUA) | - Offer screening at 40–45 for increased risk (family history, Black ancestry, germline mutations) [^1125wafw] [^114i8Ms4] |
| European Association of Urology (EAU) | Consider early PSA screening from age 45 [^116YZumg] |
| National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) | - Baseline PSA at 40–45 for high-risk men [^111ga1cY] <br/> - Individualize interval based on risk [^notfound] |

---

These guidelines emphasize **shared decision-making** [^117JmwAA] and individualized screening intervals based on risk factors and patient preferences [^112MZbEk].

---

## Recommended screening tests

- **PSA test**: Primary screening tool; start at 40–45 for high-risk men [^117JmwAA].
- **Digital rectal exam (DRE)**: Optional adjunct to PSA, especially with abnormal PSA or high-risk features [^112MZbEk].
- **MRI**: Consider before biopsy to reduce unnecessary biopsies and improve detection of clinically significant cancer [^117V7Q7Q].

---

## Frequency of screening

- **Initial screening**: Baseline PSA at 40–45 [^111Hd5nN].
- **Follow-up**: Every 2–4 years, individualized by risk, PSA levels, and patient preference [^112MZbEk] [^117SkRr6].
- **Interval adjustment**: Shorten if PSA is elevated or risk is high; lengthen or stop if PSA is consistently low and risk decreases [^117SkRr6].

---

## PSA thresholds and interpretation

A PSA ≥ 4.0 ng/mL has historically prompted further evaluation, but in high-risk men, **consider lower thresholds (2.5–4.0 ng/mL)** [^1149of81] and integrate risk factors (age, family history, DRE) when deciding on biopsy [^1149of81]. Use validated risk calculators to guide decisions, especially in the 2.5–4.0 ng/mL range [^112MZbEk].

---

## Potential benefits and harms of screening

Benefits include earlier detection of clinically significant cancer [^112vm4Rq], potential reduction in prostate cancer mortality [^112V81V9], and more treatment options [^notfound], whereas harms include false positives, overdiagnosis, overtreatment [^112V81V9], and biopsy/treatment complications (e.g. incontinence, erectile dysfunction) [^112V81V9]. Shared decision-making is essential to balance these outcomes [^1117UMji].

---

## Special considerations

Genetic counseling is appropriate for men with **strong family history** (≥ 2 first-degree relatives or early onset) [^1179TzBJ] to assess for hereditary cancer syndromes (e.g. BRCA1/2, HOXB13) [^1166pprE]. Avoid routine screening after age 70 or if life expectancy is under 10 years, as harms likely outweigh benefits [^112V81V9] [^114e4VAA].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Start screening**: Age 40–45 with baseline PSA and shared decision-making [^1173wSMU] [^1125wafw].
- **Frequency**: Every 2–4 years, individualized by risk and preferences [^112MZbEk].
- **PSA thresholds**: Use 2.5–4.0 ng/mL in high-risk men, integrating risk factors [^116dPYfz].
- **MRI**: Consider before biopsy to reduce unnecessary procedures [^117V7Q7Q].
- **Stop screening**: Age > 70 or life expectancy < 10 years [^112V81V9].

---

Men with a father with prostate cancer should **start screening at 40–45** with PSA and shared decision-making, with individualized intervals and consideration of MRI before biopsy.

### The new US preventive services task force "C" draft recommendation for prostate cancer screening [^116ds3gH]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force has issued a new draft guideline, with a "C" recommendation that men aged 55–69 yr should be informed about the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer, and offered prostate-specific antigen testing if they choose it. For men aged ≥ 70 yr, the recommendation remains "D", or "do not screen". This draft represents substantial progress in the right direction towards offering men a fair opportunity to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their primary care providers. However, the evidence review underlying the draft remains fundamentally inadequate, leading to biased presentations of both benefits and harms of screening. The final guideline and future revisions should reflect formal engagement with subject matter experts to optimize the advise given to men and their physicians.

### Prevalence, treatment modalities and prognosis of familial prostate cancer in a screened population [^113VKEyL]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

A family history of prostate cancer is an important risk factor for this disease. The clinical presentation and prognosis of familial disease remain uncertain. In this study these entities are evaluated in the first and second rounds of a screening program in The Netherlands.

Materials and Methods

Of all men randomized in the Rotterdam section of the ERSPC, 19,970 men were eligible for screening. Information regarding the family history was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire at baseline.

Results

In the prevalence screen the cancer detection rate in 1,364 men (7.1%) with a positive family history was 7.7% (106 cancers in 1,364 screened men with a positive family history) while the positive predictive value of the biopsies was 32.2% (154 cancers of 532 biopsies). In 12,803 sporadic cases the detection rate was 4.7% and the positive predictive value was 23.6% (p < 0.0001 and 0.003, RR 1.63). No clinicopathological differences were found in the 1,559 men diagnosed in the first and second rounds. The overall biochemical-free survival rate after a mean followup of 56.8 months (range 0 to 129.9) was 76.8%, and was not significantly different in familial and sporadic cases (p = 0.840). These findings were consistent for the specific treatment modalities as well.

Conclusions

Although screened men 55 to 75 years old with a father or a brother having prostate cancer themselves are at a substantially greater risk for the disease, the clinical presentation, treatment modalities and prognosis by biochemical progression are not different compared to sporadic cases.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^113TBkoF]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The Rapid Recommendations executive felt this new study — taken together with extended follow-up data from existing trials — required a new appraisal of the body of evidence for patients and clinicians.

Although the results of this study suggest screening is not worthwhile, several guidelines advocate offering screening in some cases. The study was much larger than previous studies, and existing trials had published more extended follow-up results, and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations team felt these merited a new appraisal of the body of evidence. This guideline aims to promptly and transparently translate potentially practice-changing evidence to usable recommendations for clinicians and patients, based on the GRADE framework and following standards for trustworthy guidelines.

The panel suggests against systematic PSA screening (weak recommendation). The panel members judged that most men will decline screening because the benefit is small and uncertain and there are clear harms. However, there is likely considerable variation in values and preferences. Men with family history of prostate cancer, African descent or of lower socioeconomic status, having higher baseline risk of prostate cancer death, may be more likely to choose PSA screening. Shared decision making is needed for men considering screening.

### Screening for prostate cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114qy1TV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2008 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for prostate cancer.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer, as well as the benefits and harms of treatment of localized prostate cancer.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer (grade D recommendation). This recommendation applies to men in the general U.S. population, regardless of age. This recommendation does not include the use of the PSA test for surveillance after diagnosis or treatment of prostate cancer; the use of the PSA test for this indication is outside the scope of the USPSTF.

Familial prostate cancer — classification and mutation frequency with referral indications are outlined. "The Hopkins criteria" have "been adopted to define familial prostate cancer", and "a specific HOXB13 mutation" has been identified "in 1.4–4.6% of individuals (primarily of Northern European ancestry) meeting these criteria". Although genes explain only a subset, "referral may be appropriate" for counseling and screening. Indications are: "Referral should be considered for any individual with a personal history of or first-degree relative with (i) three or more first-degree relatives with prostate cancer; (ii) two or more cases of prostate cancer diagnosed before age 55; (iii) aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥ 7) and two or more cases of breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer".

Prostate cancer — germline testing pre-test and testing considerations state that the Panel recommends inquiring about family and personal history of cancer, and known germline variants at time of initial diagnosis, and that criteria for germline testing should be reviewed at time of initial diagnosis and, if relevant, at recurrence (see CRIT-6 and HRS-3 in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment). Germline testing is also recommended for patients with metastatic, regional (node positive), very-high-risk localized, or high-risk localized prostate cancer, and should be considered in appropriate individuals where it is likely to impact the prostate cancer treatment and clinical trial options, management of risk of other cancers, and/or potential risk of cancer in family members. If criteria are met, multigene testing is recommended, and for details regarding the nuances of genetic counseling and testing, see Principles of Cancer Risk Assessment and Counseling (EVAL-A) in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic and Prostate; all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^113P3NGx]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer risk calculator — variables, development, and use: The model included six risk factors — PSA, digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, age, race (Caucasian or African American)/ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic), family history, and history of prior negative prostate biopsy — and, examining 5519 men with all 6 data elements, a tool was developed to assess an individual man's risk that "has been validated in several additional groups of men". Although it may not influence every decision, the calculator "does allow a man both to understand his risk of cancer, particularly of high-grade cancer, and to compare his risk with that of other men", and "some physicians stress that the risk of high-grade disease — not the overall cancer risk — should be the primary determinant of the need for a prostate biopsy".

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^111zjN33]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test thresholds and performance — Using a threshold of 4 ng/mL in average-risk men, the rate of PSA test positivity varies between 9% and 11%, the cancer detection rate is about 3%, the positive predictive value (PPV) ranges from 28% to 32%, and specificity remains high (92%-94%). When lower thresholds are used (2.0 ng/mL or 2.5 ng/mL), PPVs are substantially higher among men with a positive family history (38%-43%) with variable specificity (64%-93%). PSA screening in higher risk populations is characterized by higher detection rates and higher PPVs, but it is stated that we still do not know whether PSA screening performs better in higher risk men in terms of reduced prostate-specific mortality; the ERSPC observed no effect of age on mortality and neither the PLCO nor the ERSPC has reported subgroup analyses examining the impact of ethnicity or family history.

### Age-specific risk of incident prostate cancer and risk of death from prostate cancer defined by the number of affected family members [^112VrAMM]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The thorough assessment of familial prostate cancer (PCa) risk is as important as ever to provide a basis for clinical counselling and screening recommendations.

Objective

Our aim was to determine the age-specific risks of PCa and the risk of death from PCa according to the number and the age of affected first-degree relatives.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database includes a record of > 11.8 million individuals and their cancers from 1958 to 2006. All men from the database with identified parents (> 3.9 million individuals) were followed between 1961 and 2006. The study included 26 651 PCa patients, of whom 5623 were familial.

Measurements

The age-specific hazard ratios (HRs) of PCa and the HRs of death from PCa were calculated according to the number and age of affected fathers and brothers.

Results and Limitations

The HRs of PCa diagnosis increased with the number of affected relatives and decreased with increasing age. The highest HRs were observed for men < 65 yr of age with three affected brothers (HR: approximately 23) and the lowest for men between 65 and 74 yr of age with an affected father (HR: approximately 1.8). The HRs increased with decreasing paternal or fraternal diagnostic age. The pattern of the risk of death from familial PCa was similar to the incidence data.

Conclusions

The present results should guide clinical counselling and demonstrate the vast increases in risk when multiple first-degree relatives are affected.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112V81V9]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the United States, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 13%, and the lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer is 2.5%. The median age of death from prostate cancer is 80 years. Many men with prostate cancer never experience symptoms and, without screening, would never know they have the disease. African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer have an increased risk of prostate cancer compared with other men.

Objective

To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer and subsequent treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer. The USPSTF also commissioned a review of existing decision analysis models and the overdiagnosis rate of PSA-based screening. The reviews also examined the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening in patient subpopulations at higher risk of prostate cancer, including older men, African American men, and men with a family history of prostate cancer.

Findings

Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over approximately 13 years per 1000 men screened. Screening programs may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened. Potential harms of screening include frequent false-positive results and psychological harms. Harms of prostate cancer treatment include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel symptoms. About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence, and 2 in 3 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction. Adequate evidence shows that the harms of screening in men older than 70 years are at least moderate and greater than in younger men because of increased risk of false-positive results, diagnostic harms from biopsies, and harms from treatment. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men aged 55 to 69 years is small for some men. How each man weighs specific benefits and harms will determine whether the overall net benefit is small. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older do not outweigh the expected harms.

Conclusions and Recommendation

For men aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one and should include discussion of the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician. Screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some men. However, many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms on the basis of family history, race/ethnicity, comorbid medical conditions, patient values about the benefits and harms of screening and treatment-specific outcomes, and other health needs. Clinicians should not screen men who do not express a preference for screening. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older. (D recommendation).

### Prevalence of germline variants in prostate cancer and implications for current genetic testing guidelines [^11667CBi]. JAMA Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. Although serious, most of these diagnoses are not terminal. Inherited risk for prostate cancer is associated with aggressive disease and poorer outcomes, indicating a critical need for increased genetic screening to identify disease-causing variants that can pinpoint individuals at increased risk for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Objective

To identify positive (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and increased risk) germline variants in a large prostate cancer cohort and to evaluate the usefulness of current practice guidelines in recognizing individuals at increased risk for prostate cancer who would benefit from diagnostic genetic testing.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study of data from 3607 men with a personal history of prostate cancer who underwent germline genetic testing between 2013 and 2018 and were unselected for family history, stage of disease, or age at diagnosis. Referral-based testing was performed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments/College of American Pathologists-certified diagnostic laboratory. All analysis took place between February 2017 and August 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The frequency and distribution of positive germline variants, and the percentage of individuals with prostate cancer who met National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for germline genetic testing.

Results

Of 3607 men (mean [SD] age at testing, 67 [9.51] years; mean age at diagnosis, 60 [9.05] years) with a personal diagnosis of prostate cancer who were referred for genetic testing, 620 (17.2%) had positive germline variants, of which only 30.7% were variants in BRCA1/2. Positive variants in HOXB13, a gene associated only with prostate cancer risk, were identified in 30 patients (4.5%). DNA mismatch repair variants with substantial known therapeutic implications were detected in 1.74% of variants in the total population tested. Examination of self-reported family histories indicated that 229 individuals (37%) with positive variants in this cohort would not have been approved for genetic testing using the NCCN genetic/familial breast and ovarian guidelines for patients with prostate cancer.

Conclusions and Relevance

Current NCCN guidelines and Gleason scores cannot reliably stratify patients with prostate cancer for the presence or absence of pathogenic germline variants. Most positive genetic test results identified in this study have important management implications for patients and their families, which underscores the need to revisit current guidelines.

Informed and shared decision making — when the evidence is not clear that the benefits of screening outweigh the risks, an individual's values and preferences must be factored into the screening decision; given the uncertain balance between benefits and risks, it is vital to involve men in the decision whether to screen, and for informed decision making to occur, the individual should understand the basic aspects of prostate cancer and the role of screening, understand the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with testing and the option not to be tested, consider his preferences and values about screening, choose a level of participation in the decision with which he is comfortable, and make (or defer) a decision based on his values and preferences.

### Prostate cancer risk prediction based on complete prostate cancer family history [^112E8WkW]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

PC risk has been related to numerous factors, including family history, diet, environmental exposures, age, ethnicity, and obesity. Familial risk for PC is comprised of a combination of inherited genetic and shared environmental risk factors. Twin studies demonstrate that genetic risk accounts for approximately 42% of total familial risk for PC (higher than for any other cancer studied).

Of the known PC risk factors, genetic risk is appealing for investigation, but the identification of PC predisposition genes segregating in relatives has proven to be elusive given the genetic complexity of the disorder. In the meantime, individualized PC risk estimates based on a male's specific family history may prove to be an inexpensive and efficient mechanism to identify males at highest risk. Although there has been considerable discussion on what the appropriate screening for such men should be, it is clear that screening is desired by some, and has been effective in reducing PC mortality.

Prostate cancer genetics — family history and germline syndromes: Family history of prostate cancer raises risk, and prostate cancer has been associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome and Lynch syndrome due to germline mutations in homologous DNA repair genes and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, respectively. Approximately 11% of patients with prostate cancer and at least 1 additional primary cancer carry germline mutations linked to increased cancer risk; therefore, the panel recommends a thorough review of personal and family history for all patients with prostate cancer. Data also suggest that patients with BRCA1/2 germline mutations have increased risk of progression on local therapy and decreased overall survival (OS), and this information should be discussed with such patients if they are considering active surveillance.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^115kWW3r]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

For men of African descent, over a 10 year period: The baseline risk of developing prostate cancer of any stage is likely higher than that of the general population (estimated at about 51 per 1000 men diagnosed), and PSA screening probably increases their detection of any stage cancer by a larger magnitude than in the general population (29 more per 1000 men (95% CI 26 to 32 more)) Baseline risk of prostate cancer mortality is likely also higher than in the general population of men considering screening (estimated at about 7 per 1000 men dying at 10 years). However, PSA screening had a similar small effect in reducing prostate cancer mortality in absolute terms (1 fewer per 1000 (2 to 1 fewer)).
For men with family history, over a 10 year period: As for men with African descent, the baseline risk of developing prostate cancer is likely higher than in the general population (estimated at about 50 per 1000 men diagnosed with any stage prostate cancer; and about 25 per 1000 are localised cancers). PSA screening probably increases their detection of any stage cancer (29 more per 1000 (26 to 31 more)) as well as localised cancers (19 more per 1000 (17 to 21 more)) These baseline risk estimates are based on studies that defined family history as positive if a man reported that his father or at least one brother had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. These baseline risk estimates may increase with increasing number of relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer.
For men with lower level of education, over a 10 year period: There was limited data on how much more these men were at higher baseline risk. Using lower level of education as a proxy of lower socioeconomic status, we estimated that baseline risk of prostate cancer mortality was higher (about 4 per 1000 men dying at 10 years) as well as all-cause mortality (about 196 per 1000 men) The absolute effect of PSA screening is overall comparable to that in the other subgroups, with a small reduction in prostate cancer mortality (about 1 fewer per 1000 men (1 to 0 fewer)) PSA screening probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality (about 4 fewer per 1000 (10 to 0 fewer)).

### Clinically localized prostate cancer: AUA / ASTRO guideline, part I: introduction, risk assessment, staging, and risk-based management [^1166pprE]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Clinically localized prostate cancer — germline testing assessment and indications: Clinicians should perform an assessment of patient and tumor risk factors to guide the decision to offer germline testing that includes mutations known to be associated with aggressive prostate cancer and/or known to have implications for treatment (Expert Opinion). Germline testing goals include enhanced risk stratification, identification of genes that may guide treatment decisions, and providing information to determine the need for personal and family member cancer screening; identified prostate cancer associated genes to date include ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, HOXB13, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, and TP53. Testing is typically performed via a saliva or blood sample, and patient education, testing, and referral to a genetic counselor should be considered; patient and family history risk factors should be investigated and pathology from biopsy or radical prostatectomy should be reviewed. Table 4 indications include strong family history of prostate cancer (first-degree relative or multiple second-degree relatives diagnosed with Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer, particularly at early age (< 60 years), particularly if metastatic or lethal), strong personal or family history of related cancers (breast, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, upper tract urothelial carcinoma), known family history of familial cancer risk mutation (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, Lynch-syndrome associated genes), Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (particularly in patients with Grade Group 2 or higher disease), and adverse tumor characteristics (high-risk disease; intermediate-risk disease with intraductal or cribriform morphology).

### Relative value of race, family history and prostate specific antigen as indications for early initiation of prostate cancer screening [^116Sk1QJ]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many guidelines suggest earlier screening for prostate cancer in men at high risk, with risk defined in terms of race and family history. Recent evidence suggests that baseline prostate specific antigen is strongly predictive of the long-term risk of aggressive prostate cancer. We compared the usefulness of risk stratifying early screening by race, family history and prostate specific antigen at age 45 years.

Materials and Methods

Using estimates from the literature we calculated the proportion of men targeted for early screening using family history, black race or prostate specific antigen as the criterion for high risk. We calculated the proportion of prostate cancer deaths that would occur in those men by age 75 years.

Results

Screening based on family history involved 10% of men, accounting for 14% of prostate cancer deaths. Using black race as a risk criterion involved 13% of men, accounting for 28% of deaths. In contrast, 44% of prostate cancer deaths occurred in the 10% of men with the highest prostate specific antigen at age 45 years. In no sensitivity analysis for race and family history did the ratio of risk group size to number of prostate cancer deaths in that risk group approach that of prostate specific antigen.

Conclusions

Basing decisions for early screening on prostate specific antigen at age 45 years provided the best ratio between men screened and potential cancer deaths avoided. Given the lack of evidence that race or family history affects the relationship between prostate specific antigen and risk, prostate specific antigen based risk stratification would likely include any black men or men with a family history who are destined to experience aggressive disease. Differential screening based on risk should be informed by baseline prostate specific antigen.

### Screening intervals and… [^114n7ams]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

The AAFP does not recommend routine prostate-specific antigen -based screening for prostate cancer. For men aged 55 through 69 who are considering periodic prostate cancer screening, clinicians should discuss the risks and benefits and engage in shared decision-making that enables an informed choice. Routine screening for prostate cancer should not be done. See Clinical Considerations for more information. The AAFP recommends against screening for prostate cancer in men aged 70 and older. Men aged 70 years and older have a higher rate of prostate cancer, but because they are more likely to die from a cause other than their prostate cancer, the potential benefit screening is diminished. Older men experience more harms from screening, including increased rates of false positives, overdiagnosis, and increased risk of harms from biopsy and treatment. For these reasons, prostate cancer screening should not be done in men aged 70 years and older.

Routine screening for prostate cancer should not be done. Based on results of one major trial on screening and three clinical trials examining treatment, it is estimated that after 13 years, of 1, 000 men screened for prostate cancer, 100 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. As the result of early treatment, 1. 3 men will avoid dying of prostate cancer, while 5 men will die of prostate cancer despite treatment. It is also estimated that screening will result in three fewer cases of metastatic prostate cancer. While the mortality benefit of prostate cancer screening is the result of early treatment, the treatment of prostate cancer causes the most serious harms (. Men with a family history of prostate cancer are also at a higher risk. However, limited data does not support an additional mortality benefit of screening in these men. At this time, the evidence is insufficient for the AAFP to make a screening recommendation specific to men at increased risk for prostate cancer.

Due to the lack of evidence in these populations, African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer should be informed of their increased risk of developing prostate cancer in addition to the benefits and harms of screening so that they may make an informed choice. The studies of prostate cancer screening used different screening intervals and different PSA thresholds. The ideal screening strategy has not been determined, but single screens were not shown to be effective. For men who choose to undergo screening for prostate cancer, they should not be screened more frequently than every 2 years. A PSA level of 4. 0 ng/mL is a commonly used cutoff, but thresholds vary.

### Prostate specific antigen best practice statement: 2009 update [^114MFpqg]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We provide current information on the use of PSA testing for the evaluation of men at risk for prostate cancer, and the risks and benefits of early detection.

Materials and Methods

The report is a summary of the American Urological Association PSA Best Practice Policy 2009. The summary statement is based on a review of the current professional literature, clinical experience and the expert opinions of a multispecialty panel. It is intended to serve as a resource for physicians, other health care professionals, and patients. It does not establish a fixed set of guidelines, define the legal standard of care or pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases.

Results

There are two notable differences in the current policy. First, the age for obtaining a baseline PSA has been lowered to 40 years. Secondly, the current policy no longer recommends a single, threshold value of PSA, which should prompt prostate biopsy. Rather, the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy should be based primarily on PSA and DRE results, but should take into account multiple factors including free and total PSA, patient age, PSA velocity, PSA density, family history, ethnicity, prior biopsy history and comorbidities.

Conclusions

Although recently published trials show different results regarding the impact of prostate cancer screening on mortality, both suggest that prostate cancer screening leads to overdetection and overtreatment of some patients. Therefore, men should be informed of the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening before biopsy and the option of active surveillance in lieu of immediate treatment for certain men diagnosed with prostate cancer.

### Family history and prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen [^114unm9g]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Early detection of prostate cancer has been recommended for men with affected first-degree relatives despite the lack of evidence for mortality reduction. We therefore evaluated the impact of family history in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.

Patients and Methods

Approximately 80,000 men were identified from the population register for the first screening round. Of the 32,000 men randomized to the screening arm, 30,403 were eligible at the time of invitation. A blood sample was drawn from the participants (n = 20,716), and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was determined. Men with a PSA level ≥ 4.0 ng/mL were referred for prostate biopsy. Information on family history was obtained through a self-administered questionnaire at baseline.

Results

A total of 964 (5%) of the 20,716 screening participants had a positive family history, and 105 (11%) were screening-positive. Twenty-nine tumors were diagnosed, corresponding to a detection rate of 3.0% (29 of 964) and a positive predictive value of 28% (29 of 105). Of the 19,347 men without a family history, 1,487 (8%) had a PSA level ≥ 4.0 ng/mL. The detection rate was 2.4% (462 of 19,347) and the positive predictive value was 31% (462 of 1,487). The risk associated with a positive family history was not substantially increased (rate ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.8). The results were not affected by the age of the screenee or age at diagnosis of the affected relative. The program sensitivity was 6% (29 of 491) (ie, selective screening policy would have missed 94% of cancers in the population). No differences were seen in the characteristics of screen-detected cancers by family history.

Conclusion

Our findings provide no support for selective screening among men with affected relatives.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^111FcX6A]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Conclusion — prostate cancer early detection emphasizes that the overall value of early detection in reducing morbidity and mortality remains unclear, and states that emerging evidence that early detection may reduce the likelihood of dying must be weighed against serious risks from early detection and treatment. The guideline highlights involving men in the screening decision and provides the core elements needed for decision-making, including the strengths and limitations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and the risks of finding and treating screen-detected cancer; it emphasizes the role of health care providers in helping men decide and encourages use of prostate cancer screening decision aids to reach a decision commensurate with the patient's values.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^1149of81]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer screening recommendations — men who choose to be screened after considering benefits and risks should follow these directives: Screening is recommended with PSA with or without DRE; screening should be conducted yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or greater; for men whose PSA is less than 2.5 ng/mL, screening intervals can be extended to every 2 years; a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL or greater historically has been used to recommend referral for further evaluation or biopsy, which remains a reasonable approach for men at average risk for prostate cancer; for PSA levels between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, health care providers should consider an individualized risk assessment that incorporates other risk factors and may be used to recommend a biopsy, noting that African American race, family history of prostate cancer, increasing age, and abnormal DRE increase risk and that a previous negative biopsy lowers risk.

Reassessment of screening decisions — once a screening decision has been made, the decision should be readdressed when new research becomes available that significantly alters the balance between benefits, risks, and uncertainties regarding prostate cancer early detection, and in the absence of new information, the decision should be readdressed periodically because a man's health status, values, and preferences can change over time.

Costs and resources

Results from a recent cost-effectiveness study modelled for the US suggested that screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years combined with active surveillance for low risk men could only be cost-effective at a $100 000 threshold if the screening frequency remains low (every four years) and active surveillance is offered to all men with low risk prostate cancer (that is, Gleason score ≤ 6 and stage ≤ T2a). Strategies with shorter screening intervals or in which immediate treatment is offered to all men were not cost-effective. Although the Rapid Recommendations panel focused on the patients' priorities rather than those of society, our recommendation is compatible with these findings.

Uncertainties for future research

Recent evidence suggests that incorporating MRI in the investigation of those with a positive PSA test result decreases the false positive rate, and thus the number of patients undergoing unnecessary biopsies, and may also increase the accuracy of biopsies in those who do have prostate cancer. The Rapid Recommendations panel considered addressing this issue in the guideline, but the impact of MRI on long term outcomes of prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment remains uncertain. Sophisticated decision modelling might shed light on this issue, but the panel decided not to conduct such an analysis because of logistic and feasibility considerations, and because the panel's review of the evidence suggests that modelling would introduce further uncertainties regarding the impact of MRI on patient-important outcomes.

Key research question to inform decision makers and future guidelines include

Could new screening and diagnostic techniques reduce the harms and burden of the diagnostic procedure by better identifying non-progressive and slowly progressive cancer from cancer that is likely to become symptomatic and affect quality or length of life? These strategies may include genetic markers or biomarkers, risk stratification tools, or MRI guided biopsy. For example, two recent high quality studies on MRI guided biopsy have shown encouraging results of MRI to reduce overdiagnosis, but the impact of this strategy on long term, patient-important outcomes (such as prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment) remains uncertain.
For men opting for screening, what would be the ideal age range and screening interval? Randomised trials varied in their offer of a one-off or repeated PSA testing and it remains uncertain which strategy is more suitable.
What is the impact of screening on men at higher baseline risk (men with a family history of cancer, of African descent, and of lower socioeconomic status)? Are their values and preferences different from those of men in the general population?

Early detection of prostate cancer — risk calculation for GG2+ disease should inform management decisions. Given multiple contributing factors, the panel recommends use of a risk calculator that incorporates standard factors, with or without additional factors, and notes that associated factors include age, Black ancestry, total PSA, percent free PSA, PSA density, abnormal DRE findings, prior biopsy pathology and adjunctive testing results, number of cores at initial biopsy, MRI findings, planned method of subsequent biopsy, and family history; previous biopsy reduces risk and should be considered. As in the PSA screening setting, the use of SDM is highly recommended given the uncertainty involved.

### An appraisal of genetic testing for prostate cancer susceptibility [^111ga1cY]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

What is the value of screening for prostate cancer among men at high risk?

The value of screening for prostate cancer in the general population is controversial. Three large randomized controlled trials of PSA screening and mortality produced mixed results. The European ERSPC study and the Gotenberg study found a 20–30% and 52% reduction in prostate cancer mortality respectively, whereas the US PLCO trial showed no mortality difference between the treatment and control arms. The US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends a discussion of the risks and benefits of PSA screening in men aged between 55 and 69 (and against screening for men over 70). The NCCN recommends that men with a germline mutation that increases the risk for prostate cancer consider annual PSA screening from age 40 (NCCN Guidelines V 2.2021 Prostate Cancer Early Detection). The NCCN also recommends annual screening in men with a family history and men of African descent from age 40, but notes that the evidence does not show a mortality benefit associated with earlier screening. The American Cancer Society recommends starting a discussion about screening at the age of 40 for men at high risk, including those with more than one first-degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age (a very small group).

The IMPACT study targets PSA screening specifically for male BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (and controls) between ages 40 and 69. A biopsy is offered for those with a PSA > 3.0 ng/ml. A preliminary analysis demonstrated that men who carry a BRCA2 mutation have a higher incidence of prostate cancer, a younger age at diagnosis and more clinically significant tumours than noncarrier controls. The IMPACT study group concluded that men who carry a BRCA2 mutation should be offered annual PSA screening, but further follow-up is needed for BRCA1 carriers.

To some extent, the impact of PSA screening is limited by the sensitivity of the test and the possibility of diagnosing indolent disease. Alternative screening modalities include multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Segal et al. screened 188 BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers with no previous prostate biopsy with PSA and MRI. Sixteen prostate cancers (8.5%) were diagnosed at the initial round of screening. MRI screening only missed one cancer (6%), while the PSA test alone missed five (31%). Further follow-up is needed to determine if there is an effect on mortality. The utility of screening in carriers will be determined when a large number of men who are identified to be at high risk are screened and followed.

### Prostate cancer risk prediction based on complete prostate cancer family history [^11436d34]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The American Cancer Society estimates that 233,000 men will be diagnosed with PC and 29,480 will die from PC in 2014. Current National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data suggest a 15.3% lifetime risk for men born today in the US (based on data from 2008–2010). The latest 2011 SEER analysis gives a prevalence of 2,707,821 men alive with PC (in 2011) and 98.9% surviving at least 5 years. Age adjusted incidence is 147.8 new cases per 100,000 men per year. Screening for PC has been associated with substantial over-diagnosis and over-treatment, but has been shown to reduce PC mortality.

PC family history is a substantial risk factor for PC. Estimated risks typically use only first-degree relatives or a less specific family history of close relatives, although some studies have presented familial risks based on PC in extended families including a familial risk assessment model. Herein, estimated risk for PC was based on the constellation of a male proband's affected first-, second-, and third-degree relatives, the number of affected individuals, age at diagnosis of affected relatives, and paternal and maternal contribution. This analysis expands and refines published PC risk estimates based on family history and provides individualized risk estimates based on more complete knowledge of PC family history.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116dPYfz]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer early detection — PSA thresholds and shared decision-making are outlined as follows: we continue to recommend that men who are at greater risk for developing prostate cancer at earlier ages — African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer in nonelderly relatives — should be provided the opportunity for informed decision-making at a younger age than men who are at average risk. Recognizing that lowering the PSA threshold for biopsy will increase the rate of overdiagnosis, we consider the traditional PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL to be a reasonable threshold for further evaluation. Acknowledging that there is no true PSA cutoff point that distinguishes cancer from noncancer, we suggest that providers consider individualized decision making when PSA levels fall in the indeterminate range between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, particularly in men who are at increased risk for high-grade cancer based on non-PSA risk factors. Until that time, however, it will remain incumbent on health care providers and the health care system as a whole to provide men with the opportunity to decide whether they wish to pursue early detection of prostate cancer.

### Family history of prostate and breast cancer integrated with a polygenic risk score identifies men at highest risk of dying from prostate cancer before age 75 years [^112CoqC3]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Although we lacked a direct measurement of rare pathogenic variants in the current, our analysis is in agreement with a recent study based on data from the UK Biobank examining the combined effect of rare pathogenic variants and the multiancestry 269-SNP PRS. As in our study, men in the top PRS decile carrying rare pathogenic variants had the highest lifetime risk of prostate cancer (56%). Our findings are also consistent with another study, based on a 147-SNP PRS, reporting the highest lifetime risk of prostate cancer among BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers with a PRS in the 95th percentile (lifetime risk of 50% and 88%, respectively; ref.). None of these studies had sufficient data to examine prostate cancer–specific death.

In practice, the PRS and family history information — ideally combined with rare pathogenic variants — can be used to narrow down the number of men to be targeted for more intensive screening and evaluation. Approximately 60% of men in the current analysis belonged to the increased genetic risk category (PRS 50%–100% or a family history of prostate or breast cancer), where the vast majority of prostate cancer deaths were observed. A more narrow categorization, for example PRS 75% to 100% or a positive family history, would reduce the percentage of men categorized as being at increased genetic risk, but this would at the same time exclude approximately one third of the early prostate cancer deaths. Integration of the PRS with tools that are specific for clinically significant disease, such as multiparametric MRI, may be the most promising approach to avoid overdiagnosis of indolent disease while identifying high-risk cancers to a high degree. Further studies are needed to detail out how a prostate cancer screening protocol incorporating the PRS would look like, including the optimal age when to start screening or initiate treatment. Our data suggest that men at high genetic risk may need screening starting 15 years earlier than the average man, which based on the guidelines for PSA screening, would be at around age 40 years, corresponding to the age recommended for BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^114sR23Q]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

How this recommendation was created

Our international panel included patient partners (men at risk of prostate cancer), general practitioners, general internists, urologists, epidemiologists, methodologists, and statisticians. They determined the scope of the question that the recommendation should address and what outcomes are most important to patients considering screening.

No person had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel identified eight critical outcomes needed to inform the recommendations: all-cause mortality; prostate cancer mortality; incidence of prostate cancer diagnoses (all stages); incidence of localised cancer (stage I and II); incidence of advanced cancer (stage III and IV); complications from biopsies (such as bleeding, pain, infections, and hospital readmissions), complications from prostate cancer treatment (such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction); and quality of life. The panel also identified three additional patient-important outcomes: false positive rates (men with elevated PSA levels who will have negative biopsy); false negative rates (men with a normal PSA result who will subsequently be diagnosed with cancer), and the anxiety and uncertainty related to concerns about having prostate cancer. The panel asked that potential subgroups effects be explored according to age, screening interval, family history, being of African descent, and being of lower socioeconomic level. They also asked for a sensitivity analysis of the effect of screening restricted to trials at lower risk of bias.

To inform the recommendation, the panel members requested two systematic reviews, on the following questions:

What are the benefits and harms of PSA screening versus no screening?
What evidence describes the values and preference of men considering PSA screening?

Two parallel teams conducted these systematic reviews, which are linked to this publication.

The panel met to discuss the evidence and formulate a recommendation. They followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including use of the GRADE approach to interpret the evidence and create recommendations (see appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of PSA screening; the quality of the evidence for each outcome; and typical and expected variations in patient values and preferences, as well as feasibility and acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

American Cancer Society early prostate cancer detection — screening discussion eligibility and timing are as follows: The ACS recommends that asymptomatic men who have at least a 10-year life expectancy should have an opportunity to make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened for prostate cancer, and prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision-making process. Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at age 50 years; men at higher risk, including African American men and men who have a first-degree relative (father or brother) diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 years, should receive this information beginning at age 45 years; and men at appreciably higher risk (multiple family members diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 years) should receive this information beginning at age 40 years. Asymptomatic men who have less than a 10-year life expectancy based on age and health status should not be offered prostate cancer screening, and at age 75 years, only about half of men have a life expectancy of 10 years or more. For example, men with New York Heart Association Class 4 congestive heart failure, moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage renal disease, moderate-to-severe dementia, or life-limiting cancer would not be expected to benefit from screening; for men who are unable to decide, the screening decision can be left to the discretion of the health care provider, and it is important to consider overall health status — not age alone — when making decisions about screening.

### Guidelines for genetic testing in prostate cancer: a scoping review [^114obgdy]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Genetic testing, to identify pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in prostate cancer, is valuable in guiding treatment decisions for men with prostate cancer and to inform cancer prevention and early detection options for their immediate blood relatives. There are various guidelines and consensus statements for genetic testing in prostate cancer. Our aim is to review genetic testing recommendations across current guidelines and consensus statements and the level of evidence supporting those recommendations.

Methods

A scoping review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for scoping review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Electronic database searches and manual searches of grey literature, including websites of key organisations were conducted. Using the Population, Concept, Context (PCC) framework, this scoping review included: men with prostate cancer or men at high risk of prostate cancer and their biological families; existing guidelines and consensus statements with supporting evidence for genetic testing of men with prostate cancer from any geographical location worldwide.

Results

Of the 660 citations identified, 23 guidelines and consensus statements met the inclusion criteria for the scoping review. Based on different levels of evidence about who should be tested and how, a diverse range of recommendations were identified. There was general consensus among the guidelines and consensus statements that men with metastatic disease be offered genetic testing; however, there was less consensus in relation to genetic testing in localised prostate cancer. While there was some consensus in relation to which genes to test, recommendations varied regarding who to test, testing methods and implementation.

Conclusion

While genetic testing in prostate cancer is routinely recommended and numerous guidelines exist, there is still considerable lack of consensus regarding who should be tested and how they should be tested. Further evidence is needed to inform value-based genetic testing strategies for implementation in practice.

Testing prostate cancer patients

There are several circumstances under which a man might benefit from genetic testing. For unaffected men, the information may help to specify his lifetime prostate cancer risk and aid in prevention and screening. For affected men, the information may be used to personalize cancer treatment. It is rare that an unaffected man will be the first to receive genetic testing in a family. For unaffected men, the most common scenario is that he is approached to initiate testing after a woman in his family is found to carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (or a mutation in another gene). Many men describe being tested 'for the sake of their daughters' rather than for their own health. For a prostate cancer patient, the opportunity to be tested will depend on his family history of cancer and his clinical presentation. To our knowledge, there is no guideline that suggests that all men with prostate cancer should be eligible for testing. Factors that determine eligibility are based on the probability of a mutation being detected (i.e. the prevalence) and include the presence of metastatic disease, high-grade disease, intraductal/cribriform histology, a family history of prostate cancer, a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, or a known mutation in the family. If we consider the utility of testing as the primary goal of germline genetic testing we should address the following five questions:
What is our ability to prevent prostate cancer in men with a high risk of cancer?
What is the value of screening for prostate cancer among men at high risk?
Does a germline mutation influence prognosis?
How does the knowledge of a germline mutation influence treatment of men with nonmetastatic cancer?
How does the knowledge of a germline mutation influence treatment of men with metastatic cancer or with hormone-resistant disease?

For women, genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is now widely endorsed and accepted. Its value has been demonstrated through surgical prevention of breast cancer with prophylactic mastectomy, surgical prevention of ovarian cancer with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, the improved sensitivity of MRI over mammography screening, the benefit of MRI screening on breast cancer mortality and the benefit of specific chemotherapies, such as platinum-based neoadjuvant therapy for women with breast cancer and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (i.e. Olaparib) for treatment of women with ovarian cancer. It is now recommended that all women with epithelial ovarian cancer undergo genetic testing for susceptibility genes. The clinical benefits of genetic testing for men for susceptibility genes is emerging but has not yet been established.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1167f5vN]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF prostate cancer screening — men with a family history: In PLCO, of the 7% of men who reported a family history, prostate cancer mortality among white men was lower in the intervention group than the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49 [95% CI, 0.22–1.10]; p = 0.08), but the difference was not significant and the confidence interval was wide. No studies have assessed harms related to screening, diagnosis, or treatment based on family history. Based on available evidence, the USPSTF is not able to make a separate, specific recommendation on PSA-based screening; it advises informing men with a family history — particularly those with multiple first-degree relatives — about increased risk and the potential earlier age at disease onset and discussing benefits and harms to support an informed, personal decision. Men with a first-degree relative who had advanced prostate cancer at diagnosis, developed metastatic prostate cancer, or died of prostate cancer are probably the most likely to benefit from screening. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer in men, including men with a family history, older than 70 years.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111rsE6o]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, general population, age 55–69 years, USPSTF 2018 guidelines recommend to individualize the decision on obtaining screening for prostate cancer in males aged 55–69 years with a discussion of potential benefits and harms of screening (based on family history, race/ethnicity, comorbid medical conditions, patient values about the benefits and harms of screening, and treatment-specific outcomes, and other health need). Recognize that screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some males of this age, while many males will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results requiring additional testing and possible prostate biopsy, overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Do not obtain screening in individuals not expressing a preference for screening.

### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test-NCI-national cancer institute… [^114hmhTx]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Is the PSA test recommended for prostate cancer screening. The PSA test is not recommended for routine prostate cancer screening in the general population. It was used for this purpose for several decades, beginning in the late 1980s. But by around 2008, as more was learned about both the benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening, many professional medical organizations began to caution against routine population screening with the PSA test. Most organizations now recommend that individuals who are considering PSA screening first discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors before making a decision. Some organizations do recommend that men who are at higher risk of prostate cancer have routine PSA testing, beginning at age 40 or 45. Those at higher risk include Black men, men with inherited variants in BRCA2, and men whose father or brother had prostate cancer.

The current recommendation of the United States Preventive Serves Task Force, which applies both to the general population and to those at increased risk due to race/ethnicity or family history, is as follows:

- For individuals aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one. Before making the decision, a person should discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and consider these in the context of their own values and preferences.
- PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is not recommended for individuals 70 years and older. In general, a PSA level above 4. 0 ng/mL is considered abnormal and may result in a recommendation for prostate biopsy. However, because PSA levels increase with age, some doctors apply a higher cutoff for older men and a lower cutoff for younger men.

What are some of the potential benefits and harms of the PSA test for prostate cancer screening. The potential benefit of the PSA test for prostate cancer screening is that it may help detect prostate cancer earlier, before it spreads and when it may be easier to treat, possibly reducing someone's risk of dying from prostate cancer. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials comparing PSA screening with usual care in men without a diagnosis of prostate cancer concluded that PSA screening for prostate cancer leads to a small reduction in prostate cancer mortality over 10 years.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^116yxJLe]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

PSA testing has increased the number of men diagnosed with and treated for prostate cancer, but many of these men would never have experienced any symptoms or death from prostate cancer
This guideline makes a weak recommendation against offering systematic PSA screening based on an updated systematic review. The recommendation is weak because there may be a small, though uncertain, benefit of screening on prostate cancer mortality
Men who place more value on avoiding complications from biopsies and cancer treatment are likely to decline screening. In contrast, men who put more value in even a small reduction of prostate cancer mortality (such as men at high baseline risk because of family history or African descent, or those concerned to rule out the diagnosis) may opt for screening
Shared decision making is needed for men considering screening to make a decision consistent with their individual values and preferences. However, clinicians need not feel obligated to systematically raise the issue of PSA screening with their patients

What is the role of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in prostate cancer? An expert panel produced these recommendations based on a linked systematic review. The review was triggered by a large scale, cluster randomised trial on PSA screening in men without a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer published in 2018 (box 1). It found no difference between one-time PSA screening and standard practice in prostate cancer mortality but found an increase in the detection of low risk prostate cancer after a median follow-up of 10 years.

Box 1
Results of the CAP Randomized Clinical Trial

This cluster-randomised trial of 419 582 British men was published in March 2018. After a median follow-up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality in men receiving care by general practices randomised to a single PSA screening intervention compared with men receiving care by practices randomised to standard practice without screening. The detection of low risk prostate cancer cases was higher in the PSA screening group. Although the trial had limitations, such as low adherence to PSA testing in the intervention arm (36%) and a follow-up of only 10 years, its findings do not support the use of single PSA testing for population based screening.

American Cancer Society (ACS) recommendations for higher-risk men — The ACS continues to recommend that African American men and men who have a family history of a first-degree relative with prostate cancer be provided information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits surrounding prostate cancer screening beginning at age 45 years. For men who have multiple first-degree relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 years, this discussion should take place beginning at age 40 years. For men who choose to be screened, the ACS recommends integrating established risk factors into an individualized risk assessment, particularly when PSA levels fall into what currently would be considered the high-normal range of 2.5 ng/mL to 4.0 ng/mL.

### Frequency of guideline-discordant prostate cancer screening among older males [^112bWAZ5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Our findings indicate that many males aged 70 years and older or those with a high risk of death within 10 years undergo prostate cancer screening despite the recommendation against screening in these populations by current guidelines. Given the long natural history of prostate cancer and lead time associated with PSA-based screening, these males have a low likelihood of receiving any mortality benefit from continued screening yet face the potential harms of overdiagnosis, such as complications after prostate biopsy for a false-positive screening and psychological stress associated with a cancer diagnosis.PSA-based screening rates have increased among males aged 70 years and older in recent years, suggesting that enhancements to the shared decision-making process are needed to ensure that older males who undergo screening are those who may potentially benefit. Limitations of this work include the reliance on self-reported screening history and potential measurement error in estimating life expectancy.

### Genetic testing in prostate cancer management: considerations informing primary care [^111i381k]. CA (2022). Medium credibility.

Inherited genetic mutations can significantly increase the risk for prostate cancer (PC), may be associated with aggressive disease and poorer outcomes, and can have hereditary cancer implications for men and their families. Germline genetic testing (hereditary cancer genetic testing) is now strongly recommended for patients with advanced/metastatic PC, particularly given the impact on targeted therapy selection or clinical trial options, with expanded National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and endorsement from multiple professional societies. Furthermore, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend genetic testing for men with PC across the stage and risk spectrum and for unaffected men at high risk for PC based on family history to identify hereditary cancer risk. Primary care is a critical field in which providers evaluate men at an elevated risk for PC, men living with PC, and PC survivors for whom germline testing may be indicated. Therefore, there is a critical need to engage and educate primary care providers regarding the role of genetic testing and the impact of results on PC screening, treatment, and cascade testing for family members of affected men. This review highlights key aspects of genetic testing in PC, the role of clinicians, with a focus on primary care, the importance of obtaining a comprehensive family history, current germline testing guidelines, and the impact on precision PC care. With emerging evidence and guidelines, clinical pathways are needed to facilitate integrated genetic education, testing, and counseling services in appropriately selected patients. There is also a need for providers to understand the field of genetic counseling and how best to collaborate to enhance multidisciplinary patient care.

Introduction

Guidelines currently recommend shared decision-making between males and their health care clinicians regarding prostate cancer screening using prostate-specific antigen (PSA), taking into consideration patient age and life expectancy. However, it is unclear the extent to which life expectancy is associated with screening practices among older males. We estimated the frequency of PSA-based screening by patient age and estimated life expectancy using data from a national survey.

The American Urological Association "recommends that men aged 55 to 69 years with a life expectancy of more than 10 to 15 years be informed of the benefits and harms of screening and engage in shared decision making with their clinicians, taking into account each man's values and preferences" and "to reduce the harms of screening, the screening interval should be 2 or more years"; it also notes that "decisions about screening, including potentially starting screening before age 55 years, should be individualized for African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer". The American Cancer Society "adopted detailed screening recommendations in 2016" and "recommends conversations about screening beginning at age 50 years and earlier for African American men and men with a father or brother with a history of prostate cancer before age 65 years".

### Guidelines for genetic testing in prostate cancer: a scoping review [^111DxNMa]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This scoping review is the first systematic and comprehensive review to examine current worldwide guidelines and consensus statements for genetic testing of prostate cancer. While numerous guidelines and consensus statements exist and genetic testing is now routinely recommended for patients with prostate cancer, there is still considerable lack of consensus with regard to timing and the strategies for testing, even across more high income countries. As a consequence, there are differences across guidelines and consensus statements based on medical knowledge, available resources, as well as country of origin (including differences in health systems, workforce expertise and capacity, infrastructure, and so on). The synthesised evidence from this scoping review of 23 current guidelines and consensus statements will form the survey inputs from which a Delphi Panel will determine an evidence-based, stakeholder endorsed set of genetic testing strategies for prostate cancer. These strategies could be valuable for the development of local genetic testing guidelines or for the development of an international guideline. A standardised approach to genetic testing for prostate cancer is essential to establish the value of genetic testing for prostate cancer.

A number of points of contention with genetic testing guidelines and consensus statements have been raised in the literature and are discussed below. These concerns span the process from initiation of genetic testing or systematic identification of appropriate patients, pre-test counselling, education of clinicians and patients, informed consent, collection of family history, testing platforms, test selection and ordering, delivery of results and follow up, post-test counselling, and cascade testing, and include the need for practical strategies and flexibility in delivery as a response to health system challenges. Very few guidelines or consensus statements provide any guidance on, or consideration of, the impact of implementation of genetic testing, nor do they consider such testing within the context of survivorship care. For example, recommendations such as the strategy to offer germline genetic testing to all men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer would create implementation challenges and significant barriers for both providers and patients in the delivery of genetic testing, due simply to the number of men diagnosed, even in those countries where such recommendations are currently approved. With developments in genomics and targeted treatments, germline genetic testing is now routinely recommended in some countries for all men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Integrating genetic testing into urology or oncology clinical workflows will thus require considerable planning and coordination if precision oncology is to realise the full benefits of genetic testing.

### Viewpoint: expanding prostate cancer screening [^115HeSfD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The authors address 3 key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening. The authors argue, on the basis of evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening are convincing. They recommend screening for risk assessment for average-risk men beginning at age 40 years, screening selected healthy men older than age 70 years, and lowering the PSA threshold for considering biopsy to 2.5 ng/mL for all men.

### Prostate cancer risk assessment program: a 10-year update of cancer detection [^113K1w5U]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Guidelines for screening men at high risk for prostate cancer remain under investigation. We report our 10-year cancer detection data from the Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment Program, a longitudinal screening program for men at high risk.

Materials and Methods

Men between ages 35 and 69 years with a family history of prostate cancer, any black man regardless of family history or any patient with a known mutation in the BRCA 1 gene are eligible for the Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment Program and undergo longitudinal followup. Cancer detection, prostate cancer features and the predictive value of screening parameters were determined based on Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment Program biopsy criteria.

Results

A total of 609 men were accrued to the Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment Program as of the end of June 2006, of whom 61.2% were black. Of all participants 19% underwent prostate biopsies. The prostate cancer incidence was 9.0%, more than 90% of prostate cancers were Gleason score 6 or higher and 22% were Gleason score 7 or higher. The majority were organ confined. Of men diagnosed with prostate cancer 20% had a prostate specific antigen of less than 2.5 ng/ml and a free prostate specific antigen of less than 25% with a normal digital rectal examination.

Conclusions

Our results support aggressive screening measures for men at high risk for prostate cancer. The majority of cancers detected were at a prostate specific antigen of less than 4.0 ng/ml with a fifth diagnosed at a prostate specific antigen of below 2.5 ng/ml. These cancers were intermediate to high grade and organ confined, indicating a greater likelihood of cure following local therapy in these men.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114wj7Eu]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Screening for prostate cancer in men with a family history — burden and risk: PSA-based screening (prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) has increased diagnoses and thus the number of men with an affected father, brother, or son. Genetic factors may account for up to 42% of prostate cancer risk, and men with at least 1 first-degree relative are 30% more likely to be diagnosed than men without a family history. Men with 3 first-degree relatives or 2 first-degree relatives on the same side diagnosed before age 55 years may have an inheritable form that is thought to account for less than 10% of all prostate cancer cases. The USPSTF searched for evidence about the potential benefits and harms of PSA-based screening in men with a family history.

### Prostate cancer risk prediction based on complete prostate cancer family history [^112JGHQX]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

As expected, first-degree family history contributes most significantly to PC risk (Table III A), but other more distant family history effects were also observed (Tables III B–D). A second-degree relative family history, even in the absence of affected FDRs significantly elevates risk. Males with three or more affected SDR relatives, even in the absence of affected FDRs (RR = 2.21) are at similar risk to males with exactly one affected FDR (RR = 2.46). Earlier age at diagnosis of an affected relative increases risk significantly as age at diagnosis decreases, for both FDR and SDR affected relatives (Table III E, F). RRs appear to be equivalent whether the family history is maternal or paternal, suggesting that the maternal family history should never be ignored for PC (Table III G).

The estimated RR for a combined maternal and paternal family history, for example both mother's father and father's father affected (Table III H, RR = 5.20), is higher than the sum of the RRs for each category separately (RR = 2.16 and RR = 1.93, respectively; Table III G), suggesting a synergistic effect on risk. Such an effect was not observed when the combined family history consisted of at least one mother's brother (RR = 1.85) and at least one father's brother (RR = 1.90) for which the combined RR estimate = 2.39. This effect should be investigated further.

Table IV provides a summary of those family history constellations with RR ≥ 2, and separately for those constellations with RR ≥ 3, as a quick clinical reference for probands whose family history matches one of the constellations that fits the highest risk categories identified. These risk estimates are presented as data to which both clinician and patient can refer, in order to assist in determination of an appropriate PC screening plan.

### Age at diagnosis and age at death in familial prostate cancer [^1173aLwu]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

A family history of prostate cancer is associated with a higher risk for prostate cancer to first-degree relatives. If greater surveillance of men at familial risk is considered to be useful, population-based estimates of the differences in the age at diagnosis between familial and sporadic prostate cancer cases are needed.

Methods

The men in the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database were classified according to the number and type of affected first-degree relatives (father or brother) and according to the relative's age at diagnosis. The cumulative incidence of prostate cancer and cumulative prostate cancer-specific mortality were estimated using a stratified Cox model.

Results

The cumulative incidence was highest for men with multiple affected first-degree relatives, and it was higher for brothers than for sons of prostate cancer patients. The age to reach the same cumulative incidence as the general population at age 55 years decreased with decreasing age at diagnosis of the relative, ranging from 48.7 years (father diagnosed before 60 years of age) to 53.7 years (father diagnosed after 82 years of age). Prostate cancer-specific mortality was also related to the number and type of affected relatives but there was no clear evidence for a dependency on the age at diagnosis of the relative.

Conclusions

Men with a father or a brother affected by prostate cancer are diagnosed and die at earlier ages than men without a family history of prostate cancer. This study should encourage further analysis in order to assess the risks and benefits of screening for prostate cancer in men at higher risk.

### Polygenic hazard score is associated with prostate cancer in multi-ethnic populations [^112KqHof]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Current guidelines suggest considering a man's individual cancer risk factors, overall life expectancy, and medical comorbidities when deciding whether to screen. The most prominent clinical risk factors used in practice are family history and race/ethnicity. Combined PHS and family history performed better than either alone in this multi-ethnic dataset. This finding is consistent with a prior report that PHS adds considerable information over family history alone. The prior study did not find an association of family history with age at prostate cancer diagnosis, perhaps because the universal screening approach of the ProtecT trial diluted the influence of family history on who is screened in typical practice. In the present study, family history and PHS appear complementary in assessing prostate cancer genetic risk. Moreover, the HRs for PHS suggest clinical relevance similar or greater to predictive tools routinely used for cancer screening (e.g. breast cancer) and for other diseases (e.g. diabetes and cardiovascular disease). HRs reported for those tools are around 1–3 for disease development or other adverse outcome –; HRs reported here for PHS (for any, aggressive, or fatal prostate cancer) are similar or greater.

### Family history of prostate and breast cancer integrated with a polygenic risk score identifies men at highest risk of dying from prostate cancer before age 75 years [^112hibJX]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

On the basis of data from a large cohort of men prospectively followed for 20 years, this study provides compelling evidence for integrating a prostate cancer PRS with information on family history of prostate and breast cancer in prostate cancer screening and risk assessment. This is particularly relevant for assessing risk of dying from prostate cancer; in this cohort of men, close to 100% of the total risk of prostate cancer–specific death by age 75 years occurred in men with a PRS above the median or with a family history of prostate or breast cancer. Following, men with a PRS below the median and no family history of prostate or breast cancer, approximately 40% of men, had no to low risk of dying from prostate cancer before age 75 years. This group of men also reached the same level of risk 12 years later than the average man. This suggests that men with a low PRS and no family history of cancer need a less intensive prostate cancer screening protocol than men with a high PRS or a positive family history. While screening starting at age 40 years has been recommended for BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers, and should be considered for carriers of other DNA repair gene alterations, there are currently no guidelines that incorporate PRS. Incorporating the PRS may both provide an earlier identification of high-risk cancers and reduce the burden associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low-risk cancers.

Our study is the first to provide long-term data on the risk of prostate cancer–specific death using the multiancestry 269-SNP PRS and incorporating information on family history of both breast and prostate cancer. Given the heterogeneous nature of prostate cancer, with many men presenting with indolent cancers, it is important that risk stratification tools capture men at highest risk of dying from the disease. While a few recent studies have examined combinations of PRS and family history on prostate cancer risk, only two published and one preprint study have to our knowledge included prostate cancer death as an outcome. These studies were based on earlier or different versions of the PRS and had limited follow-up for prostate cancer death and included family history of prostate cancer only. However, as in our study, including genetic risk scores substantially improved prediction of prostate cancer death as compared with family history and other risk factors.

### Prostate cancer risk in men of differing genetic ancestry and approaches to disease screening and management in these groups [^113mXRx5]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Targeted screening for prostate cancer in the higher-risk groups

There is currently no standard screening practice either population-based or individualised, in the UK for PrCa. PSA testing and digital rectal exam have been used to screen for PrCa, but this remains a source of controversy as well as uncertainty and has seen changes in practice over time, worldwide. Screening with serum PSA has been shown to have some limitations when used in population screening given its low specificity.

In the USA the USPSTF recommended against PSA testing for screening for PrCa in men of any age in 2012 and this was subsequently updated in 2018 as outlined above. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) advise individualised screening choices for high-risk men, specifically including AAM. The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that high-risk men, principally AAM and men with one or more first-degree relatives with PrCa should have an opportunity to make an informed decision with their healthcare provider about whether to be screened for PrCa from the age of 45. They should receive information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with PrCa screening as part of the informed decision.

The 2013 American Urological Association (AUA) Prostate Cancer Guidelines strongly recommended shared decision-making for men age 55–69 years at intermediate risk, who are considering PSA testing. The AUA panel did not recommend routine PSA testing in men between ages 40 and 54 years at average risk. The expert panel also commented that "for men younger than age 55 years at higher risk (e.g. positive family history or of African ancestry), decisions regarding PrCa screening should be individualised and discussed with their doctor". This statement was based on results from the updated European Randomised Study of testing for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC); this trial included European men only. The AUA guideline did not provide a clear direction or guidelines for AAM. This also shows the need to develop screening studies as we have not been able to adequately evaluate the benefit of PSA testing of AAM younger than 55 years of age despite the evidence showing they are at higher risk of developing PrCa at a younger age.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk population, AUA/SUO 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain prostate cancer screening beginning at age 40–45 years in males at increased risk of developing prostate cancer based on the following factors:

- strong family history of prostate cancer

- black ancestry

- germline mutations.

Values and preferences

The panel, including the patient partners, felt that this variability in values and preferences contributes to a weak recommendation. The recommendation against screening reflects a belief that most men would value avoiding complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment because the reduction in prostate cancer and death from screening is small and uncertain. Prostate cancer will often, though not always, remain indolent.

Men who place a high value on avoiding complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment are likely to decline screening. In contrast, men who place a higher value on even a small reduction of prostate cancer may opt for screening. Several panel members felt that higher risk patients — such as patients with family history of cancer or of African descent — may be more likely to seek screening because they may worry more about prostate cancer and want to rule out the diagnosis.

For men considering screening, shared decision making is critical to ensure that their decision is in line with their own values and preferences. The evidence summarised in this Rapid Recommendation is available in MAGICapp as decision aids that can support shared decision making.

Practical issues and other considerations

Figure 3 outlines the key practical issues. PSA testing can be performed on any normal blood sample, but prostate biopsies and their follow-up have important implications for daily life.

Fig 3
Practical issues about use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and biopsy for prostate cancer screening

Lower urinary tract symptoms (slow urine stream, sensation of incomplete emptying, increased urinary frequency) are common complaints in adult men that can have a major impact on quality of life. Benign prostatic enlargement is the major cause. Evidence to date indicates that men with these complaints are not at increased risk of prostate cancer.

For men who chose to undergo PSA testing, the optimal frequency of screening remains unknown. Figure 2 summarises the frequency used in the different trials, yet the accompanying systematic review did not find any significant subgroup effect of the effect of screening based on these different frequencies. Given that the ERSPC data are likely at lower risk of bias, PSA screening every four years — rather than, say, every year or only once in a lifetime — may be the optimal interval.

### Prostate cancer screening (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^116uHWt1]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

The evidence is insufficient to determine whether screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen or digital rectal exam reduces mortality from prostate cancer. Screening tests can detect prostate cancer at an early stage, but it is not clear whether earlier detection and consequent earlier treatment leads to any change in the natural history and outcome of the disease. Screening by Serum PSA The prostate-specific antigen test has been examined in several observational settings for initial diagnosis of disease, as a tool in monitoring for recurrence after initial therapy, and for prognosis of outcomes after therapy. Numerous studies have also assessed its value as a screening intervention for the early detection of prostate cancer. The potential value of the test appears to be its simplicity, objectivity, reproducibility, relative lack of invasiveness, and relatively low cost.

Men in the screening group were offered annual PSA testing for 6 years and digital rectal exam for 4 years. The subjects and health care providers received the results and decided on the type of follow-up evaluation. Usual care sometimes included screening, as some organizations have recommended. The 13-year follow-up analysis reported 45% of men in the PLCO trial had at least one PSA test in the 3 years before randomization. Annual PSA screening in the usual care arm was estimated to be as high as 52% by the end of the screening period. The intensity of PSA screening in the usual care group was estimated to be one-half of that in the intervention group. Stage-specific treatment between the two arms was similar. Possible explanations for the lack of a significant reduction in mortality in this trial include the following:

- Approximately 44% of the men in each study group had undergone one or more PSA tests at baseline, which would have eliminated some cancers detectable on screening from the randomly assigned population. Thus, the cumulative death rate from prostate cancer at 10 years in the two groups combined was 25% lower in those who had undergone two or more PSA tests at baseline than in those who had not been tested. The PSA threshold for biopsy was 2. 5 ng/mL. Seventy-seven percent of men in the screened group attended at least one screen. At 18 years of follow-up, 1, 396 men in the screened group and 962 in the control group had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

### Prostate cancer screening: common questions and answers [^112vm4Rq]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed noncutaneous malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer death among men in the United States. Risk factors include older age, family history of prostate cancer, and Black race. Screening via prostate-specific antigen testing may lead to a small reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality, with no reduction in all-cause mortality, but it can cause significant harms related to false-positive test results, unnecessary biopsies, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. Shared decision-making is strongly recommended by all national guidelines before initiating screening. Most guidelines recommend screening every 2 to 4 years in men 55 to 69 years of age at average risk. After a positive prostate-specific antigen test result (more than 4 ng/mL), the test should be repeated. If the prostate-specific antigen level is still elevated, next steps include multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, assessment of urine or blood biomarkers, and referral to urology. Active surveillance is increasingly accepted as the preferred standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer, because it is associated with similar long-term survival and better quality of life than curative treatment. The primary intent of screening is to identify patients with clinically significant prostate cancer who may benefit from curative treatment while minimizing the detection of clinically insignificant cancer.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^1155Wa6X]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Future directions in prostate cancer screening — screening and diagnosis remain intensely debated with many unanswered questions, and research is encouraged through clinical trials and modeling studies that prioritize inclusion of historically underrepresented populations. Shared decision making (SDM) regarding whether to screen, how frequently, and when to proceed to secondary testing or biopsy is critically important, but clinicians tend to discuss benefits more than harms; there is an unmet need for multilingual decision aids for people with varying health literacy. For populations at higher risk (e.g., concerning family history, Black ancestry, genetic risk, or elevated baseline prostate-specific antigen [PSA]), targeted and perhaps more intensive screening warrants investigation, whereas people with a very low likelihood of clinically significant cancer may benefit from less intensive or discontinuation of screening. A more comprehensive understanding is required of how race and ethnicity affect the operating characteristics of PSA, secondary biomarkers, and prostate imaging, recognizing that many undergoing screening are of mixed or unknown race and ethnicity. Efforts should be made by clinicians, payors, and health care systems to bridge this gap.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^114a5coV]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society guideline — shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening emphasizes involving men in whether to initiate and continue testing and states that men must have a basic understanding of the potential benefits of early detection, the strengths and limitations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, and the risks of finding and treating screen-detected cancer. Health care providers can and should play a critical role, and we encourage providers and patients to use prostate cancer screening decision aids; for men who are unable to decide, the screening decision can be left to the discretion of the health care provider, who should factor into the decision his or her knowledge of the patient's general health preferences and values. In view of the delay between diagnosis through screening and the expected mortality benefit, we continue to recommend that men whose life expectancy is less than 10 years not pursue prostate cancer early detection, noting that the likelihood of benefit in these men is sufficiently low to be outweighed by the risk of harms from treatment in the near term.

In conclusion, the majority of urologists and GPs adhered to PCa testing guidelines. However, these guidelines do not include family history and many physicians indicated not to consider family history. Hence, PCa counseling might not be optimal for men with a positive family history. We propose that additional guidelines on this topic are developed in a multidisciplinary effort to optimize counseling.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^1161wJgF]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer early detection guideline — development and methods began by commissioning a series of systematic evidence reviews across early detection of prostate cancer, harms of therapy for localized prostate cancer, and shared and informed decision making in prostate cancer screening; within early detection, searches addressed 1) efficacy of screening in reducing mortality from prostate cancer, 2) test characteristics of prostate cancer screening in asymptomatic men, including sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, and 3) physical and psychological harms associated with screening; searches related to the harms of treating clinically localized prostate cancer were limited to radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, androgen-deprivation therapy, watchful waiting, and active surveillance; IDM/SDM searches targeted asymptomatic men without a diagnosis of prostate cancer and included intervention designs such as randomized controlled trials, randomized controlled trials with preintervention and postintervention, preintervention and postintervention with control, and preintervention and postintervention without control, with IDM/SDM outcomes categorized as 1) knowledge, 2) screening rates, 3) screening intention, 4) decisional conflict, 5) decisional confidence, 6) decisional anxiety, 7) decision/role preferences, 8) satisfaction, and 9) other; studies were identified by searching Medline for articles published between January 1950 and June 2009, with two authors independently reviewing titles, abstracts, and full texts and independently abstracting data, stratifying data when appropriate by characteristics such as age, race, and positive family history of prostate cancer, and resolving discrepancies by discussion; results were provided to all members of the ACS Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee, supplemented by presentations by experts, deliberated in meetings and conference calls, and then the guideline with the supporting document was circulated to peer reviewers and to the ACS Mission Outcomes Committee for review.

### Prostate cancer risk prediction based on complete prostate cancer family history [^113oiuj3]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

Other risk data known about the patient could be combined with the RR estimates presented here in any decision making process. This might be especially important in the event SNP data are available for the patient. Future work in this unique population resource includes model development to include even more specific family history variables and inclusion of other risk factors in the proband, for example, SNP variants, body mass index; as well as clinical characteristics of the PC in affected relatives (e.g. Gleason score or death due to prostate cancer).

There are limitations to this study. The UPDB genealogy data represents Utah pioneer founders and their descendants. Any PC cancers diagnosed out of state are censored, as are those occurring before 1966. Failure to link existing genealogy or cancer data could also result in data censoring. Such data censoring is more likely to lead to conservative, than exaggerated, risk estimates.

Currently the clinical relevance of these findings is limited by the fact that there is no consensus on prostate cancer screening. The results of the PLCO and ERSPC randomized prostate cancer screening trials have led to concerns about the utility of PSA screening and have questioned whether the harms of widespread screening surpass the benefits of early detection. The USPSTF recommends against screening, while the NCCN and AUA still acknowledge the potential benefit of PSA screening especially in patients at higher risk of prostate cancer. Both organizations recommend a man and his physicians discuss the risks and benefits of PSA screening and then make an informed decision about whether or not to pursue screening The knowledge of specific prostate cancer risk estimates associated with a man's detailed family history may further contribute to the selection of men who stand to benefit from targeted prostate cancer screening.

### Issues faced by unaffected men with a family history of prostate cancer: a multidisciplinary overview [^113uaKFx]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Despite the established importance of the role of family history in prostate cancer, relatively little research encompasses the psychosocial issues relevant to unaffected men with a family history of prostate cancer. To determine the completeness and quality of available literature on the issues faced by men with a high risk of prostate cancer, we conducted a multidisciplinary review of the literature to provide some guidance on the information that clinicians might provide to men who are concerned about family history.

Materials and Methods

A structured literature search was conducted by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and researchers who reviewed the medical and psychosocial literature, and identified 21 relevant studies.

Results

Research suggests that many high risk patients are concerned about the risk of prostate cancer, and some may significantly overestimate that risk. Several studies have shown high screening rates among high risk patients and high levels of interest in genetic testing for prostate cancer risk should it become available, yet many men also report a desire for more information about their personal risk and risk management options.

Conclusions

Given the lack of clear data on the efficacy of prostate cancer screening among high risk patients, clinicians could consider providing men who are concerned about family history with information on their personal risk, help them to clarify the potential benefits, limitations and harms of prostate cancer screening in their situation, and then support their choice regarding the management of prostate cancer risk.

### Clinically relevant changes in family history of cancer over time [^112ZuAqT]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

Knowledge of family cancer history is important for assessing cancer risk and guiding screening recommendations.

Objective

To quantify how often throughout adulthood clinically significant changes occur in cancer family history that would result in recommendations for earlier or intense screening.

Design and Setting

Descriptive study examining baseline and follow-up family history data from participants in the Cancer Genetics Network (CGN), a US national population-based cancer registry, between 1999 and 2009.

Participants

Adults with a personal history, family history, or both of cancer enrolled in the CGN through population-based cancer registries. Retrospective colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer screening-specific analyses included 9861, 2547, and 1817 participants, respectively; prospective analyses included 1533, 617, and 163 participants, respectively. Median follow-up was 8 years (range, 0–11 years). Screening-specific analyses excluded participants with the cancer of interest.

Main Outcome Measures

Percentage of individuals with clinically significant family histories and rate of change over 2 periods: (1) retrospectively, from birth until CGN enrollment and (2) prospectively, from enrollment to last follow-up.

Results

Retrospective analysis revealed that the percentages of participants who met criteria for high-risk screening based on family history at ages 30 and 50 years, respectively, were as follows: for colorectal cancer, 2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8%-2.4%) and 7.1% (95% CI, 6.5%-7.6%); for breast cancer, 7.2% (95% CI, 6.1%-8.4%) and 11.4% (95% CI, 10.0%-12.8%); and for prostate cancer, 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5%-1.4%) and 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.7%). In prospective analysis, the numbers of participants who newly met criteria for high-risk screening based on family history per 100 persons followed up for 20 years were 2 (95% CI, 0–7) for colorectal cancer, 6 (95% CI, 2–13) for breast cancer, and 8 (95% CI, 3–16) for prostate cancer. The rate of change in cancer family history was similar for colorectal and breast cancer between the 2 analyses.

Conclusion

Clinically relevant family history of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer that would result in recommendations for earlier or intense cancer screening increases between ages 30 and 50 years, although the absolute rate is low for prostate cancer.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement about screening for prostate cancer.

Methods

The USPSTF evaluated randomized, controlled trials of the benefits of prostate cancer screening; cohort and cross-sectional studies of the psychological harms of false-positive prostate-specific antigen test results; and evidence on the natural history of prostate-specific antigen-detected prostate cancer to address previously identified gaps in the evidence from the 2002 USPSTF recommendation.

Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at age 50 years, and men in higher risk groups should receive this information before age 50 years. Men should either receive this information directly from their health care providers or be referred to reliable and culturally appropriate sources, and patient decision aids are helpful in preparing men to make a decision whether to be tested.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer screening — men for whom screening is not recommended: For localized or regional prostate cancer the 5-year relative survival rate is nearly 100%, potential survival benefits from screening accrue late, and overdiagnosis is common; therefore ACS early detection guidelines have recommended that screening for prostate cancer be offered only to those men who are judged to have at least a 10-year life expectancy, and men who are unlikely to survive for at least 10 years are not suitable candidates. Supporting data include that in the ERSPC the survival curves for screened and unscreened groups did not separate significantly until 9 or 10 years after initiation, and it is estimated that from 23% to 42% of screen-detected cancers represent overdiagnosis, with rates that may exceed 50% in men aged 75 years and older; at age 75 years, about half of men have a life expectancy of 10 years or more.

### Urologists' current practices in screening and treating men with a family history of prostate cancer [^117DsMdr]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess urologists' knowledge and utilization of family history to determine prostate cancer (PC) screening and treatment recommendations.

Materials and Methods

Questionnaires that explored urologists' knowledge, frequency, and utilization of family history information for screening and treatment recommendations for PC were prospectively collected. Data were summarized and compared using descriptive statistics.

Results

A total of 87 responses were collected, for a response rate of 60% (87 of 145). The majority of urologists reported that they always collect family history when discussing risk (95%) or screening (87%), and recommended earlier screening for men with family history of PC in comparison with men with no family history. Although only 57% reported always collecting family history when discussing treatment, the majority of respondents reported that a positive family history influenced their treatment recommendations. Eight percent of urologists would recommend prostatectomy for men diagnosed with low-grade, low-risk PC and no family history of PC vs 52% who would recommend the same course of treatment when the patient had at least 1 first-degree relative who died of the disease. Conversely, 91% of urologists would recommend active surveillance for men with low-grade, low-risk PC and no family history vs 47% for those with at least 1 first-degree relative who died of the disease.

Conclusion

The majority of urologists collect information on family history of PC. Despite the lack of literature to support that patients with familial PC require more aggressive treatment, urologists were more likely to recommend definitive therapies.

### Guidelines for genetic testing in prostate cancer: a scoping review [^115nKyBL]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

c. Who should be considered for genetic testing?

All guidelines and consensus statements recommend genetic testing (germline and/or somatic) for men with metastatic prostate cancer. The NCCN guidelines offer the most detailed guidance across the three prostate cancer relevant guidelines included (Prostate Cancer; Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian and Pancreatic Cancer; and Colon Cancer). Essentially, germline testing is recommended for men with high- or very high-risk prostate cancer, regional or metastatic prostate cancer, regardless of family history. Germline testing is also recommended for men with a personal history of breast cancer or a positive family history of early onset breast, colorectal or endometrial cancer (age ≤ 50 years); ovarian, exocrine or pancreatic cancer (any age); prostate cancer ≤ 60 years or prostate cancer death; Lynch-syndrome related cancer, especially if diagnosed < 50 years; or Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

Somatic testing is recommended for men with hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer or castrate resistant metastatic prostate cancer. While many of the major guidelines offer less specific and/or less comprehensive criteria for genetic testing than NCCN, all recommend germline and somatic testing for men with metastatic prostate cancer, particularly for men with personal or family history or Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and early onset disease.

For men with early stage or localised prostate cancer, germline genetic testing is recommended only where it is likely to impact treatment, clinical trial options, risk management of other cancers and/or potential risk for family members. Testing criteria tend to focus on personal history of metastatic or high-risk prostate cancer, particularly early onset, and family history of prostate cancer, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal or endometrial cancer and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Some guidelines recommend germline testing for men who have confirmed DNA MMR deficiency or a pathogenic variant in a listed gene after tumour testing. For this population, one guideline makes no recommendations, while others suggest genetic testing be considered only for men with personal or family history of high-risk germline mutations and/or early onset prostate cancer.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116TXXUX]. CA (2010). Low credibility.

In 2009, the American Cancer Society (ACS) Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee began the process of a complete update of recommendations for early prostate cancer detection. A series of systematic evidence reviews was conducted focusing on evidence related to the early detection of prostate cancer, test performance, harms of therapy for localized prostate cancer, and shared and informed decision making in prostate cancer screening. The results of the systematic reviews were evaluated by the ACS Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee, and deliberations about the evidence occurred at committee meetings and during conference calls. On the basis of the evidence and a consensus process, the Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee developed the guideline, and a writing committee drafted a guideline document that was circulated to the entire committee for review and revision. The document was then circulated to peer reviewers for feedback, and finally to the ACS Mission Outcomes Committee and the ACS Board of Directors for approval. The ACS recommends that asymptomatic men who have at least a 10-year life expectancy have an opportunity to make an informed decision with their health care provider about screening for prostate cancer after they receive information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with prostate cancer screening. Prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision-making process. Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at age 50 years. Men in higher risk groups should receive this information before age 50 years. Men should either receive this information directly from their health care providers or be referred to reliable and culturally appropriate sources. Patient decision aids are helpful in preparing men to make a decision whether to be tested.

The 2020 NCCN 'Clinical Practice Guideline in Oncology: Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian and Pancreatic; Version 1.2021′ state BRCA1/2 (and other cancer susceptibility genes) testing is clinically indicated in men (any age) with a personal history of metastatic or intraductal PrCa. Testing is also indicated in men with a personal history of Gleason ≥ 7 with: Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, ≥ 1 close blood relative (first, second or third-degree relative on same side of family) with breast cancer < 50 years of age/ ≥ 1 close blood relative with ovarian/pancreatic/metastatic PrCa/intraductal PrCa at any age/ ≥ 2 close relatives with breast or PrCa (any grade) at any age. Unaffected men with a FH of PrCa with a first or second-degree blood relative meeting any one of the previously mentioned criteria would also qualify for germline testing.

The latest (2020) NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Prostate Cancer Version 3.2020 also recommend germline genetic testing for men with NCCN high-risk, very high risk regional or metastatic PrCa, for all men of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, a known FH of BRCA1/2 or Lynch Syndrome, a FH of brother/father/multiple family members diagnosed with PrCa (except GGG1) at < 60 years old OR who died from PrCa. Testing is also advised for men with a FH of3 cancers on the same side of the family including bile duct, breast, ovary, colorectal, endometrial, pancreatic, kidney, melanoma, small bowel, urothelial or prostate (except GG1).

The latest (2020) NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Prostate Cancer Early Detection Version 2.2020 August 24, 2020 recommends annual PSA screening for men with known BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants due to their increased risk of subclinical, high-grade disease, increased mortality and earlier age at diagnosis.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^116zVqjc]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Adapting the offer for men at higher risk of prostate cancer and death

The linked systematic review did not find a relative subgroup effect by age: the effects of screening are consistent across age strata. Age of men enrolling in the studies ranged from 45 to 80 years, with most aged 50–69 years. The panel believes the evidence thus applies to men regardless of age. However, any possible benefit of screening is likely to become negligible as life expectancy decreases due to age or comorbidities.

There were no randomised data on whether screening efficacy differed in those with a family history of prostate cancer, men of African descent, or men from lower socioeconomic levels. It remains uncertain whether the relative effect of screening is similar to that in the general population. However, these factors are associated with higher incidence of prostate cancer and higher risk of prostate cancer death in observational studies, as well as in follow-up publications of the trials included in the linked review (Finnishand Swissarms from the ERSPC trial and the PLCO trial). Using evidence from these trials, we adapted the baseline risk in our summary of findings, using the same studies at lower risk of bias (that is, ERSPC data). In these studies, family history was assessed by self reporting in a questionnaire and defined positive if a man reported that his father or at least one brother had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. For race or ethnicity, non-Hispanic black men were compared with non-Hispanic white men. Level of education was used as a proxy for socioeconomic status, and men with primary education only were defined as having a low level of education and men with secondary or tertiary education defined as having high level of education.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk population, ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining early PSA screening (baseline PSA followed by risk-adapted follow-up) in males aged > 50 years, or earlier in individuals with any of the following:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Family history of prostate cancer|- > 45 years of age|
|African-Americans|- > 45 years of age|
|BRCA1/2 mutation carriers|- > 40 years of age.|

Community-based screening prerequisites — men who have no access to regular care should be tested only if high-quality, informed decision-making can be assured through community-based screening programs, and such programs also must assure that participants with abnormal screening results receive appropriate counseling and follow-up care if needed; availability of follow-up care must not be an afterthought, and unless these program elements are in place, community-based screening should not be initiated.
