## Question

When should renal function be monitored after initiating an ACE inhibitor?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to monitor renal function after starting an ACE inhibitor, with clear thresholds for action and evidence-based timing of lab checks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what to establish at baseline before the first dose. Then, I should verify how to risk-stratify for early follow-up. Next, I will determine when the first and subsequent monitoring should occur. After that, I need to interpret expected versus concerning changes in creatinine and potassium and decide when to continue, adjust, or stop therapy. Finally, I should consider special populations, concomitant drugs, and patient education to reduce avoidable risk.

> Let me first confirm the baseline assessment before the initial ACE inhibitor dose. I need to obtain serum creatinine to calculate eGFR and serum potassium, and document blood pressure, volume status, and concomitant medications that affect renal hemodynamics or potassium handling, because subsequent decisions hinge on relative changes from baseline and modifiable contributors like diuretics, NSAIDs, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^113jWG18] [^117QJepm].

> Next, I should review risk features to tailor how soon and how often I recheck labs. Patients with CKD, heart failure, diabetes, reduced eGFR, higher baseline potassium, older age, and those on interacting drugs such as MRAs, potassium supplements, or NSAIDs have greater risk for hyperkalemia and early creatinine rises, so they merit earlier and closer monitoring after ACE inhibitor initiation [^113jWG18] [^116LxTm8].

> My initial impulse is to recheck creatinine and potassium universally within one week, but wait, let me verify the guideline cadence. KDIGO 2024 recommends assessing blood pressure, serum creatinine, and potassium within 2–4 weeks after starting or uptitrating a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor, whereas high-risk patients are often monitored earlier, with several guidance sources and diabetes guidelines supporting a 1–2 week check, and older KDIGO/organizational pathways advising even within 1 week for the highest-risk profiles, so I will individualize timing to risk while aligning with the 2–4 week window for most [^117QJepm] [^1111qm9T] [^113jWG18].

> I need to ensure I am applying the correct thresholds for acceptable creatinine changes. A creatinine rise up to 30% from baseline within about 4 weeks of initiation is generally acceptable and should not trigger automatic discontinuation, while rises exceeding 30% prompt evaluation of reversible factors and consideration of dose reduction or cessation if not correctable, with KDIGO explicitly recommending continuation unless the creatinine increase exceeds 30% in that early window [^113LV5s7] [^116EehxT] [^11652hvH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that any small rise is benign. There is a graded association between early creatinine increases and long-term adverse outcomes in real-world cohorts, yet these signals identify higher-risk patients rather than mandating stopping RAS blockade in the absence of other problems, so when I see a 10–29% increase I should confirm true hemodynamic causation, review for volume depletion, diuretic changes, NSAIDs, or renovascular disease, and optimize supportive care while generally continuing therapy given its renoprotective benefits demonstrated across CKD populations [^111mkq3i] [^114UVwm5] [^115VhSvD].

> I will now examine potassium monitoring and response. I should confirm baseline potassium and recheck within 1–2 weeks in higher-risk patients or those on MRAs, and within 2–4 weeks for most, aiming to treat hyperkalemia rather than reflexively stop the ACE inhibitor, reserving dose reduction or discontinuation for cases of uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical management, with heightened vigilance when ACE inhibitors are combined with agents that raise potassium such as spironolactone [^111jWzdo] [^116LxTm8] [^113jWG18] [^117QJepm].

> Let me think about sick-day management, because this often drives real-life swings in creatinine and potassium. The diabetes guideline encourages providing a sick-day medication list to pause nephrotoxic or hemodynamically active drugs during acute volume-depleting illnesses in people with CKD and diabetes, but I should balance this with contemporary heart failure and renal guidance cautioning that indiscriminate sick-day stopping can cause harm if patients fail to restart, so I will individualize advice and ensure timely resumption once euvolemia returns [^1111qm9T] [^114Fafef] [^111chWTX].

> I should double-check the plan for ongoing surveillance after the first follow-up. After any dose change, I will repeat creatinine and potassium within 2–4 weeks, whereas in stable patients with preserved eGFR and normal potassium I can extend intervals, adjusting to kidney function and concomitant therapies, recognizing that KDIGO advises tailoring frequency to GFR and potassium and that inpatient or AKI-prone contexts require individualized monitoring intensity based on clinical course [^117QJepm] [^114Z4qvR] [^114nqdGk].

> Next, I should review when to persist, titrate, or stop ACE inhibition beyond creatinine and potassium thresholds. I will aim for the highest tolerated dose for kidney and cardiovascular protection, continuing therapy unless limited by symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite treatment, or a creatinine rise beyond 30% that does not improve with correction of contributing factors, keeping the original indication in mind because prognostic benefits in CKD with albuminuria and in HFrEF are substantial [^115VhSvD] [^111jWzdo] [^112GvUmE].

> But wait, what about advanced CKD where clinicians sometimes stop ACE inhibitors due to rising creatinine. The contemporary STOP-ACEi analysis indicates that routine discontinuation in progressive stage 4–5 CKD did not improve eGFR trajectory and may worsen kidney failure outcomes in some subgroups, so I should avoid withdrawing renin–angiotensin blockade solely due to low eGFR, instead monitoring closely and addressing hyperkalemia or hypotension if they occur [^117Cjtr6] [^112toQD1].

> I need to ensure I am not compounding risk with dual renin–angiotensin blockade. Combining an ACE inhibitor with an ARB reduces proteinuria but increases the risk of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury without improving hard renal outcomes in diabetic nephropathy, so I should avoid ACE inhibitor plus ARB co-therapy in routine practice and thus simplify monitoring and risk mitigation [^116c1Yt9].

> Let me consider perioperative and hemodynamic contexts because they alter monitoring needs. Continuing ACE inhibitors through noncardiac surgery is associated with more intraoperative hypotension and a modest rise in postoperative creatinine in observational data, whereas biomarker studies suggest such rises can be functional rather than structural, so for higher-risk surgeries I will often withhold the dose within 24 hours pre-op and resume post-op once hemodynamics and renal perfusion are stable, with a prompt creatinine and potassium check after reinitiation [^116gwfGh] [^112dK8BW].

> I should confirm that I have addressed drug–drug interactions and patient counseling that prevent avoidable lab abnormalities. I will instruct patients to avoid NSAIDs and potassium-containing salt substitutes, review over-the-counter supplements, and be cautious when adding MRAs or dose-escalating diuretics, arranging earlier potassium checks when such combinations are necessary because they increase hyperkalemia and renal function fluctuation risk [^116LxTm8].

> To synthesize a practical flow with self-checks: establish baseline creatinine, eGFR, potassium, blood pressure, volume status, and concomitant medications; start the ACE inhibitor and plan a first follow-up at 2–4 weeks for most or 1–2 weeks if high risk; if creatinine rises less than or equal to 30%, generally continue and correct reversible factors; if creatinine rises more than 30% or potassium remains uncontrolled despite treatment, reduce dose or temporarily stop while addressing contributors; repeat labs 2–4 weeks after any dose change and individualize longer-term intervals based on kidney function, potassium trends, and comedications, all while titrating to the maximally tolerated dose for cardiorenal benefit [^117QJepm] [^113LV5s7] [^111jWzdo] [^115VhSvD].

Check renal function (serum creatinine/eGFR and potassium) within 2–4 weeks [^114xzkea] after starting or increasing an ACE inhibitor, per KDIGO 2024 [^117QJepm]. For high-risk patients (CKD, diabetes, heart failure, elderly, or on diuretics/NSAIDs), check within 1 week [^1111qm9T] and monitor more frequently [^113jWG18]. Continue ACEi unless creatinine rises > 30% [^113LV5s7] or potassium > 5.5 mmol/L [^114LBRqk]; if so, reassess, adjust dose, or stop therapy [^111jWzdo]. Routine monitoring is essential to detect early AKI [^114nqdGk] or hyperkalemia [^113jWG18] and guide safe titration [^114xzkea].

## Recommended timing for renal function monitoring

- **Initial monitoring**: KDIGO 2024 recommends checking serum creatinine, eGFR, and potassium within 2–4 weeks [^117QJepm] of starting or increasing an ACEi, tailored to baseline GFR and potassium [^114xzkea].

- **High-risk patients**: For CKD, diabetes, heart failure, elderly, or those on diuretics/NSAIDs, check within 1 week [^1111qm9T] and monitor more frequently [^114LBRqk].

- **Subsequent monitoring**: After the initial check, monitor every 3–6 months, or more often if CKD progresses or hyperkalemia develops.

---

## Clinical rationale for monitoring renal function

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: ACEis can cause functional AKI, especially in CKD, heart failure, or volume depletion [^112dK8BW] [^114Z4qvR].

- **Hyperkalemia**: ACEis can raise potassium, particularly in CKD or with potassium-sparing drugs [^114LBRqk] [^113jWG18].

- **Long-term renal protection**: Early detection of AKI or hyperkalemia allows timely adjustment, preserving renal function and enabling continued ACEi benefit [^116uCvV1].

---

## Clinical thresholds for action

Serum creatinine **increase > 30% within 4 weeks** should prompt reassessment and consideration of dose reduction or discontinuation [^113LV5s7] [^111jWzdo]; otherwise, continue the ACEi. Hyperkalemia (** > 5.5 mmol/L**) [^114LBRqk] warrants reducing or stopping the ACEi and treating the hyperkalemia [^111jWzdo].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing monitoring frequency

- **Baseline renal function**: Lower eGFR requires closer monitoring.

- **Comorbidities**: CKD, diabetes [^1161iYyS], heart failure, and hypertension increase risk and warrant more frequent checks [^114Z4qvR].

- **Concurrent medications**: Diuretics, NSAIDs [^112dK8BW], and potassium-sparing agents [^116LxTm8] increase risk of AKI or hyperkalemia, necessitating closer monitoring.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Initial monitoring** | **Subsequent monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| General population | 2–4 weeks after initiation [^117QJepm] | Every 3–6 months |
| High-risk patients (CKD, diabetes, heart failure, elderly, diuretics/NSAIDs) | Within 1 week after initiation [^1111qm9T] | - More frequent <br/> - Individualized |
| Creatinine increase > 30% or potassium > 5.5 mmol/L | Immediate reassessment | Adjust dose or discontinue [^111jWzdo] |

---

Renal function should be checked **within 2–4 weeks** [^117QJepm] after starting or increasing an ACEi, with earlier and more frequent monitoring in high-risk patients [^1111qm9T]. This approach facilitates early detection of AKI and hyperkalemia, enabling safe titration and continued ACEi benefit [^116uCvV1].

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, specifically with respect to RAAS inhibitors and ACEis/ARBs, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend continuing ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine increases by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^113jWG18]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-I) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing blood pressure and proteinuria, slowing the progression of kidney disease, and improving outcomes in patients with heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and post–myocardial infarction. However, these medications have also been associated with adverse events, including hyperkalemia. Although adverse events can occur at any level of kidney function, the risk is thought to be greatest in those with chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure. Thus, concern for adverse effects may lead to underutilization in the subgroups of patients who are expected to derive the greatest benefit.

Clinical detection of hyperkalemia requires laboratory evaluation, and close laboratory monitoring is recommended during ACE‐inhibitor or ARB use. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on chronic kidney disease evaluation and management recommends assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and potassium within one week after initiating or increasing the dose of an ACE‐I or ARB, regardless of baseline potassium level. The 2004 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) suggests a more detailed algorithm: monitor laboratory values within the first four weeks after initiation or dose change for high-risk patients (defined as having systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, serum potassium > 4.5 mmol/L, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²) and within 4 to 12 weeks for all other patients.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes [^1111qm9T]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are significant. The 2018 guidelines recommend assessing serum creatinine and potassium levels at baseline and within 1–2 weeks of initiation or titration of therapy. It is also advised to do so during times of acute illness in patients with diabetes on ACE inhibitors or direct renin inhibitors. Additionally, provide a "sick-day" medication list to adult patients with diabetes and CKD, outlining which medications should be held during times of acute illness.

Blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system are the mainstays of therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Research has confirmed the benefits in mild CKD, but data on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in advanced CKD are lacking. In the STOP-ACEi trial, we aim to confirm preliminary findings that suggest withdrawal of ACEi/ARB treatment can stabilize or even improve renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD.

Regarding the medical management of diabetic nephropathy, particularly concerning RAAS inhibitors like ACE inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend initiating either an ACEi or an ARB in nonpregnant patients with diabetes and hypertension who have moderately increased albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30–299 mg/g creatinine) and/or an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². The medication should be titrated to the maximally tolerated dose to prevent the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular events.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^115bTM7k]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Many post hoc analyses of clinical trials have examined the prognostic significance of a deterioration in renal function after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment. In clinical trials of patients with heart failure, deterioration in renal function after starting ACEI/ARB treatment is commonly found. Although this deterioration is associated with a poorer prognosis compared with patients with preserved renal function, the overall benefits of ACEI/ARB treatment compared with placebo remain for cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Our study does not undermine that evidence but flags that the risk-benefit ratio may differ among patients with marked changes in creatinine concentrations. This is particularly the case for other prescribing indications for which the clinical trial evidence is less clear.

The recommendation in many international guidelines to stop ACEI/ARB treatment if creatinine rises by 30% or more after initiation is founded on a single review of 12 clinical trials of ACEI/ARB treatment for diabetes and heart failure. Studies included in this review evaluated progression of renal disease among patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Of these studies, only six were double-blinded and included a total of 1,102 participants. These trials were published during 1993–97 and may not relate to patients receiving contemporary routine clinical care. The methods that define a cut-off level of creatinine increase at 30% for cessation are not clearly presented. In addition, the results provided by these studies are not supported by later trials.

### The assessment of renal function in relation to the use of drugs in elderly in nursing homes; a cohort study [^112mL6GW]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are used for the treatment of congestive heart failure, hypertension, secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, and for slowing the progression of renal disease. Hyperkalemia does not usually occur in renocompetent patients but can be common in patients with renal impairment, diabetes, and those taking medications that interfere with renal potassium secretion. Therefore, potassium levels should be monitored carefully in patients at risk. There is no specific creatinine level that is an absolute contraindication to ACEI therapy. However, it is recommended to titrate the dosage slowly when initiating treatment, and the target dosage may have to be reduced. An initial increase of 20 percent in serum creatinine levels is common, but it is not an indication for discontinuing the medication. The same cautions apply when prescribing angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) as ACEI.

Digoxin is used as symptomatic treatment in subjects with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Morbidity associated with the use of digoxin is common due to its narrow therapeutic index. The toxicity of digoxin is dose-dependent and is often the result of alterations in renal function. In patients with renal impairment, digoxin therapy is associated with an increase in the risk of cardiac dysrhythmias. For this reason, it is recommended to reduce the dose in these patients, and the serum concentration must be monitored carefully.

There is not much research on the population of frail elderly in nursing homes, although these patients often have bo…

### Initial estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and long-term renal function during intensive antihypertensive therapy: A post hoc analysis of the SPRINT and ACCORD-BP randomized controlled trials [^113jvqKH]. Hypertension (2020). High credibility.

In line with earlier separate analyses of SPRINT and ACCORD, we observed that patients in the pooled cohort with a higher initial eGFR decline are at increased CVD risk and experience more events during follow-up. However, these studies suggest that the increased risk of CVD is not a consequence of intensive BP-lowering, as the effect is independent of treatment allocation. A post hoc analysis of the SOLVD (Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction) trial in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction showed no increased risk of death in patients randomized to ACE inhibition compared with placebo when stratified to initial eGFR decline. Similarly, post hoc analyses of the AASK (African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension) and MDRD trials (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) in patients with CKD showed that an initial decline in renal function is associated with an increased risk for end-stage renal disease and mortality in patients with CKD. However, this association was only significant in the > 20% decline strata in the intensive group, while in the standard group, the 5% to 20% stratum was already associated with adverse events. Corroborating these data, a recent post hoc analysis of the ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation) showed that the creatinine increase during the run-in phase was associated with an elevated cardiovascular risk but did not influence the effect of treatment on cardiovascular events. Our analysis extends these findings by showing

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^112i7NXE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition resulting from damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is increasingly common due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, heightened clinical awareness, and the international adoption of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) classification. Early detection and management of CKD offer the opportunity to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending renal replacement therapy. They also allow for interventions to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on renal outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of renal impairment severity have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain.

- **Objectives**: This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB, or both, in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus.

- **Search strategy**: In March 2010, we searched The Cochrane Library, including The Cochrane Renal Group's specialized register and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Reference lists of review articles and relevant studies were also checked. The search was conducted using the optimally sensitive strategy developed.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist therapy is associated with prolonged patient and graft survival after renal transplantation [^115PM2Ms]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) reduce cardiovascular death in the general population, but data for renal transplant recipients remain elusive. Similarly, ACEI/ARB have been shown to reduce proteinuria, but data on graft survival are lacking. Therefore, a retrospective open cohort study was conducted on 2031 patients who received their first renal allograft at the Medical University of Vienna between 1990 and 2003 and survived at least 3 months. Patient and graft survival were compared between patients with versus without ACEI and/or ARB therapy. Data were analyzed with and without propensity score models for ACEI/ARB therapy. Medication and comorbidities were analyzed as time-dependent variables in the Cox regression analyses.

Ten-year survival rates were 74% in the ACEI/ARB group but only 53% in the no ACEI/ARB group (P < 0.001). The hazard ratio (HR) of ACEI/ARB use for mortality was 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.81) compared with non-use. Ten-year actual graft survival rate was 59% in ACEI/ARB patients but only 41% in non-users (P = 0.002). The HR of actual graft failure for ACEI/ARB recipients was 0.55 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.70) compared with non-users; the HR of functional graft survival was 0.56 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.78). Ten-year unadjusted functional graft survival rates were 76% among ACEI/ARB patients and 71% in no ACEI/ARB recipients (P = 0.57). In summary, the use of ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with longer patient and graft survival after renal transplantation. More frequent use of these medications may be beneficial.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^114LBRqk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The prediction of hyperkalemia following ACE‐I or ARB initiation shows that the susceptibility score — predicted probability of developing a potassium level greater than 5.5 mmol/L within a year — varies by patient profile. Patients with relatively preserved eGFR or baseline potassium levels exceeding 5.5 mmol/L are more likely to experience hyperkalemia in the year following ACE initiation.

Within the SCREAM cohort, comprising all new users of ACE‐I or ARB therapy, it was found that 91.8% had a predicted risk greater than 20%. Conversely, the risks among new users without potassium checks in the year following medication initiation were lower, with 95.6% having a predicted risk of less than 20%.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: National guidance [^114Fafef]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

The interaction between treatment for heart failure and decline in renal function is frequently misunderstood, and it is commonly used as a reason to withhold potentially life-prolonging therapy. This misunderstanding is not helped by referring to RAAS inhibitors as 'nephrotoxic' drugs, which they most emphatically are not. Well-meaning but poorly evidenced recommendations to give patients 'sick day rules' have the potential to cause harm when patients stop their medication for minor illnesses or fail to restart them once the illness has passed.

Of even greater concern is inaccurate advice given by bodies such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which suggested that 'concomitant use of spironolactone with ACEi or ARB is not routinely recommended'. The combination is vital for patients with symptomatic HFrEF; however, close monitoring of renal function and potassium is crucial when using MRA and other RAAS inhibitors together.

There is a danger that concerns over renal function may prevent patients from receiving medication beneficial to their long-term outcome. While a decline in renal function is important and may require drugs to be stopped, it should only occur after very careful consideration of the risks and benefits to the individual patient.

- **Management of patients with AKI or worsening renal function receiving RAAS inhibitor**: Clinical assessment of the individual patient is key. In all cases, consider the original indication for the RAAS inhibitor concerning major prognostic benefits, such as HFrEF and post-MI.

The KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend that, in the context of medical management for chronic kidney disease — specifically in the management of hypertension — RAAS inhibitors should be continued. ACEi or ARB therapy should not be discontinued unless there is a rise in serum creatinine by more than 30% within four weeks following the initiation of treatment or an increase in dose.

### The association of withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers on acute kidney injury after non-cardiac surgery [^116gwfGh]. Anaesthesia (2024). Low credibility.

Withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers peri-operatively in non-cardiac surgery remains controversial as they may result in intra-operative hypotension and postoperative organ damage.

- **Methods**: We included patients prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers who underwent surgical procedures lasting more than one hour under general or spinal anaesthesia from January 2012 to June 2022 in a single center. We categorised patients by whether these drugs were withheld for 24 hours before surgery. We evaluated the association of withholding these drugs before non-cardiac surgery with creatinine concentrations that increased by ≥ 26.4 μmol/l in the first 48 postoperative hours (acute kidney injury). We also analysed changes in creatinine concentrations and estimated glomerular filtration rates.

- **Results**: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers were withheld in 24,285 of 32,933 (74%) patients and continued in 8,648 (26%) patients. We used propensity scores for drug discontinuation to match 8,631 patient pairs who did or did not continue these drugs. Acute kidney injury was recorded for 1,791 (21%) patients who continued these drugs versus 1,587 (18%) who did not (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08–1.25, p < 0.001). Intra-operative hypotension was recorded for 3,892 (45%) patients who continued drugs versus 3,373 (39%) patients who did not (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.21–1.36, p < 0.001). Continuing drugs was independently associated with a mean increase in creatinine of 2.2 μmol/l (p < 0.001).

### Early rapid decline in kidney function as a beneficial sign after starting antihypertensive medication [^111gF8qq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

On the other hand, the alternative for endovascular procedures in renovascular hypertension, medical therapy alone, also conveys a suspicious risk of temporary renal function deterioration. Many physicians have noticed this in their practice, and studies have revealed similar findings. This is not only true in situations where systemic or isolated glomerular hypovolemia and hypoperfusion are present, such as with infectious diarrhea, reduced drinking volume, or bleeding, resulting in full-blown acute kidney failure.

The randomized ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified-Release Controlled Evaluation) trial investigated the effect of starting perindopril-indapamide (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with thiazide) or placebo in kidney-stable patients on the occurrence of major macrovascular events, new or worsening nephropathy, and all-cause mortality. Interestingly, although an initial GFR decrease was associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular endpoints, the frequency of nephropathy was not higher in patients in whom the study medication was continued, despite an early GFR decrease. These study authors argued that while initial short-term increases in serum creatinine beyond 30% (and indeed even 20%) are associated with a less favorable prognosis, the continuation of ACE inhibitor-based therapy in those who experience these levels of increase may be beneficial and reduce the long-term risk of major clinical outcomes.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^116uCvV1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that occurs as a result of damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory-estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, raised clinical awareness, and international adoption of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. Early recognition and management of CKD afford the opportunity to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending kidney replacement therapy, as well as for intervention to reduce the risk of disease progression and cardiovascular disease.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on kidney outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of severity of kidney impairment have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain. This is an update of a review that was last published in 2011.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB or both in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus (DM).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 6 July 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and conference proceedings.

### Evaluation of the stopping angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor compared to angiotensin receptor blocker (STOP ACEi trial) in advanced and progressive chronic kidney disease [^117Cjtr6]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

In the STOP-ACEi trial, the outcome was similar whether or not renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) were discontinued. We now investigate whether the effect of withdrawing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) differed.

In this open-label trial, patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) under 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) were randomized to stop or continue RASi. The primary outcome was eGFR at three years. The composite of kidney failure, over 50% fall in eGFR, or kidney replacement therapy (KRT) was also assessed.

Of patients randomized, 99 stopped and 123 continued ACEi, while 104 stopped and 77 continued ARB at baseline. At three years, the eGFR was similar whether or not patients were withdrawn from ACEi or from ARB. Kidney failure or initiation of KRT occurred in 65% of those stopping and 54% continuing ACEi (hazard ratio if stopped, 1.52; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.07 to 2.16) and in 60% on an ARB regardless of randomized group (hazard ratio if stopped, 1.23; 0.83 to 1.81).

Kidney failure/initiation of KRT with over 50% decline in eGFR occurred in 71% of those stopping and 59% continuing ACEi (relative risk if stopped, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.41) and in 65% stopping and 69% continuing ARB (relative risk if stopped, 0.96; 0.79 to 1.16). Thus, neither discontinuing ACEi nor ARB slowed the rate of decline in eGFR. Although discontinuation of ACEi appeared to have more unfavorable effects on kidney outcomes than stopping ARB, the trial was neither designed…

### Association of albuminuria levels with the prescription of renin-angiotensin system blockade [^11296y51]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Multiple clinical guidelines recommend an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) in patients with elevated albuminuria, which can be measured through urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), protein-to-creatinine ratio, or dipstick. However, how albuminuria test results relate to the prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB is uncertain. We identified individuals with an ACR measurement between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2018, with no contraindications or allergy to ACE inhibitor/ARB. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses to evaluate the association between ACR level and prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB within 6 months after the test. We applied similar methods to investigate the association of protein-to-creatinine ratio and dipstick measurement results with the prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB.

Among 67,237 individuals with an ACR measurement, 47.7% were already taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB at the time of the first ACR measurement. Among the 35,138 individuals who were not on ACE inhibitor/ARB, those with higher ACR levels were more likely to be prescribed ACE inhibitor/ARB in the following 6 months, with steep increases in prescriptions until ACR 300 mg/g, after which the association plateaued. The majority (80.9%) of ACE inhibitor/ARB prescriptions were made by family medicine and internal medicine specialists. A similar pattern was observed in the cohorts tested by protein-to-creatinine ratio and dipstick measurement. Our study provides evidence that albuminuria test results change patient care, suggesting adherence to albuminuria testing guidelines can impact treatment decisions.

### Is it the agent or the blood pressure level that matters for renal protection in chronic nephropathies [^112YWtLY]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Some antihypertensive agents may be capable of reducing chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) progression because they halt some of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in renal damage. Although this effect seems to be partially independent of BP reduction, it is still unclear whether these drugs are really superior to other antihypertensive agents when the BP values recommended by the present guidelines are actually achieved. This is particularly true when considering that, in published trials, target and achieved BP values were consistently higher than those nowadays recommended.

Furthermore, in the majority of these studies, patients treated with ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) or Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ATIIRA) achieved lower BP values than those in control groups, and BP values during 24 h were not recorded. Anyway, taking into account the role of baseline and follow-up BP values, the treatment effect remained significant in almost all of the multivariate models. These findings suggest that the renoprotective effect of these agents (ACE-I, ATIIRA) is partially independent of better BP control.

However, caution should be paid in attributing true biologic renoprotective properties to drugs just on the basis of statistical adjustments of BP values, although robustly performed, without being aware of what those BP values actually reflect.

### Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in advanced chronic kidney disease: How low can the kidney function go [^112toQD1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

To present the available data on the risks and benefits for ACEi/ARB usage in patients with advanced CKD, it has been well established that ACEi/ARB use is beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate CKD, especially in patients with proteinuria. The majority of available data includes patients with diabetes mellitus. However, data in individuals with advanced CKD are limited. Additionally, data available for this subset of patients is conflicting, and the definition of advanced CKD varies across clinical trials.

On the basis of our literature review, evidence suggests continuing ACEi/ARB therapy in patients with advanced CKD (eGFR less than 15ml/min/1.73m) unless hyperkalemia ensues unresponsive to therapy, hypotension develops, or there is an unusually rapid worsening of eGFR (not the usual progressive decline). These patients should be monitored closely. There is not enough data to support starting ACEi/ARBs de novo in patients with advanced CKD (eGFR less than 15ml/min/1.73m). If RAS blockade is started de novo in this subgroup, we recommend close monitoring.

### Outcome in acute heart failure: Prognostic value of acute kidney injury and worsening renal function [^117TSspf]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of worsening renal function (WRF) in acute heart failure is debated. Moreover, it is not clear if the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in this context is detrimental.

- **Method and results**: In a retrospective cohort study of 646 patients hospitalized for acute heart failure, the risk of death or readmission associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) present at admission, WRF during the first 7 days, and up-titration of ACEI/ARB were analyzed in a Cox proportional hazards model. AKI, WRF, hemoglobin concentration, ACEI/ARB up-titration, and use of loop diuretics before admission were significantly associated with the primary outcome in univariate analysis. In a multivariate model, the association remained significant for AKI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–1.47; p = 0.0002), WRF (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06–1.45; p = 0.0059), and ACEI/ARB up-titration (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.97; p = 0.026). There was no excess mortality in patients with ACEI/ARB up-titration despite WRF.

- **Conclusions**: Both AKI and WRF are strongly associated with poor outcome in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure. ACEI/ARB up-titration seems to be protective.

### Enalaprilat [^1165Jcif]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The usual dose of 1.25 mg of enalaprilat every six hours is recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance > 30 mL/min (serum creatinine of up to approximately 3 mg/dL). For patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min (serum creatinine ≥ 3 mg/dL), the initial dose is 0.625 mg (see WARNINGS). If, after one hour, there is an inadequate clinical response, the 0.625 mg dose may be repeated. Additional doses of 1.25 mg may be administered at six-hour intervals.

For dialysis patients, see below, "Patients at Risk of Excessive Hypotension".

For conversion from intravenous to oral therapy, the recommended initial dose of Vasotec (enalapril maleate) tablets is 5 mg once a day for patients with creatinine clearance > 30 mL/min and 2.5 mg once daily for patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response.

- **Patients at risk of excessive hypotension**: Hypertensive patients at risk of excessive hypotension include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure, hyponatremia, high-dose diuretic therapy, recent intensive diuresis or increase in diuretic dose, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology (see WARNINGS). Single doses of enalaprilat as low as 0.2 mg have produced excessive hypotension in normotensive patients with these diagnoses. Because of the potential for an extreme hypotensive response in these patients, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. The starting dose should be no greater than…

### Association of acute increases in plasma creatinine after renin-angiotensin blockade with subsequent outcomes [^111mkq3i]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Data from observational and interventional studies provide discordant results regarding the relationship between creatinine increase after renin-angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) and adverse outcomes. We compared health outcomes among patients with different categories of increase in creatinine upon initiation of RASi in a large population-based cohort.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements database, which contains complete information on diagnoses, medication dispensation claims, and laboratory test results for all Stockholm citizens accessing health care. Included were 31,951 adults initiating RASi during 2007–2011 with available pre- and post-initiation creatinine monitoring. Multivariable Cox regression was used to compare mortality, cardiovascular, and ESKD events among individuals with different ranges of creatinine increases within 2 months after starting treatment.

- **Results**: In a median follow-up of 3.5 years, acute increases in creatinine were associated with mortality (3,202 events) in a graded manner: compared with creatinine increases < 10%, a 10%-19% increase showed an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.15 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05 to 1.27); HR 1.22 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.40) for 20%-29%; HR 1.55 (95% CI, 1.36 to 1.77) for ≥ 30%. Similar graded associations were present for heart failure (2,275 events, P < 0.001) and ESKD (52 events; P < 0.001) and, less consistently, myocardial infarction (842 events, P = 0.25). Results were robust across subgroups.

### Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use with outcomes after acute kidney injury [^114jRQLg]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at an increased long-term risk of death. Effective strategies that improve long-term outcomes in patients with AKI are unknown. This study aims to evaluate whether the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) after hospital discharge is associated with better outcomes in patients with AKI.

This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Alberta Kidney Disease Network population database, evaluating 46,253 adults aged 18 years or older who experienced an AKI episode during a hospitalization between July 1, 2008, and March 31, 2015, in Alberta, Canada. All patients who survived to hospital discharge were followed up for a minimum of two years.

The study focused on the use of an ACEI or ARB within six months post-hospital discharge. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for a renal cause, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a composite outcome of ESRD or sustained doubling of serum creatinine concentration. AKI was defined as a 50% increase between prehospital and peak in-hospital serum creatinine concentrations. Propensity scores were employed to construct a matched-pairs cohort of patients with and without a prescription for an ACEI or ARB within six months post-hospital discharge.

The study evaluated 46,253 adults with a mean (SD) age of 68.6 (16.4) years, with 24,436 (52.8%) being male. Within six months of discharge, 22,193 (48.0%) of the participants were prescribed an ACEI or ARB.

### Impact of early initiation of renin-angiotensin blockade on renal function and clinical outcomes in patients with hypertensive emergency: a retrospective cohort study [^114npfto]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Although the progress in drug development facilitates efficient management of blood pressure in hypertensive emergencies, controversy remains as to whether the early blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system confers short- and long-term benefits on target organs.

This study elucidates whether renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), established to alleviate the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), contribute to the recovery of renal function following hypertensive emergencies. When RASi treatment is started early during hospitalization, a progressive increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is noted during the first six months following the initiation of antihypertensive therapy (Figure 1A).

Even in patients with moderately to severely impaired renal function, the same tendency is observed along with similar changes in hematocrit (Figure 2).

In contrast, patients without RASi treatment show unaltered eGFR throughout the observational period. Thus, RASi treatment is a critical determinant of recovery from renal injury induced by hypertensive emergencies. Furthermore, the early decrease in proteinuria observed with RASi (Figure 1B) may reflect the recovery process from renal injury rather than the glomerular hemodynamic action inherent in RASi (i.e. a reduction in glomerular pressure).

Finally, in patients with impaired renal function, RASi treatment is associated with an early increase in hematocrit (Figure 2B), possibly due to ameliorated renal injury or reduced activation.

### Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate before and after the first visit for atrial fibrillation [^1117i9Q8]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Kidney management should be initiated at the time of the first visit for atrial fibrillation (AF), even in patients with normal renal function. For proper management of direct oral anticoagulation, renal function should be reconfirmed within the first few months after the first visit for AF.

- **Limitations**: This study has the following limitations. First, because this study was a retrospective, single-center study, the frequency and the interval of available estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) data were different for each patient. Second, we could not investigate data on proteinuria, which is a known risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. Thirdly, we could not investigate the type, dosage, and duration of diuretic medication. In addition, changes in drug therapy including diuretics and ACE-Is/ARB may affect renal function, but this study does not present follow-up data on drug cessation or addition. Fourth, we could not analyze the effect of AF treatment on renal function. The implications of the improvement in eGFR slope are not clear in this study. Treatment of AF and its comorbidities, such as heart failure, may have had a positive impact on renal function. Finally, because it was difficult to determine the date of the first AF episode, the date of the first AF diagnosis was set as the baseline. Patients who had subclinical AF more than a few months before the first visit for AF due to mild subjective symptoms may have been included in this study.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: Cohort study [^111MKuJi]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are commonly prescribed drugs for hypertension, heart failure, diabetic microalbuminuria, proteinuric renal disease, and after myocardial infarction. Patients, however, may experience a sudden decline in kidney function after starting these drugs due to antagonism of angiotensin II mediated efferent arteriolar constriction. Despite unambiguous recommendations to detect sudden renal impairment by monitoring serum creatinine before and after starting ACEI/ARB treatment, and to discontinue treatment if creatinine concentrations increase by 30% or more, recent data show that only 10% of patients receive the recommended monitoring, and only 20% of those with a creatinine increase of 30% or more after starting ACEI/ARB treatment discontinue the drugs.

Clinical trial data indicate that ACEI/ARB induced renal impairment is uncommon. However, patients seen in routine clinical practice are, on average, older and have more comorbidities than those eligible for trials. As a consequence, the absolute risk of increases in creatinine of 30% or more in the community setting is not negligible. Although this level of creatinine increase after starting ACEI/ARB treatment raises concern about the long-term balance of risks and benefits, smaller increases (< 30%) do not prompt consideration of treatment discontinuation according to guidelines. The rationale for the 30% threshold in the context of adverse clinical outcomes is unclear, as little evidence is available on the actual risk.

### ACE inhibitors to prevent end-stage renal disease: When to start and why possibly never to stop: A post hoc analysis of the REIN trial results. Ramipril efficacy in nephropathy [^116anLuG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

In this post hoc, secondary analysis of the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) trial, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition risk/benefit profile was assessed in 322 patients with nondiabetic, proteinuric chronic nephropathies and different degrees of renal insufficiency. The rate of GFR decline (Delta GFR) and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during ramipril or non-ACE inhibitor treatment were compared within three tertiles of basal GFR. Delta GFR was comparable in the three tertiles, whereas the incidence of ESRD was higher in the lowest tertile than in the middle and highest tertiles.

Ramipril decreased Delta GFR by 22%, 22%, and 35%, and the incidence of ESRD by 33% (P < 0.05), 37%, and 100% (P < 0.01) in the lowest, middle, and highest tertiles, respectively. Delta GFR reduction was predicted by basal systolic (P < 0.0001), diastolic (P = 0.02), and mean (P < 0.001) BP and proteinuria (P < 0.0001), but not by basal GFR (P = 0.12). ESRD risk reduction was predicted by basal proteinuria (P < 0.01) and GFR (P < 0.0001) and was strongly dependent on treatment duration (P < 0.0001).

Adverse events were comparable among the three tertiles and within each tertile in the two treatment groups. Thus, disease progression and response to ACE inhibition do not depend on the severity of renal insufficiency. The risk of ESRD and the absolute number of events saved by ACE inhibition is highest in patients with the lowest GFR. However, renoprotection is maximized when ACE inhibition is started earlier and when long-lasting treatment may result in GFR stabilization.

### Initial estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and long-term renal function during intensive antihypertensive therapy: A post hoc analysis of the SPRINT and ACCORD-BP randomized controlled trials [^111negBd]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

We included all participants where the initial eGFR decline could be calculated and stratified patients according to their BP-target and initial eGFR decline (20% decline) following previous publications. Baseline characteristics for each stratum were depicted and compared using the appropriate tests (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, or χ²). Cardiovascular risk was estimated using the Framingham risk score. Increased albuminuria was defined according to guidelines as albuminuria stage A2 or A3, corresponding to an albuminuria to creatinine ratio larger than 30 mg/g. The use of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers was determined after the initial decline and during the last study visit from the trial medication log.

The relation between initial eGFR decline and decline in BP was determined using a generalized additive regression model. We used relative eGFR expressed as a percentage with respect to baseline to account for intraindividual differences in renal function. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was used as it reflects the steady component of renal perfusion pressure, which was determined as the weighted average of diastolic (0.6) and systolic (0.4) BP.

- **Relation between MAP decrease and relative eGFR change**: This was modeled using restricted cubic splines, with the order selected based on the Generalized Akaike Information Criterion. Next, we determined the regression line starting from the intercept of 0% eGFR decrease to determine the slope between relative eGFR and MAP.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in myocardial infarction patients with renal dysfunction [^114U9nux]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be used for secondary prevention in all or only high-risk patients after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

- **Objectives**: This study sought to investigate whether ACEI/ARB treatment after AMI is associated with better outcomes across different risk profiles, including the entire spectrum of estimated glomerular filtration rates.

- **Methods**: This study evaluated discharge and continuous follow-up data on ACEI/ARB use among AMI survivors (2006 to 2009) included in a large Swedish registry. The association between ACEI/ARB treatment and outcomes (mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and acute kidney injury [AKI]) was studied using Cox proportional hazards models (intention-to-treat and as treated).

- **Results**: In total, 45,697 patients (71%) were treated with ACEI/ARB. The 3-year mortality was 19.8% (17.4% of ACEI/ARB users and 25.4% of nonusers). In adjusted analysis, significantly better survival was observed for patients treated with ACEI/ARB (3-year hazard ratio: 0.80; 95% confidence interval: 0.77 to 0.83). The survival benefit was consistent through all kidney function strata, including dialysis patients. Overall, those treated with ACEI/ARB also had lower 3-year risk for myocardial infarction (hazard ratio: 0.91; 95% confidence interval: 0.87 to 0.95), whereas treatment had no significant effect on stroke risk. The crude risk for AKI was generally low (2.5% and 2.0% for treated and nontreated, respectively) and similar across estimated glomerular filtration rates.

### Aldactone [^116LxTm8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Aldactone: Critical warnings and precautions include monitoring for:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Aldactone can cause hyperkalemia, with an increased risk due to impaired renal function or the concurrent use of potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or drugs like ACE inhibitors and ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor serum potassium within one week of initiation or dose adjustment, and regularly thereafter. More frequent monitoring is advisable when Aldactone is used with other hyperkalemia-inducing drugs or in patients with impaired renal function. If hyperkalemia occurs, reduce the dose or discontinue Aldactone and treat hyperkalemia.

- **Hypotension and worsening renal function**: Excessive diuresis may lead to symptomatic dehydration, hypotension, and worsening renal function, especially in salt-depleted individuals or those using ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Renal function deterioration can also occur with the use of nephrotoxic drugs, such as aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and NSAIDs. Monitor volume status and renal function periodically.

- **Electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities**: Regularly assess serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose levels.

### Jadenu [^1114qiQr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Evaluate renal glomerular and tubular function before initiating therapy or increasing the dose. Use prediction equations validated for use in adult and pediatric patients to estimate GFR. Obtain serum electrolytes and urinalysis in all patients to evaluate renal tubular function [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].

Monitor all patients for changes in eGFR and for renal tubular toxicity weekly during the first month after initiation or modification of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. Dose reduction or interruption may be considered if abnormalities occur in levels of markers of renal tubular function and/or as clinically indicated. Monitor serum ferritin monthly to evaluate for overchelation. Use the minimum dose to establish and maintain a low iron burden.

Monitor renal function more frequently in patients with preexisting renal disease or decreased renal function. In pediatric patients, interrupt Jadenu during acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor renal function more frequently. Promptly correct fluid deficits to prevent renal injury. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

The prospective Translational Research Investigating Biomarker Endpoints for Acute Kidney Injury (TRIBE-AKI) study demonstrated that the graded increase in functional AKI (continued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker use was greater than held angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker use, which was greater than no use) was not accompanied by "structural" AKI. There were no differences in AKI risk between the three exposure groups, as assessed by four different urinary biomarkers for AKI. The results of a study can be dramatically altered based on how AKI is defined (serum creatinine changes vs. biomarkers), and this discrepancy may be especially pronounced in patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. This study demonstrates that a rise in serum creatinine is not always accompanied by tissue damage, and tissue damage does not always result in rising serum creatinine, i.e. subclinical AKI. This highlights one of the major limitations of serum creatinine as a biomarker.

- **Management of NSAIDs**: NSAIDs have been used effectively to mitigate postoperative pain while decreasing the opioid requirement. However, NSAIDs can adversely affect the renal system via prostaglandin-mediated afferent arteriolar dilation, causing reduced glomerular perfusion and leading to acute interstitial nephritis.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney disease [^113vfrPP]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chronic kidney disease, specifically in the context of managing hypertension, the KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend initiating RAAS inhibitors (ACEis or ARBs) in patients who have hypertension, CKD, and moderately to severely increased albuminuria (G1-G4, A2, and A3) with diabetes.

### An acute fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate during treatment with losartan predicts a slower decrease in long-term renal function [^113ipBKS]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Intervention in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is associated with slowing the progressive loss of renal function. During initiation of therapy, however, there may be an acute fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We tested whether this initial fall in GFR reflects a renal hemodynamic effect and whether this might result in a slower decline in long-term renal function. We performed a post hoc analysis of the Reduction of Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial. Patients assigned to losartan had a significantly greater acute fall in estimated GFR (eGFR) during the first 3 months compared to patients assigned to placebo, but a significantly slower long-term mean decline of eGFR thereafter.

A large interindividual difference, however, was noticed in the acute eGFR change. When patients were divided into tertiles of initial fall in eGFR, the long-term eGFR slope calculated from baseline was significantly higher in patients with an initial fall compared to those with an initial rise. When eGFR decline was calculated from 3 months to the final visit, excluding the initial effect, patients with a large initial fall in eGFR had a significantly lower long-term eGFR slope compared to those with a moderate fall or rise. This relationship was independent of other risk markers or changes in risk markers for progression of renal disease, such as blood pressure and albuminuria. Thus, the greater the acute fall in eGFR during losartan treatment, the slower the rate of long-term eGFR decline.

### Combined angiotensin inhibition for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy [^116c1Yt9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Combination therapy with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) decreases proteinuria; however, its safety and effect on the progression of kidney disease are uncertain.

- **Methods**: We provided losartan (at a dose of 100 mg per day) to patients with type 2 diabetes, a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 300, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30.0 to 89.9 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either lisinopril (at a dose of 10 to 40 mg per day) or placebo. The primary end point was the first occurrence of a change in the estimated GFR (a decline of ≥ 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m² if the initial estimated GFR was ≥ 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m², or a decline of ≥ 50% if the initial estimated GFR was < 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m²), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or death. The secondary renal end point was the first occurrence of a decline in the estimated GFR or ESRD. Safety outcomes included mortality, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury.

- **Results**: The study was stopped early owing to safety concerns. Among 1448 randomly assigned patients with a median follow-up of 2.2 years, there were 152 primary end-point events in the monotherapy group and 132 in the combination-therapy group (hazard ratio with combination therapy, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.12; P = 0.30). A trend toward a benefit from combination therapy with respect to the secondary end point was observed.

### Efficacy of ACE-inhibitor therapy on renal disease in glycogen storage disease type 1: a multicentre retrospective study [^114FLKpP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

The efficacy of ACE-inhibitors in decreasing microalbuminuria and proteinuria has been reported in a few patients with glycogen storage disease type 1 (GSD1); however, no case-control study has ever been published.

- **Aim**: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of ACE-inhibitors in reducing glomerular hyperfiltration, microalbuminuria, and proteinuria, and in delaying the progression of renal damage.

- **Patients and methods**: Ninety-five patients (median age at the time of the study: 14.5 years) were enrolled from nine Italian referral centers for metabolic diseases. A retrospective study of a 10-year follow-up was conducted to compare the evolution of these parameters in treated patients with those who were not treated with ACE-inhibitors.

- **Results**: A significant and progressive decrease of glomerular filtration rate was observed in treated patients vs. those who were not treated with ACE-inhibitors (P < 0.05). No difference was observed for microalbuminuria and proteinuria between the two groups of patients. Moreover, the ACE-inhibitors significantly delayed the progression from glomerular hyperfiltration to microalbuminuria, but not that from microalbuminuria to proteinuria.

- **Conclusions**: The results of the present study underline the importance of a strict follow-up of renal function in GSD1 patients. The detection of glomerular hyperfiltration suggests precocious initiation of ACE-inhibitor treatment to delay the progression of renal damage. A randomized prospective study is needed to establish the real effectiveness of this treatment.

### Comparative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on blood pressure and the kidney [^115FpGnT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Many clinicians are uncomfortable using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (AT(1)-blockers) to treat patients with renal disease due to concerns about increasing serum creatinine levels. However, the benefits of these medications, particularly their efficacy in slowing the progression of renal disease, outweigh such concerns. ACE inhibitors are effective in patients with type 1 diabetes and renal disease, as well as in those with nondiabetic renal disease and proteinuria > 0.5 g/d. AT(1)-blockers slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Although these classes of medications should not be used in patients with severe renal insufficiency (e.g. glomerular filtration rate < 20 mL/min), they may be beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency. Caution should be exercised in those with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min, and serum creatinine and potassium levels should be checked approximately one week after starting treatment. There is also evidence suggesting that these medications lead to greater reductions in blood pressure and proteinuria when used in combination than when alone.

The purpose of this paper is to review the mechanisms of action of these two classes of medication, as well as the experimental and clinical evidence that they slow the progression of renal disease.

### Impact of early initiation of renin-angiotensin blockade on renal function and clinical outcomes in patients with hypertensive emergency: a retrospective cohort study [^1176HUdN]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Hypertensive emergency is an acute progressive disorder caused by severe hypertension and requires prompt recognition and timely intervention, which could prevent the occurrence of catastrophic events, including cerebral hemorrhage, heart failure, and acute kidney impairment. This disorder is arbitrarily defined in many guidelines as acutely elevated blood pressure (BP), mostly more than 180/120 mmHg, with barotrauma on major vital organs.

Alternatively, malignant hypertension is characterized by acute severe hypertension with advanced retinopathy and has long been recognized as a subset of hypertensive emergency or crisis, raising the possibility of reappraisal of malignant hypertension. Indeed, a growing number of studies have attempted to characterize the pathophysiology of hypertensive emergencies and have reported that hospital admissions for this disease have increased over the past 20 years. Nevertheless, there have been a small number of investigations evaluating the long-term effects of this acute event on target organs, particularly the kidney, which may progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring renal replacement therapy.

Great progress has been made regarding the development of antihypertensive drugs, with various drugs possessing different mechanisms available for clinical use, either solely or in combination with other types of antihypertensive agents. In malignant hypertension, long-term control of BP is reported to offer favorable renal outcomes. Because the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone (RAA) system is activated in such conditions, therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway are crucial.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: Cohort study [^114UVwm5]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

We found that patients in routine clinical care who started treatment with ACEI/ARB and whose creatinine concentration had increased by 30% or more at their first follow-up monitoring visit were at increased risk for adverse cardiac outcomes and death compared with patients with more stable creatinine values. Our study thus confirms data from clinical trials in a real-world clinical setting. Moreover, we established that risks were also substantially increased for end-stage renal disease. In general, risks were highest in the first year after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment but were sustained up to 10 years later for end-stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, and death. Importantly, we showed a "dose-response" relation between the level of increase in creatinine values and the risk of adverse outcomes, indicating that all increases below 30% cannot be viewed as safe.

Our results were consistent across calendar periods and patient subgroups in a range of sensitivity analyses. It is not clear whether increases in creatinine values after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment are due to pathophysiological processes representing a biomarker of increased risk or whether a direct causal relation exists between reduced renal function and adverse outcomes. These results therefore identify a group of patients at high risk but do not necessarily support discontinuation of ACEI/ARBs.

Regarding inpatient care for acute kidney injury, particularly in terms of renal function monitoring, the UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend close monitoring for AKI in outpatients deemed at high risk if there has been a new exposure to potential risk factors. Serum creatinine levels should be measured regularly until at least 48 hours after the period of increased risk has passed.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113xBsQ8]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for diabetic nephropathy, specifically in the context of primary prevention with RAAS blockers, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend against the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for the primary prevention of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with diabetes who have normal blood pressure (BP), a normal urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (< 30 mg/g creatinine), and a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

### Change of renal function after short-term use of cardioprotective agents in patients with type 2 diabetes is not accurately assessed by the change of estimated glomerular filtration rate: an observational study [^1166U5uR]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

We focused exclusively on patients with T2D in the early stage of their disease, prior to macroalbuminuria or CKD stage 3 or higher, as it is important for clinicians and family doctors to detect early and reliably a change in renal function in daily clinical practice. Hence, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the routinely used estimating equation CKD-EPI to detect short-term changes of renal function after pharmacological intervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin-receptor blocker, gliptin, or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor.

### Stopping renin-angiotensin system blockers after acute kidney injury and risk of adverse outcomes: parallel population-based cohort studies in English and Swedish routine care [^1179HHvk]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Lack of information about measures of creatinine in the hospital meant that we could not grade the severity of AKI according to the KDIGO criteria; however, a sensitivity analysis excluding people who required dialysis during their baseline admission did not alter our results. We were also unable to ascertain whether the cause of AKI or misclassification of participants who actually had progressive chronic kidney disease influenced our results. We chose a priori not to adjust for creatinine or potassium levels after discharge in our analysis, as we thought this would be differentially missing for the sickest people who were readmitted before they could have outpatient blood tests, and blood test results may be on the causal pathway of the decision to restart ACEI/ARB. However, where available to clinicians, levels of kidney function and potassium are likely to influence practice in routine care.

In defining ACEI/ARB exposure, we did not have data for in-hospital treatment or discharge prescribing. We chose our 30-day post-discharge period to define exposure using primary care prescriptions partly because participants in England would have been likely to receive medication 'to take away' from the hospital. Therefore, people classified as 'continuers' in our analysis could experience a range of treatment patterns, such as continuing ACEI/ARB without a break and stopping the drugs for a period but receiving a prescription within 30 days post-AKI discharge. It is also possible that people did not take the medication as prescribed or that they were given specific instructions about whether.

### Kidney function and potassium monitoring after initiation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade therapy and outcomes in 2 North American populations [^114xzkea]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend routine kidney function and serum potassium testing within 30 days of initiating ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy. However, evidence is lacking about whether follow-up testing reduces therapy-related adverse outcomes.

- **Methods and results**: We conducted two population-based retrospective cohort studies in Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Ontario, Canada. Patients with outpatient serum creatinine and potassium tests in the 30 days after starting ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy were matched 1:1 to patients without follow-up tests. We evaluated the association of follow-up testing with 30-day all-cause mortality and hospitalization with acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia using Cox regression. We also developed and externally validated a risk score to identify patients at risk of having abnormally high serum creatinine and potassium values in follow-up.

We identified 75,251 matched pairs initiating ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2017, in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Follow-up testing was not significantly associated with 30-day all-cause mortality in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.54–1.06]) and was associated with higher mortality in 84,905 matched pairs in Ontario (hazard ratio, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.07–1.62]). In Kaiser Permanente Northern California, follow-up testing was significantly associated with higher rates of hospitalization.

### Effect of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and other antihypertensive drugs on renal outcomes: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113diAfM]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

A consensus has emerged that angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) have specific renoprotective effects. Guidelines specify that these are the drugs of choice for the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal disease. We sought to determine to what extent this consensus is supported by the available evidence.

- **Methods**: Electronic databases were searched up to January 2005 for randomized trials assessing antihypertensive drugs and progression of renal disease. Effects on primary discrete endpoints (doubling of creatinine and end-stage renal disease) and secondary continuous markers of renal outcomes (creatinine, albuminuria, and glomerular filtration rate) were calculated with random-effect models. The effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in placebo-controlled trials were compared with the effects seen in trials that used an active comparator drug.

- **Findings**: Comparisons of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with other antihypertensive drugs yielded a relative risk of 0.71 (95% CI 0.49–1.04) for doubling of creatinine and a small benefit on end-stage renal disease (relative risk 0.87, 0.75–0.99). Analyses of the results by study size showed a smaller benefit in large studies. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, no benefit was seen in comparative trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on the doubling of creatinine (1.09, 0.55–2.15), end-stage renal disease (0.89, 0.74–1.07), glomerular filtration rate, or creatinine amounts. Placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs showed greater benefits than comparative trials.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: Conclusions from a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^112gvZAp]. Kidney International (2020). Low credibility.

It remains unclear how to best determine baseline kidney function. What constitutes a baseline serum creatinine level is controversial and inconsistently defined. It would be ideal to have prior serum creatinine or GFR measurements widely available through electronic medical records, but this is not common practice in many parts of the world. Prior serum creatinine or GFR measures may also further elucidate the risk of AKI in patients considered at high risk due to either comorbidity or an intervention. There is controversy about whether an acute decrease in serum creatinine level indicates AKI that has already occurred, and more research is needed in this area. For example, small declines in serum creatinine level need to be interpreted with caution because they may result from acute changes in creatinine production or volume of distribution.

After a timed insult (e.g. coronary angiography, elective surgery, nephrotoxic drug exposure), serum creatinine level should be measured at an appropriate time to allow for AKI to manifest. After AKI onset, serum creatinine level should be measured during follow-up as necessary for clinical management and care transitions (e.g. transfer to and from intensive care) and for determining changes in AKI staging and classification (AKI vs. AKD), including onset of CKD at 90 days.

How urine output should be evaluated is also an area that needs further investigation to avoid variability in reporting AKI incidence (e.g. use of actual or ideal body weight, strict time period vs. time-averaged values). Future guidelines should address these issues comprehensively.

### Potential indications for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in atherosclerotic vascular disease [^1155YMq8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are well established as first-line therapy for patients with left ventricular dysfunction, diabetic patients with hypertension or renal disease, and patients recovering from myocardial infarction. Angiotensin II and bradykinin regulate cellular proliferation, inflammation, and endothelial function, thus playing an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. A large body of experimental evidence reporting that ACE inhibitors limit these effects has formed the rationale for major clinical trials of these drugs in the management of atherosclerotic vascular disease. The first trial to be completed demonstrated that ACE inhibition improves the prognosis of patients who have, or are at risk of, atherosclerotic vascular disease, independent of its effects on left ventricular function and hypertension. Expanding the indications for ACE inhibitors is now evidence driven, although the choice of agent for these new indications remains to be determined by further research.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: National guidance [^111chWTX]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Changes in kidney function during acute interillness are common, regardless of whether patients are treated with RAAS inhibitors. The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is reported to be between 7% and 18% among hospitalized patients. AKI is a significant risk marker for poor outcomes and is strongly associated with an increased risk of subsequent admission for heart failure. Renal function often does not return to baseline levels in survivors of AKI, especially in those with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The incidence of AKI, as defined by hospital coding, is rising rapidly. This may reflect a genuine increase or simply greater awareness. Conditions associated with the development of AKI, such as diabetes and CKD, are common indications for RAAS inhibitors; hence, the occurrence of AKI in association with RAAS blockade is a common clinical scenario. However, it is not clear that ACEI/ARB therapy alone is associated with a substantially increased risk of AKI.

When AKI is associated with overt hypovolemia, hypotension, or sepsis, it is critical that prompt correction of these abnormalities will improve outcomes. However, the reflex inclusion of patients with HFrEF in treatment algorithms for AKI is dangerous. The administration of crystalloids to patients who are already fluid overloaded defies common sense. There is no solid evidence that the temporary cessation of RAAS therapy given for HFrEF during hospitalization or perioperative periods reduces the rates of AKI. Among patients hospitalized with AKI, treatment with ACEI or ARB is associated with a lower risk of death.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: Cohort study [^1135A6Tu]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Among 303,451 patients who started ACEI/ARB treatment during 1997–2014, 122,363 (40%) had both baseline and follow-up creatinine monitoring and were included in the study. Among these, 2,078 (1.7%) had an increase in creatinine of 30% or more (median age 68 years), and 120,285 (98.3%) had an increase of less than 30% (median age 63 years). More detailed categorisation showed that the creatinine increase was less than 10% for 102,445 (83.7%) patients, 10–19% for 14,301 (11.7%) patients, 20–29% for 3,539 (2.9%) patients, 30–39% for 1,099 (0.9%) patients, and 40% or more for 979 (0.8%) patients.

- **Patients' characteristics**:

	- The study categorized patients according to the guideline-recommended discontinuation level of creatinine increases (≥ 30%) after renin-angiotensin system blockade. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise. The abbreviations used are as follows: ACEI (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker), eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), IQR (interquartile range), and NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug).

	- **Diagnosis**: Ever registered in Clinical Practice Research Datalink or Hospital Episode Statistics before the start of treatment with ACEI or ARB.

	- **Calculation**: From the most recent creatinine measurement within 12 months before the first prescription date; eGFR given in mL/min/1.73 m².

	- **Blood pressure measurements**: 16,365 (13%) patients had no pre-initiation blood pressure measurement within 12 months before starting ACEI/ARB treatment (18% among those with ≥ 30% increase in creatinine and 13% among those with < 30% increase). Additionally, 17,190 (14%) patients had no post-initiation blood pressure measurement.
