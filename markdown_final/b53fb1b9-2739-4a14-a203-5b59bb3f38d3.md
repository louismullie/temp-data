## Question

What kidney labs do I order for diabetic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what kidney labs should be ordered for patients with diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about who needs screening and when to start based on diabetes type and duration. Then, I should verify which core tests are required and why both UACR and eGFR are necessary. Next, I will confirm test ordering specifics and how to handle positive results, including the need for repeat testing and timing. After that, I need to set monitoring frequency by CKD stage and risk. I will then consider advanced testing for complicated cases and when to refer. Finally, I should double-check glycemic monitoring adjustments in CKD, common pitfalls in practice, and summarize the practical, order-ready recommendations.

> Let me first confirm who needs screening and when to start, because timing differs by diabetes type and duration. For type 1 diabetes, I should start annual screening 5 years after diagnosis or after puberty if onset was in childhood, since early disease may not yet show albuminuria and delayed screening risks missed progression, whereas for type 2 diabetes I should begin at diagnosis given the uncertain duration of disease and the high prevalence of CKD at presentation, and continue annually thereafter [^114G8dUy] [^1134fs75] [^111RFXh2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single test being sufficient. I need to check the two core markers that must be ordered together. The spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) detects kidney damage and can be abnormal before eGFR declines, while the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from serum creatinine assesses kidney function; using both together aligns with KDIGO risk stratification and ADA guidance, and I should ensure the lab reports eGFR using the CKD-EPI equation refit without race, or consider cystatin C when creatinine-based eGFR may be unreliable [^113rzxmp] [^114G8dUy] [^116M6TyD].

> Wait, let me verify the test-ordering specifics so I don't miss practical details. UACR should be measured on a spot urine sample, ideally first-morning to reduce variability, and I should avoid testing during acute illness, after strenuous exercise, with uncontrolled hypertension, during menstruation, or with a urinary tract infection, because these can transiently elevate albumin; if the initial UACR is abnormal, I need to repeat two additional first-morning specimens over 3–6 months and classify albuminuria only if at least two of three are abnormal, given intraindividual variability of about 20–40% [^113rzxmp] [^112bBHEU] [^114idCUp].

> I should confirm how to interpret and act on results, and I need to ensure I'm using current thresholds. Moderately increased albuminuria (A2, formerly microalbuminuria) is UACR 30–300 mg/g, and severely increased albuminuria (A3, formerly macroalbuminuria) is UACR ≥ 300 mg/g; CKD is also staged by eGFR, with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² indicating reduced function, and both UACR and eGFR categories feed into KDIGO risk grids to guide intensity of monitoring and therapy, including ACE inhibitors or ARBs when albuminuria is present, with close follow-up of creatinine and potassium after initiation or dose changes [^113rzxmp] [^117GKq7f] [^1125hA23].

> Next, I should review monitoring frequency by CKD stage and risk, and I need to double-check that I'm aligning with ADA and KDIGO cadences. For patients with diabetes and established CKD, UACR and eGFR should be monitored 1–4 times per year depending on stage and progression risk; more concretely, many guidelines suggest every 6–12 months for stage G3, every 3–5 months for stage G4, and every 1–3 months for stage G5, with earlier and more frequent checks if albuminuria is rising or eGFR is falling, and at least annual testing for all with diabetes even without known CKD [^114G8dUy] [^115nF8Gf] [^112mg1fG].

> But wait, what if the clinical picture is atypical or the course is rapidly progressive? I should consider additional testing and when to refer. If there is active urinary sediment, absence of diabetic retinopathy, rapidly declining eGFR, or nephrotic-range proteinuria, I need to evaluate for non-diabetic kidney disease and consider autoimmune serologies, imaging, or referral; cystatin C can improve eGFR accuracy when creatinine is unreliable, and risk tools like the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) help prognostication in stages G3–5, with nephrology referral indicated for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², persistent albuminuria > 300 mg/g with progression, or continuously declining eGFR despite optimized care [^113mHrmt] [^114MUoHU] [^112BWhd3] [^111J9zqs].

> I will now examine glycemic monitoring in the context of CKD, because I need to ensure I'm not over-relying on HbA1c when kidney function declines. HbA1c remains first-line for glycemic monitoring, typically twice yearly in stable patients and up to four times yearly if therapy changes or targets are unmet, but its accuracy wanes as eGFR falls; CGM or SMBG can complement or substitute when HbA1c is discordant or hypoglycemia risk is high, and I should prefer agents with lower hypoglycemia risk and dose-adjust for eGFR when CKD is present [^111Aobuo] [^116HpCEq] [^1132eqXM].

> Hold on, I should verify common pitfalls that undermine quality and how to fix them. Real-world data show UACR testing is markedly underutilized compared with eGFR, often due to workflow issues, lack of patient awareness, or reliance on insensitive dipsticks. Embedding prompts, educating patients to bring first-morning samples, and standardizing lab reporting of UACR and eGFR can improve adherence and reduce missed CKD, and I should avoid ordering albumin without creatinine because it prevents accurate UACR interpretation [^1112J16c] [^114gsuJF] [^112dbVfc].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the practical, order-ready recommendations to ensure nothing is missing. For all patients with diabetes, order spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and serum creatinine with automatic eGFR reporting at least annually, starting at diagnosis for type 2 and after 5 years for type 1; if UACR is abnormal, repeat two additional first-morning specimens over 3–6 months before confirming albuminuria; if CKD is diagnosed, increase monitoring frequency to 1–4 times per year based on stage and risk, add potassium and creatinine checks when initiating or adjusting ACEi/ARB/MRA, and consider cystatin C, KFRE, or nephrology referral for advanced disease or diagnostic uncertainty; throughout, align glycemic monitoring with CKD stage and agent selection to mitigate hypoglycemia and improve accuracy [^114G8dUy] [^113rzxmp] [^112BWhd3] [^1125hA23].

---

For a patient with diabetes, order **annual kidney labs** [^111RFXh2] to screen for diabetic kidney disease: **spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)** [^1134fs75] and **serum creatinine with eGFR** [^113rzxmp]. If UACR is ≥ 30 mg/g or eGFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², **repeat testing in 3–6 months** [^112bBHEU] to confirm persistence, then increase monitoring frequency to every 3–6 months based on CKD stage and risk [^112mg1fG]. Also check **serum potassium** when ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or MRAs are used or when eGFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1125hA23] [^116ynZWg]. Consider **cystatin C** [^113rzxmp] or a **combined creatinine–cystatin C eGFR** [^114MUoHU] if creatinine-based eGFR is unreliable. Routine electrolytes, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, calcium, phosphate, and PTH are added as CKD advances or complications arise [^115nF8Gf].

---

## Core kidney labs for diabetic patients

### Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)

- **Purpose**: Detects early kidney damage (microalbuminuria) before eGFR declines [^116HyCSo].
- **Frequency**: Annually in all patients with diabetes; more often if abnormal or CKD progresses [^116ynZWg] [^111wk3BT].
- **Interpretation**: < 30 mg/g = normal; 30–300 mg/g = moderately increased; > 300 mg/g = severely increased [^113rzxmp].

---

### Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

Serum creatinine with **eGFR** [^113rzxmp] assesses kidney function and stages CKD. Obtain at least annually; increase frequency as eGFR declines or CKD advances [^115nF8Gf]. CKD is staged by eGFR: G1 ≥ 90, G2 60–89, G3a 45–59, G3b 30–44, G4 15–29, and G5 < 15 mL/min/1.73 m².

---

## Additional kidney labs based on clinical context

### Serum potassium

Check **serum potassium** to monitor for hyperkalemia, especially with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or MRAs, or when eGFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1125hA23] [^116ynZWg]. Monitor periodically in patients on RAAS blockade or with reduced eGFR.

---

### Serum bicarbonate

Use **serum bicarbonate** to assess metabolic acidosis in advanced CKD. Check when eGFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or if clinically indicated [^notfound].

---

### Hemoglobin

Use **hemoglobin** to screen for anemia in CKD. Check when eGFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or if clinically indicated [^115nF8Gf].

---

### Calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH)

Use **calcium, phosphate, and PTH** to assess CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Check when eGFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or if clinically indicated [^115nF8Gf].

---

## Frequency of kidney lab monitoring

| **Kidney lab** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| UACR | Annually; every 3–6 months if abnormal or CKD progresses [^114G8dUy] [^111wk3BT] |
| Serum creatinine/eGFR | Annually; every 3–6 months if eGFR < 60 or CKD progresses [^112mg1fG] |
| Serum potassium | Periodically if on ACEi/ARB/MRA or eGFR < 60 [^1125hA23] [^116ynZWg] |
| Serum bicarbonate | Every 6–12 months if eGFR < 60 [^115nF8Gf] |
| Hemoglobin | Annually if eGFR < 60 [^115nF8Gf] |
| Calcium, phosphate, PTH | Annually if eGFR < 60 [^115nF8Gf] |

---

## Special considerations

### Cystatin C

Use **cystatin C** when creatinine-based eGFR is unreliable (e.g. altered body composition, low muscle mass) [^116M6TyD]. Consider combined creatinine–cystatin C eGFR for improved accuracy [^113rzxmp].

---

### Alternative markers

Use **alternative markers** such as β2-microglobulin or retinol-binding protein when traditional markers are inconclusive or unavailable.

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal kidney labs

- **Microalbuminuria (UACR 30–300 mg/g)**: Indicates early kidney damage; increased risk of progression and cardiovascular events [^113rzxmp] [^114ZsWZj].
- **Macroalbuminuria (UACR > 300 mg/g)**: Indicates advanced kidney damage; high risk of progression to ESRD [^113rzxmp] [^114kvirP].
- **eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²**: Indicates CKD; requires closer monitoring and management [^113rzxmp] [^115nF8Gf].
- **Hyperkalemia**: Risk with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, MRAs; may require dose adjustment or alternative therapies [^1125hA23] [^116ynZWg].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Annual screening**: UACR and serum creatinine/eGFR for all diabetic patients [^117GKq7f] [^1134fs75].
- **Increased frequency**: Every 3–6 months if UACR ≥ 30 mg/g or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^112mg1fG] [^1177CBvm].
- **Additional labs**: Potassium, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, calcium, phosphate, PTH as CKD advances [^115nF8Gf].
- **Special considerations**: Use cystatin C or alternative markers when indicated [^113rzxmp] [^114MUoHU].

---

Regular monitoring of **UACR and eGFR** [^114G8dUy] is essential for early detection and management of diabetic kidney disease, with additional labs tailored to CKD stage and clinical context [^115nF8Gf].

### Pillar risk-based treatment for chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^116HyCSo]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

There are two main markers of kidney disease that should be monitored at least annually in people at risk of, or diagnosed with, CKD: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatine ratio (UACR). eGFR is calculated from serum creatinine concentration, measured in the laboratory using an enzymatic method in a venous blood sample. UACR is measured in a spot urine sample, preferably collected from the first morning void. UACR (i.e. urine albumin [mg]/urine creatinine [g]) is calculated from laboratory-measured urine albumin and creatinine concentrations (preferred) or can be estimated directly using dipstick-based measurement with automated reading.

Once an abnormal eGFR or UACR is identified, repeat testing is recommended 3 months later by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), an international clinical practice guidelines working group. eGFR is a marker of kidney function, whereas UACR is a marker of kidney damage, and testing these together allows one to characterize and prognosticate CKD and its risk for progression, as well as cardiovascular events and death, as illustrated in the KDIGO heatmap (Fig. 1). In CKD, UACR may be elevated before eGFR declines to levels associated with impaired kidney function, and should be recognized as a measure that is as important as blood pressure or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to trigger treatments for reducing cardiovascular and kidney risks. Despite recommendations, UACR testing is widely underutilized in clinical practice, especially compared with eGFR testing. The lack of UACR testing was also noted by The Center for Kidney Disease Research, Education, and Hope Registry, which showed that of over 2.6 million people with T2D at risk of CKD, only 8.7% of adults were tested for UACR (n / N = 52,511/606,064), likely resulting in a significant underestimation of diagnosed CKD cases and complete lack of prognostication.

2. Rationale

Early detection of albuminuria allows early intervention with the goal of reducing cardiovascular risk and delaying the onset of overt diabetic nephropathy. Thus, it is an indicator of the need for more intensive efforts to reduce cardiovascular risk factors.

Albuminuria (stage A2) rarely occurs with a short duration of type 1 diabetes or before puberty. Thus, testing is less urgent in these situations. Nevertheless, the difficulty in precisely dating the onset of type 2 diabetes warrants initiation of annual testing at the time of diagnosis of diabetes. Although older patients (age > 75 years or a life expectancy < 20 years) may not be at risk for clinically significant nephropathy because of a short projected life span, they will be at higher cardiovascular risk. In such patients, the role of treating albuminuria is far from clear. Published studies have demonstrated that it is cost-effective to screen all patients with diabetes and/or kidney disease for albuminuria.

Globally, diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it is predicted to increase in the following years. Despite its high prevalence, CKD remains under diagnosed. In this BMC Medicine collection of articles on diabetic kidney disease (DKD), we place in context the importance of screening and early detection of DKD and the most accurate tools to monitor for optimal glycemic control in this his risk population. Further, we address this population's risk for severe complications such as stroke and all-cause mortality. We close this editorial by summarizing recent advances in management of this vulnerable population of patients with DKD, including guideline-directed medical therapy, novel treatments, and predictors of treatment failure.

Implementation and challenges of HbA1c monitoring in CKD — Implementing the KDIGO guideline recommendation to use HbA1c to monitor glycemic control is straightforward because the test is widely available, but the declining performance of the HbA1c as kidney function worsens implies that one may need more frequent assessments, particularly in those individuals with rapidly declining kidney function. This appears particularly problematic in patients who have an apparent "acceptable" range of HbA1c between 6.5% and 8%. Neither glycated albumin nor fructosamine has been sufficiently validated to support their use over HbA1c in CKD, though SMBG and CGM may offer distinct advantages in this population.

CKD CDSS

Manns et al. studied 93 primary care practices in Canada treating 22,092 patients with diabetes or proteinuria. Practices were randomized to receive either an enhanced eGFR prompt containing suggestions about ACEi or ARB use, blood pressure control, lipid control, and A1c target, or a standard eGFR prompt. Although the primary outcome, which concerned use of ACEi/ARB, was limited to the 5444 patients over age 65 for whom data were available, the results that concern laboratory testing were based upon all patients. They found the prompt improved the rate of urine albumin measurements, but not that of LDL-C or HbA1c measurements. The enhanced prompt did not alter the achievement of laboratory test targets.

In another study, real-time automated alerts recommending nephrology referral and urine albumin measurements failed to significantly improve either endpoint. Studies of CDSS aimed at reducing adverse drug events or renal function impairment in CKD patients have shown benefits only in reducing medication errors.

All in all, the record of CDSS usage for CKD has not been such as to promote its widespread adoption. By contrast, our CDSS might have practical value. It is scalable, and imposes no extra effort on physicians or their support staff. Our CDSS is specific to an individual patient and cognizant of changes over time. At the very least, it appears to improve the timeliness of lab test ordering. It may, in some cases, lead to better achievement of laboratory targets.

Glycemic monitoring in diabetes and CKD — We recommend hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) for monitoring glycemic control in patients with diabetes and CKD (1C) and, due to its low cost and availability, it is the preferred method for glycemic monitoring in CKD. It is reasonable to measure HbA1c twice a year in stable patients with diabetes and up to 4 times a year if the individualized glycemic target has not been met and/or therapy is adjusted (practice point 2.1.1), but accuracy and precision of HbA1c will decline with worsening kidney function (practice point 2.1.2). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) provide measures that are not known to be affected by CKD and its treatment; however, a weakness of SMBG is that it may not detect the wide and often unpredictable glucose excursions common in patients with diabetes and CKD, the inconvenience and costs of these approaches are substantially higher than the other glycemic monitoring methods, and currently, there are no RCTs to recommend alternative measures of glycemic control over HbA1c in these patients.

### Making an impact on kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: the importance of screening for albuminuria [^1173LXqC]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Albuminuria as a target for intervention

Microalbuminuria (UACR < 300 mg/g) has been reported in association with impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, with a prevalence of 15.5% in people with pre-diabetes. Correlation between the presence of microalbuminuria in people with pre-diabetic conditions and progression towards T2D suggests that screening of albuminuria in the general population may be beneficial for the early prevention of kidney damage.

Reducing albuminuria may slow progression of CKD and should, therefore, be considered as a separate target for kidney-protective therapy. A meta-analysis of data from 41 clinical trials that included participants with diabetes (71%), glomerular disease (4.4%) and other CKD (25.2%) demonstrated that decreasing albuminuria is associated with a reduced risk for developing the clinical endpoint (a composite of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine concentration, or eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²), predictive of CKD progression. This is in addition to monitoring cardiovascular risks using well-established surrogate endpoints, such as glycated hemoglobin for glucose lowering, blood pressure for control of hypertension, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol for efficacy of lipid lowering.

Optimum patient management requires regular screening of people with T2D to ensure early identification of CKD, followed by targeted intervention to reduce albuminuria (ie, with the use of SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs) and stabilize eGFR, along with continued regular monitoring. A proposed algorithm for the optimum management of CKD in T2D using albuminuria as a target is presented in figure 3. However, barriers to albuminuria testing exist, including confusion caused by the similarity of test names and results. For example, the typical range of results for UACR and urine albumin (UALB) is similar, but the UACR test measures albumin content relative to creatine (in units of mg/g) while the UALB test measures total albumin in urine (in units of mg/dL). Other barriers include a lack of understanding of testing guidelines and which tests to order; infrequent physician visits by patients or avoidance of treatment; and methodologic issues, such as urine collection instructions, requirement for specific urine cups, or an inadequate patient recall system when patients fail to provide a urine sample. The guideline-preferred method of screening is annual testing of albuminuria using the accurate and cost-effective UACR test (table 1).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, patients at risk, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor urinary albumin (such as spot urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio) and eGFR 1–4 times per year in patients with established diabetic kidney disease, depending on the stage of the disease.

### Guidelines adherence in the prevention and management of chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus on the background of recent European recommendations-a registry-based analysis [^112dbVfc]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are a number of potential reasons for this low screening rate. First, it may be the result of partial guideline inconsistencies. For example, the 2020 ADA guidelines recommend only to screen for CKD in type 1 diabetes if diabetes duration is ≥ 5 years. This criterion is not met for at least some of the patients in the current dataset with a median diabetes duration of 11.9 years and an interquartile range of 2.7 to 25.0 years. Secondly, as multiple determinations of urinary albumin (at least two tests out of three need to be positive to arrive at a diagnosis of microalbuminuria) are necessary, the efforts for screening may be perceived to be high. Conversely, albuminuria tests are sometimes regarded as unreliable, especially if only performed once. Thirdly, not every physician's office is able to collect urinary samples, which may appear unhygienic and, thus, not desirable. As a potential limitation, we did not explore whether a twice-annual monitoring of kidney function is actually performed in patients with advanced disease (urinary albumin > 30 mg/g creatinine and/or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Some patients counted as screened in our analysis, would not be classified based on a requirement for two annual investigations as suggested by the ADA.

Finally, only about half of all patients in our database were screened based on both urinary albumin and creatinine. As opposed to the majority of guidelines, a determination of urinary albumin without normalization to creatinine appears to be frequent in clinical practice. This is of concern as a simple urinary dipstick test has a lower sensitivity and higher false-discovery rate compared to UACR-based screening. It has been previously described that there is no standardised method of collection and measurement of urinary albumin and creatinine and there are concerns about test reliability, intra-individual variability based on body position, activity and temperature.

Table 7
Review of assays to assess albuminuria

Table 8
Definitions of albuminuria a

The JNC 7, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), and the ADA all recommend the use of morning spot albumin/creatinine measurement for annual quantitative testing for urine albumin in adults with diabetes. Individuals should be fasting. The optimal time for spot urine collection is the early morning, but for minimizing variation, all collections should be at the same time of day; the individual preferably should not have ingested food for at least 2 h.

Positive test results represent "albuminuria" in these guidelines, corresponding to protein excretion of > 300 mg/24 h, > 200 μg/min, or > 300 mg/g creatinine (Table 8). In these patients, quantitative measurement of urine albumin excretion is used in assessing the severity of albuminuria and its progression, in planning treatment, and in determining the impact of therapy. To properly assess the stage of kidney disease, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be calculated from the serum creatinine value, age, sex, and race of the patient. An eGFR of < 60 mL/min, regardless of the presence of low levels of albuminuria, is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. A urine albumin value of < 30 mg/g creatinine, although considered "normal", should be reassessed annually, because values as low as 10 mg/g creatinine have been associated in some studies with an increased cardiovascular risk. If the value is ≥ 30 mg/g creatinine, changes should be reassessed after 6 to 12 months if antihypertensve therapy is required or annually in those who are normotensive. For children with type 1 diabetes, testing for low levels of albuminuria is recommended to begin after puberty and after a diabetes duration of 5 years. Of note is that most longitudinal cohort studies have reported significant increases in the prevalence of low levels of albuminuria only after diabetes has been present for 5 years.

In the algorithms of both the NKF and the ADA for urine protein testing, the diagnosis of low levels of albuminuria requires both the demonstration of increased albumin excretion (as defined above) on two of three tests repeated at intervals of 3 to 6 months and the exclusion of conditions that "invalidate" the test (Fig. 1).

### Screening, identifying, and treating chronic kidney disease: why, who, when, how, and what? [^116mQVbG]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes

Diabetes is the most common cause of CKD, incident and prevalent end-staged kidney disease (ESKD). Moreover, the prevalence of type-2 diabetes in the adult population continues to rise, driven by population aging and the obesity epidemic. As previously noted, up to 40% of patients with diabetes have detectable CKD by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio (uACR). Three- and five-year incidence of new moderately elevated albuminuria (CKD A2 historically termed microalbuminuria (see Fig. 1))in those with previously normal urine studies have been predicted to be 12.8% and 23.9%, respectively. Given our abilities to reduce the rate of progression of diabetic kidney disease, recommendations for yearly CKD screening for diabetic patients have been in place for almost 20 years. Studies looking at the impact of yearly screening overwhelmingly show cost-effectiveness, in addition to decreasing ESKD incidence by up to 40%. Despite consensus among clinical practice guideline recommendations for yearly screening, less than 40% of diabetic patients receive necessary screening tests. Along with guidelines, we strongly recommend yearly CKD screening for patients with diabetes. Screening for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) should occur at time of diagnosis while type 1 diabetes (T1DM) should start five years after diagnosis; this difference is due to the rapid onset of presentation in T1DM and frequently delayed diagnosis of T2DM.

### Assessing glycemic control in diabetic patients with severe nephropathy [^115aqpyk]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure in westernized societies, including the United States. In addition to renal manifestations, complications of poorly controlled diabetes include accelerated atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, neuropathy, and retinopathy. The estimated total cost of diabetes care in the United States was $174 billion in 2007-a number expected to increase markedly in the coming decades. Clinicians must be able to accurately recognize patients with poor glycemic control to have opportunities to intensify treatment and potentially reduce hyperglycemia-related complications. Detecting hyperglycemia is uniquely difficult in patients with severe kidney disease. This paper reviews the literature on the accuracy of glucose monitoring assays in diabetic patients with advanced nephropathy. Interpretation of commonly used tests is affected to a great extent by the uremic milieu and frequently complicates disease management.

KDOQI diabetes and chronic kidney disease — glucose monitoring strategy follows ADA standards: Data for monitoring glycemic control in people with diabetes and CKD essentially are absent; therefore, assessment of glycemic control should follow the general standards recommended by the ADA, with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) recommended 3 or more times daily in people receiving multiple insulin injections and, for those treated by oral agents or medical nutrition therapy, SMBG is useful in achieving glycemic goals; postprandial SMBG testing also may be helpful, particularly in patients with gastroparesis. The optimal frequency of SMBG has not been established in patients with type 2 diabetes treated by oral agents, but the ADA recommends testing sufficiently often to reach glycemic goals, and HbA1c level should be determined at least twice per year in stable patients and more often, approximately every 3 months, in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not reaching goals.

Guideline 1: Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD, with initial screening commencing 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; screening should include measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot urine sample and measurement of serum creatinine with estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the absence of urinary tract infection, an elevated ACR should be confirmed with 2 additional first-void specimens collected over the next 3 to 6 months, and to confirm classification 2 of 3 samples should fall within the microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric range. Microalbuminuria is defined as an ACR between 30–300 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria is defined as an ACR > 300 mg/g.

### Chronic kidney disease testing among at-risk adults in the U.S. remains low: real-world evidence from a national laboratory database [^1112J16c]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

An estimated 37 million Americans have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Nearly 90% do not know about their condition because of low awareness about the importance of CKD testing and diagnosis among practitioners and people at risk for CKD. This study uses data from a national clinical laboratory to identify guideline-recommended CKD testing rates across the U.S.

Research Design and Methods

Patients with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (Labcorp) testing between 2013 and 2019 were defined as at risk for CKD if they had any testing ordered with diagnosis codes for diabetes and/or hypertension. Guideline-concordant CKD assessment was defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) testing within the study year.

Results

We identified 28,295,982 at-risk patients (mean age 60.6 ± 14.8 years; 53.6% women): 16.2% had diabetes, 63.8% had hypertension, and 20.1% had both comorbidities. Of these, 80.3% did not receive guideline-concordant assessment during the study period. Furthermore, only 21.0% had uACR testing versus 89.6% with eGFR. CKD assessment occurred at least once in 28.7% of patients with diabetes, 10.5% of patients with hypertension, and 41.4% of patients with both conditions. In a state-by-state comparison, annual testing rates ranged from 5 to 30%. The nationwide rate increased modestly each year between 2013 and 2018 (from 10.7% to 15.2%).

Conclusions

Despite guideline recommendations, testing for CKD with uACR and eGFR in U.S. adults with diabetes and hypertension is low in routine clinical care. These data highlight the need for strategies to improve routine CKD assessment nationwide.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — ACR should be measured in first-void urine samples, but if a random urine specimen is abnormal, the second test could be done in a first-voided morning sample obtained within the subsequent 3 to 6 months. Screening for microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, if leading to multifactorial interventions, can result in reduced risks of cardiovascular events, progression of albuminuria, and development or progression of retinopathy and neuropathy, whereas similar studies in patients with type 1 diabetes are lacking. International control between laboratories should be established, and there should also be standardized reporting of ACRs with internationally agreed-upon categorical definitions.

KDOQI diabetes and chronic kidney disease epidemiology and care gaps — global and U.S. burden is highlighted as follows: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is described as a worldwide public health problem affecting more than 50 million people, with more than 1 million receiving kidney replacement therapy, and in the United States CKD affects 11% of the population with those affected at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and kidney failure. Kidney failure represents about 1% of prevalent CKD in the United States, and the prevalence of kidney failure treated by dialysis or transplantation is projected to increase from 453,000 in 2003 to 651,000 in 2010. Among people with a history of diabetes in the United States, microalbuminuria is found in 43% and macroalbuminuria in 8%, and diabetes accounts for 45% of prevalent kidney failure, up from 18% in 1980. Despite care advances, fewer than 1 in 4 patients with diabetes receives at least 1 hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test, at least 1 lipid test, and at least 1 glucose testing strip each year.

Blood and urine tests are commonly performed by clinicians in both ambulatory and hospital settings that detect chronic and acute kidney disease. Thresholds for these tests have been established that signal the presence and severity of kidney injury or dysfunction. In the appropriate clinical context of a patient's history and physical examination, an abnormal test result should trigger specific actions for clinicians, including reviewing patient medication use, follow-up testing, prescribing lifestyle modifications, and specialist referral. Tests for kidney disease can also be used to determine the future risk for kidney failure as well as cardiovascular death.

### All patients with diabetes should have annual UACR tests. why is that so hard? [^111jAeJJ]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

The urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) detects abnormal levels of protein in the urine and should be performed annually to detect kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus. UK national audits show that 25% of patients do not have annual tests and our data suggested that some patients had more than one test per year. Data from 20 patients showed that 55% had more than one UACR test per year, with a total of 19 unnecessary tests at an estimated cost of £20,000 per year. However 20% had not had a UACR in the previous year, so unreliable testing was potentially causing harm as well as waste. Process mapping showed that having a UACR test depended on whether the patient brought a urine sample to the clinic. Most (72%) patients were unaware that the urine sample was used to detect kidney damage. We encountered barriers when finding a process to automate measures of reliability of UACR testing using computer protocol, and therefore created a patient information leaflet. The first version of the leaflet was too technical and several changes were suggested by patients. After reading the revised leaflet 99% of patients understood the reason for UACR testing and 64% felt more motivated to bring in urine samples. The phlebotomist disseminated the patient information leaflet with a median of 90% reliability for six consecutive clinics. The patient information leaflet has the potential to improve patient involvement in their care and to increase the number of patients who bring urine samples to the clinic. However, this could increase the number of unnecessary tests unless the process of test ordering is changed to ensure that UACR is only measured annually.

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: ANNUAL TESTING FOR ALBUMINURIA IN PATIENTS WITHOUT CLINICAL PROTEINURIA SHOULD BEGIN IN PUBERTAL OR POSTPUBERTAL INDIVIDUALS 5 YEARS AFTER DIAGNOSIS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES AND AT THE TIME OF DIAGNOSIS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES, REGARDLESS OF TREATMENT B (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: URINE ALBUMIN AT CONCENTRATIONS ≥ 30 mg/g CREATININE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CONTINUOUS RISK MARKER FOR CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS B (moderate).

A. Diagnosis/screening.

Diabetes is associated with a very high rate of cardiovascular events and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the Western world. Early detection of risk markers, such as albumin in the urine (formerly termed "microalbuminuria"), relies on tests for urinary excretion of albumin. Conventional qualitative tests (chemical strips or "dipsticks") for albuminuria do not detect the small increases of urinary albumin excretion. For this purpose, tests to detect albumin concentrations are used (Table 7). Low levels of albuminuria have been defined by the Joint National Committee (JNC) 7 and the ADA and have more recently been redefined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Committee (,–) as excretion of 30–300 mg of albumin/24 h, 20–200 μg/min, or 30–300 μg/mg creatinine (Table 8) on two of three urine collections. Recent data, however, suggest that risk extends below the lower limit of 20 μg/min, reinforcing the notion that this factor is a continuous variable for cardiovascular risk.

### Early nephropathy in type 1 diabetes: the importance of early renal function decline [^113GzS9w]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The results of recent clinical trials in early diabetic nephropathy demonstrate that current therapies designed to suppress microalbuminuria do not prevent renal function decline. However, recent observational studies refined the traditional model of early nephropathy in type 1 diabetes and may inform more effective therapies for the prevention of chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

A contemporary model of early nephropathy in type 1 diabetes has emerged in which initiation of renal function decline occurs soon after the onset of microalbuminuria and is not conditional on progression to proteinuria. Early renal function decline can be diagnosed using serial measurement of serum cystatin C. Abnormal levels of markers of protein glycation, uric acid metabolism, and chronic inflammation appear to represent mechanisms unique to early renal function decline and distinct from those involved in microalbuminuria.

Summary

Recent findings refine the existing paradigm of early nephropathy in type 1 diabetes and have significant implications for research. Clinical tests — such as an algorithm for the serial determination of serum cystatin C — should be developed for monitoring early renal function decline for use as an outcome in clinical trials.

Nephropathy Screening and Treatment

General recommendations

To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize glucose control. (A)
To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize blood pressure control. (A)

Screening

Perform an annual test to assess urine albumin excretion (UAE) in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetes duration of ≥ 5 years and in all type 2 diabetic patients, starting at diagnosis. (E)
Measure serum creatinine at least annually in all adults with diabetes regardless of the degree of UAE. The serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and stage the level of chronic kidney disease (CKD), if present. (E)

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, with hypertension and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. (E)
Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g · kg body wt⁻¹ · day⁻¹ in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g · kg body wt⁻¹ · day⁻¹ in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (UAE rate, GFR) and is recommended (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of UAE to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

Atypical clinical features in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — atypical clinical features should prompt evaluation for non-DKD and people with diabetes and CKD may have increased risks of testing and treatments (Moderate). Evaluation of a person with atypical features should include additional diagnostic testing in selected cases, depending on the clinical presentation; for example, refractory hypertension and/or a significant decrease in kidney function after RAS blockade should prompt consideration of renal artery stenosis. Rapidly decreasing kidney function and/or increasing proteinuria (particularly if nephrotic), active urinary sediment, or evidence of other systemic disease should raise concerns about nondiabetic glomerular disease. Diagnosis of these diseases may require invasive testing or interventional procedures, administration of radiographic contrast, with or without angiography, may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in other people, and in the absence of another identifiable and treatable cause of kidney disease, patients with diabetes and CKD should be treated as if they have DKD.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes — assessment with urine albumin and estimated GFR: Screening for albuminuria can be most easily performed by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in a random spot urine collection, with albuminuria categories defined as " < 30 mg/g creatinine", " ≥ 30–300 mg/g creatinine", and " ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine". Because of high biological variability of " > 20%", two of three UACR specimens collected within a "3-to 6-month" period should be abnormal before considering moderately or severely elevated albuminuria, and transient factors such as "Exercise within 24 h, infection, fever, heart failure, marked hyperglycemia, menstruation, and marked hypertension may elevate UACR independently of kidney damage". For kidney function, "eGFR persistence < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or an urinary albumin value of > 30 mg/g of creatinine is considered abnormal", the CKD-EPI creatinine equation "was refit without the race variable and should be used for everyone", and "increased use of cystatin C… is suggested in combination with serum creatinine" because combining markers "is more accurate and would support better clinical decisions than either marker alone".

### What methods are being used to create an evidence base on the use of laboratory tests to monitor long-term conditions in primary care? A scoping review [^113gXNKv]. Family Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies have shown unwarranted variation in test ordering among GP practices and regions, which may lead to patient harm and increased health care costs. There is currently no robust evidence base to inform guidelines on monitoring long-term conditions.

Objectives

To map the extent and nature of research that provides evidence on the use of laboratory tests to monitor long-term conditions in primary care, and to identify gaps in existing research.

Methods

We performed a scoping review-a relatively new approach for mapping research evidence across broad topics-using data abstraction forms and charting data according to a scoping framework. We searched CINAHL, EMBASE and MEDLINE to April 2019. We included studies that aimed to optimize the use of laboratory tests and determine costs, patient harm or variation related to testing in a primary care population with long-term conditions.

Results

Ninety-four studies were included. Forty percent aimed to describe variation in test ordering and 36% to investigate test performance. Renal function tests (35%), HbA1c (23%) and lipids (17%) were the most studied laboratory tests. Most studies applied a cohort design using routinely collected health care data (49%). We found gaps in research on strategies to optimize test use to improve patient outcomes, optimal testing intervals and patient harms caused by over-testing.

Conclusions

Future research needs to address these gaps in evidence. High-level evidence is missing, i.e. randomized controlled trials comparing one monitoring strategy to another or quasi-experimental designs such as interrupted time series analysis if trials are not feasible.

### Diabetic nephropathy: common questions [^1167Bofy]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy, or diabetic kidney disease, affects 20 to 30 percent of patients with diabetes. It is a common cause of kidney failure. Diabetic nephropathy presents in its earliest stage with low levels of albumin (microalbuminuria) in the urine. The most practical method of screening for microalbuminuria is to assess the albumin-to-creatinine ratio with a spot urine test. Results of two of three tests for microalbuminuria should be more than 30 mg per day or 20 mcg per minute in a three- to six-month period to diagnose a patient with diabetic nephropathy. Slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy can be achieved by optimizing blood pressure (130/80 mm Hg or less) and glycemic control, and by prescribing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Patients with diabetes and isolated microalbuminuria or hypertension benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In the event that these medications cannot be prescribed, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be considered. Serum creatinine and potassium levels should be monitored carefully for patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. These medications should be stopped if hyperkalemia is pronounced.

### Microalbuminuria constitutes a clinical action item for clinicians in 2021 [^111b3w4D]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the population or 800 million people globally, with diabetes being the leading cause. The presence of chronic kidney disease with impaired kidney function or with albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of a progressive loss of renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excess mortality. Screening for chronic kidney disease is critically important because during the initial stages patients often have no symptoms and because we now have available recently approved multiple interventions that can reduce the high risks dramatically. Screening should be performed with regular measurement of albumin in the urine and creatinine or cystatin C in blood for estimation of kidney function. Regretfully recent data indicates that screening for albuminuria is conducted in only 20%-50% of people at risk depending on the setting. Clinicians need to perform regular screening and concomitant management of risk factors. Recent therapeutic options must be implemented to improve outcomes. Finally, a reduction in albuminuria after initiation of intervention constitutes a treatment target because it indicates improved prognosis.

### Treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in persons with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^1156iw6u]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Regular monitoring of UACR in‐line with guideline recommendations is an essential tool in the detection of the onset of CKD, monitoring of disease progression, collection of kidney and CV prognostic data, and guidance in treatment decision‐making. However, rates of UACR testing remain suboptimal despite the recommendations for eGFR and UACR screening. United States and international cohort studies in participants with diabetes and/or hypertension have demonstrated that although eGFR testing rates are consistently high at approximately 90%, UACR testing rates are low. These studies indicate that approximately half to two‐thirds of participants with diabetes have not been screened for UACR, and testing for UACR is particularly low in persons with hypertension (≤ 11%) leaving many individuals at risk of CKD with undetected albuminuria due to lack of testing.

Poor adherence to guideline recommendations on UACR testing may lead to a delay in diagnosis of CKD and the initiation of treatment resulting in poorer clinical outcomes and increased economic burden. In people with T2D, a UACR of 300 mg/g is associated with significantly higher healthcare utilization and costs compared with a UACR < 30 mg/g, including an almost threefold increase in all‐cause hospital admissions and fourfold increase in inpatient days. A retrospective cohort study of people with CKD and T2D demonstrated that UACR testing reduced all‐cause mortality by 8%. UACR testing in the early stages of CKD is cost‐effective in people with T2D, as the cost of testing and increased management is offset by fewer CV deaths, a reduced need for dialysis, and the generation of additional life‐years gained before end‐stage kidney disease.

Kidney Function Assessment

Screening for nephropathy is one of the pillars of the management of T2D. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in up to 40% of patients with T2D, prompting the need for regular screening that should be done by measuring both the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) and serum creatinine coupled with automatic laboratory reporting of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using an appropriate formula, such as that of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), annually. Periodic monitoring is needed with more frequent testing if the UACR exceeds 300 mg/g and/or the eGFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Current recommendations, in particular those of the Kidney Disease Global Improved Outcomes (KDIGO), endorse testing both UACR and eGFR since an abnormality in one of these markers can be an indicator for DKD. A heat map for assessment of risk progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), included in the recent American Diabetes Association (ADA)/KDIGO 2022 consensus report for diabetes management in CKD, is based on both UACR and eGFR. A higher UACR coupled with low eGFR carries a significant risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), hence the importance of regular checks of these parameters in patients with already established DKD and timely intervention. A study carried out in the USA in 2014 showed that although physicians generally agree with the definition of CKD and albuminuria testing, a large proportion seemed to recognize that low levels of eGFR could be lone indicators of CKD while a smaller proportion agreed that UACR could also be an indicator for CKD even when eGFR values are normal. At the local clinical level, a recent study on T2D management and patient quality of life and treatment satisfaction in Jordan and Lebanon showed suboptimal screening for diabetic kidney complications. It is common practice to have urine albumin measured without simultaneous urine creatinine measurement, which does not allow the calculation of UACR and, consequently, does not achieve the aim of the testing. The Lebanese Consortium for Early and Comprehensive Management of T2D (LCECMD) attributed the suboptimal follow-up in part to a lack of knowledge of treating physicians and recommended that the clinical laboratories automatically provide standardized UACR and eGFR calculations, which can be used to optimize the collaborative multidisciplinary care of each patient. This recommendation is supported by other studies underlining the lack of awareness in physicians regarding the development and monitoring of CKD. However, CKD imposes a heavy burden on patients with T2D, especially in that renal and CV complications are connected and the worsening of renal function negatively impacts the CV outcomes. In addition, and besides the risk of ESKD, DKD is associated with or can exacerbate several other conditions, such as hypertension, volume overload, electrolyte abnormalities, metabolic acidosis, anemia, malnutrition, and metabolic bone disease.

### All patients with diabetes should have annual UACR tests. why is that so hard? [^114gsuJF]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Problem

The two key markers for chronic kidney disease (CKD) are urine albumin and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The UACR is the most reliable screening test and should be performed yearly to diagnose and monitor kidney damage in patients with type 1 diabetes for five years or more or with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore it is important to agree the frequency of monitoring UACR, as patients with, or those who are likely to develop, the disease must be monitored more regularly.

Our team consisted of a consultant diabetologist, the Medical School Lead for Quality Improvement, the Teaching Lead for Patient Safety, the phlebotomist and lab technician working at the diabetes clinic and a third year medical student. We were concerned that UACR tests were either being performed too frequently at the diabetes follow-up clinic at the Strathmore Diabetes Centre, or not at all. Baseline data, however, confirmed that not only did 55% of patients have multiple UACR tests per year, 20% of patients had waited more than the recommended 12 months for their next UACR test.

Our main concerns were the waste of resources caused by too many UACRs and the potential harm caused by patients having too few. The two aims of this project were therefore to: improve the reliability of the system for UACR testing with the outcome of reducing waste from excess testing and reducing harm by ensuring all patients have an annual UACR; involve patients more in their care with the outcome of their having a better understanding of kidney disease and why bringing in urine samples is important.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112cYWvN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in diabetes — Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, and screening should begin after 5 years of type 1 diabetes and at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes because of the inability to establish the onset of type 2 diabetes with certainty. Because urinary albumin excretion has an intraindividual coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 40%, multiple positive test results are required for classification. Evidence for the usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alone as a screening test for CKD in patients with diabetes is less secure; many patients may have elevated or high-normal GFRs early after diagnosis, so markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages of CKD, and eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse.

B. Prognosis.

Albuminuria values > 30 mg/g creatinine [and lower values if the eGFR is < 60 mL/min (Table 8)] have prognostic significance. Multiple epidemiologic studies have shown it to be an independent risk marker for cardiovascular death. In 80% of patients with type 1 diabetes and low levels of albuminuria, urinary albumin excretion can increase by as much as 10%–20%/year, with the development of clinical proteinuria (> 300 mg albumin/day) in 10–15 years in more than half the patients. After clinical-grade proteinuria occurs, > 90% of patients develop a decreased GFR and, ultimately, end-stage renal disease. In type 2 diabetes, 20%–40% of patients with stage A2 albuminuria (Table 8) progress to overt nephropathy, but by 20 years after overt nephropathy, approximately 20% develop end-stage renal disease. In addition, patients with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and stage A2 albuminuria are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Of note is that low levels of albuminuria alone indicate neither an increased risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease nor kidney disease per se; hypertension needs to be present for the risk of progression. Moreover, about 20% of people progress to end-stage kidney disease without an increase in low levels of albuminuria. Another factor that indicates progression is an increase in albuminuria from stage A2 to A3 over time despite achievement of blood pressure goals.

C. Monitoring.

The roles of routine urinalysis and albumin measurements are less clear in patients with stage A2 albuminuria. Some experts have advocated urine protein testing to monitor treatment, which may include improved glycemic control, more assiduous control of hypertension, dietary protein restriction, and therapy with blockers of the renin angiotensin system. Several factors are known to slow the rate of urinary albumin excretion or to prevent its development. They include reducing blood pressure (with a blocker of the renin angiotensin system as part of the regimen), glycemic control, and lipid-lowering therapy (,–).

### Importance of early screening and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111G8kXr]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Screening Enables Early Diagnosis OF CKD

Chronic kidney disease is asymptomatic in its early stages and is diagnosed via estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which assesses kidney function, and detection of albuminuria, a marker for kidney damage. The ADA 2020 Standards of Care recommend that patients with newly diagnosed T2D should be screened for CKD with urinary albumin (e.g. spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]) testing and eGFR. They should then be retested annually thereafter, with the frequency of retesting driven by the level of kidney damage and function (Fig. 1). For patients with a UACR > 30 mg/g albumin/creatinine, and/or an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, monitoring should be performed twice annually to guide therapy. Of note, in 2013 the American College of Physicians made the recommendation that patients with T2D and CKD (stage 1–3) receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) did not need to undergo annual testing for proteinuria. This recommendation has been retired, and therefore it is important that primary care providers (PCPs) take note of this change and adjust their practice accordingly. Based on the ADA guidelines, patients with stage 1–3 CKD should be screened between one and three times annually based on their level of albuminuria (Fig. 1).

The preferred method for assessment of albuminuria is the UACR, measured in a random spot urine collection. This method of assessment is easy to perform compared with a 24-h urine collection, which is inconvenient for patients and subject to incomplete collection. Concurrent measurement of urinary creatinine ensures that variations in albumin concentration due to hydration levels do not confound the result. A positive diagnosis of increased urinary albumin excretion, defined as ≥ 30 mg/g albumin/creatinine, should only be made when two of three samples collected over a 3- to 6-month period exceed that threshold.

### Optimizing multidisciplinary care of patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111Vc5SZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Adapted from de Boer et al. under a CC-BY license

Early identification and management of CKD is needed to prevent CKD progression and CV events. CKD treatment guidelines provide recommendations about how and when to screen for CKD as well as test result thresholds for referrals, and the relevance of these recommendations has been reported previously. However, many clinical practices have not incorporated these recommendations. Early detection, usually within the primary care setting, reduces the risk of progression and risk of requiring kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation), which is expensive and can have significant health status and quality-of-life implications for a patient.

Primary care clinicians typically focus on managing modifiable risk factors in patients with T2DM and CKD, including blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and albuminuria, as well as monitoring kidney function and coordinating care. However, it is typically the role of specialists, such as nephrologists, to consider treatment and associated CV risk in patients with advanced CKD. Patient transition from primary to secondary specialist care usually occurs following referral from a primary care clinician; therefore, the latter are often considered gatekeepers to further care. When a patient with T2DM visits their primary care clinician, if all confirmatory kidney screening tests point to CKD, they should be referred to a nephrologist, particularly when the test results show UACR > 300 mg/g and/or eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Although the criteria for when this should happen are included in the ADA-KDIGO 2022 consensus report (Fig. 1), it is important to consider the practitioner's comfort level with the management and treatment of these patients.

DKD refers to kidney disease that is specific to diabetes, and diagnosis is based in part on elevated urinary albumin excretion divided into microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria; most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test is less secure, and markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages because eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse. Because coincidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relatively frequent, evaluation of a person with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, and care should be used in determining tests because radiographic contrast may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others.

Biochemical tests

Identifying and monitoring diabetes-associated CKD primarily involves the assessment of kidney damage (albuminuria) and kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]). The general recommendation is that CKD screening in individuals with diabetes should begin within five years after the diagnosis of T1DM and at the diagnosis of T2DM, which should include measuring urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) to detect microalbuminuria and serum creatinine (and/or cystatin C) for the calculation of eGFR (Table 2). These biochemical screening tests have practical advantages and limitations.

Abbreviations: uACR urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, CKD-EPI Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation

Albuminuria

Albuminuria is a major prognostic factor for CKD progression, morbidity, and mortality from CVD, as it is often the first clinical indicator of CKD in people with diabetes. However, despite albuminuria being a clinically useful tool for predicting prognosis and monitoring response to therapy, there are limitations to its usefulness.

The variability of urinary albumin, the method used to diagnose albuminuria, whether it be urinary albumin excretion rate (uAER), uACR, or by dipstick, has implications in lower-income settings. The assessment of uAER, whether timed or 24-h collections, is a more accurate measure of albumin concentration than uACR; however, it is cumbersome, and the precision of urine collection is questionable, whereas measurement of albumin from spot urine samples, without simultaneously measuring urine creatinine, is less expensive but less accurate. The dipstick test for urinary protein, which is the most frequently used test in LMICs due to its cost-effectiveness and accessibility, is even less accurate, as it is insensitive to reliably detect albumin concentrations in ranges < 300 mg/day, and it correlates poorly with uACR.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112VFwDP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — diabetic kidney disease (DKD) terminology and clinical characterization — For consistency with chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification, the term DKD is proposed for a presumptive diagnosis of kidney disease caused by diabetes, and the term "diabetic nephropathy" should be replaced by DKD; the term diabetic glomerulopathy should be reserved for biopsy-proven kidney disease caused by diabetes. DKD is now defined, in part, by increased urinary albumin excretion and is divided into microalbuminuria, a modest elevation associated with stable kidney function but a greater risk of macroalbuminuria and kidney failure, and macroalbuminuria, a higher elevation associated with progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased systemic blood pressure, and a high risk of kidney failure. These generalizations do not apply in all cases because people with normal urinary albumin excretion may have advanced DKD, whereas those with microalbuminuria may have either substantial or no pathological evidence of kidney damage; because diabetes is highly prevalent, some individuals with diabetes may have other types of CKD, although in most cases, clinical measures may be used to diagnose DKD.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common complications of diabetes, occurring in approximately 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes. Early awareness and identification of individuals at risk of rapid progression are at the forefront of CKD prevention. The disease is characterized by progressive loss of kidney function, which is assessed by sequential estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and can vary substantially between individuals. Monitoring is performed using noninvasive methods consisting of annual physical examinations, laboratory test results, and determination of eGFR. A clinically useful prediction model of future eGFR measurements based on these routinely collected clinical data may help clinicians guide and plan preventive interventions as well as improve patient understanding and patient-physician communication about the further course of kidney function decline.

Previous studies, that aimed to predict progressive loss of kidney function used an arbitrary definition to create a binary outcome based on continuously measured eGFR, limiting the accuracy of the prediction. Generally, prediction models focus on definitive kidney function end points (eg, kidney replacement therapy), even if these end points are artificially created based on repeatedly observed laboratory measurements, such as doubling of serum creatinine levels or eGFR slope-based approaches quantifying yearly loss. For example, Gurudas et aldefined the split for risk classification as the latest of the first 2 eGFR measurements lower than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, obtained at least 3 months apart, to predict the risk of incident stage 3 CKD. More commonly, eGFR slope-based approaches based on repeated eGFR recordings are used as proxies for annual estimated decline in kidney function. However, these end points are substantially less definitive in contrast to kidney replacement therapy and are limited by the inter- and intraparticipant variability inherent to eGFR readings as well as estimation accuracy that is dependent on the number of time points available. Despite the known ambiguity in eGFR slope estimation and the benefits of continuous monitoring of disease deterioration, prediction modeling for future eGFR values remains largely overlooked.

The Kidney Disease

Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease represents the first KDIGO guideline on this subject. The guideline comes at a time when advances in diabetes technology and therapeutics offer new options to manage the large population of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) at high risk of poor health outcomes. An enlarging base of high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials is available to evaluate important new treatments offering organ protection, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. The goal of the new guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations to optimize the clinical care of people with diabetes and CKD by integrating new options with existing management strategies. In addition, the guideline contains practice points to facilitate implementation when insufficient data are available to make well-justified recommendations or when additional guidance may be useful for clinical application. The guideline covers comprehensive care of patients with diabetes and CKD, glycemic monitoring and targets, lifestyle interventions, antihyperglycemic therapies, and self-management and health systems approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD.

Monitoring

Guidelines recommending monitoring intervals, generally adopted these from the KDIGO recommendations, although NICE recommended less frequent monitoring for early stage CKD. Monitoring intervals are mainly based on clinical experience and consensus, given a lack of clinical studies evaluating the effect of different monitoring intervals on health outcomes. Guidelines were not always clear which parameters should be monitored continuously. Therefore, individual patients' preferences, comorbidities and progression risk, should be incorporated in decisions on monitoring frequency. Monitoring eGFR and proteinuria was recommended by all guidelines, but the latter might not be necessary if proteinuria has been ruled out.

Other parameters mentioned, were prognostic and etiological factors like diabetes, or laboratory values indicative of complications like CKD-MBD or anemia, that have different monitoring intervals, which is potentially confusing. Some guidelines recommended testing for electrolyte disturbances, which usually develop in later CKD stages, so that it seems sensible to focus more extensive laboratory testing on patients with moderate or severe CKD. Although nephrotoxic medication can be an important risk factor for CKD progression, only BCMA and ACP recommended regular medication reviews. Blood pressure monitoring was not formally recommended by most guidelines except for HAS and BCMA, although almost all guidelines recommended specific blood pressure targets.

Chronic kidney disease — diagnosis, assessment, and lab monitoring recommendations include the following: We suggest testing for chronic kidney disease (i.e., urine albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) in patients with one or more of the following associated risk factors: Age over 60 years, Diabetes, Hypertension, and Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. We recommend using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate for predicting chronic kidney disease progression. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m², we suggest estimating glomerular filtration rate with a combined creatinine and cystatin C formula for risk prediction. We suggest the use of a validated end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. When providing patient education about chronic kidney disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific health education program or mode of delivery.

Metformin — Implementation considerations note that the change in the FDA guidance from serum creatinine to eGFR calculations with a cutoff of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 may reduce challenges because most laboratories now report the actual eGFR when it is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and that measuring the eGFR more frequently than annually when the eGFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 is reasonable.

CONCLUSIONS

The renal biomarkers albuminuria and eGFR predict renal and cardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes beyond the set of traditional cardiovascular biomarkers. The short-term (treatment-induced) changes in albuminuria and eGFR indicate the long-term changes in renal and cardiovascular risk. This feature provides further clinical usefulness to these biomarkers.
