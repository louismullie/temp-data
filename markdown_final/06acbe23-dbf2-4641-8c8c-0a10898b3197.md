## Question

Tamoxifen for acute otitis media

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether tamoxifen is used to treat acute otitis media and what the correct evidence-based management should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what tamoxifen is and whether it has any role in ear infections. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media versus otitis media with effusion. Next, I will decide when to initiate antibiotics versus observation. After that, I need to select first-line therapy, dosing, and duration, consider alternatives and special scenarios, ensure pain control, and plan for treatment failure and follow-up while differentiating AOM from OME and acute otitis externa to avoid mismanagement.

> Let me first confirm the medication issue. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used in hormone receptor–positive breast cancer; it is not an antimicrobial and has no role in treating middle ear infections, and in fact carries thrombotic risks illustrated in case reports, which underscores its irrelevance and potential harm in this context; so using tamoxifen for AOM would be inappropriate and unsafe [^111bN6cV] [^114DqTAM]. Wait, let me verify I'm not confusing this with topical otic therapies used for external canal disease; those are fluoroquinolone or other topical antimicrobials for otitis externa, not systemic SERMs for middle ear infection, so the distinction is clear [^113YUrtu] [^115Fetqo].

> Next, I should review how AOM is diagnosed so I don't jump to conclusions. AOM requires acute symptoms with objective middle ear effusion and signs of inflammation, and specifically either moderate-to-severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new-onset otorrhea not due to otitis externa; pneumatic otoscopy or tympanometry helps confirm effusion, and I should double-check that we are not actually dealing with OME, which lacks acute inflammatory signs [^113LJRNc] [^114DqTAM] [^114LbU7C].

> Now, I need to determine whether to treat immediately with antibiotics or observe. Severe cases at any age, defined by moderate-to-severe otalgia, otalgia for at least 48 hours, or fever above 39°C, warrant prompt antibiotics; children 6–23 months with bilateral AOM should also receive antibiotics regardless of severity, while selected children without severe features may be managed with close observation and a safety-net plan to start antibiotics if not improving by 48–72 hours; I should confirm that reliable follow-up is feasible before choosing observation [^112QStUz] [^115Draen] [^1162orWZ] [^112KSmBB].

> For first-line therapy, I will now examine the recommended agent and dose. High-dose amoxicillin at 80–90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily is the guideline-preferred choice for uncomplicated AOM due to pneumococcal coverage and favorable PK/PD in middle ear fluid; durations are typically 5–7 days for children 2 years and older with nonsevere disease, and 10 days for children under 2 or with severe symptoms; hold on, I initially considered older FDA monograph dosing like 20–25 mg/kg/day, but that underdoses current pneumococcal susceptibility patterns — so I should align with the AAP/AAFP high-dose recommendation rather than those legacy dosing ranges [^116ujukL] [^114DqTAM] [^11198YjU] [^112GN9EW].

> But wait, what if amoxicillin isn't appropriate. I should use amoxicillin-clavulanate when there was amoxicillin in the past 30 days, when purulent conjunctivitis suggests beta-lactamase producers, or with prior amoxicillin nonresponse; for vomiting or severe nonresponse, intramuscular ceftriaxone is reasonable; I need to be cautious with cefdinir given concerns about achieving adequate middle ear concentrations for pneumococcus; cephalexin is not preferred empirically for typical AOM pathogens despite labeled doses in adults, so I should verify susceptibility and prefer guideline-backed choices [^114FpdgU] [^112gxnNf] [^117Nosa3] [^112HrX2y] [^112dqxpt] [^115owjY4].

> I should confirm pain control because analgesia is a core management pillar. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen should be offered for otalgia; topical antipyrine/benzocaine drops can be adjunctive for short-term relief, but they do not replace systemic therapy when antibiotics are indicated; importantly, acetaminophen does not interfere with antibiotic pharmacokinetics in the middle ear based on experimental data, so I can reassure caregivers on that point [^114pQr6t] [^112kYfSn] [^114TLoeM].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to treatment failure and follow-up. If symptoms worsen or fail to improve by 48–72 hours, I need to reassess the diagnosis to exclude OME or otitis externa, and then step up therapy to high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate or consider ceftriaxone; in recalcitrant or recurrent cases, tympanocentesis for culture can guide targeted therapy; younger age, bilateral disease, and marked bulging predict higher failure risk, so I should factor these into initial decision-making [^113y75pc] [^116gnzNJ] [^112nBjM4].

> Let me reconsider the differential with OME because antibiotics are not helpful there. OME is middle ear effusion without acute inflammatory signs or symptoms, and for children not at risk, the recommendation is watchful waiting for 3 months, with hearing and speech surveillance as appropriate; surgical options such as tympanostomy tubes are reserved for specific indications and are addressed in otolaryngology guidelines, which I should reference when persistent effusion or hearing concerns arise [^112YAxw6] [^115TsK36] [^1142nRLf] [^116t2xPp].

> Finally, I need to ensure there's no confusion with otitis externa management. Acute otitis externa is treated primarily with topical antimicrobials, not systemic antibiotics, and certainly not with tamoxifen; this reinforces the importance of distinguishing canal disease from middle ear disease at the outset to avoid misdirected therapy [^113YUrtu] [^115Fetqo].

> In summary, tamoxifen is not a treatment for acute otitis media and should not be used for ear infections; evidence-based AOM management centers on accurate diagnosis, appropriate use of high-dose amoxicillin with guideline-concordant durations or suitable alternatives when indicated, judicious observation with safety-net plans in selected patients, rigorous pain control, and timely reassessment if not improving by 48–72 hours — all of which are consistent with modern pediatric guidelines and stewardship principles [^112QStUz] [^116ujukL] [^1162orWZ] [^11198YjU].

Tamoxifen is **not indicated for acute otitis media (AOM)** [^114DqTAM] because it lacks antimicrobial activity and is not recommended by clinical guidelines [^116ujukL]. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used for breast cancer and has no role in treating bacterial infections like AOM. The **standard of care for AOM** is **amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate** [^112QStUz], with observation for select cases [^1162orWZ], and tamoxifen should not be used for AOM management [^116ujukL].

---

## Pharmacological properties of tamoxifen

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that binds estrogen receptors and exerts tissue-specific estrogenic or antiestrogenic effects [^111bN6cV]. It is used to treat and prevent estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It has **no antimicrobial properties** or mechanisms that would make it effective against bacterial infections such as AOM.

---

## Current clinical guidelines for acute otitis media

Guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) [^116ujukL] clearly recommend managing AOM with antibiotics, specifically **amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate**, as first-line therapy [^112QStUz]. Observation and symptomatic care are appropriate in select cases, particularly in older children with mild symptoms [^114pQr6t] [^112KSmBB]. Tamoxifen is **not mentioned or recommended** in these guidelines, and there is no evidence or clinical rationale for its use in AOM [^112WRk5V].

---

## Evidence supporting or refuting tamoxifen use in AOM

A comprehensive review of the available medical literature reveals **no evidence supporting the use of tamoxifen** in the treatment of AOM [^112WRk5V]. No clinical trials, case studies, or observational studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy or safety of tamoxifen for this indication. Accordingly, tamoxifen is not considered a viable treatment option for AOM [^116ujukL].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of tamoxifen

Tamoxifen is associated with several potential risks and side effects, including:

- **Increased risk of thromboembolic events**: Such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^111bN6cV].

- **Hot flashes**: Commonly reported by patients.

- **Endometrial cancer**: Increased risk due to estrogenic effects on the uterus.

- **Ocular toxicity**: Including cataracts and retinopathy.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Liver function abnormalities.

These risks are significant and **outweigh any hypothetical benefits** in AOM, especially given the lack of evidence supporting efficacy for this condition [^116ujukL].

---

## Comparison with standard antibiotic treatments

Standard antibiotic treatments, such as amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate, have been extensively studied and proven effective in treating AOM [^116AVPji]. These antibiotics target the bacterial pathogens responsible for AOM, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [^114DqTAM]. By contrast, tamoxifen has **no antimicrobial activity** and would not address the underlying bacterial infection.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Tamoxifen is **not indicated or recommended** for the treatment of acute otitis media, and there is no scientific evidence or clinical rationale supporting its use [^112WRk5V]. Current clinical guidelines emphasize antibiotics and symptomatic management [^114pQr6t] as the standard of care for AOM [^112QStUz]. Tamoxifen **should not be used** in the management of AOM due to its lack of efficacy and potential risks [^116ujukL].

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112QStUz]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute otitis media, particularly concerning systemic antibiotics, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend initiating antibiotic therapy in patients aged 6 months or older who present with acute otitis media (AOM), whether bilateral or unilateral, and exhibit severe signs or symptoms. These include:

- **Moderate or severe otalgia**: Defined as significant ear pain.
- **Duration of otalgia ≥ 48 hours**: Indicating a prolonged period of ear pain.
- **Temperature > 39 °C**: A high fever that accompanies the condition.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^116ujukL]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute otitis media, particularly concerning systemic antibiotics regimens, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend administering amoxicillin as the first-line therapy in patients with uncomplicated AOM. This recommendation applies in the absence of a penicillin allergy, recent treatment with amoxicillin, and purulent conjunctivitis.

### Otitis media: diagnosis and treatment [^114DqTAM]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is diagnosed in patients with acute onset, presence of middle ear effusion, physical evidence of middle ear inflammation, and symptoms such as pain, irritability, or fever. It is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction that occurs during a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common organisms isolated from middle ear fluid.

Management of acute otitis media should begin with adequate analgesia. Antibiotic therapy can be deferred in children two years or older with mild symptoms. High-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is the antibiotic of choice for treating acute otitis media in patients who are not allergic to penicillin. Children with persistent symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy should be reexamined, and a second-line agent, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, should be used if appropriate.

Otitis media with effusion is defined as middle ear effusion in the absence of acute symptoms. Antibiotics, decongestants, or nasal steroids do not hasten the clearance of middle ear fluid and are not recommended. Children with evidence of anatomic damage, hearing loss, or language delay should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

### Practice patterns versus practice guidelines in pediatric otitis media [^11254KtF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

To study the practice patterns of physicians and their adherence to an evidence-based practice guideline (PG) on pediatric otitis media with effusion, we hypothesized that overall knowledge of the recommendations from the guidelines would be less than 75%, and that specialist physicians would have better knowledge of the recommendations than generalist physicians.

- **Methods**: We performed a survey study of 1,167 otolaryngologists, pediatricians, and pediatric otolaryngologists. Each physician was sent a 6-item survey asking about their practice patterns and treatment preferences for young children with otitis media with effusion. We compared responses between different specialties.

- **Results**: The overall response rate was 48%. Only 8 (1.4%) of the 558 responding physicians answered all 6 items congruent with the PG. Overall, pediatricians, otolaryngologists, and pediatric otolaryngologists had similar total scores, but different scores on individual items.

- **Conclusions**: These results indicate that the practice patterns of pediatricians, otolaryngologists, and pediatric otolaryngologists differ from the recommendations of an evidence-based PG. In particular, 2 items covering key treatment recommendations were answered in agreement with the PG by fewer than half of the physicians. It is not clear from this study whether these discrepancies were due to poor dissemination or knowledge concerning the PG, or disagreement with its recommendations.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^115Fetqo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. It provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the clinical resolution of AOE.

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is necessary due to new clinical trials, systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Although differential diagnosis will be discussed, recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. It is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

### Delayed versus immediate antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media [^1172hC8s]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Watchful waiting with the option of delayed antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media is recommended in several guidelines. Our aim was to study whether delayed, as compared with immediate, initiation of antimicrobial treatment worsens the recovery from acute otitis media in young children.

- **Methods**: Children (6–35 months) with acute otitis media received either delayed or immediate antimicrobial treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7 days. The delayed antimicrobial treatment group (n = 53) consisted of placebo recipients from a randomized-controlled trial to whom antimicrobial treatment was initiated following a watchful waiting period. The immediate antimicrobial treatment group (n = 161) consisted of children allocated to receive antimicrobial treatment immediately.

- **Results**: Improvement during antimicrobial treatment (which includes both symptoms and otoscopic signs) was observed in 91% and 96% of children in the delayed and immediate antimicrobial treatment groups, respectively (P = 0.15). The median watchful waiting period was 48 hours. Delayed initiation of antimicrobial treatment was associated with prolonged resolution of fever, ear pain, poor appetite, and decreased activity, but not ear rubbing, irritability, restless sleep, or excessive crying. Parents of children in the delayed antimicrobial treatment group missed more workdays (mean 2.1 versus 1.2 days, P = 0.03). Diarrhea, vomiting, and rash were equally common in both groups.

- **Conclusions**: Our results indicate that delayed initiation of antimicrobial treatment does not worsen the recovery from acute otitis media in young children.

### Antipyrine and benzocaine [^112kYfSn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Antipyrine and benzocaine are indicated for use in acute otitis media of various etiologies. These medications provide prompt relief of pain and reduction of inflammation in the congestive and serous stages. They are used as adjuvant therapy during systemic antibiotic administration for resolving the infection. Due to the close anatomical relationship of the eustachian tube to the nasal cavity, otitis media is a frequent problem, particularly in children, in whom the tube is shorter, wider, and more horizontal than in adults.

Antipyrine and benzocaine also facilitate the removal of excessive or impacted cerumen, aiding in the management of this condition.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^11198YjU]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) accounts for roughly 25% of antibiotics prescribed to children annually. Despite national guidelines that recommend short (5–7 days) durations of antibiotics for children 2 years and older with AOM, most receive long (10-day) courses. This study aims to evaluate antibiotic durations prescribed for children aged 2–17 years with uncomplicated AOM across two pediatric academic health systems and to assess the variability in prescribed durations between and within each system.

Electronic medical record data from 135 care locations at two health systems were retrospectively analyzed. Outpatient encounters for children aged 2–17 years with a diagnosis of AOM from 2019 to 2022 were included. The primary outcome was the percentage of 5-day prescriptions. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of 7-day prescriptions, 10-day prescriptions, prescriptions for non-first-line antibiotics, cases associated with treatment failure, AOM recurrence, and adverse drug events.

Among 73,198 AOM encounters for children 2 years and older, 61,612 (84%) encounters resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Most prescriptions were for 10 days (45,689; 75%), 20% were for 7 days (12,060), and only 5% were for 5 days (3,144). Treatment failure, AOM recurrence, adverse drug events, hospitalizations, and office, emergency department, or urgent-care visits for AOM within 30 days after the index visit were rare.

Despite national guidelines that recommend shorter durations for children with uncomplicated AOM, 75% of our cohort received longer courses of antibiotics.

### Temporal trends in and patient characteristics associated with surgery for otitis media [^112gxQV6]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

Otitis media (OM) is a common reason for pediatric outpatient visits and antibiotic prescriptions. Acute otitis media occurs in up to 60% of children by age 3 years, with upwards of 2.2 million episodes of otitis media with effusion occurring annually. OM is the fourth most expensive condition among children in the United States. In addition to its high economic burden, OM can impact hearing and speech, leading to delays in development and/or school performance in the pediatric population.

Children with frequent episodes of acute OM or persistent effusion often undergo surgical management. The mainstay surgical procedure is tympanostomy tube insertion (TTI), which may be accompanied by adenoidectomy. In 2012, there was a shift in the surgical OM guidelines recommending the presence of ear fluid to offer TTI for recurrent OM. The 2006 National Health Statistics reported that TTI (667,000 cases) was the most frequent and adenoidectomy (132,000 cases) was the third most common ambulatory pediatric surgical procedure. TTI rates have ranged from 5.5% to 8.6% among all children. There exists a gap in addressing the frequency of adjuvant adenoidectomy for OM and describing clinical characteristics and risk factors in surgical otitis media management.

Using multi-institutional electronic health records (EHR), we sought to address the dearth of information surrounding surgical OM management, specifically, surgical trends, clinical/demographic characteristics, and predictive factors for surgery. EHR, characterized as "real-world data", allows for efficient evaluation of patterns and outcomes.

### Easy-ceft1g [^112gxnNf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Clinical studies**: In two adequate and well-controlled U.S. clinical trials, a single intramuscular (IM) dose of ceftriaxone was compared with a 10-day course of oral antibiotics in pediatric patients between the ages of 3 months and 6 years. The clinical cure rates and statistical outcomes are summarized below:

*Table 5: Clinical efficacy in pediatric patients with acute bacterial otitis media.*

An open-label bacteriologic study of ceftriaxone without a comparator enrolled 108 pediatric patients, 79 of whom had positive baseline cultures for one or more of the common pathogens. The results of this study are tabulated as follows:

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^113y75pc]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend reassessing patients whose symptoms worsen or fail to respond to initial antibiotic treatment within 48–72 hours. This assessment determines whether a change in therapy is needed.

### Acute otitis externa: An update [^115nN2h8]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa is a common condition involving inflammation of the ear canal. The acute form is caused primarily by bacterial infection, with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Staphylococcus aureus* being the most common pathogens. Acute otitis externa presents with the rapid onset of ear canal inflammation, resulting in otalgia, itching, canal edema, canal erythema, and otorrhea. It often occurs following swimming or minor trauma from inappropriate cleaning. Tenderness with movement of the tragus or pinna is a classic finding.

Topical antimicrobials or antibiotics such as acetic acid, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones are the treatment of choice in uncomplicated cases. These agents come in preparations with or without topical corticosteroids; the addition of corticosteroids may help resolve symptoms more quickly. However, there is no good evidence that any one antimicrobial or antibiotic preparation is clinically superior to another. The choice of treatment is based on several factors, including tympanic membrane status, adverse effect profiles, adherence issues, and cost. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone preparations are a reasonable first-line therapy when the tympanic membrane is intact. Oral antibiotics are reserved for cases in which the infection has spread beyond the ear canal or in patients at risk of a rapidly progressing infection. Chronic otitis externa is often caused by allergies or underlying inflammatory dermatologic conditions and is treated by addressing the underlying causes.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^113LJRNc]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for acute otitis media, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend diagnosing AOM in children who present with moderate-to-severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new onset of otorrhea not due to acute otitis externa.

### Does acetaminophen interfere in the antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media caused by a penicillin-resistant pneumococcus strain? A gerbil model [^114TLoeM]. Pediatric Research (2003). Low credibility.

The possible interference of acetaminophen combined with antibiotics in the treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) caused by a penicillin-resistant pneumococcus strain (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC], 2 microg/mL), and sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and erythromycin, was evaluated in a gerbil model. Animals were challenged with approximately 5 × 10⁶ bacteria in each ear through transbullar instillation. Acetaminophen was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 50 mg/kg, 30 minutes before each antibiotic administration. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and erythromycin (2.5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) were administered subcutaneously at 2, 10, and 18 hours after inoculation. Samples from the middle ear (ME) were collected on day 2 after inoculation for bacterial count.

The overall results showed no difference between animals that received acetaminophen, with or without antibiotics, and those that did not receive acetaminophen. Antibiotic concentrations in the ME were practically identical in both groups of animals, indicating that acetaminophen did not interfere with the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in the ME. However, both antibiotics significantly reduced the number of culture-positive cases and the bacterial concentration in ME samples when compared with animals not treated with antibiotics. Both antibiotics, whether combined with acetaminophen or not, reduced the prevalence of AOM, with 75% of the animals presenting otitis media with effusion, and no differences were observed between the groups. A high rate of bacterial eradication from the ME correlated with antibiotic serum concentrations being above the MIC of the infecting organism for more than 15% of the dose duration.

### Panel 7: Otitis media: Treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing).

- **Review methods**: All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary.

- **Conclusions**: Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments.

- **Implications for practice**: Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114pQr6t]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, specifically concerning analgesics, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend assessing for pain as part of the management of AOM and offering analgesic treatment if pain is present.

### Effectiveness of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for outcomes of acute otitis media [^1164Tjth]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

To determine whether adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations could be increased, we employed well-accepted approaches aimed at improving the quality of care. Our objective was to assess if adherence to these recommendations resulted in improved outcomes for acute otitis media (AOM).

A cluster randomization study was conducted in 12 pediatric practices, with 6 serving as intervention sites and 6 as control sites. The main outcome measures were adherence to the CDC recommendations, which were modified to include two additional antimicrobial agents, and subsequent antibiotic prescriptions for AOM within 30 days after diagnosis.

Out of 3152 patients referred to research assistants, 2584 (82%) met the eligibility criteria. Of those eligible, 1368 (99%) of the 1382 patients at the intervention sites and 1138 (99%) of the 1146 patients at the control sites consented to participate. Rates of adherence to the CDC recommendations were not significantly higher at the intervention sites compared to the control sites for both initial enrollment episodes (78.2% vs. 70.6%) and second episodes (62.6% vs. 59.9%). After controlling for clustering according to site and covariates, it was found that children not treated in adherence to the CDC recommendations for both episodes had 1.60 times the odds of receiving a subsequent prescription within 12 days compared to those treated in adherence at both episodes.

Despite utilizing evidence-based approaches known to influence physician behavior, we were unable to increase adherence to the CDC recommendations for the treatment of AOM. However, we established that prescription of antimicrobial therapy for those not adhering to recommendations could lead to increased subsequent antibiotic use.

### Consistency of diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media: A review of the recent literature [^113YpSU7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Clinicians use various criteria to diagnose acute otitis media (AOM). Using the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, we reviewed the consistency of AOM diagnosis in clinical trials from 1994 to 2005. Eighty-one percent of the studies required at least one of the three AAP criteria. Only 20% of the 88 studies met all three AAP criteria for a diagnosis. We found no association between the number of criteria met and study quality or industry sponsorship. Better agreement on the definition of AOM using AAP criteria could facilitate a more accurate clinical diagnosis and provide standardization of research and patient care practices.

### Updated guidelines for the management of acute otitis media in children by the Italian Society of Pediatrics: Diagnosis [^114LbU7C]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). High credibility.

In recent years, significant progress has been made regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM). Consequently, the Italian Pediatric Society decided to update the guidelines originally published in 2010.

- **Methods**: Literature searches were conducted on MEDLINE via PubMed, including studies in children, in English or Italian, published between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. Specifically, the quality of the systematic reviews was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 appraisal tool. The guidelines were formulated using the GRADE methodology by a multidisciplinary panel of experts.

- **Results**: The diagnosis of AOM is based on acute clinical symptoms and otoscopic evidence; alternatively, the presence of otorrhea associated with spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation supports an AOM diagnosis. The diagnosis of AOM must be certain, and the use of a pneumatic otoscope is of fundamental importance. As an alternative to the pneumatic otoscope, pediatricians can use a static otoscope and a tympanometer. To objectively establish the severity of the episode for the formulation of a correct treatment program, an AOM severity scoring system was developed, taking into account clinical signs and otoscopic findings.

- **Conclusions**: The diagnosis of AOM is clinical and necessitates the introduction of specific medical training programs. The use of pneumatic otoscopes must be promoted, as they are not sufficiently utilized.

Antimicrobial treatment is effective in the management of acute otitis media (AOM), but approximately half of the children may recover without antimicrobial agents. By identifying patients who may not require antimicrobial treatment, the use of antimicrobial agents could be substantially reduced. Our aim was to identify subgroups of children with AOM who would benefit most from antimicrobial treatment and those who could be suitable for initial observation.

- **Methods**: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Children aged 6 to 35 months with AOM (N = 319) were randomly allocated to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (40/5.7 mg/kg per day) or placebo for 7 days. Our primary outcome was the time until treatment failure.

- **Results**: Treatment failure occurred in 31.7% of all children. Older age (24–35 months) and a peaked tympanogram at entry decreased the hazard for treatment failure (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 0.96; p = 0.04, and hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.88; p = 0.02, respectively). The rate difference for treatment failure between antimicrobial treatment and placebo groups was highest among children with severe bulging of the tympanic membrane (11.1% vs. 64.1%; rate difference -53.0%; 95% CI, -73.5% to -32.4%), resulting in a number needed to treat of 1.9.

- **Conclusions**: Children with severe bulging of the tympanic membrane seem to benefit most from antimicrobial treatment of AOM. On the other hand, children with a peaked tympanogram (A and C curves) might not require immediate antimicrobial intervention.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^112HrX2y]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Amoxicillin is the recommended antibiotic for most children who have not had acute otitis media (AOM) in the prior 30 days, but we observed only 70% of antibiotic prescriptions at index encounters for AOM were for amoxicillin. This percentage is within the range of prior studies using commercial insurance claims databases, where 57–71% of patients were prescribed amoxicillin. Notably, 16% of antibiotic prescriptions in our cohort were for cefdinir. This may, in part, be a response to reported beta-lactam allergies, present in 11% of encounters. However, it is known that over 90% of children with a reported allergy are able to tolerate the antibiotic.

A study among children enrolled in Kentucky Medicaid found similarly high rates of cefdinir prescribing for AOM, with 27–30% of all cefdinir prescriptions having an indication of AOM. Cefdinir is a broader-spectrum antibiotic than amoxicillin, and based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, oral cephalosporins are unlikely to achieve sufficiently high levels in middle ear fluid to effectively treat most pneumococcal ear infections. Rising rates of cefdinir use for common outpatient infections are concerning and, therefore, represent a target for future stewardship interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

This update of a 2004 guideline, co-developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group; evidence from four new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision-making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (e.g. steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental concerns.

### Bacterial eradication in the treatment of otitis media [^115awQah]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Drugs differ in their ability to eradicate various pathogens from the middle-ear cavity during acute otitis media (AOM), and these differences clearly affect clinical outcomes. Outcome is derived from differences in the association between concentrations of the drugs at the site of infection and the antimicrobial effect (termed pharmacodynamics). These differences are even more marked in the present era of antimicrobial resistance. However, since AOM is a self-limiting disease in most cases, differences in clinical outcomes are more difficult to ascertain than those of bacteriological outcomes, which are measured within 3–5 days.

A favorable clinical outcome, regardless of the bacteriological effect of the drug, can result in false optimism when less-effective antibiotic drugs are used. Inappropriate study design and manipulation of clinical results add to this confusion. In this review, we attempt to highlight the evidence regarding bacteriological response to antibiotics in AOM and to draw attention to potential flaws that may mislead clinicians.

### Current approaches to otitis media [^111qtShY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is the most commonly diagnosed illness in children and is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription. In many countries, antibiotic resistance is increasing among the bacteria implicated in acute otitis media, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae.

This evolution should stimulate changes in the management of acute otitis media, particularly:

- **Improvement in diagnostic accuracy**: Efforts should focus on enhancing the precision of diagnosing acute otitis media.
- **Reduction in antibiotic use**: Reducing unnecessary prescriptions can help combat antibiotic resistance.
- **Selection of the most appropriate drugs at the appropriate dosage**: Careful selection of antibiotics, considering resistance patterns, is crucial.
- **Reduction in duration of treatment, when possible**: Limiting treatment duration can decrease resistance development.
- **Implementation of new vaccines**: Vaccines can be a preventive measure against the pathogens causing acute otitis media.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media: Evaluating the evidence [^111MDeQS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common illnesses for which children in the United States receive an antimicrobial agent. Among the six recommendations offered in recent guidelines for the treatment of AOM, only one — the assessment and treatment of pain with analgesics — is based on strong evidence. This article reviews the diagnosis of AOM and the accuracy of various signs and symptoms in indicating a bacterial origin. It also explores data on the effect of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo in the treatment of AOM, and identifies gaps in knowledge that should be addressed by future research and clinical trials.

### Trends in otitis media treatment failure and relapse [^113HdiB5]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The study aimed to describe trends in acute otitis media, treatment failure, relapse, and the use of high-dose amoxicillin. It also sought to determine whether treating acute otitis media with high-dose amoxicillin was associated with treatment failure or relapse.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted on acute otitis media visits between 1996 and 2004 by children aged 2 months to 12 years in a large group practice, using computerized data. Acute otitis media was defined as an otitis media visit with antibiotics dispensed, preceded by 30 days without otitis media visits. Treatment failure was defined as the initiation of treatment with a second antibiotic before the first prescription was finished, and relapse as the initiation of antibiotic treatment after the first prescription was finished but within 30 days after the index acute otitis media episode. The primary independent measure was high-dose amoxicillin (> 70 mg/kg per day). The study evaluated changes over time and determined whether high-dose amoxicillin use was associated with otitis media treatment failure or relapse.

- **Results**: The study identified 111,335 acute otitis media visits over a 9-year period. The incidence of acute otitis media decreased from 385.1 visits per 1000 enrollees in 1996 to 188.8 visits per 1000 enrollees in 2004. The proportion of acute otitis media visits treated with high-dose amoxicillin increased from 1.7% in 1996 to 41.9% in 2004. Both otitis media treatment failure and relapse rates decreased from 1996 to 2004, with treatment failure rates reducing from 3.9% to 2.6% and relapse rates from 9.2% to 8.9%.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114FpdgU]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, particularly concerning the use of systemic antibiotics, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend administering an antibiotic with additional β-lactamase coverage in patients meeting any of the following criteria:

- **Receipt of amoxicillin in the last 30 days**: Patients who have taken amoxicillin recently may require an alternative treatment.

- **Presence of conjunctivitis-purulent**: The co-occurrence of purulent conjunctivitis necessitates extended β-lactamase coverage.

- **History of recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin**: Past instances of otitis media not responding to amoxicillin warrant the use of enhanced antibiotic coverage.

### A cost-utility analysis of 5 strategies for the management of acute otitis media in children [^111abAcB]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

To assess whether antimicrobial therapy in young children with acute otitis media reduces time to resolution of symptoms, overall symptom burden, and persistence of otoscopic evidence of infection, we used a cost-utility model. This model evaluated whether immediate antimicrobial treatment seems worthwhile, and if so, which antimicrobial agent is most cost-effective.

- **Study design**: We compared the cost per quality-adjusted life-day of five treatment regimens in children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media. The regimens included immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate, immediate amoxicillin, immediate cefdinir, watchful waiting, and delayed prescription (DP) for antibiotics.

- **Results**: The treatment regimens, listed from least effective to most effective, were DP, watchful waiting, immediate cefdinir, immediate amoxicillin, and immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate. In terms of cost, from least costly to most costly, the regimens were DP, immediate amoxicillin, watchful waiting, immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate, and immediate cefdinir. The incremental cost-utility ratio of immediate amoxicillin compared with DP was $101.07 per quality-adjusted life-day gained. The incremental cost-utility ratio of immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate compared with amoxicillin was $2331.28 per quality-adjusted life-day gained.

- **Conclusions**: In children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media and no recent antibiotic exposure, immediate amoxicillin appears to be the most cost-effective initial treatment.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^1151Z5eo]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). High credibility.

Ear assessments during therapy: Bilaterally normal ears were observed at least once in 11 (21%) amoxicillin infants and 5 (10%) placebo infants. More children in the amoxicillin group had at least one diagnosis of OME, and more had AOMwoP. Fewer amoxicillin-treated children had AOMwiP detected (25% compared to 33% in the placebo group), and reAOMwiP was identified in significantly fewer amoxicillin children (4%) than placebo children (18%) (RD = -14% [-25, -2]).

Results expressed as a proportion of examinations for each group showed that bilateral normal ears were detected in 6% of visits for amoxicillin infants and 2% for placebo infants (adjusted risk ratio = 2.7 [0.78, 9.13] p = 0.116). OME was the worst ear diagnosis in about half of the visits for each group, with AOMwoP detected in about one-quarter of visits. AOMwiP was less often diagnosed in children receiving amoxicillin (8%) compared to placebo (19%) (adjusted risk ratio = 0.36 [0.16, 0.84] p = 0.017). Significant differences in perforation were found for combined diagnostic categories of any suppurative OM, any perforation, and any active perforation. Antibiotic prescribing for a clinical indication was less often required at examinations of amoxicillin children (55%) compared to placebo children (68%) (adjusted risk ratio = 0.67 [0.36, 1.22] p = 0.190). More details of ear status over the course of the trial can be found in Tables S2a and S2b.

Nasopharyngeal outcomes at the end of therapy showed the carriage of OM pathogens, and carriage of penicillin non-susceptible strains was…

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^115TVDqQ]. Family Practice (2024). High credibility.

Of children with acute otitis media (AOM), 15%–20% present with acute ear discharge due to a spontaneous perforation of the eardrum. These children experience equal levels of ear pain, suffer from more frequent AOM recurrences and hearing problems, and benefit more from antibiotic treatment than those with AOM who do not present with ear discharge. Guidelines suggest clinicians can consider oral antibiotics for children with AOM and ear discharge (AOMd), but this must always be balanced against the risk of side effects and the significant public health danger of antibiotic resistance.

We have previously shown that treatment with antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops is superior to oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes presenting with acute ear discharge. The question is whether this strategy is also effective in children without ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge as one of the symptoms of AOM, arguing that the spontaneous perforation of the eardrum would provide an entry for topical antibiotics to act in the middle ear. Such an approach would contribute to antibiotic stewardship and avoid systemic antibiotic side effects. We, therefore, conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with oral antibiotics and antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children presenting in primary care with AOMd.

### Management of recurrent and persistent acute otitis media: new options with familiar antibiotics [^117Nosa3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent and persistent acute otitis media (AOM) is a common problem, affecting close to 20% of children in their first years of life. It presents a therapeutic challenge to physicians, particularly as beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae, as well as penicillin- and, more recently, macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae are often responsible for AOM in these patients. Intramuscular ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, once daily for 3 days) has been shown to be effective in treating nonresponsive AOM, but there have been relatively few clinical trials exploring oral antibiotic regimens.

Higher doses of commonly used antibiotics, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate in a 14:1 ratio and azithromycin (60 mg/kg divided into three equal once-daily doses), have demonstrated high rates of clinical success. These studies will be discussed together with a review of the clinical and microbiological characteristics of this disease. We will also address the impact that the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may have on the microbiology of recurrent and persistent AOM.

The management of hearing loss associated with otitis media is multifaceted. Clinical practice guidelines set the collaborative prescriptive standards for the medical management of otitis media in children. Treatment of this condition does not end with the medical practitioner; it has far-reaching effects that permeate every aspect of patients' lives, including physiological, educational, and psychosocial domains. Therefore, a comprehensive interprofessional treatment plan must be designed, taking into consideration best practices from a range of professions to maximize clinical outcomes, including the treating physician, speech-language pathologist, clinical audiologist, educational audiologist, and professionals in the educational setting.

### Otitis media: The application of personalized medicine [^116X692n]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

During most of recorded history, the application of knowledge to the care of individual patients was founded on the experience of individual medical practitioners; when published, it basically took the form of case reports. Not until the middle of the 20th century did randomized controlled trials (RCTs) become the gold standard. By the beginning of the 21st century, however, the limitations of RCTs and their syntheses, the meta-analyses, have come to be recognized, and their applicability to the individual patient has been questioned and, indeed, challenged.

The intense increase in our knowledge base and accompanying technology has made possible the personalization of medicine beyond the possibilities of earlier periods. The approach of personalized medicine requires evaluation of four parameters: the individual patient's intrinsic susceptibility, intrinsic morbidity, extrinsic susceptibility, and extrinsic morbidity. The characteristics of the disease agent — how much (duration) and how virulent — must also be considered. These individualized data define the appropriate intervention: high susceptibility and/or morbidity or low susceptibility and/or morbidity and the aggregate of the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors are co-factored in medical decision-making.

We followed symptoms of children with acute otitis media (AOM) who were enrolled in a clinical trial that included a baseline tympanocentesis. We observed marked and rapid improvement in symptom scores after tympanocentesis. Although symptom scores (measured by the AOM-SOS) correlated with overall clinical assessment and bacteriologic outcomes, the early effect of tympanocentesis rendered the AOM-SOS less useful as a primary outcome measure.

- **Pathophysiology**: AOM is mostly caused by bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis) followed by viruses.
- **Disease course**: The inflammatory disease due to middle ear space infection with particular involvement of the tympanic membrane results in AOM, which presents with clinical presentations of earache, otorrhea, headache, fever, general malaise, and hearing impairment. AOM is a self-limiting condition.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AOM is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^111a7pz8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via a MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations.

The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated, and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably as a result of increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States.

The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM.

### Recurrence up to 3.5 years after antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media in very young Dutch children: Survey of trial participants [^111DD6qM]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media, one of the most common infections in childhood, remains the leading cause of doctors' consultations by children and the most common reason for children to take antibiotics. Guidelines recommend the prescription of antibiotics in children with severe illness and in those younger than 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media or acute otorrhoea. For most other children with acute otitis media, initial observation is recommended.

So far, little is known about the long-term effects of antibiotics in acute otitis media. The initial prescription of antibiotics may, on one hand, shorten the course of acute otitis media. On the other hand, it may encourage doctors' attendance in future episodes, increase pressure on doctors to prescribe, increase future use of antibiotics, and therefore increase antibiotic resistance. In addition, antibiotic treatment may cause an unfavorable shift towards colonization with resistant pathogens, which are likely to promote the recurrence of the infection. We aimed to study the long-term effects of antibiotics on recurrence of acute otitis media; referrals to secondary care; and ear, nose, and throat surgery.

### Predictors of pain and/or fever at 3 to 7 days for children with acute otitis media not treated initially with antibiotics: A meta-analysis of individual patient data [^113FLBid]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The goal was to determine the predictors of a prolonged course for children with acute otitis media.

- **Methods**: A meta-analysis was conducted using data from six randomized controlled trials. Participants included 824 children aged 6 months to 12 years, all diagnosed with acute otitis media. The primary outcome was determined to be a prolonged course of acute otitis media, defined by the presence of fever and/or pain at 3 to 7 days.

- **Results**: Out of the 824 children included, 303 experienced pain and/or fever at 3 to 7 days. Independent predictors of a prolonged course included an age of less than 2 years and bilateral acute otitis media. The risk for children older than or equal to 2 years with unilateral acute otitis media was 25%.

- **Conclusions**: The risk of a prolonged course was twice as high for children younger than 2 years with bilateral acute otitis media. Clinicians can utilize these characteristics (i.e. age under 2 years and bilateral acute otitis media) to provide more explicit guidance to parents regarding the expected progression of their child's condition and to indicate which symptoms should prompt a follow-up with a clinician for reexamination.

### Management of acute otitis media by primary care physicians: Trends since the release of the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics/American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1137w1m6]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians released a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute otitis media. This included an endorsement of an observation option for selected cases and recommendations of specific antibiotics. The objective of this study was to describe primary care physicians' management of acute otitis media in comparison with the guideline's recommendations and to describe trends since 2004.

The research design used was a mail survey conducted from March through June 2006 within the Slone Center Office-Based Research Network, a national practice-based pediatric research network.

The response rate was 299 out of 477, which equates to 62.7%. The observation option was considered reasonable by 83.3% of respondents, compared with 88.0% in 2004, and was applied in a median of 15% of acute otitis media cases over the previous three months. The most common physician-identified barriers to adopting the observation option were parental reluctance (83.5%) and the cost and difficulty of follow-up for children who do not improve (30.9%).

In terms of antibiotic choices for acute otitis media, agreement with the guideline's antibiotic recommendation for four common clinical scenarios was as follows:

- **Antibiotic choice for nonsevere symptoms**: High-dose amoxicillin was used in 57.2% of cases.
- **Antibiotic choice for severe symptoms**: High-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate was used in 12.7% of cases.
- **Antibiotic choice for failure to respond to amoxicillin**: High-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate was used in 42.8% of these cases.
- **Antibiotic choice for failure to respond to amoxicillin-clavulanate**: Intramuscular ceftriaxone was used in 16.7% of cases.

### Ofloxacin [^111MLkBM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

As with other anti-infective preparations, prolonged use of ofloxacin may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If the infection is not improved after one week, cultures should be obtained to guide further treatment. If otorrhea persists following a full course of therapy, or if two or more episodes of otorrhea occur within six months, further evaluation is recommended to exclude an underlying condition, such as cholesteatoma, a foreign body, or a tumor.

The systemic administration of quinolones, including ofloxacin at doses much higher than those given or absorbed by the otic route, has led to lesions or erosions of cartilage in weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. However, young growing guinea pigs dosed in the middle ear with 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution showed no systemic effects, lesions, or erosions of cartilage in weight-bearing joints, or other signs of arthropathy. No drug-related structural or functional changes of the cochlea and no lesions in the ossicles were noted in the guinea pig following otic administration of 0.3% ofloxacin for one month.

Furthermore, no signs of local irritation were found when 0.3% ofloxacin was applied topically in the rabbit eye. Ofloxacin also demonstrated a lack of dermal sensitizing potential in the guinea pig maximization study.

- **Information for patients**: Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the fingers or other sources to preserve the sterility of the drops. Systemic quinolones, including ofloxacin, have been associated with adverse effects, and such precautions are necessary.

### Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion executive summary (update) [^117Y9bUu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of *Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery* featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements.

The 18 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy, identification of children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from otitis media with effusion, and education of clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most otitis media with effusion and the lack of efficacy for medical therapy (e.g. steroids, antihistamines, decongestants).

An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Parental experiences and attitudes regarding the management of acute otitis media — a comparative questionnaire between Finland and The Netherlands [^111GRjGc]. Family Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Both treatment guidelines and the amount of antibiotics used for acute otitis media (AOM) vary across Western countries. Parental expectations and their awareness of antimicrobial use and resistance, which may also be influenced by the guidelines, are not yet completely known.

- **Objective**: To compare parental experiences and opinions regarding the management of AOM in children with AOM in Finland and The Netherlands.

- **Methods**: We sent the questionnaires via public day care in Turku, Finland, and Utrecht, The Netherlands. We asked about family background, the child's history of AOM, and parental experiences and attitudes about AOM treatment and antimicrobial resistance.

- **Results**: Of 1151 participants, 83% in Finland and 49% in The Netherlands had had at least one episode of AOM. Antibiotics were used more frequently in Finland than in The Netherlands (99% versus 78%, respectively). More Finnish parents reported believing that antibiotics are necessary in the treatment of AOM compared to Dutch parents. Use of analgesics for AOM was similar, with 80% in Finland and 86% in The Netherlands. One-third of the parents had discussed resistance with their doctor. According to parental experiences, antimicrobial resistance had caused more problems in Finland than in The Netherlands (20% versus 2%). Finally, 88% of parents in Finland and 65% in The Netherlands were worried that bacteria could become resistant to antibiotics.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment practices and parental expectations seem to interact with each other. Therefore, if we aim to change AOM treatment practices, we have…

### A case with cerebral thrombosis receiving tamoxifen treatment [^111bN6cV]. European Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Cerebral sinus thrombosis (CST) is associated with various underlying etiologies, including otitis media, trauma, pregnancy, birth control pills, tumors, malnutrition, dehydration, hematologic disorders, and malignancy. We present the case of a patient with breast cancer receiving the anti-estrogen drug tamoxifen who developed CST. A 40-year-old female presented as an emergency with a 10-day history of headache and left-sided weakness. Her medical history included a diagnosis of breast cancer three years prior, treated with radical mastectomy and tamoxifen 20 mg daily. At the time of admission, neurologic examination revealed mild left-sided hemiparesis and a present Babinski sign. Non-contrast enhanced tomography was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed thrombosis in the superior sagittal sinus, right lateral sinus, and jugular vein. In addition, venous infarction in the right temporal lobe was present.

Routine hematology and biochemistry were normal. Anticoagulation tests, antithrombin III, and protein S and C levels were also normal. She was treated with anticoagulation therapy, and her hemiparesis improved within three days. Control MRI showed the resorption of the venous infarction and resolution of the thrombosis.

### Sustainability of interventions to increase guideline-concordant durations of antibiotic therapy for children with acute otitis media [^111XRAav]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Two low-cost pragmatic interventions, including a change in the options in the electronic health record and a change in the electronic health record combined with education plus feedback comparing prescribing with peers, were implemented to improve prescribing of guideline-concordant short antibiotic durations for children aged 2 years and older with uncomplicated acute otitis media. These interventions were highly effective, and the results were sustained 18 months after discontinuation of the active components of the interventions.

### Management of acute otitis media after publication of the 2004 AAP and AAFP clinical practice guideline [^115uLH6b]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Observation without initial antibiotic therapy was accepted as an option for acute otitis media (AOM) management in the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline. The guideline also recommended amoxicillin as the first-line treatment for most children, and analgesic treatment to reduce pain if it was present. Our objective was to compare the management of AOM after the publication of the 2004 guideline.

We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2002–2006 (N = 1114), which was conducted in US physicians' offices. The patients were children aged 6 months to 12 years who were diagnosed with AOM. The time comparisons were set over the 30-month periods before and after the guideline's release. The main outcome measured was the encounter rate at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported. Secondary outcomes included the identification of factors associated with encounters where no antibiotic was prescribed, as well as antibiotic and analgesic-prescribing rates.

The rate of AOM encounters at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported did not change significantly after the guideline publication (11%-16%; p = 0.103). Independent predictors of an encounter with no antibiotic-prescribing included the absence of ear pain, absence of reported fever, and receipt of an analgesic prescription. Following the guideline publication, the rate of amoxicillin-prescribing increased (40%-49%; p = 0.039), while the rate of amoxicillin/clavulanate-prescribing decreased (23%-16%; p = 0.043).

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112WRk5V]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline is a revision of the 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians. It provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM. In 2009, the AAP convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in pediatrics, family practice, otolaryngology, epidemiology, infectious disease, emergency medicine, and guideline methodology. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the new literature related to AOM since the initial evidence report of 2000.

The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures. It also addresses recurrent AOM (reAOM), which was not included in the 2004 guideline. Decisions were made based on a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the AAP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of otitis media [^111nc5aK]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media include the rapid onset of symptoms, middle ear effusion, and signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial isolates from the middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media. Fever, otalgia, headache, irritability, cough, rhinitis, listlessness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and pulling at the ears are common but nonspecific symptoms. Detection of middle ear effusion by pneumatic otoscopy is key in establishing the diagnosis.

Observation is an acceptable option in healthy children with mild symptoms. Antibiotics are recommended in all children younger than six months, in those between six months and two years if the diagnosis is certain, and in children with severe infection. High-dosage amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is recommended as first-line therapy. Macrolide antibiotics, clindamycin, and cephalosporins are alternatives for penicillin-sensitive children and those with resistant infections. Patients who do not respond to treatment should be reassessed. Hearing and language testing is recommended in children with suspected hearing loss or persistent effusion for at least three months, and in those with developmental problems.

### Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion [^114EDL2Q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research, now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Unlike the earlier guideline, which was limited to children aged 1 to 3 years with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media (AOM).

- **Recommendations for clinicians**:
	(1) Document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME;
	(2) Distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing.

### Knowledge and practices relating to the 2004 acute otitis media clinical practice guideline: a survey of practicing physicians [^115FsrYS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess primary care physicians' awareness of the 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) clinical practice guideline and to compare their clinical practices with the guidelines' recommendations.

A mail survey was conducted from October through December 2004, targeting all active physician members of the Slone Center Office-Based Research Network, a national, practice-based, pediatric research network.

The results indicated a response rate of 276 out of 469 (58.8%). Of the respondents, 90.5% had read the guideline or summaries of it. Pneumatic otoscopy was always used by 16.2% of respondents, used half the time or more by 23.1%, used less than half the time by 34.6%, and was never used by 26.2%. Observation was considered a reasonable option for certain AOM cases by 88.0% of physicians; over the previous three months, these physicians opted for observation a median of 10% of the time (with the 25th and 75th percentiles at 5% and 25%, respectively). Regarding the concern that the observation option could lead to AOM complications, 75.6% were not at all or only slightly concerned, whereas 24.4% were moderately or very concerned. Generally, these physicians reported modifying their antibiotic prescribing practices for AOM in alignment with the guideline's recommendations since its release. However, antibiotic choices significantly deviated from the guideline in cases of severe AOM, where only 17.9% adhered to the recommendation for high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate. Additionally, for children who failed treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, only 27.7% preferred the recommended intramuscular ceftriaxone.

In conclusion, while most surveyed physicians are familiar with the AOM guideline, a significant number do not adhere to all its recommendations.

### Trends in broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing for children with acute otitis media in the United States, 1998–2004 [^116T9Mhe]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Episodes of care for acute otitis media were studied by recording up to three diagnoses per visit. These were initially captured as free text and subsequently coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). Visits included in the study had any of the following diagnoses: acute nonsuppurative otitis media (ICD-9-CM 381.0), nonsuppurative otitis media, not specified as acute or chronic (ICD-9-CM 381.4), acute suppurative otitis media (ICD-9-CM 382.0), unspecified suppurative otitis media (ICD-9-CM 382.4), or unspecified otitis media (ICD-9-CM 382.9). Visits with alternative diagnoses that could justify antibiotic prescriptions were excluded, including diagnoses like acute sinusitis (ICD-9-CM 461), chronic sinusitis (ICD-9-CM 473), acute pharyngitis (ICD-9-CM 462), acute tonsillitis (ICD-9-CM 463), streptococcal sore throat (ICD-9-CM 034.0), or pneumonia (ICD-9-CM 481–486). Further, visits were categorized as acute or chronic problems, with chronic cases being excluded to focus solely on acute otitis media episodes.

Patient covariates included age (up to 12 years, categorized as < 2 years, ≥ 2 years), sex, race (categorized as white or non-white), and insurance status (categorized as private, Medicare/Medicaid, or other). Provider specialty, self-selected through NAMCS, and clinic type coded as NHAMCS were designated as pediatrics (including pediatric clinics), family practice (including general medical clinics), or otolaryngology (including surgery clinics). Geographic region of the visits was also recorded.

### Otitis media and its consequences: Beyond the earache [^114CgyV2]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

An international group of multidisciplinary experts on middle-ear and paediatric infections met to explore where consensus exists on the management of acute otitis media. After informal discussions among several specialists in paediatric infectious disease, the group was expanded to include a larger spectrum of professionals with complementary expertise in middle-ear disease.

Acute otitis media is a very common bacterial infection in children worldwide, leading to excessive antibiotic consumption in most countries and to a substantial burden of deafness and suppurative complications in developing countries. The group attempted to move beyond the existing controversies surrounding guidelines on acute otitis media and proposed to clinicians and public health officials their views on the actions needed to reduce the disease burden caused by acute otitis media and microbial antibiotic resistance from the resulting use of antibiotics.

Definition of acute otitis media and diagnostic accuracy are crucial steps to identify children who will potentially benefit from treatment with antibiotics and to eliminate unnecessary prescribing. Although the group agreed that antibiotics are distributed indiscriminately, even to children who do not seem to have the disease, no consensus could be reached on whether antibiotics should be given to all appropriately diagnosed children. This reflects the wide range of practices and lack of convincing evidence from observational studies.

The major unanimous concern was an urgent need to reduce unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics for acute otitis media.

### Evidence assessment of management of acute otitis media: I. The role of antibiotics in treatment of uncomplicated acute otitis media [^116AVPji]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

In 1995, more than 5 million episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) accounted for $3 billion in health care expenditures.

- **Objectives**: To synthesize the literature on the natural history of AOM, the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated AOM, and the relative effectiveness of specific antibiotic regimens.

- **Data sources**: Seven electronic databases for articles published between 1966 and March 1999 and reference lists in proceedings, published articles, reports, and guidelines.

- **Study selection**: Two physicians independently assessed each article. Studies addressing AOM in children 4 weeks to 18 years old were included, while those addressing children with immunodeficiencies or craniofacial abnormalities were excluded. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were used to assess antibiotic effectiveness, and RCTs and cohort studies were used to assess the natural history of AOM. Among the 3491 citations identified, 80 (2.3%) met our inclusion criteria.

- **Data extraction**: Two physicians independently abstracted data and assessed the quality of studies using a validated scale for RCTs and eight quality components for cohort studies.

- **Data synthesis**: Random-effects estimates of pooled absolute rate differences of outcomes were derived, and the heterogeneity of both the rates and rate differences was assessed. Children with AOM not treated with antibiotics experienced a 1- to 7-day clinical failure rate of 19% (95% confidence interval: 0.10–0.28) and few suppurative complications. When patients were treated with amoxicillin, the 2- to 7-day clinical failure rate was reduced to 7%, a 12% reduction.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^112GN9EW]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat, fueled by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Unnecessary antibiotic use contributes to adverse drug events such as rash, diarrhea, and abdominal pain and causes almost 70,000 emergency department visits in children annually. Each excess day of antibiotic prescribed has been associated with a 5% increase in the odds of antibiotic-associated adverse events.

Acute otitis media (AOM) affects approximately 5 million children in the United States annually and accounts for roughly 25% of all antibiotics prescribed to children each year. Therefore, understanding prescribing habits for AOM is essential to developing effective strategies to reduce overall pediatric antibiotic use.

Studies suggest that for most children with uncomplicated AOM (defined as AOM without otorrhea), the risk of treatment failure does not differ between those who receive 5 days of therapy and those who receive 7 or more days of therapy. Additionally, 5-day regimens provide similar rates of clinical cure and bacterial eradication for children ages 2 years and older compared to traditional 10-day regimens. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) AOM guidelines published in 2013 recommend short (5–7 day) durations for children ages 2 years and older with nonsevere and uncomplicated AOM. Despite these recommendations, most children with AOM receive longer (10-day) antibiotic durations. These prior studies were either performed in single centers and may not be generalizable, or they used large insurance claims databases and were unable to provide a granular analysis.

### Treatment failure, recurrence, and antibiotic prescription rates for different acute otitis media treatment methods [^116gnzNJ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

In an era of increasing antibiotic resistance, reliance on empirical antibiotic therapy for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) will eventually become an untenable strategy. New research efforts are needed to identify effective treatment alternatives. In this retrospective analysis, we assessed AOM treatment failure (AOMTF), recurrent AOM (RAOM), and antibiotic prescription rates for groups of AOM episodes managed with either immediate antibiotics (ABX), tympanocentesis plus observation (Tap + OBS), or tympanocentesis plus immediate antibiotics (Tap + ABX). No significant differences in rates of AOMTF or RAOM were observed between any of the treatment groups. The 30-day rate of antibiotic prescriptions written for AOM was significantly lower in the Tap + OBS group (1 prescription per 3.8 episodes) than in the immediate antibiotic therapy groups (1.2 prescriptions per episode), P < .001. The comparative risk of AOMTF was slightly higher among AOM episodes caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (OR 2.523; CI 1.070–5.944; P = 0.056). Neither the presence of other particular otopathogens nor the presence of drug-resistant otopathogens, nor the choice of any particular AOM antibiotic therapy correlated with increased risk of either AOMTF or RAOM. The observed absence of significant differences in clinical outcomes between the various treatment groups in this study is consistent with findings published by other authors: alternative AOM therapies can help reduce reliance on antibiotics without inviting significant increases in rates of clinical failure.
