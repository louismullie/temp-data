## Question

Max tylenol dosage for adulta

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the maximum Tylenol (acetaminophen) dosage for adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility sources that define the absolute maximum daily dose. Then, I should verify how this maximum applies across oral, IV, and combination products. Next, I will consider special populations and risk factors that warrant a lower ceiling. After that, I should review conflicting guidance and reconcile why some labels list 3,250–3,900 mg while others list 4,000 mg. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation and confirm the key counseling points about total daily acetaminophen from all sources.

> Let me first confirm the absolute maximum daily dose from authoritative sources. Multiple high-credibility guidelines and FDA labeling consistently state that the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen for adults is 4,000 mg (4 g) per day, and this ceiling applies to total acetaminophen from all routes and all products, including prescription combinations and over-the-counter formulations [^a2827c78] [^d80883c0] [^be4aa0f7] [^5af32b5e].

> Wait, let me verify how this translates to common oral dosing patterns. Typical adult oral dosing is 650 mg every 4–6 hours or 1,000 mg every 6 hours, with a hard cap of 4,000 mg in 24 hours; exceeding this threshold increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, so the total daily dose must account for all acetaminophen-containing products a patient is using [^a2827c78] [^d80883c0] [^be4aa0f7].

> I need to check whether the same 4,000 mg/day ceiling applies to IV acetaminophen. Yes, the IV formulation (Ofirmev) carries the same adult maximum of 4,000 mg/day, and importantly, the total daily acetaminophen exposure must include IV, oral, and rectal sources to avoid inadvertent overdose [^a2827c78] [^93af1f25].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single universal ceiling for everyone. I should confirm special populations and risk factors where a lower maximum is advised. For older adults, particularly those aged 80 years and above, many trauma and geriatric guidelines recommend a maximum of 2,000–3,000 mg/day due to reduced hepatic clearance and increased hepatotoxic risk; similarly, patients with chronic liver disease, alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, or those on enzyme-inducing drugs should generally stay below 3,000 mg/day, and some experts advise 2,000 mg/day or avoidance depending on severity and context [^ccdb2a53] [^143bb4fb] [^be4aa0f7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, some labels and references list 3,250–3,900 mg/day rather than 4,000 mg/day. Let me reconsider the rationale. These lower ceilings reflect conservative, safety-oriented labeling adopted by certain manufacturers and advisory positions aiming to reduce unintentional overdose risk; for example, some oral products cap at 3,250 mg/day and extended-release formulations at 3,900 mg/day, even though multiple high-credibility guidelines still recognize 4,000 mg/day as the labeled maximum when used carefully and short-term in appropriate patients [^fb4e5238] [^9deafe58] [^d80883c0] [^be4aa0f7].

> I should double-check the hepatotoxicity threshold to ensure I'm not overstating safety. Toxicity is dose-dependent; single ingestions above about 10 g or repeated supratherapeutic dosing above 4 g/day increase risk, and AASLD guidance explicitly recognizes acetaminophen as a dose-dependent hepatotoxin when doses exceed 4 g in 24 hours, reinforcing the 4,000 mg/day ceiling as a key safety boundary [^b16ba88d] [^25b46168].

> Next, I should review practical counseling points to prevent unintentional overdose. Patients must tally acetaminophen from all sources, including prescription opioids, cold medications, and different OTC brands; many cases of liver injury arise from unintentional excess due to unrecognized combination products, and health literacy limitations correlate with exceeding 4 g/day, so explicit education and medication reconciliation are essential [^ed0ad93c] [^da6d6df3] [^d80883c0].

> Let me synthesize a clear, clinically usable answer. For a typical healthy adult without liver disease, alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, or enzyme-inducing drugs, the maximum Tylenol dosage is 4,000 mg per day total from all sources, with common regimens of 650 mg every 4–6 hours or 1,000 mg every 6 hours, not to exceed 4,000 mg in 24 hours. For adults aged 80 years and older or those with hepatic risk factors, a lower maximum of 2,000–3,000 mg/day is prudent, and some clinicians use 3,000 mg/day as a routine ceiling for prolonged therapy even in otherwise low-risk adults [^a2827c78] [^d80883c0] [^ccdb2a53] [^be4aa0f7].

> But wait, what if the patient is using combination products with opioids or other agents? I should confirm that the same 4,000 mg/day total acetaminophen limit applies, and that opioid–acetaminophen labels reinforce using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration and counting the acetaminophen component toward the daily total to avoid hepatic injury [^d1572a25] [^f783b552] [^a2827c78].

> Final answer: The maximum Tylenol (acetaminophen) dosage for adults is 4,000 mg per day total from all routes and products, with a lower ceiling of 2,000–3,000 mg per day recommended for older adults, those with liver disease, chronic alcohol use, malnutrition, or interacting medications, and with careful attention to cumulative intake from combination products to prevent hepatotoxicity [^a2827c78] [^d80883c0] [^ccdb2a53] [^be4aa0f7].

---

The maximum recommended daily dose of Tylenol (acetaminophen) for adults is **4,000 mg per day** [^a2827c78] from all sources (oral, IV, rectal, and combination products) [^93af1f25]. For patients with liver disease, chronic alcohol use, or those at higher risk of hepatotoxicity, **limit the total daily dose to 3,000 mg or less** [^be4aa0f7] [^143bb4fb]. Always count acetaminophen from all medications to avoid unintentional overdose and liver injury [^d80883c0].

---

## Standard maximum daily dose

The standard maximum daily dose of acetaminophen for adults is **4,000 mg per day** [^a2827c78] (4 grams) from all sources, including prescription and over-the-counter medications [^d80883c0].

---

## Recommended dosing regimens

Several dosing regimens are commonly recommended for adults:

| **Regimen** | **Dose** | **Frequency** | **Maximum daily dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Standard oral dosing | 650 mg | Every 4–6 hours | 3,250 mg [^fb4e5238] |
| Alternative oral dosing | 1,000 mg | Every 6 hours | 4,000 mg [^e786539d] |
| Extended-release formulation | 1,300 mg | Every 8 hours | 3,900 mg [^9deafe58] |

---

## Special considerations and adjustments

Certain populations require dose adjustments or enhanced monitoring:

- **Liver disease**: Patients with liver impairment should generally limit acetaminophen intake to 2,000–3,000 mg per day or avoid it altogether, depending on severity [^be4aa0f7] [^143bb4fb].
- **Chronic alcohol use**: Individuals who consume more than three alcoholic beverages per day should limit acetaminophen to 2,000–3,000 mg per day due to increased risk of hepatotoxicity [^notfound].
- **Older adults**: Reduced clearance and increased sensitivity may necessitate lower daily limits, typically around 3,000 mg per day [^notfound].
- **Combination products**: Many prescription and over-the-counter medications contain acetaminophen. Patients must account for total daily intake from all sources to avoid unintentional overdose [^d80883c0].

---

## Risks of exceeding the maximum dose

Exceeding the maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen can lead to **severe liver damage**, including acute liver failure, and may be fatal [^b16ba88d]. Even at therapeutic doses, some individuals may experience elevated liver enzymes, particularly with prolonged use or when combined with other hepatotoxic substances [^6a2d0fc5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines consistently emphasize **adherence to the 4,000 mg per day limit** and recommend using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible [^d80883c0]. Regular monitoring of liver function is advised for patients receiving prolonged or high-dose acetaminophen therapy, particularly in those with underlying liver conditions or other risk factors [^4b18a5d4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard maximum daily dose**: 4,000 mg per day for healthy adults [^a2827c78].
- **High-risk patients**: Limit to 2,000–3,000 mg per day (e.g. liver disease, chronic alcohol use, older adults) [^be4aa0f7] [^143bb4fb].
- **Combination products**: Always account for total daily acetaminophen intake from all sources [^d80883c0].
- **Monitoring**: Regular liver function tests for prolonged or high-dose use [^4b18a5d4].

---

The maximum recommended daily dose of Tylenol for adults is **4,000 mg per day** [^a2827c78], with lower limits for those at increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Adhering to these guidelines and monitoring total intake from all sources is essential to prevent liver injury [^d80883c0].

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse (see WARNINGS).

Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24–72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly (see WARNINGS).

Initial Dosage

Initiating Treatment with TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg are associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions and are not associated with greater efficacy.

The usual adult dosage is:

TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets (codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain.

TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets (codeine 60 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take one tablet every 4 hours as needed for pain.

The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours, based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.

Conversion from Other Opioids to TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets

There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (Tylenol with codeine) [^52bcfde7]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

TYLENOL®with Codeine (acetaminophen and codeine phosphate) tablets are indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain, where treatment with an opioid is appropriate and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

Limitations of Use

Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, with opioids, even at recommended doses (see WARNINGS), reserve TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics]

Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia,
Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated.

### Developing consumer-centered, nonprescription drug labeling a study in acetaminophen [^239085a9]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the U.S., acetaminophen overdose has surpassed viral hepatitis as the leading cause of acute liver failure, and misuse contributes to more than 30,000 hospitalizations annually. Half to two thirds of acetaminophen overdoses are unintentional, suggesting the root cause is likely poor understanding of medication labeling or failure to recognize the consequences of exceeding the recommended maximum daily dosage.

Purpose

Elicit subject feedback about active ingredient and dosing information on over-the-counter (OTC) acetaminophen and elicit feedback on proposed plain-language text and icons.

Methods

Six focus groups, preceded by individual interviews, were conducted in April 2010 among 45 adults in two cities from two clinics and an adult basic education center. The individual interviews evaluated knowledge of OTC pain relievers, attention to product label information and literacy level while the group discussion elicited preference for label messages and icons. Analyses were conducted from April to June 2010.

Results

Forty-four percent read at or below the 6th-grade level. Individual interviews revealed that <50% of participants routinely examine product label information. Only 31% know acetaminophen is in Tylenol®. The groups achieved consensus on a preferred icon for acetaminophen, desired explicit statement of potential liver damage in the warning against simultaneous use of acetaminophen products, and indicated preference for an icon and wording for maximum dose.

Conclusions

With the high prevalence of OTC use, a consumer-centered approach to developing icons and messages to promote awareness and safe use of acetaminophen could benefit consumers.

### Emergency department patient knowledge concerning acetaminophen (paracetamol) in over-the-counter and prescription analgesics [^ed0ad93c]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to evaluate patient knowledge of the acetaminophen (paracetamol) content of commonly used pain medications and the maximum daily recommended dose of acetaminophen.

Methods

A prospective, convenience sample of emergency department patients were enrolled. Data were recorded using a standardised questionnaire over 4 months.

Results

1009 patients were enrolled. 492 patients (49%) did not know if Tylenol contained acetaminophen (paracetamol). The majority (66-90%) of patients did not know if Lortab, Vicodin, Percocet, non-aspirin pain reliever, ibuprofen, Motrin, or Advil contained acetaminophen. 568 patients (56%) reported not knowing the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen and only 71 patients (7%) reported the correct daily dose.

Conclusions

Patient knowledge of the acetaminophen content of commonly used analgesic medications and its maximum recommended daily dose is limited. This may contribute to unintentional repeated supratherapeutic ingestion (RSTI) of acetaminophen, or overdose.

Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse (see WARNINGS). Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.

If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

Discontinuation of TYLENOL®with Codeine

When a patient who has been taking TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets in a physically-dependent patient (see WARNINGS, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

Serotonin Syndrome

Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms and signs of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop.

Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications (see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions).

MAOI Interaction

Inform patients not to take TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets (see WARNINGS, Drug Interactions).

Adrenal Insufficiency

Inform patients that opioids could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms (see WARNINGS).

Important Administration Instructions

Instruct patients how to properly take TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Advise patients not to adjust the dose of TYLENOL®with Codeine without consulting a physician or other healthcare professional.
If patients have been receiving treatment with TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, counsel them on the importance of safely tapering the dose and that abruptly discontinuing the medication could precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication (see WARNINGS).

Maximum Daily Dose of Acetaminophen

Inform patients not to take more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Advise patients to call their healthcare provider if they have taken more than the recommended dose.

Hypotension

Inform patients that TYLENOL®with Codeine may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) (see WARNINGS; Hypotension).

Anaphylaxis

Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in TYLENOL®with Codeine. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction, and if they develop signs of allergy such as a rash or difficulty breathing to stop taking TYLENOL®with Codeine and seek medical attention. (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Acetaminophen for osteoarthritis [^1bcbc556]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is important to consider as NSAIDs have the potential for serious gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicities, and acetaminophen in high dosages (greater than or equal to 2 grams per day), may also have the potential for serious upper gastrointestinal toxicity.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, arthrotec, celecoxib,naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (up to July 2002), and Current Contents (up to March 2002). Reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles were also hand searched.

Selection Criteria

Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in OA were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pain, physical function and global assessment outcomes were reported. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk and the number needed to treat was calculated.

Main Results

Six RCTs and 1689 participants were included in the review. One study compared acetaminophen to placebo, and five compared acetaminophen to NSAIDs. In the placebo-controlled RCT, acetaminophen was shown to be clearly superior to placebo with a similar safety profile. The number needed to treat to achieve an improvement in pain was three. In the comparator-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was less effective overall than NSAIDs in terms of pain reduction and global assessments but both drugs had similar efficacy in terms of improvements in functional status. No significant difference was found between the safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs, although patients taking NSAIDS were more likely to withdraw due to GI events.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The evidence to date suggests that NSAIDs are superior to acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with OA but have not been shown to be superior in improving function. The size of the treatment effect was modest, and the mean trial duration was only six weeks, therefore, additional considerations need to be factored in when making the decision between using acetaminophen or NSAIDs. In OA subjects with moderate-to-severe levels of pain, NSAIDs appear to be more effective than acetaminophen.

2.1 General Dosing Information

Acetaminophen Injection may be given as a single or repeated dose for the treatment of acute pain or fever. No dose adjustment is required when converting between oral acetaminophen and Acetaminophen Injection dosing in adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg and above. Calculated maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is based on all routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral, and rectal) and all products containing acetaminophen. Exceeding the maximum mg/kg daily dose of acetaminophen as described in Tables 1 to 3 may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death. To avoid the risk of overdose, ensure that the total amount of acetaminophen from all routes and from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended dose.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (Tylenol with codeine) [^bdbd2b7b]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Controlled Substance

TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets contain codeine. Codeine in combination with acetaminophen, is a Schedule III controlled substance.

Abuse

TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets contain codeine, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids, including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion (see WARNINGS).

All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.

Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.

Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful, or potentially harmful, consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.

"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care providers. "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.

Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.

TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

### Guidance for healthcare providers on newest guidelines for over-the-counter drug treatment of mild symptoms of COVID-19 [^12dce3e2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

On January 18, 2024, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued their most recent guidelines for over-the-counter drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Specifically, the organization stated that "Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), to help you feel better." In this review we consider the contributions of different types of evidence and conclude that healthcare providers should make individual clinical judgments for each of their patients in the selection of over-the-counter drugs to treat symptoms of COVID-19. This judgment should be based on the entire benefit to risk profile of the patient. It is our belief that the individual healthcare provider knows far more about each of his or her patients than anyone, including expert members of guideline committees. Their astute and judicious individual clinical decision-making for each individual patient based on all these considerations has the potential to do far more good than harm.

2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

2.1 General Dosing Information

OFIRMEV may be given as a single or repeated dose for the treatment of acute pain or fever. No dose adjustment is required when converting between oral acetaminophen and OFIRMEV dosing in adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg and above. Calculated maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is based on all routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral, and rectal) and all products containing acetaminophen. Exceeding the maximum mg/kg daily dose of acetaminophen as described in Tables 1-3 may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death. To avoid the risk of overdose, ensure that the total amount of acetaminophen from all routes and from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended dose.

2.2 Recommended Dosage: Adults and Adolescents

Adults and adolescents weighing 50 kg and over: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 1000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of OFIRMEV of 1000 mg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 4000 mg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

Adults and adolescents weighing under 50 kg: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of OFIRMEV of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (acetaminophen and codeine) [^eeb6291f]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. The usual adult dosage is:

The usual dose of codeine phosphate in children is 0.5 mg/kg.

Doses may be repeated up to every 4 hours.

The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.

It should be kept in mind, however, that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg fail to give commensurate relief of pain but merely prolong analgesia and are associated with an appreciably increased incidence of undesirable side effects. Equivalently high doses in children would have similar effects.

### Clinical practice guideline: opioid prescribing for analgesia after common otolaryngology operations [^079e768f]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Table 17—patient frequently asked questions about opioids provides practical postoperative guidance: pain medication should be taken for severe pain as needed but only if pain is not controlled with nonopioid medication, and if opioids are needed for severe pain, take as prescribed on the medication’s bottle. Dose amounts should follow the instructions on the bottle or ones given by your health care provider. For co-medication, probably yes to using Tylenol, aspirin, or Advil instead or with this medication, but check with your health care provider; some prescribed pain medications combine acetaminophen with opioids, and taking additional acetaminophen with the prescribed combination pain medication could be unsafe. Patients do not need to finish the entire bottle; pain medication should be taken when needed and must be stopped when pain is controlled, and if severe pain is under control, there is no need to finish the bottle. Leftover pills should not be left in the home where someone else can access them, and there are facilities that will take these leftover medications. Medications should never be shared with a family member or anyone else, and if pills are left over patients should check with their health care provider or take them to a facility that will dispose of them safely.

### Relation of health literacy to exceeding the labeled maximum daily dose of acetaminophen [^da6d6df3]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen is a commonly used analgesic/antipyretic; overdoses can lead to liver damage. Little is known about the relationship of health literacy to exceeding the recommended maximum daily dose (4 g).

Methods

Subjects were recruited at 23 U.S. malls in 2011. Health literacy was measured by Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), classified as very low (VLL, score <45); low (LL, 45-60); or adequate (AL, >60). Participants completed a 7-day acetaminophen use diary by daily telephone interview; an exit interview covered demographics, physical/mental health, medical history, medication label reading, and medication-taking knowledge/attitudes. Acetaminophen products were identified from a comprehensive list; subjects were not required to know their medications contained acetaminophen. Seven hundred fifty-six subjects aged ≥18 years had taken acetaminophen in the past 30 days and completed 7 diary days with ≥1 day of acetaminophen use, plus the exit survey. Analysis was conducted in 2012-2014.

Results

VLL were more likely than AL individuals to exceed 4 g on ≥1 day (OR [95% CI]=3.8 [1.5, 9.6]; 4.0 [1.3, 12] after controlling for five REALM score-related factors). On usage days, VLL individuals were also more likely to exceed 4 g (3.3 [1.1, 10], by generalized estimating equations; 2.4 [0.9, 6.6], direct effect after accounting for mediation by other deviations from label recommendations).

Conclusions

VLL individuals exceed the recommended maximum acetaminophen dose more often than AL individuals. Other identified characteristics related to health literacy do not explain this, but it is partly mediated by increased frequency of other label deviations.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^b3cd0db1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs. However, experts agreed there is a need for thresholds as benchmarks and suggested including them in the supporting text after the main recommendation statement. Experts also agreed with separating recommendations on dosage into a recommendation applying to patients starting opioids and patients already receiving opioids.

When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8). The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). For example, a label for hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg) and acetaminophen (300 mg) states that the usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every 4–6 hours as needed for pain, and the total daily dosage should not exceed eight tablets. Clinicians should use additional caution when initiating opioids for patients aged ≥65 years and patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of a potentially smaller therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and overdose (see Recommendation 8). Formulations with lower opioid doses (e.g. hydrocodone bitartrate 2.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) are available and can facilitate dosing when additional caution is needed. Product labeling regarding tolerance includes guidance for patients already taking opioids. In addition to opioids, clinicians should consider cumulative dosages of other medications, such as acetaminophen, that are combined with opioids in many formulations and for which decreased clearance of medications might result in accumulation of medications to toxic levels.

### The FDA acetaminophen advisory committee meeting-what is the future of acetaminophen in the United States? The perspective of a committee member [^6b720b5c]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Unintentional acetaminophen toxicity is a common problem throughout the world but particularly in the more developed countries. To deal with the problem, several countries have attempted to decrease the risk of acetaminophen overdose by reducing package sizes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convened a joint meeting recently of three Advisory Committees to consider the issue of unintentional acetaminophen-related toxicity and to explore strategies to address the problem.

Proposals and Recommendations

Three strategies addressed the issue of dose reduction as a way to decrease morbidity and mortality. The FDA proposed a decrease in the maximum daily dose from 4,000 to 3,250 mg, reducing the maximum individual dose from 1,000 to 650 mg and relegating 500 mg tablets to prescription status. The Committees voted in favor of each of those initiatives. Restricting the number of doses that could be purchased by regulating package sizes, as has been done in some European countries, was proposed, but rejected by the Committees. Proposals also addressed the elimination of nonprescription and prescription acetaminophen combination products (e.g., multi-symptom cold relief combinations and acetaminophen/opioid combinations) as a strategy to decrease unintentional poisoning when individuals unknowingly take different products, all of which contain acetaminophen. The Committees rejected the proposal to eliminate the nonprescription combinations but recommended the elimination of prescription combination products. Currently, liquid acetaminophen is available in the United States in three different concentrations. To reduce the confusion associated with the variance in concentrations the Committees voted to have a single concentration for all acetaminophen liquid products. Finally, the Committees voted, almost unanimously, to encourage the FDA to place a boxed warning in the product information to create awareness among prescribers and pharmacists about acetaminophen toxicity and to educate their patients accordingly.

Conclusions

Many of the recommendations were not evidence-based but instead have an anecdotal basis. However, the Committees are advisory to the FDA, their recommendations are not binding and it remains to be seen which of the recommendations will be implemented.

### Codeine phosphate and apap (Acetaminophen and codeine) [^d2a85760]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient.

Codeine Phosphate 15mg to 60mg 360 mg

Acetaminophen 300 mg to 1000 mg 4000 mg

The usual dose of codeine phosphate in children is 0.5 mg/kg.

Doses may be repeated up to every 4 hours.

The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours, based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.

It should be kept in mind, however, that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg fail to give commensurate relief of pain but merely prolong analgesia and are associated with an appreciably increased incidence of undesirable side effects. Equivalently high doses in children would have similar effects.

2.4 Recommended Dosage For Treatment of Fever in Neonates and Infants

Neonates, including premature neonates born at ≥ 32 weeks gestational age, up to 28 days chronological age: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 12.5 mg/kg every 6 hours, to a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 50 mg/kg per day, with a minimum dosing interval of 6 hours.

Infants 29 days to 2 years of age: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours, to a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 60 mg/kg per day, with a minimum dosing interval of 6 hours.

2.5 Instructions for Intravenous Administration

For adult and adolescent patients weighing ≥ 50 kg requiring 1000 mg doses of OFIRMEV, administer the dose by inserting a vented intravenous set through the septum of the 100 mL vial or a non-vented intravenous set through the administration spike port of the 100 mL bag. OFIRMEV may be administered without further dilution. Examine the container contents before dose preparation or administering. DO NOT USE if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Administer the contents of the container intravenously over 15 minutes. Use aseptic technique when preparing OFIRMEV for intravenous infusion. Do not add other medications to the OFIRMEV vial or infusion device.

### A randomized controlled trial comparing acetaminophen plus ibuprofen versus acetaminophen plus codeine plus caffeine after outpatient general surgery [^1c8b90f7]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Narcotics are used extensively in outpatient general surgery but are often poorly tolerated with variable efficacy. Acetaminophen combined with NSAIDs is a possible alternative. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of acetaminophen, codeine, and caffeine (Tylenol No. 3) with acetaminophen and ibuprofen for management of pain after outpatient general surgery procedures.

Study Design

A double-blind randomized controlled trial was performed in patients undergoing outpatient inguinal/umbilical/ventral hernia repair or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomized to receive acetaminophen plus codeine plus caffeine (Tylenol No. 3) or acetaminophen plus ibuprofen (AcIBU) 4 times daily for 7 days or until pain-free. Pain intensity, measured four times daily by visual analogue scale, was the primary outcome. Secondary end points included incidence of side effects, patient satisfaction, number of days until patient was pain-free, and use of alternative analgesia.

Results

One hundred forty-six patients were randomized (74 Tylenol No. 3 and 72 AcIBU), and 139 (95%) patients completed the study. No significant differences in mean or maximum daily visual analogue scale scores were identified between the 2 groups, except on postoperative day 2, when pain was improved in AcIBU patients (p = 0.025). During the entire week, mean visual analogue scale score was modestly lower in AcIBU patients (p = 0.018). More patients in the AcIBU group, compared with Tylenol No. 3, were satisfied with their analgesia (83% versus 64%, respectively; p = 0.02). There were more side effects with Tylenol No. 3 (57% versus 41%, p = 0.045), and the discontinuation rate was also higher in Tylenol No. 3-treated patients (11% versus 3%, p = 0.044).

Conclusions

When compared with Tylenol No. 3, AcIBU was not an inferior analgesic and was associated with fewer side effects and higher patient satisfaction. AcIBU is an effective, low-cost, and safe alternative to codeine-based narcotic analgesia for outpatient general surgery procedures.

### Aminotransferase elevations in healthy adults receiving 4 grams of acetaminophen daily: a randomized controlled trial [^6a2d0fc5]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

During a clinical trial of a novel hydrocodone/acetaminophen combination, a high incidence of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations was observed.

Objective

To characterize the incidence and magnitude of ALT elevations in healthy participants receiving 4 g of acetaminophen daily, either alone or in combination with selected opioids, as compared with participants treated with placebo.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-treatment, parallel-group, inpatient, diet-controlled (meals provided), longitudinal study of 145 healthy adults in 2 US inpatient clinical pharmacology units.

Intervention

Each participant received either placebo (n = 39), 1 of 3 acetaminophen/opioid combinations (n = 80), or acetaminophen alone (n = 26). Each active treatment included 4 g of acetaminophen daily, the maximum recommended daily dosage. The intended treatment duration was 14 days. Main Outcomes Serum liver chemistries and trough acetaminophen concentrations measured daily through 8 days, and at 1- or 2-day intervals thereafter.

Results

None of the 39 participants assigned to placebo had a maximum ALT of more than 3 times the upper limit of normal. In contrast, the incidence of maximum ALT of more than 3 times the upper limits of normal was 31% to 44% in the 4 treatment groups receiving acetaminophen, including those participants treated with acetaminophen alone. Compared with placebo, treatment with acetaminophen was associated with a markedly higher median maximum ALT (ratio of medians, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-4.09; P<.001). Trough acetaminophen concentrations did not exceed therapeutic limits in any participant and, after active treatment was discontinued, often decreased to undetectable levels before ALT elevations resolved.

Conclusions

Initiation of recurrent daily intake of 4 g of acetaminophen in healthy adults is associated with ALT elevations and concomitant treatment with opioids does not seem to increase this effect. History of acetaminophen ingestion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of serum aminotransferase elevations, even in the absence of measurable serum acetaminophen concentrations.

### What dose of paracetamol for older people? [^f33fa884]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Paracetamol, on its own or in combination with other analgesics, is widely used to treat pain associated with acute and chronic conditions. It is considered safe enough to have a general sales licence (GSL) for use by "adults, elderly and children over 16 years" and has few listed cautions or contraindications.1,2 However, recently the effectiveness and safety of paracetamol for some conditions have been challenged, 3,4 and there are published case reports of liver failure associated with therapeutic doses.5-9 Here, we review the use of paracetamol, its pharmacokinetics, the mechanisms by which it can cause liver damage and consider whether frail older people are at greater risk of adverse effects. We also discuss if dose reduction should be considered in some circumstances.

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^2d9dfe68]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The maximum single dose of paracetamol for pain or fever treatment is 1 g every 4–6 hours as needed, up to a recommended maximum daily dose of 4 g. It is well established that paracetamol is clinically effective under the recommended daily dose and has a well-tolerable safety profile.Paracetamol-related adverse events are rare in healthy adults receiving a daily dose of ≤4  g/day.Thus, several guidelines recommend paracetamol as an optimal option for mild-to-moderate pain conditions, such as headache and migraine attacks, postoperative pain and chronic osteoarthritis for limited duration of treatment (however, with some discrepancies here, according to guidelines).

Interestingly, the analgesic effect of paracetamol has a distinct dose-response, according to experimental models and consumers’ experience.The French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) recommended initiating paracetamol with the minimum dose. In a recent focus review, studies comparing the analgesic response to higher (1 g) and lower (500–650 mg) doses of paracetamol were retrieved and summarized. Both direct and indirect comparisons demonstrated analgesic superiority of higher single dose compared to lower single doses, highlighting that a higher single dose of paracetamol for a short duration (4–5 days) poses more benefit than lower single doses.This observation is consistent with the successful experimental demonstration in healthy volunteers of a lack of acetaminophen ceiling effect on R-III nociceptive flexion reflex.In terms of safety, a Cochrane review concluded that the rate of adverse events was similar between the higher and lower single doses of paracetamol.This was in line with another clinical trial showing similar rates of treatment-related adverse events between the higher and lower single doses of paracetamol.

### Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic acetaminophen administration in patients without risk factors [^d0b8240b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature regarding the potential of acetaminophen to cause toxicity in adult patients without risk factors, when used chronically in daily doses < or = 4 g.

Data Sources

Key tertiary literature was reviewed, along with searches of MEDLINE (1966-July 2001). International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2001), and PREMEDLINE (July Week 5, 2001). Key search terms included acetaminophen, paracetamol, toxic hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, liver dysfunction, overdose, drug toxicity, and poisoning.

Data Synthesis

Most tertiary references state that the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is 4 g. Patients taking more than this amount, especially those with certain risk factors, are more likely to develop toxicity. However, a few patients may develop toxicity regardless of risk. An evaluation of the literature regarding the toxic potential of acetaminophen when given at doses < or = 4 g/d chronically (> or = 4 d) to adult patients without risk factors was conducted.

Conclusions

Acetaminophen should be used cautiously on a chronic basis because several case reports show that it may be hepatotoxic at therapeutic doses.

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen injection (Combogesic iv) [^042c601b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

• Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

• Do not exceed the maximum total daily dose of COMBOGESIC IV (4,000 mg acetaminophen and 1,200 mg ibuprofen) in 24 hours.

• Do not exceed a total daily dose of 4,000 mg (4 g) acetaminophen from all sources.

• Do not co-administer COMBOGESIC IV with other acetaminophen or ibuprofen containing products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

• Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. If visibly opaque particles, discoloration, or other foreign particulates are observed, do not use.

• Use COMBOGESIC IV in one patient on one occasion only. It contains no antimicrobial preservative. Discard any unused solution.

• Do not mix with diluents or with other medicines.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

For adult patients weighing greater than or equal to 50 kg (actual body weight): The recommended dosage of COMBOGESIC IV is one vial (100 mL; acetaminophen 1,000 mg/ibuprofen 300 mg) administered as a 15-minute infusion every 6 hours, as necessary.

For adult patients weighing less than 50 kg (actual body weight): The recommended dosage is 15 mg/kg acetaminophen and 4.5 mg/kg ibuprofen, administered as a 15-minute infusion every 6 hours, as necessary. This equates to a maximum single dose of 750 mg acetaminophen and 225 mg ibuprofen (discard remaining medicine in vial), and a total daily dose of 3,000 mg (3 g) acetaminophen and 900 mg ibuprofen.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^3fdd4290]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

### National poison center calls before vs after availability of high-dose acetaminophen (paracetamol) tablets in Switzerland [^bb1cc7cb]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is an antipyretic and analgesic drug with a weak anti-inflammatory action. Since its clinical introduction in 1955, acetaminophen has become the most widely used analgesic-antipyreticand accounts for nearly half of all pain medication prescriptions in Switzerland.Worldwide, acetaminophen is widely available via prescription or over the counter (OTC), with the most common formulations being 500-mg and 1000-mg oral tablets. The therapeutic dose for those aged 12 years and older is 1000 mg every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 4000 mg. Among children younger than 12 years, weight-based dosing is recommended (ie, 10-15 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours), with a maximum daily dose of 75 mg/kg.When used within this therapeutic dosage, acetaminophen is considered among the safest pain medications available.As such, it is indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain and/or fever.However, daily doses exceeding the therapeutic maximum can cause hepatoxicity, and severe toxic effects can occur with doses exceeding 10 000 mg in adults or 150 to 200 mg/kg in children.

In many Western countries, acetaminophen poisoning is the leading cause of liver failure,and researchers have identified that prolonged exposure to high daily doses can increase the risk of liver failure and death.Thus, in light of the limited evidence of a clinical benefit for musculoskeletal conditions, headache and migraine, or dental pain,,,, concerns regarding the benefit-risk profile of acetaminophen have been raised.In August 2020, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) released draft guidance on chronic pain management, in which acetaminophen (paracetamol) is no longer recommended because of its unfavorable benefit-risk profile.

Access to high doses of acetaminophen may increase the risk of unintentional poisonings owing to a combination of underestimating the risks and lack of clinical effect in pain management, leading to up-dosing.Several studies have linked OTC acetaminophen availability to higher acetaminophen-related inquiries to poison information centers and acetaminophen-related mortality. As a result, many European countries—including the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden—have implemented pack size restrictions for OTC sales. However, changes in legislations for OTC restrictions have so far only identified modest reductions in mortality and poisonings in some regions, and the association with liver transplantation remains limited.

### Consensus-based recommendations on management of acetaminophen poisoning (...) [^0df73356]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The recommended dose is 50 to 100 g for adults and 25 to 50 g for children. An acetaminophen concentration sample drawn before 4 hours after ingestion cannot be used to risk-stratify patients on the acetaminophen nomogram. A nondetectable concentration at 2 to 4 h after ingestion typically excludes significant ingestion, but consultation with a poison center or toxicologist is recommended. The original Rumack-Matthew nomogram line, derived from patient data, begins at 200 μg/mL at 4 hours after ingestion. 8 The treatment line beginning at 150 μg/mL at 4 hours was derived as 25% lower than the original nomogram. line. 9 A line beginning at 300 μg/mL at 4 hours was derived as 50% greater than the original nomogram line to denote patients and increased risk of developing liver injury. 10 Acetylcysteine should be initiated if a serum or plasma acetaminophen blood concentration drawn 4 to 24 hours after ingestion falls on or above the treatment line.

If the concentration falls on or above the high-risk line, many clinicians would provide an increased dose of acetylcysteine. However, the medical literature is insufficient to allow recommendation of a specific acetylcysteine dose in this circumstance. If indicated, acetylcysteine should be initiated and the route or rate of administration adjusted if the patient develops adverse events, such as vomiting or an anaphylactoid reaction. When a 150-mg/kg loading dose is used, it should be infused over at least 1 hour. ALT indicates alanine transaminase; AST, aspartate transaminase; FDA, US Food and Drug Administration; IV, intravenous; INR, international normalized ratio; NAC, acetylcysteine; PT, prothrombin time. Objective To develop consensus guidelines for the management of acetaminophen poisoning in the US and Canada. Evidence Review. Acetylcysteine is administered orally or intravenously.

The initial dose should be administered as soon as the need for treatment becomes evident. More than 15 different regimens were identified, but the comparative effectiveness of these regimens has not been evaluated. 11 The panel recommended use of a regimen that delivers at least 300 mg/kg orally or intravenously during the first 20 to 24 hours of treatment.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Oxycodone and acetaminophen) [^d1572a25]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse (see WARNINGS).

Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly (see WARNINGS).

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets (see WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression ; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients/Caregivers).

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient (see WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants).

Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose .

Initial Dosage

Initiating Treatment with Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets 

The usual adult dosage is one tablet every 6 hours as needed for pain. The total daily dose of acetaminophen should not exceed 4 grams.

Conversion from Oxycodone and Acetaminophen to Extended-Release Oxycodone 

The relative bioavailability of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets or oral solution compared to extended-release oxycodone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release oxycodone must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression.

Hand, hip, and knee osteoarthritis—acetaminophen—is conditionally recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA. Effect sizes in clinical trials are very small and meta-analysis has suggested monotherapy may be ineffective, and longer-term treatment is no better than placebo for most individuals. For those with limited pharmacologic options due to intolerance of or contraindications to NSAIDs, acetaminophen may be appropriate for short-term and episodic use, and regular monitoring for hepatotoxicity is required for patients who receive acetaminophen on a regular basis, particularly at the recommended maximum dosage of 3 g daily in divided doses.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^a615767a]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) for pain management—APAP, also known as paracetamol, is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent whose analgesic and antipyretic actions appear limited to the central nervous system and, for this reason, APAP is ineffective as an anti-inflammatory; research suggests that APAP may also act as a cannabinoid system modulator. The most commonly reported side effect is GI discomfort, and the most common severe effects are hepatotoxicity from significant overdose with hepatocellular damage and death; toxicity from a single administration <150 mg/kg for adults or 200 mg/kg for children is rare, and care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and other patients with hepatic dysfunction where the maximum safe daily dose may not be known. APAP has the advantage of being lightweight and low bulk, is available in PO, PR, and IV formulations, and multiple studies comparing IV against PO and PR administrations have found clinical equipoise.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen [^5ff9d944]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opiods and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opiod doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets for patients in who, lower doses are insufficiently effective and in who, the expected benefits of using a higher dose opiod clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

### Aminotransferase activities in healthy subjects receiving three-day dosing of 4, 6, or 8 grams per day of acetaminophen [^9ea9afbb]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

This multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study has a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design with three dosing regimens. Healthy subjects received repeated doses of acetaminophen (4 then 6 g/d or 4 then 8 g/d) or placebo.

Methods

The disposition of acetaminophen and its metabolites and the tolerability of increased acetaminophen doses over 3 days of continuous consumption were characterized. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities measured throughout the study were consistent across the acetaminophen 4, 6, and 8 g/d dose levels and with placebo.

Results

Serum aminotransferase activities did not exceed the upper limit of the reference range (ULRR), except for one subject with an AST of 43 U/L (ULRR, 42 U/L), which was not considered clinically significant. All doses were generally well tolerated.

Conclusions

In a multiple-dose pharmacokinetics study of 4, 6, and 8 g/d of acetaminophen for 3 days, multiple aminotransferase determinations demonstrated no clinically important elevations at 1, 1.5, or 2 times the maximum recommended acetaminophen dose.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets [see WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers].

### Acetaminophen as a renoprotective adjunctive treatment in patients with severe and moderately severe falciparum malaria: a randomized, controlled, open-label trial [^962d5817]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Studies of acetaminophen in uncomplicated malaria lacking PK–PD analyses have questioned its antipyretic efficacy and suggested deceleration in parasite clearance. PK–PD analysis in the current study shows a dose-dependent effect of acetaminophen on fever clearance time, whereas acetaminophen concentrations were not associated with parasite clearance rates in these artemisinin-sensitive infections. Studies that evaluated acetaminophen in uncomplicated malaria have not reported serious adverse events or hepatotoxicity attributable to acetaminophen. The current study shows that administering the maximum recommended daily dosage of acetaminophen results in a moderate increase in aminotransferases, but no patient met criteria for Hy’s law for hepatotoxicity. The maximum peak acetaminophen concentration of 31.6 mg/L observed in our study is well below the acute toxicity threshold of 150 mg/L used in guidelines as indication for N-acetylcysteine treatment. PK dosing simulations showed that 6-hourly dosing of 1500 mg (6 g/day) achieved therapeutic steady-state acetaminophen concentrations between 10 and 20 mg/L in this patient population, but this exceeds the maximum recommended daily dosage of acetaminophen in adults (4 g/day). The conventional 6-hourly dose of 1000 mg used in this trial yielded a simulated average steady-state concentration of 9.21 mg/L and median AUC 0-72h of 644 mg × h × L -1 (Supplementary Figure 12). Comparing this cumulative exposure to that generated from the PK–PD model suggests that this conventional regimen has an important renoprotective effect (Table 3).

### The effect of acetaminophen (four grams a day for three consecutive days) on hepatic tests in alcoholic patients – a multicenter randomized study [^9da5a18b]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic failure has been associated with reported therapeutic use of acetaminophen by alcoholic patients. The highest risk period for alcoholic patients is immediately after discontinuation of alcohol intake. This period exhibits the largest increase in CYP2E1 induction and lowest glutathione levels. Our hypothesis was that common liver tests would be unaffected by administration of the maximum recommended daily dosage of acetaminophen for 3 consecutive days to newly-abstinent alcoholic subjects.

Methods

Adult alcoholic subjects entering two alcohol detoxification centers were enrolled in a prospective double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were randomized to acetaminophen, 4 g/day, or placebo for 3 consecutive days. The study had 95% probability of detecting a 15 IU/L difference in serum ALT.

Results

A total of 443 subjects were enrolled: 308 (258 completed) received acetaminophen and 135 subjects (114 completed) received placebo. Study groups did not differ in demographics, alcohol consumption, nutritional status or baseline laboratory assessments. The peak mean ALT activity was 57 ± 45 IU/L and 55 ± 48 IU/L in the acetaminophen and placebo groups, respectively. Subgroup analyses for subjects presenting with an elevated ALT, subjects fulfilling a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis and subjects attaining a peak ALT greater than 200 IU/L showed no statistical difference between the acetaminophen and control groups. The one participant developing an increased international normalized ratio was in the placebo group.

Conclusion

Alcoholic patients treated with the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen for 3 consecutive days did not develop increases in serum transaminase or other measures of liver injury. Treatment of pain or fever for 3 days with acetaminophen appears safe in newly-abstinent alcoholic patients, such as those presenting for acute medical care.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)—adult and pediatric dosing and analgesic ceiling—Studies of multiple NSAIDs have suggested an analgesic ceiling at submaximal doses—for example, 400 mg PO for ibuprofen. The recommended analgesic dose of ibuprofen is 200–400 mg as needed every 6 h PO for adults or 5–10 mg/kg for children, and in short-term applications an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/day or less has been shown to lead to no further adverse GI effects than placebo in otherwise healthy patients. For naproxen, recommended analgesic dosing is generally a 550 mg loading dose, followed by 250 mg every 12 h PO for adults, and 5 mg/kg every 12 h for children (maximum 10 mg/kg/d). Meloxicam is another PO NSAID notable for austere use in that its recommended analgesic dosing for adults is 7.5–15 mg PO as needed only once daily. Ketorolac is an NSAID that is available PO and in a parenteral form, given IV or IM; doses for adults are 15 mg IV or 30 mg IM every 6 h.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate [^21fd6a44]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings].

### An integrated safety analysis of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen (maxigesic / combogesic) in adults [^cc043ee1]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

APAP and IBP are two analgesic compounds with a long history of use, and both are considered safe and well tolerated at maximum recommended OTC daily doses. The major safety risks of APAP (hepatic injury) and IBP (gastric bleeding and thromboembolic) are largely related to dose. Using a combination addresses these risks by providing superior analgesia without transgressing daily OTC dose limits. Combinations containing APAP and IBP are beneficial as there is less opportunity for drug interactions due to their distinct metabolic pathways.–,–Providing an FDC without an opioid also limits the risk of overdosing, as patients attempt to increase their opioid intake due to tolerance and dependence.

Clinical safety data obtained from clinical trials with both the FDC 325/97.5 and the FDC 500/150 demonstrate the safety and tolerability of an FDC of APAP and IBP at or below maximum OTC daily doses of 4,000 mg, and in the case of IBP, well below maximum daily dose of 2,400 mg. This is supported by safety data from a variety of FDC formulations reported previously, including a large meta-analysis of the literature.–,–,When taken at full doses, the cumulative daily consumption of APAP and IBP from the FDC 325/97.5 is 97.5% of that from the FDC 500/150. This permitted the pooling of data for the analysis of safety. Among a pooled safety population of 922 patients, 521 AEs were reported. Data from these 922 subjects demonstrated that the superior analgesic efficacy obtained by combining APAP and IBP did not come at the expense of safety or tolerability. During the double-blind period (24–48 hours), treatment with the FDC did not increase the incidence of AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, or the proportion of subjects experiencing at least one AE relative to either monotherapy group or placebo. There was no increase in the percentage of AEs deemed possibly or probably related to the study medication. The FDC did not differ in the percentage of AEs rated as severe. The incidence of common AEs was also unchanged. The FDC did not alter the rates of GI AEs or postoperative bleeding compared with either monotherapy or placebo. There were also no appreciable changes to hemoglobin and liver biochemistry levels compared to the APAP monotherapy during the open-label phase of one study (AFT-MX-6E). The additional analgesia provided by the FDC does not come at the cost of a reduction in tolerability.The FDC provides a well tolerated and effective means of analgesia for mild–moderate pain, which can be used as an alternative or adjunct to opioid use post surgery.

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets (see WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression ; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients/Caregivers).

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient (see WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, and Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants).

Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose .

Analgesics—pain management in chronic pelvic pain in men allows that clinicians may prescribe pharmacologic pain management agents (e.g., urinary analgesics, acetaminophen, non-opioid medications) after counseling on risks and benefits. There are no controlled studies of common pharmacologic pain agents for use in CP/CPPS, and currently there is no method to predict which drug is most likely to alleviate pain in a given male chronic pelvic pain patient. The starting dose should always be the smallest available and titration should occur at frequent intervals based on pain scores and side effects, and the goal is not necessarily to eliminate pain but to improve QOL and daily functioning. Regarding acetaminophen, it is considered safe at recommended daily adult doses up to 4 g/day, and doses above the recommended doses may lead to hepatotoxicity.

### National poison center calls before vs after availability of high-dose acetaminophen (paracetamol) tablets in Switzerland [^20027f3e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Nevertheless, the wide utilization of 1000-mg acetaminophen in Switzerland is concerning considering the ongoing debate regarding the evidence of effectiveness., A 2011 meta-analysisfound that acetaminophen has a marginal benefit compared with placebo in acute pain, and NICE recently released guidance removing acetaminophen from the list of recommended treatments for chronic pain management because of a lack of effectiveness and increased risk of harm.In addition, it has been shown that acetaminophen users were more likely to remedicate early, thereby suggesting a lack of effectiveness and a potential for unintentional poisoning.

The limited effectiveness of acetaminophen for pain, particularly chronic pain, is important to consider in light of the potential for toxic effects with large quantities reaching supratherapeutic dosages greater than the maximum daily dose of 4000 mg. While this maximum daily dose threshold is debated, with some experts recommending it be reduced to 3250 mg,the evidence of the potential for liver damage above 10 000 mg is clear. In our analysis, among calls with acetaminophen monointoxications and information on the ingested dose, we observed that the 1000-mg tablets were overrepresented among those with exposure exceeding 10 000 mg. While we did not observe differences in deaths or severe outcomes, we note that more than 90% of patients with exposure greater than 10 000 mg received the antidote, thereby minimizing the likelihood of severe negative outcomes.

The ITS analysis revealed a significant increase in the reporting of acetaminophen-related calls to the National Poison Centre within 1 year of the 1000-mg tablet being added to the market. While the total number of calls was small in comparison with the total tablets sold, particularly following 2012, these results suggest that adding a more potent formulation of acetaminophen was associated with increased harm. This result is in line with previous studies showing that reducing the available pack sizes of acetaminophen may lead to sustained reductions in the total number of poisonings. However, while Hawton and colleaguesidentified that pack size restriction legislation in the United Kingdom was associated with a decrease in acetaminophen-related deaths, they did not observe a reduction in liver transplantation registration or transplantation. Moreover, while legislation limiting prescription medications has led to changes in utilization patterns, a study by Bateman et alconcluded that legislations limiting OTC drugs were unlikely to be successful. Thus, given that the 1000-mg acetaminophen tablets are currently only available with a medical prescription, we could expect a greater impact of regulations limiting (or withdrawing) the 1000-mg tablet than in studies analyzing the impact of limiting pack sizes of the 500-mg OTC formulations.

### Guidance on the management of pain in older people [^8788de67]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

This guidance document reviews the epidemiology and management of pain in older people via a literature review of published research. The aim of this document is to inform health professionals in any care setting who work with older adults on best practice for the management of pain and to identify where there are gaps in the evidence that require further research. The assessment of pain in older people has not been covered within this guidance and can be found in a separate document (http://www.britishpainsociety.org/pub_professional.htm#assessmentpop). Substantial differences in the population, methods and definitions used in published research makes it difficult to compare across studies and impossible to determine the definitive prevalence of pain in older people. There are inconsistencies within the literature as to whether or not pain increases or decreases in this age group, and whether this is influenced by gender. There is, however, some evidence that the prevalence of pain is higher within residential care settings. The three most common sites of pain in older people are the back; leg/knee or hip and 'other' joints. In common with the working-age population, the attitudes and beliefs of older people influence all aspects of their pain experience. Stoicism is particularly evident within this cohort of people. Evidence from the literature search suggests that paracetamol should be considered as first-line treatment for the management of both acute and persistent pain, particularly that which is of musculoskeletal origin, due to its demonstrated efficacy and good safety profile. There are few absolute contraindications and relative cautions to prescribing paracetamol. It is, however, important that the maximum daily dose (4 g/24 h) is not exceeded. Non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used with caution in older people after other safer treatments have not provided sufficient pain relief. The lowest dose should be provided, for the shortest duration. For older adults, an NSAID or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor should be co-prescribed with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and the one with the lowest acquisition cost should be chosen. All older people taking NSAIDs should be routinely monitored for gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular side effects, and drug–drug and drug–disease interactions. Opioid therapy may be considered for patients with moderate or severe pain, particularly if the pain is causing functional impairment or is reducing their quality of life. However, this must be individualised and carefully monitored. Opioid side effects including nausea and vomiting should be anticipated and suitable prophylaxis considered. Appropriate laxative therapy, such as the combination of a stool softener and a stimulant laxative, should be prescribed throughout treatment for all older people who are prescribed opioid therapy. Tricyclic antidepressants and anti-epileptic drugs have demonstrated efficacy in several types of neuropathic pain. But, tolerability and adverse effects limit their use in an older population. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections in osteoarthritis of the knee are effective in relieving pain in the short term, with little risk of complications and/or joint damage. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid is effective and free of systemic adverse effects. It should be considered in patients who are intolerant to systemic therapy. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid appears to have a slower onset of action than intra-articular steroids, but the effects seem to last longer. The current evidence for the use of epidural steroid injections in the management of sciatica is conflicting and, until further larger studies become available, no firm recommendations can be made. There is, however, a limited body of evidence to support the use of epidural injections in spinal stenosis. The literature review suggests that assistive devices are widely used and that the ownership of devices increases with age. Such devices enable older people with chronic pain to live in the community. However, they do not necessarily reduce pain and can increase pain if used incorrectly. Increasing activity by way of exercise should be considered. This should involve strengthening, flexibility, endurance and balance, along with a programme of education. Patient preference should be given serious consideration. A number of complementary therapies have been found to have some efficacy among the older population, including acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and massage. Such approaches can affect pain and anxiety and are worth further investigation. Some psychological approaches have been found to be useful for the older population, including guided imagery, biofeedback training and relaxation. There is also some evidence supporting the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) among nursing home populations, but of course these approaches require training and time. There are many areas that require further research, including pharmacological management where approaches are often tested in younger populations and then translated across. Prevalence studies need consistency in terms of age, diagnosis and terminology, and further work needs to be done on evaluating non-pharmacological approaches.
