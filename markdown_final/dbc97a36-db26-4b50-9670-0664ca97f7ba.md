## Question

tremfya - write loading and maintenance dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the loading and maintenance dosing of Tremfya (guselkumab). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and prioritize source hierarchy. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled dosing regimens for each approved indication and confirm the induction-to-maintenance transitions. Next, I will examine pharmacokinetics to rationalize interval choices. After that, I will check special populations, pre-treatment evaluations, and device strengths. Finally, I should consider extended-interval dosing data and synthesize a concise, indication-specific summary while double-checking for any inconsistencies.

> Let me first confirm the drug and my evidence hierarchy: Tremfya is guselkumab, an IL‑23 p19 monoclonal antibody, and the primary source of truth for dosing is the current FDA Prescribing Information and SPL entries, supplemented by pivotal trials for external validation, which I will cross-check as I go to avoid drifting into off-label territory [^11152MBv] [^111hsNHY] [^11394VSB] [^117KCEbF].

> I need to verify the approved indications and the general loading–maintenance framework; Tremfya is approved for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, and moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and each indication follows a defined induction phase followed by maintenance dosing, which I will now detail per label to ensure precision [^11152MBv] [^111hsNHY].

> For plaque psoriasis, hold on, I should confirm the exact weeks and doses: the FDA-labeled regimen is 100 mg SC at Week 0 and Week 4, then every 8 weeks thereafter, which aligns with VOYAGE and ECLIPSE trial protocols used to establish efficacy and long-term safety, so the loading is Weeks 0 and 4 with maintenance q8w starting Week 12 in practice [^111hsNHY] [^11394VSB] [^117SVsUq] [^11189GVG].

> For psoriatic arthritis, let me double-check that the dosing mirrors psoriasis and whether combination with csDMARDs is permitted: the label confirms 100 mg SC at Week 0 and Week 4, then every 8 weeks thereafter, and it may be used alone or with conventional DMARDs such as methotrexate, which I should note explicitly for co-therapy planning [^111hsNHY] [^117KCEbF].

> For ulcerative colitis, wait, let me verify induction route and maintenance options: the labeled induction is 200 mg IV over at least 1 hour at Weeks 0, 4, and 8; maintenance can be either 100 mg SC at Week 16 and q8w thereafter or 200 mg SC at Week 12 and q4w thereafter, with a recommendation to use the lowest effective recommended dosage to maintain therapeutic response, which I should emphasize for dose optimization discussions [^111hsNHY] [^112bThVR] [^114q8XZd].

> For Crohn's disease, I need to check both IV and SC induction pathways and their corresponding maintenance schedules so I don't conflate the sequences: per label and SPL summaries, an IV induction of 200 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 can be followed by either 100 mg SC at Week 16 and q8w thereafter or 200 mg SC at Week 12 and q4w thereafter; alternatively, an SC induction of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 is followed by 200 mg SC q4w from Week 12, which I will cross-reference against the Crohn's trials summary to ensure internal consistency [^111hsNHY] [^112bnYV1] [^113JEFN8] [^115mffAs].

> I should now rationalize why the maintenance intervals differ using pharmacokinetics; the mean half-life is approximately 15–18 days, SC 100 mg achieves a Cmax around 8 mcg/mL by about 5.5 days with roughly 49% bioavailability, IV induction to Week 8 reaches mean peaks around 68–70 mcg/mL in UC/CD, and SC 400 mg induction in CD reaches a mean peak around 28 mcg/mL, with overall similar total induction exposure between IV and SC pathways in CD, which supports q8w or q4w maintenance strategies tailored to disease severity and response [^112CfULG].

> Next, I should review special populations and drug–drug interactions pragmatically; no dose adjustments are recommended for older adults, weight-related PK changes do not necessitate dose changes, and no specific renal or hepatic impairment trials exist; concomitant NSAIDs, oral corticosteroids, and conventional DMARDs such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and 6‑mercaptopurine did not alter guselkumab clearance in population PK analyses, which simplifies co-management decisions [^116TXmDc].

> Before initiating therapy, I need to ensure required evaluations and immunizations are addressed; evaluate for TB prior to initiation, and for UC or CD obtain baseline liver enzymes and bilirubin; complete age-appropriate vaccinations per guidelines prior to starting therapy, and keep this sequence explicit to avoid pre-treatment omissions [^111hsNHY].

> Let me confirm device strengths and availability to operationalize the labeled regimens; subcutaneous products are available as 100 mg/mL and 200 mg/2 mL pens and prefilled syringes, and the intravenous induction is supplied as 200 mg/20 mL single-dose vials, which aligns with the need for 200 mg IV induction doses and supports SC 100 mg and 200 mg maintenance options in IBD [^113Rgwcc] [^113aB9BE] [^114RZVCC].

> I will now examine safety reminders and monitoring with a quick self-check for major warnings; key labeled safety topics include hypersensitivity reactions, infections including TB, and hepatotoxicity, with long-term pooled psoriasis safety data through 100 weeks and up to 5 years supporting a favorable and stable safety profile compared with placebo and active controls, though ongoing vigilance for serious infections and malignancy remains prudent [^117DCjws] [^117SVsUq] [^111nmpyw] [^111eSaru].

> But wait, what about extended-interval maintenance in "super responders" with psoriasis; the GUIDE trial demonstrated that in patients achieving early complete clearance (PASI 0 at Weeks 20 and 28), dosing every 16 weeks was noninferior to every 8 weeks for maintaining PASI < 3 at Week 68, albeit with slightly lower rates of PASI 0 and PASI ≤ 1 on the q16w regimen, which suggests de-escalation may be feasible in selected patients while recognizing that this extension beyond q8w is not the labeled psoriasis regimen and should be contextualized as evidence-based but off-label [^116N1ybU] [^116yGoJ7] [^114WkzJs] [^1138SRbL] [^112Zv4Pz] [^116pzC6h] [^114insvt].

> Let me synthesize the indication-specific dosing while I double-check sequence timing; for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: 100 mg SC at Weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks thereafter; for ulcerative colitis: 200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8, then either 100 mg SC at Week 16 and q8w thereafter or 200 mg SC at Week 12 and q4w thereafter; for Crohn's disease: either 200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by 100 mg SC at Week 16 and q8w thereafter or 200 mg SC at Week 12 and q4w thereafter, or 400 mg SC at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by 200 mg SC q4w from Week 12, which I confirm is consistent with the labeled options and clinical trial designs [^111hsNHY] [^112bThVR] [^112bnYV1] [^113JEFN8] [^115mffAs].

> Hmm, wait a minute, in an earlier synthesis I almost summarized Crohn's maintenance as "100 mg SC q8w or 200 mg SC q4w, or 200 mg SC q4w depending on induction route", which is redundant; hold on, I should verify and correct this to be precise: after IV induction, either 100 mg SC q8w starting Week 16 or 200 mg SC q4w starting Week 12, while after SC 400 mg induction the recommended maintenance is 200 mg SC q4w starting Week 12, which removes the duplication and matches the label and trial schema [^111hsNHY] [^112bnYV1] [^113JEFN8].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical guardrails are explicit: screen for TB, update immunizations, obtain baseline LFTs and bilirubin for IBD, train patients if self-administering SC doses, and use the lowest effective recommended maintenance dose in UC to sustain response while minimizing exposure, which ties the dosing plan to safe implementation in routine care [^111hsNHY] [^114RZVCC].

### Tremfya [^116TXmDc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

No apparent differences in clearance were observed in subjects aged 65 years and older compared to those under 65 years, suggesting no dose adjustment is needed for elderly subjects. Clearance and volume of distribution of guselkumab increase as body weight increases; however, clinical trial data indicate that dose adjustment based on body weight is not warranted. No specific trials have been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of guselkumab.

- **Drug interactions**: Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the concomitant use of NSAIDs, oral corticosteroids, and conventional DMARDs such as methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine (AZA), and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) did not affect the clearance of guselkumab.

- **Cytochrome P450 substrates**: The effects of guselkumab on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (metabolized by CYP3A4), warfarin (metabolized by CYP2C9), omeprazole (metabolized by CYP2C19), dextromethorphan (metabolized by CYP2D6), and caffeine (metabolized by CYP1A2) were evaluated in an exploratory study with six to twelve evaluable subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Changes in AUCinf of midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, and caffeine following a single dose of guselkumab were not clinically relevant. For dextromethorphan, changes in AUCinf after guselkumab were not clinically relevant in nine out of ten subjects; however, a 2.9-fold change in AUCinf was observed in one individual [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Immunogenicity**: The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent.

### Safety of guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated through 100 weeks: a pooled analysis from the randomized VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 studies [^117SVsUq]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Long-term evaluation is required to confirm the safety profile of newer biologic agents. This study aims to report on pooled safety data from the ongoing VOYAGE 1 (NCT02207231) and VOYAGE 2 (NCT02207244) trials through 100 weeks of follow-up.

- **Methods**: Patients were randomized to either guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter; placebo at weeks 0, 4, 12 followed by guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 16 and 20 and every 8 weeks thereafter; or adalimumab 80 mg at week 0, 40 mg at week 1, and 40 mg every 2 weeks thereafter. Patients who received adalimumab crossed over to guselkumab at week 52 (VOYAGE 1) and at or after week 28 based on clinical response (VOYAGE 2). Open-label extensions, in which all patients received guselkumab, started at week 52 (VOYAGE 1) and week 76 (VOYAGE 2). Rates of adverse events (AEs) per 100 patient-years (PYs) are presented through 100 weeks of follow-up.

- **Results**: Through week 52, observed rates for guselkumab- and adalimumab-treated patients, respectively, were 262.45 per 100 PYs and 328.28 per 100 PYs for AEs, 6.20 per 100 PYs and 7.77 per 100 PYs for serious AEs (SAEs), 1.22 per 100 PYs and 1.79 per 100 PYs for serious infections (SIs), 0.28 per 100 PYs and 0.40 per 100 PYs for malignancies other than nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), 0.56 per 100 PYs and 0.40 per 100 PYs for NMSCs, and 0.47 per 100 PYs and 0.40 per 100 PYs for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Rates among patients treated with guselkumab through week 52 and week 100, respectively, were 262.45 per 100 PYs and 210.41 per 100 PYs for AEs.

### Tremfya [^112bnYV1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Tremfya was studied in four clinical trials in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (CD1, CD2) and one randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging trial (CD4, NCT03466411), subjects received intravenous Tremfya at weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by one of two recommended subcutaneous Tremfya dosing regimens for a total duration of up to 48 weeks. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (CD3), subjects received subcutaneous Tremfya at weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by one of two recommended subcutaneous Tremfya dosing regimens for a total duration of up to 48 weeks.

- **Trials CD1, CD2, and CD4**: In CD1, CD2, and CD4, 1349 subjects were enrolled. Of these, 649 were randomized to receive intravenous Tremfya 200 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by either subcutaneous Tremfya 100 mg every 8 weeks (with the first dose given at week 16) for up to an additional 32 weeks (from week 16 through week 48) or subcutaneous Tremfya 200 mg every 4 weeks (with the first dose given at week 12) for up to an additional 36 weeks (from week 12 through week 48). Additionally, 211 subjects were randomized to receive a placebo.

- **Side effects**: Through week 12 in CD1, CD2, and CD4, headache (including headache, migraine, and sinus headache) was reported in ≥ 3% of subjects treated with intravenous Tremfya and at a greater rate than placebo (3.4% Tremfya-treated subjects vs. 1.9% placebo-treated subjects). In Tremfya-treated subjects in CD2, one case of active extrapulmonary TB was reported between weeks 12–48.

### Guselkumab versus secukinumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis (ECLIPSE): results from a phase 3, randomised controlled trial [^11189GVG]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Antibodies targeting interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-17A effectively treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The ECLIPSE trial is the first comparator study of an IL-23p19 inhibitor, guselkumab, versus an IL-17A inhibitor, secukinumab. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of clinical response at week 48 for guselkumab versus secukinumab.

- **Methods**: In this phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, comparator-controlled trial conducted at 142 outpatient clinical sites across nine countries (Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and the United States), eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis. These patients were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned with permuted block randomisation using an interactive web response system to receive either guselkumab (100 mg at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks) or secukinumab (300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then every 4 weeks). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in the intention-to-treat population who achieved a 90% reduction or more from baseline of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90 response) at week 48. Major secondary endpoints included the proportions of patients in the guselkumab group and in the secukinumab group who achieved a PASI 75 response at both weeks 12 and 48, a PASI 90 response at week 12, a PASI 75 response at week 12, a PASI 100 response at week 48, an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (cleared) at week 48, and an IGA score of 0 or 1 (minimal) at week 48.

### Tremfya [^113zmoG6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Tremfya (trem fye' ah) (guselkumab) prefilled syringe single-dose: Important

Tremfya comes as a single-dose prefilled syringe containing one 100 mg dose. Each Tremfya prefilled syringe can only be used one time. After one dose, discard the used prefilled syringe, even if there is medicine left in it. Do not reuse your Tremfya prefilled syringe.

If your healthcare provider decides that you or a caregiver may be able to give your injections of Tremfya at home, you should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject Tremfya using the prefilled syringe before attempting to inject. Do not try to inject yourself until you have been shown the proper method by your healthcare provider.

Read these instructions for use before using your Tremfya prefilled syringe and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of discussions with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

The Tremfya prefilled syringe is intended for injection under the skin, not into the muscle or vein. After injection, the needle will retract into the body of the device and lock into place.

### Effectiveness and safety of guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in real-world practice in Korea: A prospective, multicenter, observational, postmarketing surveillance study [^112v8uG1]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

The proportion of patients with an absolute PASI of ≤ 3, ≤ 2, or ≤ 1 increased over time, reaching a maximum of 96.0%, 86.7%, and 59.0%, respectively, at visit 7 in the overall population. A significantly greater proportion of biologic-naïve (vs. biologic-experienced) patients achieved an absolute PASI of ≤ 3 by visits 5–7 (p = 0.001 at visit 7) and absolute PASI of ≤ 2 by visits 6–7 (p = 0.0014 at visit 7). The proportion of patients with a PASI75 response increased after the start of treatment, reaching 98.5% at visit 7. The proportions of patients with PASI90 and PASI100 responses also increased over time, reaching 74.3% and 25.4%, respectively, at visit 7.

- **Responses**: Compared with the biologic-experienced group, a significantly greater proportion of biologic-naïve patients achieved PASI75 (biologic-naïve vs. biologic-experienced, 99.4% vs. 94.9%, p = 0.0141) and PASI90 (78.0% vs. 59.0%, p = 0.0006) responses at visit 7.

The figures illustrate the proportions of patients with absolute PASI scores of ≤ 3, ≤ 2, and ≤ 1 by visit in the overall population and by prior biologic use. The p values reflect differences between the biologic-naïve and biologic-experienced patients. PASI stands for Psoriasis Area and Severity Index.

### Adjusted treatment comparisons between guselkumab and ustekinumab for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: the COMPASS analysis [^111pKr3w]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, no head-to-head RCTs have compared ustekinumab and guselkumab in a combination of biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients. The present study leveraged individual patient data (IPD) from the NAVIGATE and VOYAGE trials to compare guselkumab and ustekinumab indirectly in a combination of biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients. IPD analysis is the gold-standard methodology for comparing treatments in the absence of head-to-head RCTs. The study found that guselkumab was associated with significantly greater achievement of PASI 90, PASI 75, and PASI 100 responses than ustekinumab throughout 40 weeks of treatment, using IPD from the NAVIGATE, VOYAGE 1, and VOYAGE 2 trials.

There was consistency in long-term results among analyses using different data sources. The primary analyses included ustekinumab IPD from NAVIGATE, while sensitivity analyses included IPD for patients treated with ustekinumab in the PHOENIX trials, according to approved labeled dosing (i.e. 45 mg for patients weighing ≤ 100 kg and 90 mg for patients weighing > 100 kg). The primary analyses focused on NAVIGATE, to reduce potential bias, as the timeframe for that study was similar to that for VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 (i.e. it was initiated in 2014). It is reassuring that sensitivity analyses using IPD from the PHOENIX trials, which were initiated in 2005, were consistent with the primary analyses of PASI response rates.

### Guselkumab shows high efficacy and maintenance in the improvement of response until week 48, a real-life study [^114sLuau]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Guselkumab is an IL-23 inhibitor that has been demonstrated to be effective and safe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in clinical trials. However, the data pool relating to the use of guselkumab in real-life settings is still lacking. To evaluate its efficacy and safety in such settings, with a focus on predictors of early clinical response, a single-center prospective study was conducted enrolling patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

The clinical data regarding the drug's efficacy and safety were collected at the initiation of treatment and at all subsequent clinical follow-ups. The primary endpoint was PASI90 and PASI100 response at weeks 12, 24, and 48. Out of the total cohort of 74 patients, 62 (83.8%) reached a 48-week follow-up, 64 (87.8%) reached a 24-week follow-up, and 72 (97.3%) reached a 12-week follow-up.

Treatment with guselkumab reduced the mean PASI from the initial 11 ± 6.3 to 2.5 ± 3.1 at 12 weeks, to 1.2 ± 1.8 at 24 weeks, and to 0.8 ± 1.6 at 48 weeks. At week 12, a PASI90 and PASI100 response was achieved by 44.4% and 23.6% of patients, respectively. After 24 weeks, 63% of patients reported a PASI90 response, while 46.1% achieved PASI100.

- **Impact of previous treatment**: Previous treatment with one or more other biologics did not significantly impact the achievement of PASI90 and PASI100 at any endpoints analyzed. No difference was reported between bio-naïve and non-naïve patients in response to guselkumab. High safety and efficacy were shown in both populations.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: The GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^116N1ybU]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Clinical findings in super responders (SRes) were supported through the assessment of immunologic parameters, including blood and skin biomarkers associated with psoriasis. The cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, together with the keratinocyte-derived antimicrobial peptide BD-2, represent markers of disease activity and clinical response. We showed that IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and BD-2 serum levels were reduced as early as week 4 with guselkumab treatment and remained suppressed to week 68. In turn, lesional skin CD8-positive TRM cells were normalized to nonlesional skin levels by week 28. In line with clinical and patient-reported outcomes, no differences in immunologic parameters were observed between the every 8-week and every 16-week dosing groups at week 68.

Our findings suggest that early skin clearance with guselkumab is accompanied by rapid and sustained suppression of TRM cells in lesional skin, after which an extended dosing interval effectively controlled disease activity in super responders. Importantly, the 16-week dosing interval evaluated in the GUIDE clinical trial corresponds to a duration far greater than 5 half-lives of guselkumab. Although it is currently unknown whether some super responders had higher blood levels of guselkumab throughout the dosing randomization period, our data suggest a link between TRM cells and maintenance of clinical response.

A new Delphi consensus defines disease modification as sustained improvement in the disease course of psoriasis resulting from changes in pathophysiology that minimize the need for treatment. Based on this definition, data from the GUIDE trial suggest the potential…

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: The GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^116yGoJ7]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Super responders (SRes) maintained high rates of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 1 or lower and PASI of 0 response over time and at Week 68, with higher response rates observed with dosing every 8 weeks compared to every 16 weeks. PASI ≤ 1 at Week 68 was achieved by 133 out of 148 patients (89.9%) dosed every 8 weeks, compared to 118 out of 149 patients (79.2%) dosed every 16 weeks (P = 0.01). PASI = 0 at Week 68 was noted in 120 out of 148 patients (81.1%) with 8-week dosing and in 103 out of 149 patients (69.1%) with 16-week dosing (P = 0.02).

Mean PASI and affected Body Surface Area (BSA) percentage improved rapidly from baseline and remained low to Week 68 for both dosing intervals in SRes. SRes also achieved high rates of PASI 75, with 137 out of 148 patients (92.6%) when dosed every 8 weeks, and 140 out of 149 patients (94.0%) when dosed every 16 weeks (P = 0.63), and PASI 90, with 136 out of 148 patients (91.9%) dosed every 8 weeks, and 128 out of 149 patients (85.9%) dosed every 16 weeks (P = 0.10) at Week 68. No statistically significant differences were observed between the dosing intervals regarding these responses. Similarities in PASI responses between dosing groups were also confirmed using individual patient data, supporting the noninferiority of less frequent dosing.

### Guselkumab: A review in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [^113Ppega]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Guselkumab (Tremfya®) is a human immunoglobulin G1 λ (IgG1λ) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that blocks the interleukin-23 (IL-23)-mediated signaling pathway. It is the first in its class to be approved for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in several countries, including the United States and EU.

In the VOYAGE trials, guselkumab was superior to placebo and adalimumab at week 16 regarding the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1 and ≥ 90% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 90 response). The benefits of guselkumab over adalimumab were maintained at week 24. At the time of writing, the beneficial effects of guselkumab treatment in these trials were maintained for up to 2 years.

Inadequate responders to ustekinumab, who were then randomized to guselkumab in the NAVIGATE study, showed better responses than those randomized to ustekinumab between weeks 28–40. They had a significantly greater mean number of visits at which patients had IGA 0/1 and ≥ 2-grade improvement in IGA score, as well as higher proportions of patients achieving PASI 90 and PASI 100 at week 52.

Treatment with guselkumab improved health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) and patient-reported outcomes in all trials and was generally well tolerated. Administered by subcutaneous injection, guselkumab is a useful new option for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

### Absolute psoriasis area and severity index as a valuable marker to determine initial treatment response in psoriasis patients treated with guselkumab in routine clinical care [^115jXKfG]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Guselkumab is an anti-interleukin-23p19 monoclonal antibody approved as a first-line medication in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis and as a second-line treatment in active psoriatic arthritis. In clinical practice, patients who have shown a lack of previous treatment efficacy and/or tolerability are often prescribed guselkumab. These patients generally have less severe psoriasis compared to clinical trial cohorts, reflected in lower Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores.

To evaluate treatment response in a real-world setting, we conducted a multicenter-retrospective chart review in three specialized dermatological centers. Seventy-four patients who received guselkumab treatment were included in the study, and baseline characteristics were described. The mean PASI at baseline was 13.0 (± 6.7). After 12 weeks of treatment, 40 patients could be followed up at the participating centers and efficacy was assessed: 72.5% of these patients achieved an absolute PASI ≤ 5 (55.0% ≤ 3; 42.5% ≤ 2), whereas only 57.5% of patients were able to achieve a delta PASI reduction of at least 75%.

Using the absolute PASI as a treatment goal rather than the response rate revealed that guselkumab was highly effective in this real-world setting. In conclusion, the absolute PASI proved to be a more valuable tool to measure treatment outcomes.

### Real-world safety and effectiveness of guselkumab in patients with psoriasis: A post-marketing surveillance study through up to week 52 in Japan [^114aEizX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin‐23 and inhibits its downstream signaling. Phase 3 studies conducted within and outside Japan reported the safety profile of guselkumab and its superior efficacy over placebo and adalimumab for treating patients with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis. To assess the real‐world safety and effectiveness of guselkumab in Japanese patients with psoriasis, we conducted a multicenter, single‐arm, prospective, post‐marketing surveillance study. Guselkumab was administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4, then every following 8 weeks. The patient observation period was 52 weeks after the initial guselkumab dose or until treatment withdrawal.

- **Safety analysis set**: The safety analysis set consisted of 416 patients, including 310 patients with vulgaris (PsV). There were more men (71.3%, 221/310) than women among the PsV group. The median age among those with PsV was 58 years, the median disease duration was 11.50 years, 50.0% (155/310) had comorbidity, and 41.3% (128/310) had previously been treated with biologic agents. During the observation period, 8.4% (35/416) of patients experienced 49 adverse drug reactions, 2.9% (12/416) experienced 13 serious adverse drug reactions, and 3.4% (14/416) experienced 16 adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.

- **Effectiveness analysis set**: The effectiveness analysis set consisted of 251 patients, including 236 patients with PsV or psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

### A head-to-head comparison of ixekizumab vs. guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 12-week efficacy, safety and speed of response from a randomized, double-blinded trial [^116uPbgS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Patients with psoriasis value the rapid and complete clearance of their skin. No head-to-head studies have focused on the early responses to interleukin-17 vs. -23 inhibitors. This study aimed to compare early and complete skin clearance by the -17A inhibitor ixekizumab vs. the -23p19 inhibitor guselkumab.

- **Methods**: A 24-week, randomized, double-blinded study was conducted, enrolling adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [static Physician's Global Assessment of Disease score of ≥ 3, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ≥ 12, and ≥ 10% body surface area]. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive the approved dose of subcutaneous ixekizumab or guselkumab. The primary endpoint was 100% improvement at week 12. Major secondary endpoints included other levels of improvement at different time points. Comparisons were made using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test with a multiple testing strategy. Nonresponder imputation was used for missing data. After the completion of the study, the final secondary endpoint (100% improvement at 24 weeks) and safety data through week 24 will be reported.

- **Results**: In total, 1027 patients were randomized. The primary endpoint of 100% improvement at week 12 was met [215/520 for ixekizumab (41%); 126/507 for guselkumab (25%); P < 0.001]. All major secondary endpoints measured up to week 12 were fulfilled, including 50% improvement at week 1 and 75% improvement at week 2. Serious adverse event frequency was 3% for each group; no new safety signals were identified.

- **Conclusions**: Ixekizumab was superior to guselkumab for rapidly improving signs and symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis by week 12.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: The GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^114WkzJs]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Following achievement of early and complete clearance of psoriasis, guselkumab dosing at an extended every 16 weeks interval was noninferior to every 8 weeks dosing for maintaining disease control. Patient-reported outcomes and findings for key immunologic parameters support the clinical observations. Data from the GUIDE trial add new insights into the concepts of disease modification and long-term maintenance of efficacy. Future analyses from the GUIDE trial will assess the association between clinical response and biomarker and pharmacokinetic data, and further evaluate maintenance of long-term response after treatment withdrawal.

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab in psoriasis patients who failed ustekinumab and/or anti-interleukin-17 treatment: A real-life 52-week retrospective study [^114MxwKB]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Recent major research advancements have significantly expanded our understanding of psoriasis pathophysiology, resulting in the development of highly effective, targeted therapies. Guselkumab is the first interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitor approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis, providing a new therapeutical option for this condition. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of guselkumab in psoriatic patients who previously failed anti-IL-12/23 and/or anti-IL-17 treatment.

A 52-week single-center retrospective study was conducted, enrolling moderate-to-severe patients attending our Psoriasis Care Center from October 2018 to May 2020. The study population included 13 patients; 46.1% had been previously treated with ustekinumab, while 69.2% had previously failed an anti-IL-17 treatment (38.5% secukinumab, 30.8% ixekizumab, and 38.5% both). At baseline, the mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index was 13.2 ± 6.8, reducing to 0.5 ± 0.7 at week 52 (p < 0.001). Body surface area reduced from 22.3 ± 10.5 (baseline) to 0.8 ± 1.1 at week 52 (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found between patients previously treated with anti-IL-12/23 compared to anti-IL-17 or both. Only one patient discontinued guselkumab at week 36 due to secondary inefficacy.

This is a single institution study with a relatively small sample size. Our real-life data confirm trial results, showing guselkumab as a safe and effective option in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, even in those who previously failed ustekinumab and/or anti-IL-17 treatment.

Effect of Period on Achievement of PASI 100

The effect of the period (42-day intervals) on the achievement of first 100% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 100) was studied in relation to the cumulative benefit for Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores of 0 or 1, regardless of the drug used. The focus was on days from randomization to first achieved PASI 100 compared to cumulative days with a DLQI score of 0 or 1 over the 24-week study. Data are presented as the least squares mean for normalized area-under-the-curve measurements, with 100% representing the maximum area for each measure, multiplied by the 168-day study duration. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals, with significance levels of # P < 0.05 vs. 85–126 days; † P < 0.01 vs. 127–184 days; ‡ P < 0.001 vs. no PASI 100. P-values were calculated using analysis after adjustment for baseline scores and pooled sites.

Safety

Similar proportions of patients reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between the treatment groups: 62% (323 of 519) for ixekizumab and 57% (286 of 506) for guselkumab. Most infections were mild to moderate in severity, and serious adverse events were reported by 3% of patients in each group. Discontinuation due to adverse events was similar between the ixekizumab and guselkumab groups (3% and 2%, respectively). No deaths occurred during the study. The most common TEAE was upper respiratory tract infection, affecting 8% of patients in each group. In total, six opportunistic infections were reported: mucocutaneous candidiasis (three in the ixekizumab arm) and herpes zoster.

Patients with psoriasis highly value rapid and complete skin clearance. However, no head-to-head studies have focused on early responses to interleukin (IL)-17 versus IL-23 inhibitors.

- **Objectives**: To compare early and complete skin clearance by the IL-17A inhibitor ixekizumab versus the IL-23p19 inhibitor guselkumab.

- **Methods**: IXORA-R, a 24-week, randomized, double-blinded study, enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [static Physician's Global Assessment of Disease (sPGA) score of ≥ 3, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12, and ≥ 10% body surface area]. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive the approved dose of subcutaneous ixekizumab or guselkumab. The primary endpoint was 100% improvement in PASI (PASI 100) at week 12. Major secondary endpoints included other levels of improved PASI and sPGA at different time points. Comparisons were made using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with a multiple testing strategy. Nonresponder imputation was used for missing data. After the completion of the study, the final secondary endpoint (PASI 100 at 24 weeks) and safety data through week 24 will be reported.

- **Results**: In total, 1027 patients were randomized. The primary end point PASI 100 at week 12 was met [215/520 ixekizumab (41%); 126/507 guselkumab (25%); P < 0.001]. All major secondary endpoints measured up to week 12 were met, including PASI 50 at week 1 and PASI 75 at week 2. Serious adverse event frequency was 3% for each group; no new safety signals were identified.

- **Conclusions**: Ixekizumab was superior to guselkumab for rapidly improving signs and symptoms of plaque psoriasis, demonstrating greater efficacy in achieving early and complete skin clearance.

### Guselkumab dosing interval optimization in adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis switching from ustekinumab [^1156SoQj]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Psoriasis (PSO) is an inflammatory disease that results from a dysregulation of the interleukin 23 (IL23)/Th17 axis. There are several biologic alternatives to treat PSO, administered monthly, every two months, and every three months. Guselkumab (GUS) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks IL-23 by binding to its p19 subunit. There is limited evidence on the dose optimization of GUS in psoriatic patients.

This retrospective, observational case series review includes patients with moderate-to-severe PSO who switched from ustekinumab to GUS, administered as standard dosing or every 12 weeks, in the context of daily clinical practice in dermatology units. Clinical and demographic data from patients were collected from February 2019 to October 2021. Analyses were conducted "as observed" using GraphPad Prism version 8.3.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA, www.graphpad.com).

A total of 30 patients participated in this study: 20 received GUS as standard of care (SC), and 10 received an optimized dosing (Q12W), which is GUS every 12 weeks without induction. The Q12W group demonstrated a greater percentage of comorbidities and was less refractory to previous biologic treatments. After receiving GUS as SC or Q12W, the psoriasis area severity index and dermatology life quality index improved significantly in both groups up to 52 weeks. Survival rates were 87.2% for the SC and 100% for the Q12W, with no safety signals reported. Our case series of 10 patients receiving GUS every 12 weeks without induction indicated good effectiveness and safety profiles, accompanied by excellent patient outcomes.

### Adjusted treatment comparisons between guselkumab and ustekinumab for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: The COMPASS analysis [^115tvR1M]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Guselkumab is an interleukin‐23 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis in adults. It has demonstrated additional benefits in patients with an early inadequate response to ustekinumab. However, long‐term efficacy comparisons of guselkumab and ustekinumab are currently lacking among ustekinumab‐naive patients.

The objective of this study is to assess the relative efficacy of guselkumab compared to ustekinumab for the maintenance therapy of moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis. This assessment uses individual patient data from randomized controlled trials.

Methods involved pooling data for guselkumab from trials 1 and 2 and comparing this with data for ustekinumab from the trial. Multivariable logistic regression analyses compared guselkumab 100 mg with ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg for the achievement and maintenance of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90, 75, and 100 responses up to 40 weeks. The regression models accounted for a range of clinically relevant covariates such as age, sex, and psoriasis duration. Relative efficacy was expressed using odds ratios and predicted probability of treatment response associated with each intervention.

The results indicated that patients receiving guselkumab had significantly higher probabilities of achieving a PASI 90 response than those receiving ustekinumab, at both week 16 [70.4% vs. 46.0%, odds ratio 2.79, 95% confidence interval 2.22–3.45] and week 40 [74.2% vs. 54.5%, odds ratio 2.40, 95% confidence interval 1.89–3.13]. Guselkumab was also associated with a significantly increased likelihood of achieving both PASI 75 and PASI 100 responses at weeks 16 and 40, compared with ustekinumab.

In conclusion, adjusted analyses demonstrate that guselkumab provides superior efficacy over ustekinumab in terms of achieving and maintaining significant PASI responses in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

### A head-to-head comparison of ixekizumab vs. guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 24-week efficacy and safety results from a randomized, double-blinded trial [^1143zKWN]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

The study provides a cumulative benefit analysis of ixekizumab (IXE) vs. guselkumab (GUS) for both clinical and patient‐reported outcomes. It examines cumulative days of response over a 24‐week period for 100% and ≥ 90% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) of 0 or 1, and itch numerical rating scale (NRS) score of 0 for IXE vs. GUS treatments. Data are presented as the least squares mean for normalized area‐under‐the‐curve measurements, with 100% representing the maximum area for each measure, multiplied by the 168‐day study duration. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. ✱✱✱ p < 0.001, ✱✱ p < 0.01, ✱ p < 0.05 vs. GUS. P-values were calculated using analysis after adjusting for baseline scores and pooled sites.

To explore the benefit of achieving PASI 100 early vs. late in the study, the 24‐week study was divided into four time periods. The treatment groups were combined, and cumulative days of DLQI of 0 or 1 were evaluated. Patients who first achieved PASI 100 during days 1–42 had significantly more days at DLQI of 0 or 1 compared to those achieving it between days 85–126 (111.1 vs. 95.5 days; P = 0.045). Patients who first achieved PASI 100 between study days 127 and 184 had fewer days at DLQI of 0 or 1, and those who did not achieve PASI 100 during the 24‐week study had the fewest days (84.8 days and 51.0 days, respectively). Achieving a PASI 100 response earlier was associated with more days at DLQI of 0 or 1, regardless of treatment.

### Guselkumab shows high efficacy and maintenance in the improvement of response until week 48, a real-life study [^111WV1Aj]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Guselkumab is an IL-23 inhibitor that has been demonstrated to be effective and safe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in clinical trials. However, the data pool relating to the use of guselkumab in a real-life setting is still lacking. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in such a setting, and to focus on predictors of early clinical response, a single-center prospective study was conducted. This study enrolled patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

The clinical data concerning the efficacy and safety of the drug were acquired at the initiation of treatment and during all subsequent clinical follow-ups. The primary endpoint was the PASI90 and PASI100 response at weeks 12, 24, and 48. Out of the total cohort of 74 patients, 62 (83.8%) reached a 48-week follow-up, 64 (87.8%) reached a 24-week follow-up, and 72 (97.3%) completed a 12-week follow-up.

Treatment with guselkumab reduced the mean PASI from the initial 11 ± 6.3 to 2.5 ± 3.1 at 12 weeks, to 1.2 ± 1.8 at 24 weeks, and to 0.8 ± 1.6 at 48 weeks. At week 12, a PASI 90 and PASI 100 response was achieved by 44.4% and 23.6% of patients, respectively. After 24 weeks, 63% of patients reported a PASI 90 response, while 46.1% achieved PASI 100. Previous treatment with one or more other biologics did not significantly impact the achievement of PASI 90 and 100 at any endpoint analyzed. No difference was observed between bio-naïve and non-naïve patients in response to guselkumab. High safety and efficacy were demonstrated in both populations.

### Adjusted treatment comparisons between guselkumab and ustekinumab for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: the COMPASS analysis [^115SUK7c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

The NAVIGATE study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT), provides data regarding the relative efficacy of guselkumab compared with ustekinumab in patients who were inadequate responders to ustekinumab [i.e. an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥ 2 after 16 weeks of treatment]. The VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 trials included patients with or without prior biologic therapy (i.e. 21.6% and 20.4% of patients had prior biologic treatment in VOYAGE 1 and 2, respectively). However, there are no head-to-head RCTs comparing guselkumab and ustekinumab in a broader patient population not previously treated with ustekinumab.

The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of guselkumab versus ustekinumab in a mix of ustekinumab-naive and ustekinumab-experienced patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, using individual patient data (IPD) from pivotal guselkumab RCTs (i.e. VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2) and ustekinumab RCTs (i.e. NAVIGATE, PHOENIX 1, and PHOENIX 2).

### Safety of guselkumab treatment for up to 5 years in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis: pooled analyses across seven clinical trials with more than 8600 patient-years of exposure [^111nmpyw]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Guselkumab has demonstrated favourable safety and efficacy across individual clinical studies in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the safety of guselkumab in patients with psoriasis using pooled data from seven phase II/III studies (X-PLORE, VOYAGE 1, VOYAGE 2, NAVIGATE, ORION, ECLIPSE, Japan registration).

- **Methods**: All studies, except NAVIGATE and ECLIPSE (active comparator-controlled only), included a 16-week placebo-controlled period. X-PLORE, VOYAGE 1, and VOYAGE 2 included both placebo and active controls. In most studies, guselkumab-treated patients received 100-mg subcutaneous injections at week 0, week 4, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Safety data were summarized for the placebo-controlled period (weeks 0–16) and through the end of the reporting period (up to 5 years). Incidence rates of key safety events were integrated post hoc, adjusted for the duration of follow-up, and reported per 100 patient-years (PY).

- **Results**: During the placebo-controlled period, 544 patients received placebo (165 PY) and 1220 received guselkumab (378 PY). Through the end of the reporting period, 2891 guselkumab-treated patients contributed 8662 PY of follow-up. During the placebo-controlled period, in the guselkumab and placebo groups, respectively, rates of adverse events (AEs) were 346/100 PY and 341/100 PY, and infections were 95.9/100 PY and 83.6/100 PY. Rates of serious AEs (6.3/100 PY vs. 6.7/100 PY), AEs leading to discontinuation (5.0/100 PY vs. 9.7/100 PY), serious infections (1.1/100 PY vs. 1.2/100 PY), malignancy were observed.

### Guselkumab shows high efficacy and maintenance in the improvement of response until week 48, a real-life study [^113hcZiB]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

The tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)–interleukin 23 (IL‐23)‐IL17 axis forms the basis of the pathophysiology of psoriasis. Anti‐IL‐23 drugs, the most recently introduced group, act upstream of the inflammatory cascade, where this interleukin stimulates and maintains the activation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells. The products of these cells (IL‐17 and IL‐22) create a feedforward mechanism.

Guselkumab is the first biologic drug available that specifically inhibits IL‐23 downstream intercellular signaling by binding to its p19 subunit. It is approved for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy. The safety and efficacy of guselkumab were demonstrated by two randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled, comparator‐controlled, phase III clinical trials: VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2. The NAVIGATE study demonstrated the efficacy of guselkumab in patients who had inadequately responded to ustekinumab.

Real‐life studies are useful in everyday practice as they deal with more complex patients compared to clinical trials, characterized by multiple comorbidities, multiple therapies, and previous failures of biotechnological treatments.

Following a single 100 mg subcutaneous injection in healthy subjects, guselkumab reached a mean (± SD) maximum serum concentration of 8.09 ± 3.68 mcg/mL by approximately 5.5 days post-dose. The absolute bioavailability of guselkumab following a single 100 mg subcutaneous injection was estimated to be approximately 49% in healthy subjects.

- **Absorption**: Following the recommended intravenous induction dose regimen of Tremfya 200 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, mean (± SD) peak serum guselkumab concentration at week 8 was 68.3 ± 17.3 mcg/mL in subjects with ulcerative colitis. In subjects with Crohn's disease, the mean (± SD) peak serum guselkumab concentration at week 8 was 70.5 ± 24.5 mcg/mL. With the recommended subcutaneous induction dose regimen of Tremfya 400 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, the mean (± SD) peak serum guselkumab concentration was estimated to be 27.7 ± 9.1 mcg/mL in subjects with Crohn's disease. The total systemic exposure (AUC) after the recommended induction dose regimen was similar following subcutaneous and intravenous induction.

- **Distribution**: In subjects with plaque psoriasis, the apparent volume of distribution was 13.5 L. In subjects with ulcerative colitis, the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state was 10.1 L. For those with Crohn's disease, it was 11.4 L at steady-state.

- **Elimination**: The apparent clearance in subjects with plaque psoriasis was 0.516 L/day. The mean half-life of guselkumab was approximately 15 to 18 days in subjects with plaque psoriasis.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: The GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^115PbGHq]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

The GUIDE study, authored by Kilian Eyerich and colleagues, was published in 2024 in the journal JAMA Dermatology. It focuses on psoriasis. The research question addressed whether 16-week guselkumab dosing is noninferior to 8-week dosing for maintenance therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The study was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 297 patients (95 female, 202 male).

Adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis were included, while key exclusion criteria were previous use of agents targeting IL-23, receipt of systemic immunosuppressants or anakinra within four weeks prior to the first administration, and a positive test for HBV infection. The interventions included 149 patients receiving guselkumab every 16 weeks (100 mg at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 20, followed by 100 mg every 16 weeks between weeks 28–68) and 148 patients receiving guselkumab every 8 weeks (100 mg at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 20, followed by 100 mg every 8 weeks between weeks 28–68).

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome was that the difference did not exceed the non-inferiority margin in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) < 3 at week 68, with results of 91.9% vs. 92.6% (OR 0.92, 90% CI 0.45 to 1.87).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant decrease in PASI ≤ 1 at week 68 (79.2% vs. 89.9%; ARD -10.7, 90% CI -17.5 to -3.8). Significant decrease in PASI of 0 at week 68 (69.1% vs. 81.1%; ARD -12, 90% CI -20.1 to -).

The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Patient‐reported outcome measures such as DLQI, EQ‐5D, and SF‐36 PCS and MCS scores improved throughout the study, indicating an improvement in the signs and symptoms of psoriasis and overall quality of life (QoL) with guselkumab treatment. Additionally, in a small number of patients with active PsA, guselkumab treatment resulted in improvements in joint signs and symptoms at week 16, which were maintained through week 52. Findings from a global phase 2 study of guselkumab also demonstrated improvements in the signs and symptoms associated with PsA, further establishing the efficacy of guselkumab for PsA.

The study was limited by a small sample size and a placebo‐control period of 16 weeks. Although this study was not designed to statistically compare efficacy responses between the guselkumab 50 mg and 100 mg doses, a dose response was generally not observed for most efficacy measures. However, over time, a tendency for higher PASI‐100 and IGA 0 response, the most stringent efficacy criteria indicating complete clearance of psoriasis, was observed in the guselkumab 100 mg group. In patients with scalp psoriasis, which is often resistant to treatment, the guselkumab 100 mg dose consistently showed higher ss‐IGA 0 response rates. This is a particularly important consideration given that new biologics have recently been developed to address the growing demand for treatments that can provide higher levels of improvement and overall QoL of psoriatic patients while maintaining a favorable safety profile.

Overall, guselkumab was generally well‐tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent with previous studies.

Patients and methods

- **Study design**: IXORA‐R was a multicentre, randomized, double‐blinded, parallel‐group, phase IV study with the primary endpoint at 12 weeks and the blinded study continuing to 24 weeks. The study's detailed design is shown in Figure S1 (see Supporting Information). The results reported here were obtained between 9 November 2018 and 15 July 2019 by 124 investigators at 124 sites in the U.S. A. and Canada.

All patients were required to give informed consent for participation in the study. The IXORA‐R protocol was approved by local ethical review boards and was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Two amendments to the protocol are described in File S2 (see Supporting Information).

- **Randomization and masking**: Patients were allocated to treatment by a computer‐generated random sequence and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous injections of ixekizumab or guselkumab at the approved dosing. For ixekizumab, patients received a 160-mg starting dose at week 0 (two 80-mg injections), followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks from weeks 2 to 12. For guselkumab, patients received 100 mg injections at weeks 0, 4, and 12. To maintain blinding, patients on guselkumab received one placebo injection at weeks 0, 2, 6, 8, and 10.

### Guselkumab for the treatment of severe refractory psoriasis in a pediatric patient [^112Ae848]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis have led to the development of a variety of targeted therapies with improved efficacy, ushering in an era where it is possible for most patients to achieve complete or nearly complete clearance with treatment. Anecdotally, when treating psoriasis in adults, most dermatologists are comfortable moving freely from one biologic agent to the next. However, in the pediatric age group, we are typically (and justifiably) more cautious and tend to follow a more traditional therapeutic ladder, first using treatments approved for use in children or those with a longer history of use.

In cases of particularly severe and recalcitrant disease, it may be necessary to move beyond these more widely accepted therapies to achieve results. Although guselkumab was a newer agent compared with other available options, such as IL-17 inhibitors, the rationale for choosing guselkumab in this case was not only its efficacy data but also its similar mechanism to ustekinumab, which is approved for use in the pediatric population. Additionally, guselkumab is generally well tolerated, with infections being the most common type of adverse events, with incidence rates similar to those associated with adalimumab and ustekinumab. Although larger studies are needed to explore the safety and efficacy of guselkumab in pediatric patients, the marked improvement seen in our patient with refractory psoriasis suggests that it may be a promising therapeutic option for this population.

### SPECTREM phase 3b clinical trial results through week 16: Guselkumab efficacy and safety for the treatment of low body surface area, moderate psoriasis with high-impact site involvement [^111NaoJk]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Patients with psoriasis affecting a low percentage of their body surface area (BSA) are underrepresented in clinical studies and may face substantial disease burden if high-impact sites are affected.

- **Objectives**: SPECTREM is a Phase 3b, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating guselkumab efficacy and safety in participants with low BSA (2%-15%), moderate (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] = 3) plaque psoriasis involving ≥ 1 high-impact site (scalp, face, genitals, intertriginous areas).

- **Methods**: Eligible participants were randomized 2:1 to receive guselkumab 100 mg or placebo at Week 0 and Week 4, then every 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants achieving IGA 0/1 (cleared/minimal) at Week 16. Major secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants achieving ≥ 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90), IGA 0, and PASI 100; mean percent improvements from baseline to Week 16 in BSA and PASI; and proportions of participants achieving site-specific IGA or Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1 among those with scalp, facial, genital, or intertriginous site-specific IGA/PGA ≥ 3 at baseline.

- **Results**: Among the 338 (guselkumab, n = 225; placebo, n = 113) randomized participants, mean (SD) baseline BSA was 7.6% (3.7) and PASI was 9.0 (3.8). At Week 16, all primary and major secondary endpoints were met, with guselkumab demonstrating superiority versus placebo (all p < 0.001) in the proportions of participants achieving IGA 0/1 (74.2% vs. 12.4%), IGA 0 (40.4% vs. 3.5%), PASI 90 (52.9% vs. 6.2%), and PASI 100 (32.4%).

The sample size was estimated to have 98% power for testing the superiority of ixekizumab to guselkumab for the PASI 100 outcome at week 12 at a two-sided 5% type I error rate (for details see File S2; see Supporting Information).

- **Efficacy analyses**: For the blinded treatment dosing period, all randomized patients were included according to the treatment to which they were assigned (intent-to-treat population). Safety data up to the week 12 database lock were summarized using the safety population (all randomized patients who received one or more dose of a trial drug) per the assigned treatments.

- **Statistical methods**: For the primary and major secondary endpoints, odds ratios and P-values were obtained using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test stratified by pooled site. Missing data were imputed using a nonresponder imputation method. A multiple testing strategy was implemented for primary and major secondary endpoints to control the overall familywise type I error rate at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Exploratory analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. One interim analysis was planned and executed when all patients completed their week 12 visit or early termination visit. This paper presents the results of this interim analysis and is considered the primary report of the trial. Additional details regarding statistical analyses are in File S2 (see Supporting Information).

- **Safety data**: Safety data on terms related to cerebrocardiovascular events and suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were adjudicated by external clinical event committees (for details see File S2 in the Supporting Information).

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: The GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^1138SRbL]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with unmet needs for tailored treatment and therapy de-escalation strategies. The objective of this study was to evaluate early intervention with and prolonging the dosing interval for guselkumab, a p19 subunit-targeted interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitor, in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

The GUIDE clinical trial is an ongoing phase 3b, randomized, double-blinded trial conducted across 80 centers in Germany and France. It comprises three parts evaluating the impact of early disease intervention, prolonged dosing interval, and maintenance of response following treatment withdrawal among adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In study part 2, reported herein, initial and final patient visits occurred from September 2019 to March 2022.

In part 1 (week [W]0-W28), patients received guselkumab, 100 mg, at W0, W4, W12, and W20. Those achieving a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 0 at both W20 and W28 were termed super responders (SRes). In part 2 (W28-W68), SRes were randomized to guselkumab, 100 mg, every 8 weeks or every 16 weeks, while non-SRes continued open-label guselkumab every 8 weeks.

The primary objective was to demonstrate noninferiority (with a 10% margin) of guselkumab every 16 weeks vs. every 8 weeks dosing among SRes for maintenance of disease control (PASI < 3 at W68). Biomarker substudies assessed immunologic effects in skin and blood.

Overall, 822 patients received guselkumab in part 2 (297 [36.1%] SRes [every 8 weeks].

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: The GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^116pzC6h]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic immune-mediated disease, predominantly characterized by skin plaques. Due to the chronic and often progressive nature of the disease, long-term treatment is necessary, and the timing of targeted intervention plays a crucial role in the patient's response to therapy. Although treatment de-escalation of biologic therapies for psoriasis is commonly applied in daily practice, evidence-based treatment guidelines and algorithms are lacking.

Guselkumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL)-23 and is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It is administered in 100 mg maintenance doses every 8 weeks after two initial doses 4 weeks apart. The ongoing GUIDE clinical trial is the first prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled phase 3b clinical trial to stratify patients with psoriasis based on early and complete skin clearance at two consecutive visits (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] of 0 at both week [W]20 and W28). Patients achieving this response are defined as super responders (SRes). The trial assesses the long-term impact of subsequent treatment de-escalation at both the clinical and immunologic levels.

The primary objective was to demonstrate the noninferiority of extended guselkumab dosing every 16 weeks compared to every 8 weeks in SRes for the maintenance of disease control (PASI < 3) at W68. The GUIDE trial secondary objectives include the evaluation of early intervention with guselkumab on long-term disease outcomes and the clinical response in SRes following various interventions.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: The GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^112Zv4Pz]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

The GUIDE trial, to our knowledge, is the first randomized clinical trial providing evidence that guselkumab-treated patients with early and complete skin clearance can maintain control of psoriasis with an extended dosing interval. We demonstrated that guselkumab dosing every 16 weeks was noninferior to the standard every 8 weeks dosing interval for maintenance of disease control at week 68 in super responders (SRes), meeting the primary endpoint. Of note, disease control in the GUIDE trial was defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) lower than 3, similar to treat-to-target goals proposed by national treatment guidelines.

Further supporting the primary endpoint findings, a high level of response was observed in SRes with no significant differences between every 16 weeks and every 8 weeks guselkumab dosing regarding clinical outcomes such as PASI 90 at week 68, or patient-reported outcomes such as Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 0/1 response over time. For the highest treatment goals, every 8 weeks maintenance dosing appeared to be favorable, with more than 80% of SRes maintaining completely clear skin at week 68 compared to almost 70% of SRes receiving dosing every 16 weeks. A similar difference was observed between dosing groups for PASI of 1 or lower response. Nevertheless, only small differences between the every 8 weeks and dosing every 16 weeks groups for mean PASI (0.1 vs 0.4, respectively) and affected Body Surface Area (BSA) (%; 0.2 vs 0.4, respectively) values were observed at week 68.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: The GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^1161TKu9]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Michielsens et al. identified 19 studies evaluating tapering of biologic therapy in psoriasis. One of these was the large-scale phase 3b OPTIMISE trial, which determined that the treatment interval for secukinumab (an IL-17 inhibitor) could not be extended from every 4 weeks to every 6 weeks without impacting efficacy and overall persistence. Meanwhile, a post hoc exploratory analysis of the phase 3 PSTELLAR clinical trial demonstrated that patients who achieved a Physician's Global Assessment score of 0 after 28 weeks of ustekinumab (an IL-12/23 inhibitor) treatment were able to maintain high levels of clinical response following dosing interval extension up to every 24 weeks. Similarly, in a clinical study of patients who achieved a PASI of 0 after the third administration of guselkumab, extension of the dosing interval did not result in loss of disease control. Together, these results suggest that early response to IL-23 inhibition may be a key determinant of effective disease control with dosing interval extension. However, given the molecular and pathomechanistic differences of approved IL-23 inhibitors, further studies are needed to address this possibility for other agents in this class. These data also suggest that maintenance of efficacy following dose de-escalation may vary across biologic treatment classes as a result of their differential therapeutic impact on pathogenic mechanisms. Specifically, IL-17–producing CD8-positive TRM cells are known to be responsible for the recurrence of psoriasis skin lesions in previously affected areas, and that IL-23, but not IL-17…

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: The GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^114insvt]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

- **Key points**:

	- **Question**: Is guselkumab dosing every 16 weeks noninferior to standard dosing every 8 weeks for maintaining psoriasis disease control, defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index lower than 3 at week 68, in super responders (SRes)?

	- **Findings**: This phase 3b clinical trial randomized 149 guselkumab super responders to guselkumab every 16 weeks and 148 to every 8 weeks at week 28. The study demonstrated noninferiority of the 16-week dosing for maintenance of disease control, successfully meeting the primary endpoint. Clinical effects corresponded with immunologic changes.

	- **Meaning**: The GUIDE randomized clinical trial is the first to show that disease activity in patients with early complete skin clearance may be effectively controlled with an extended guselkumab dosing interval.

### A head-to-head comparison of ixekizumab vs. guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 24-week efficacy and safety results from a randomized, double-blinded trial [^113W3rvR]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The safety data presented here are consistent with those in previously published studies of ixekizumab and guselkumab for the treatment of psoriasis. The frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, and injection-site reactions, and the severity of TEAEs and serious adverse events (AEs) were similar to those in previous clinical trials and consistent with the known safety profile for ixekizumab. Although there was one patient receiving ixekizumab who had a TEAE of Crohn disease, this patient had a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The AE occurred on study day 140, 24 days after the patient's last dose of ixekizumab. Patients on ixekizumab should be monitored for new onset or exacerbation of IBD.

The study was conducted only in the United States and Canada, which may limit the general applicability of these results. Another limitation was the length of the trial. However, the primary objective of this study was to compare the rapidity of skin clearance in patients with psoriasis. Previous studies have established the long-term safety and efficacy of both ixekizumab and guselkumab in patients with psoriasis, with ixekizumab reporting five years of efficacy and safety data. This study also sought to understand this hallmark of ixekizumab by linking clinical responses and patient-reported symptoms with microscopic findings and molecular changes in lesional skin. To that end, analyses are underway from a study addendum in which skin biopsies were obtained from patients to compare the early changes in lesion pathology and gene expression associated with ixekizumab.
