## Question

Evaluate causes of cyanosis in a newborn.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating the causes of cyanosis in a newborn. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining cyanosis and its pathophysiology in neonates. Then, I should categorize the major etiologic groups and prioritize life-threatening causes. Next, I will outline a practical bedside approach, including the hyperoxia test and pulse oximetry nuances. After that, I should review key diagnostic tests and their limitations. Finally, I will consider special populations, including preterm infants and those with darker skin tones, and close with a concise decision algorithm and key takeaways anchored in evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Cyanosis reflects visible bluish discoloration of skin and mucous membranes due to increased deoxygenated hemoglobin, typically at least 3–5 g/dL, and in newborns the threshold can be higher because fetal hemoglobin shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve leftward, masking cyanosis at a given PaO2 compared with adult hemoglobin, which means severe hypoxemia may be present before cyanosis is clinically apparent [^115NmgJs] [^112KCb3G]. Hold on, I should verify the oxygen saturation correlate; visible cyanosis generally corresponds to oxygen saturation around 80–85% in infants with normal hemoglobin, though anemia can obscure cyanosis and polycythemia can accentuate it, so I need to keep hemoglobin level in mind when interpreting color change [^1163cfgz] [^1179zAyD].

> Next, I should categorize the causes into four major groups to structure the differential. Let me think about this carefully: cardiac causes with right-to-left shunting or common mixing, pulmonary causes with impaired oxygenation, hematologic causes with dysfunctional hemoglobin, and neurologic or metabolic causes that affect ventilation or oxygen delivery; I will prioritize cardiac and pulmonary etiologies because they are most common and immediately life-threatening in the newborn period [^116kpvtc] [^111BcH2d]. Wait, let me verify that I'm not overstating frequency; yes, cardiac and respiratory causes dominate neonatal cyanosis, but I should also remember that methemoglobinemia and other hemoglobinopathies, while rare, are classic masqueraders that can delay diagnosis if not considered early [^114c53dZ].

> I will now examine cardiac causes, starting with critical congenital heart disease, because missing these is high risk. Duct-dependent lesions such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, interrupted aortic arch, coarctation of the aorta, and critical aortic stenosis can present with cyanosis when the ductus closes; transposition of the great arteries, tetralogy of Fallot, tricuspid atresia, pulmonary atresia, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, and truncus arteriosus are prototypical cyanotic lesions that often declare themselves in the first days of life as pulmonary vascular resistance falls and right-to-left shunting increases [^116kpvtc] [^11571j9G]. Hold on, I should verify the timing; indeed, many cyanotic CHD cases present in the first week of life as the transitional circulation evolves, which is why early recognition and prostaglandin therapy can be lifesaving while awaiting definitive care [^11571j9G].

> Let me consider pulmonary causes next, since they are frequent and can mimic cardiac disease. Transient tachypnea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia including congenital infections, pneumothorax, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn all impair oxygenation and can produce central cyanosis; PPHN in particular causes labile hypoxemia with differential cyanosis and requires echocardiography to distinguish from structural heart disease and to guide pulmonary vasodilator therapy [^111BcH2d] [^112KCb3G]. I should double-check that PPHN can be primary or secondary to parenchymal lung disease or lung hypoplasia, which affects management priorities such as lung recruitment and surfactant use in secondary PPHN [^112KCb3G].

> Now, hematologic causes are easy to miss, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion. Methemoglobinemia, whether congenital due to cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency or hemoglobin M variants, or acquired from oxidant exposures like nitrates, benzocaine, or dapsone, produces cyanosis that is classically unresponsive to oxygen and may show chocolate-brown blood; pulse oximetry can be misleading because methemoglobin alters light absorption, often yielding a fixed SpO₂ around 85% that does not improve with supplemental oxygen [^114c53dZ] [^113PsoQs]. But wait, what if the methemoglobin level is normal on co-oximetry? Hemoglobin M disease can still cause cyanosis with low pulse oximetry yet normal methemoglobin on standard assays, so I should consider genetic testing for globin variants when the clinical picture fits and other causes are excluded [^1133vZ48] [^113UTzod].

> I should confirm the approach at the bedside so I don't delay stabilization. Immediate priorities are airway, breathing, and circulation with continuous pulse oximetry, preductal and postductal saturations, a focused exam for murmurs, femoral pulses, and signs of respiratory distress, and rapid glucose assessment; if central cyanosis persists with SpO₂ less than about 95% in room air or a pre/postductal gap greater than 3%, I should escalate support and initiate a hyperoxia test while arranging cardiology consultation and echocardiography [^111BcH2d] [^1163cfgz]. Hold on, I should verify the hyperoxia protocol; a rise in PaO₂ above about 150 mmHg in 100% oxygen argues for a pulmonary cause, whereas failure to improve above about 100 mmHg suggests a fixed right-to-left shunt and cardiac etiology, though I must interpret this in the context of ongoing ventilation and hemodynamics [^116kmqXE].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic tests and their limitations so I choose wisely. Arterial blood gas with co-oximetry is essential to document true oxygenation and methemoglobin; chest radiography helps distinguish pulmonary disease; electrocardiography may reveal axis or chamber abnormalities; and echocardiography is the definitive modality to define cardiac anatomy and shunting, with neonatologist-performed echocardiography increasingly used to rapidly differentiate PPHN from structural disease at the bedside [^111BcH2d] [^114KcZmX]. I need to ensure I account for pulse oximetry pitfalls in methemoglobinemia and consider that some hemoglobinopathies can yield falsely reassuring co-oximetry results, prompting targeted genetic testing when suspicion remains high [^114c53dZ] [^1133vZ48].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with preterm infants, because the threshold for cyanosis and the differential shift. Preterm infants have higher fetal hemoglobin and immature lungs, so cyanosis may be masked until hypoxemia is more severe, and PPHN is a prominent cause of cyanosis in this group; surfactant and lung recruitment strategies are key, and I should remember that some fetal hemoglobin variants can cause benign cyanosis that resolves with maturation, so I must correlate with blood gas and, if needed, hemoglobin studies before labeling a cardiac cause [^113PsoQs] [^111Mezd4]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "always start prostaglandin in preterms with cyanosis", but I should correct that; prostaglandin is indicated when a duct-dependent systemic circulation is suspected, not for all preterm cyanosis, so I must anchor that decision to echocardiography and clinical context [^11571j9G].

> I should also address equity and skin tone, because visual assessment of cyanosis is less reliable in darker-skinned neonates. Visual detection of cyanosis is challenging across ethnicities, with the tongue, gums, and lips being the most reliable sites, and pulse oximetry is preferred to mitigate bias; however, oximeters may slightly overestimate saturation in darker skin, so I should interpret borderline values cautiously and integrate pre/postductal differences and clinical status rather than relying on a single measurement [^116uKvKa] [^115wxK7c]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize objective measures; yes, contemporary guidance recommends pulse oximetry screening and structured clinical assessment to reduce missed hypoxemia in all infants, especially those with darker skin tones [^1163cfgz] [^116uKvKa].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm, and I will double-check each branch. If cyanosis improves with oxygen and the hyperoxia test shows a substantial PaO2 rise, I should pursue pulmonary causes; if cyanosis persists despite 100% oxygen and the hyperoxia test is flat, I should prioritize cardiac causes and start prostaglandin if duct-dependent physiology is suspected while arranging urgent echocardiography; if pulse oximetry shows a fixed SpO2 around 85% that does not change with oxygen, I should check methemoglobin and consider hemoglobinopathies; if the infant is preterm or has risk factors for PPHN, I should evaluate for pulmonary hypertension with echocardiography and tailor pulmonary vasodilation and lung recruitment strategies accordingly [^116kpvtc] [^114c53dZ] [^112KCb3G]. I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely on a single diagnosis; persistent unexplained cyanosis warrants broadening the workup to include infection, metabolic disease, and neurologic causes as indicated by the clinical picture [^111BcH2d].

> Key takeaway, and I should confirm this aligns with the evidence: cyanosis in the newborn is never normal and demands a structured, time-sensitive evaluation that distinguishes cardiac, pulmonary, hematologic, and neurologic etiologies; early use of pulse oximetry with pre/postductal measurements, a hyperoxia test when stable, and prompt echocardiography are the cornerstones, while remembering that methemoglobinemia and hemoglobinopathies can masquerade as hypoxemia and that skin tone can confound visual assessment, so objective data and clinical integration are essential to avoid delays in life-saving therapy [^1163cfgz] [^114c53dZ] [^116uKvKa].

Cyanosis in newborns reflects **inadequate oxygenation** or **impaired oxygen delivery**, and the causes are broadly categorized as **cardiac, pulmonary, hematologic, or neurologic/metabolic**. The most common and urgent causes are **congenital heart disease** (especially duct-dependent lesions) [^116kpvtc] and **respiratory distress syndromes** (RDS, TTN, pneumonia, PPHN) [^111BcH2d]. Hematologic causes such as **methemoglobinemia** [^114c53dZ] or hemoglobinopathies [^1133vZ48] are less common but important, particularly when cyanosis is refractory to oxygen. Evaluation should be **rapid and systematic**, using pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas, chest radiography, and echocardiography [^111UAaqz] to distinguish cardiac from pulmonary causes and guide urgent management, including prostaglandin for duct-dependent lesions [^11571j9G] and supportive respiratory care [^111BcH2d].

---

## Physiological basis of cyanosis

Cyanosis results from **increased deoxygenated hemoglobin** (> 3–5 g/dL) in the blood, making the skin and mucous membranes appear blue [^115NmgJs]. In newborns, fetal hemoglobin has a higher oxygen affinity, so cyanosis may appear only when oxygen saturation is significantly lower than in older infants [^113PsoQs].

---

## Classification of neonatal cyanosis

Neonatal cyanosis is classified as **central or peripheral**:

- **Central cyanosis**: Involves the tongue, lips, and mucous membranes; indicates systemic hypoxemia.
- **Peripheral cyanosis**: Involves the extremities; often due to circulatory insufficiency or vasoconstriction [^115NmgJs].

## Etiological categories of neonatal cyanosis

| **Category** | **Common causes** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Cardiac | - Duct-dependent lesions (e.g. hypoplastic left heart syndrome, coarctation of the aorta, interrupted aortic arch) [^116kpvtc] <br/> - Transposition of the great arteries <br/> - Tetralogy of Fallot <br/> - Tricuspid atresia <br/> - Total anomalous pulmonary venous return <br/> - Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [^112KCb3G] | - Central cyanosis <br/> - Poor perfusion <br/> - Murmur <br/> - Differential cyanosis (pre- and post-ductal saturation difference > 3%) [^111UAaqz] |
| Pulmonary | - Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) <br/> - Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) <br/> - Meconium aspiration syndrome <br/> - Pneumonia <br/> - Pneumothorax <br/> - Congenital diaphragmatic hernia <br/> - Airway obstruction (e.g. choanal atresia, Pierre Robin sequence) [^111BcH2d] | - Tachypnea <br/> - Grunting <br/> - Nasal flaring <br/> - Retractions <br/> - Atelectasis or hyperinflation on CXR [^111BcH2d] |
| Hematologic | - Methemoglobinemia (congenital or acquired) [^114c53dZ] <br/> - Hemoglobinopathies (e.g. hemoglobin M) [^1133vZ48] <br/> - Polycythemia [^115NmgJs] | - Cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen <br/> - Chocolate-brown blood <br/> - Normal PaO2 on ABG [^114c53dZ] |
| Neurologic/metabolic | - Central hypoventilation syndromes <br/> - Sepsis <br/> - Metabolic acidosis <br/> - Hypoglycemia <br/> - Maternal sedation | - Lethargy <br/> - Poor tone <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Abnormal blood gas [^111BcH2d] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **systematic approach** is essential:

- **History**: Prenatal care, maternal illnesses, gestational age, mode of delivery, Apgar scores, feeding difficulties, family history of cardiac or hematologic disorders [^111BcH2d].
- **Physical examination**: General appearance, respiratory effort, heart sounds, murmurs, femoral pulses, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation (pre- and post-ductal) [^111UAaqz].
- **Hyperoxia test**: Differentiates cardiac from pulmonary causes. PaO₂ > 150 mmHg in 100% oxygen suggests pulmonary disease; < 100 mmHg suggests cardiac disease [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic investigations

- **Pulse oximetry**: Pre- and post-ductal saturations; a difference > 3% suggests cardiac disease [^111UAaqz].
- **Arterial blood gas (ABG)**: Assesses oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base status [^111BcH2d].
- **Chest radiography**: Evaluates lung disease, cardiac size, and pulmonary vascularity [^111BcH2d].
- **Echocardiography**: Gold standard for diagnosing congenital heart disease [^114DTHsK].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, glucose, electrolytes, methemoglobin levels, hemoglobin electrophoresis [^114c53dZ].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Cardiac causes**: Prostaglandin E1 to maintain ductal patency, supportive care, and surgical intervention [^11571j9G].
- **Pulmonary causes**: Oxygen therapy, CPAP, mechanical ventilation, surfactant, antibiotics, and correction of acid-base disturbances [^111BcH2d].
- **Hematologic causes**: Methylene blue for methemoglobinemia, exchange transfusion for polycythemia [^114c53dZ].
- **Neurologic/metabolic causes**: Treat underlying condition, supportive care, and correction of metabolic disturbances [^111BcH2d].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with the **cause and timeliness of intervention**. Early recognition and management of critical congenital heart disease and respiratory distress syndromes significantly improve outcomes [^111UAaqz]. Delayed diagnosis can lead to significant morbidity and mortality [^116YgBqG].

---

Cyanosis in newborns is a critical sign requiring **prompt evaluation and management**. The causes are diverse, but early identification and targeted therapy — especially for cardiac and pulmonary etiologies — are essential to optimize outcomes [^116kpvtc].

### Congenital methemoglobinemia: a rare cause of cyanosis in the newborn – a case report [^111eUGTd]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Cyanosis is a physical finding that can occur at any age but presents the greatest challenge when it occurs in the newborn. The cause is multiple, and it usually represents an ominous sign, especially when it occurs in association with neonatal sepsis, cyanotic congenital heart disease, and airway abnormalities. Cyanosis caused by abnormal forms of hemoglobin can also be life-threatening, and early recognition is mandatory to prevent unnecessary investigations and delay in management. Abnormal hemoglobin, such as hemoglobin M, is traditionally discovered by electrophoresis, so the newborn screen, which is mandatory in several states, is a useful tool for the diagnosis. Although acquired methemoglobinemia, caused by environmental oxidizing agents, is common, congenital deficiency of the innate reducing enzyme is so rare that only a few cases are documented in the medical literature around the world. We present a neonate with cyanosis as a result of congenital deficiency of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme. This infant was found to be blue at a routine newborn follow-up visit. Sepsis, structural congenital heart disease, prenatal administration, and ingestion of oxidant dyes were excluded as a cause of the cyanosis by history and appropriate tests. Chocolate discoloration of arterial blood provided a clue to the diagnosis. A normal newborn screen and hemoglobin electrophoresis made the diagnosis of hemoglobin M unlikely as the cause of the methemoglobinemia (Hb A 59.4%, A2 1.8%, and F 38.8%). Red blood cell enzyme activity and DNA analysis revealed a homozygous form of the cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme deficiency. He responded very well to daily methylene blue and ascorbic acid administration, and he has normal growth and developmental parameters, although he shows an exaggerated increase in his methemoglobin level with minor oxidant stress such as diarrhea.

Comment: Neonatal hypoxaemia and cyanosis

Subnormal oxygenation of arterial blood can result in cyanosis (from the Greek, kyanos, for blue), a bluish discolouration of the skin or mucous membranes reflecting an increased concentration of deoxygenated haemoglobin (> 3–5 g/dL). Cyanosis is dependent upon the absolute concentration of reduced (deoxygenated) haemoglobin and not the oxygen saturation, thus, infants with polycythaemia are cyanotic at higher arterial saturations than those who are anaemic.

Cyanosis occurs when there is excessive oxygen extraction in the tissues (resulting in peripheral cyanosis) or decreased oxygen saturation of the systemic arterial blood (resulting in central cyanosis). Transient cyanosis of the extremities or perioral region, is a common, non-pathological phenomenon often precipitated by exposure to the cold, while oxygen saturations remain normal.

From a cardiac perspective, cyanosis is a manifestation of right-to-left shunting at any level of the circulation or of common mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood.

Cyanosis can be difficult to detect clinically in newborns, particularly in borderline hypoxaemia, hence the usefulness of pulse oximetry screening for CHD.

The differential diagnosis of cyanosis in the neonate is described in tables 4–6.

Table 4
Peripheral cyanosis: inadequate oxygen supply to extremeties

Table 5
Pulmonary causes of central cyanosis

Table 6
Central cyanosis: cardiac causes (some cardiac conditions can be placed in more than one category)

Comment: Pulmonary causes

This infant was centrally cyanosed. The examination findings and air space shadowing on chest X-ray would be consistent with a pulmonary cause. However, oxygen saturations did not normalise with 100% oxygen, with a contemporaneous arterial blood gas showing a low pO₂ of 6.57 kPa. Additionally, the baby's ability to self-ventilate did not deteriorate, despite worsening signs of respiratory distress and hypoxia. The blood gas pCO₂ was always in the normal range. These factors taken together would make a pulmonary cause much less likely and other pathologies should be considered.

### Exon sequencing of the α-2-globin gene for the differential diagnosis of central cyanosis in newborns: a case report [^113UTzod]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemoglobin M (Hb M) is one of the causes of inherited methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobin (MetHb) refers to the oxidized form of hemoglobin. Hb M caused by a mutation in α-, β-, or γ-globin can lead to spontaneous oxidation of the ferrous ion in the heme and cannot transport or release oxygen in tissues. Hb M disease causes cyanosis that is unresponsive to oxygen therapy. Some variants might need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of central cyanosis in newborns because they cause cyanosis from birth. Hemoglobin variants by a genetic mutation are different from natural MetHb in the absorption spectrum. Then, co-oximetric measurement may be inaccurate in cases of Hb M.

Unlike other types of methemoglobinemia, Hb M disease is a benign disease and does not require any treatment although it reveals a history of lifelong cyanosis. Clinical suspicion and early diagnosis could avoid unnecessary investigations and invasive management for patients and alleviate concern for their family. In this study, we present a male newborn with Hb M Boston and review the literature for Hb M disease since 1961.

### Major heart defects: the diagnostic evaluations of first-year-olds [^115Ufsvv]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, murmur and cyanosis are the most common manifestations of prenatally undetected CHDs. Except for prenatally undiagnosed critical and severe defects, some cases with a persistent arterial ductus required operational solution, and cardiac symptoms were caused by persistent foetal circulation. Cyanotic lesions were diagnosed significantly earlier than defects with heart murmur. The majority of children with major heart defects were diagnosed as neonates. Diagnosis after discharge home occurred in 12% of all major CHDs.

### Systematic review of APGAR scores&cyanosis in black, Asian, and ethnic minority infants [^114Y8ewq]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was performed according to the protocol published on PROSPERO (CRD42022344617). This manuscript considers the neonatal assessments of Apgar score and cyanosis.

Data sources

A comprehensive electronic search was undertaken in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases. Database were searched from inception until 30th April 2022, with the search updated on 31st August 2023. Gray literature such as statutory body reports or consultation exercise reports were also searched for using OpenGrey within the DANS EASY archive. Searches included medical subject headings (MeSH) combined with key text words. These included terms around Apgar score, cyanosis, hypoxia, neonate, and ethnicity. Appendix S1 provides an example full search strategy. Only English language articles were considered.

As well as the above digital searches a group of stakeholders, including healthcare providers, academics, commissioners, and maternity user representatives, were asked via email regarding their awareness of relevant literature for inclusion.

Eligibility criteria and study selection

Two researchers independently screened citations by title and abstract against the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were any qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods study that explored detection of cyanosis or examined associations between Apgar score and an objective measure of neonatal wellbeing included but were not limited to blood gas, intensive care admission, mortality, ongoing development. Studies were included if they compared Black, Asian, or "dark" skinned neonates (less than 4 weeks old) to their White counterparts or those defined as "light" skinned within the included study. Studies undertaken in any country were eligible for inclusion regardless of development as defined by the United Nations Human Development Index. Reviews were not eligible for inclusion per se, however, references of reviews on a related topic were screened for additional primary studies, as were the references of all included studies. Two researchers independently screened all potentially relevant citations at full text. The whole research team discussed disagreements over inclusion.

Critical appraisal

Included studies were critiqued using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. This incorporates two screening questions, followed by five quality criteria relating to the appropriateness of methodology, data collection, and data analysis. These five quality criteria differ for five study design categories: qualitative, quantitative–randomized, non-randomized and descriptive, and mixed methods. Two researchers independently critiqued the included studies, with disagreements discussed with a third researcher until agreement was reached.

QUESTIONS

Q1. When should congenital methemoglobinemia be considered as a possible diagnosis?

Congenital methemoglobinemia should be considered in the following clinical situations:
Known family history of methemoglobinemia.

Typically methemoglobinemia due to NADH‐cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and so there may be no family history unless the patient is from a small community or their parents are fairly closely related. Alpha, beta and gamma globin mutations causing HbM typically exhibit an autosomal dominant inheritance. Nevertheless, many of these cases are due to de novo mutational events, thus showing a non‐dominant inheritance pattern.
Cyanosis in a newborn baby, infant, child, or adult not associated with hypoxemia, cold exposure or other known explanation

MetHb levels should be measured. Levels are typically > 10% if blue discoloration is present. Typically, congenital cases will present at birth in this way, although milder cases may present later in childhood or even adulthood associated with an acute increase in MetHb levels, possibly associated with illness or environmental exposure. Typically, the child is otherwise well (methemoglobinemia, type I) (Table 2) and the cyanosis does not improve with oxygen therapy.
Incidental finding of increased MetHb level.

This occurs most commonly when venous or arterial blood gases are analyzed for some reason, and a high MetHb level is noticed. Usually, the levels are between 3% and 10%, with higher levels likely to cause noticeable cyanosis.
Pulse oximetry showing unexpected or discordant results compared to clinical assessment or other measures of oxygenation

Pulse oximetry screening at birth or before newborns are discharged may reveal subclinical hypoxemia. Methemoglobinemia interferes with the accuracy of pulse oximetry. This is related to MetHb having a modified light absorption pattern, which interferes with the algorithm used to calculate oxygen saturation. For this reason, most pulse oximeters give a fixed reading of about 85% when significant amounts of MetHb are present, which does not change much with varying levels of methemoglobinemia or hypoxia.
Detection of methemoglobinemia by co‐axial pulse oximetry

### A 5-hour-old male neonate with cyanosis [^113zYxw6]. Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methemoglobin (MetHb) is a form of hemoglobin in which heme iron is oxidized and unable to bind oxygen; its normal basal production is counteracted by an efficient MetHb-reduction pathway. The causes of methemoglobinemia are classified as congenital or acquired. Shortly after his birth, the 5-hour-old male Caucasian neonate, whose case we present herein, developed central cyanosis that was unresponsive to supplemental oxygen. Oxygen saturation as determined via pulse oximetry was normal. In contrast, blood gas testing by multiwave CO-oximetry indicated decreased fractional oxyhemoglobin and an elevated MetHb fraction. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with a congenital cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency. This case emphasizes causes of methemoglobinemia and differences among analytical methods used to measure oxygen status when MetHb is present.

### Diagnosis of a rare fetal haemoglobinopathy in the age of next-generation sequencing [^111muBDc]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Neonatal cyanosis resulting from a fetal methaemoglobin variant is rare. Most such variants are only described in a few published case reports. We present the case of a newborn with unexplained persistent cyanosis, ultimately determined to have a γ-chain mutation causing Hb FM-Fort Ripley. This neonatal haemoglobinopathy can be challenging to diagnose, as significant oxygen desaturation may result from barely detectable levels of the mutant haemoglobin and co-oximetry studies may show a falsely normal methaemoglobin level. Our analysis of the infant's haemoglobin included high-performance liquid chromatography, cellulose acetate electrophoresis and citrate agar electrophoresis, which showed trace amounts of a suspected variant. Ultimately, the diagnosis was made through a novel application of next-generation sequencing (NGS). NGS-based diagnostic approaches are becoming increasingly available to clinicians, and our case provides a framework and evidence for the utilisation of such testing paradigms in the diagnosis of a rare cause of neonatal cyanosis.

### The pediatric electrocardiogram part III: congenital heart disease and other cardiac syndromes [^114UkV3T]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Approximately 1% of newborns are affected by congenital heart disease (CHD), and although many lesions of CHD have trivial hemodynamic and clinical implications, some clinically significant lesions are asymptomatic in the immediate newborn period and may present after discharge from the well baby nursery. Because of this, CHD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any ill-appearing newborn, regardless of the presence of cyanosis. In addition, the number of children, adolescents, and adults with surgically repaired or palliated CHD continues to grow within the United States and other developed countries. It is in this population that arrhythmias are particularly prone to develop, and knowledge of the common arrhythmias associated with CHD is mandatory for the acute care provider.

### A rare cause of early neonatal cyanosis: absent right pulmonary artery [^1176nL4R]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Unilateral absent right pulmonary artery is a rare developmental anomaly that usually presents in late childhood and adolescence as recurrent respiratory tract infections, dyspnoea and haemoptysis. We report a case of a 2-day-old baby with respiratory distress and differential cyanosis. Echocardiogram showed pulmonary hypertension with absent right pulmonary artery. The findings were confirmed by CT angiogram. The baby improved with pulmonary vasodilators and antifailure medications.

### Getting to the heart of the matter: epidemiology of cyanotic heart defects [^111T3voE]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common type of birth defect, making significant contributions to infant morbidity and mortality, but not all CHDs contribute equally to such outcomes. Although cyanotic CHDs constitute some of the most serious CHDs, its epidemiology is poorly understood. We present a comprehensive systematic review of the literature on the epidemiology of cyanotic CHD, with emphasis on the most current knowledge on identified risk/etiologic factors. Literature for this review was identified by searching the PubMed database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the US National Library of Medicine as well as bibliographies of identified papers. The 100 reports that contributed to this review describe risk factors such as infant sex, race, and ethnicity, environmental exposures, and maternal and paternal age. Several studies reported differences in prevalence rates by race and ethnicity and elevated sex ratios, and they identified some risk factors, including advanced maternal age. Investigators have made significant progress in the effort to describe the etiology of cyanotic CHDs, but discrepancies, such as the variation in prevalence rates by race and ethnicity and the impact of environmental exposures, still need to be addressed.

### Nucleated red blood cell counts differentiate cardiac from respiratory causes of cyanosis at birth [^114v3G8N]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Tissue hypoxia increases erythropoietin production and release of immature erythrocytes that can be measured using nucleated red blood cell counts (nRBC). We hypothesized that hypoxia due to congenital heart disease (CHD) is chronic and is better tolerated than hypoxia due to respiratory disease (RD), which is an acute stress in newborns leading to higher nRBC. This study assesses the utility of nRBC as a marker to differentiate hypoxia due to CHD vs RD in term neonates. This was a single-center, retrospective study of term neonates with cyanosis from 2015 to 2022. Neonates < 37 weeks of gestation, with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and those with other causes of cyanosis were excluded. The patients were divided into 2 groups: cyanotic CHD and cyanotic RD. Clinical and laboratory data done within 12 h and 24–36 h after birth were collected. Data are represented as median and Interquartile range. Of 189 patients with cyanosis, 80 had CHD and 109 had RD. The absolute nRBC count at ≤ 12 h of age was lower in the CHD (360 cells/mm³) compared to RD group (2340 cells/mm³) despite the CHD group having significantly lower baseline saturations. A value of 1070 cells/mm³ was highly sensitive and specific for differentiating CHD from RD. The positive predictive value for this cut-off value of 1070 cells/mm 3 was 0.94 and the negative predictive value was 0.89. The absolute nRBC is a simple screening test and is available worldwide. A nRBC < 1070 cells/mm³ in cyanotic newborns should hasten the search for CHD etiology with the possible need for prostaglandin therapy.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^112i26xB]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) guideline — scope, definition, and risk stratification are summarized as follows: The guideline has 3 objectives and "recommends the replacement of the term ALTE with a new term, brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)", provides a risk-based evaluation approach, and "provides management recommendations, or key action statements, for lower-risk infants". A BRUE is "defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year when the observer reports a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of ≥ 1 of the following: (1) cyanosis or pallor; (2) absent, decreased, or irregular breathing; (3) marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia); and (4) altered level of responsiveness", and it is diagnosed "only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination". Using this framework, "infants younger than 1 year with a BRUE are categorized either as (1) a lower-risk patient… for whom evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and management are offered or (2) a higher-risk patient… but for whom recommendations are not offered", and "Each key action statement indicates a level of evidence, the benefit-harm relationship, and the strength of recommendation".

Data extraction

Two reviewers undertook data extraction using a pre-defined template to record relevant information. This included; title, author, year of publication, country of origin, study design, methodology (setting, data collection, data analysis), sample size, ethnicity and age of included neonates, study outcomes according to ethnic subgroups, covariates adjusted for within analyses, source of study funding. The method used to classify ethnicity or race within each included study was noted. Where ambiguities were noted authors of the original published report were contacted for clarification.

Data synthesis

A narrative synthesis approachwas utilized, with Apgar score and Cyanosis/Hypoxia considered separately. Consideration was given to neonatal ethnicity within the included studies. Consideration was given to potentially confounding factors including socioeconomic status, education level, and maternal age.

### Exon sequencing of the α-2-globin gene for the differential diagnosis of central cyanosis in newborns: a case report [^116B7kLn]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Hb M disease is a rare blood disorder, but needs to be considered in newborns with cyanosis or low SO₂ on pulse oximetry in the face of normal arterial blood saturation regardless of MetHb value. Early diagnosis helps to avoid unnecessary diagnostic approaches and aggressive interventions because the hemoglobin variants show a good prognosis.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: how to spot serious heart disease in the newborn [^111bkZg6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is common and important as it remains a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and appreciable mortality. Prenatal diagnosis, the presence of a murmur, cyanosis, tachypnoea and/or poor or differential peripheral pulses raise the suspicion of CHD aided by differential pre/postductal saturations. Yet even serious CHD may not be considered when such clues are absent. Nevertheless, there are clinical cues which may alert the clinician to the possibility of a significant CHD which may lead to an early and accurate diagnosis and appropriate intervention to achieve best results. This paper addresses these issues which become especially difficult if caring for infants away from facilities provided by tertiary centres. Tachypnoea on the first postnatal day is generally non-cardiac in origin. Exceptions include large arteriovenous fistulae and/or 'pump' (ventricular) failure. In addition, attention is drawn to two important confounding factors in the newborn, namely the patency of the ductus arteriosus and the initially high pulmonary vascular resistance, both of which alter and may mask the clinical findings of a serious cardiac abnormality. An appreciation of the physiological changes that occur in early infancy will aid the clinician's understanding of CHD as it affects the newborn.

### When pneumonia does not respond to antibiotics: a challenging neonatal diagnosis [^114HL59V]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The frequently non-specific presentation of the unwell neonate provides a challenging diagnostic conundrum. The diagnosis may initially appear quite clear — respiratory distress, raised inflammatory markers and chest X-ray features all apparently suggestive of pneumonia — but all may not be as it seems. As the clinical picture evolves, so does the differential diagnosis, and the clinician must remain open minded, malleable and equipped with a broad knowledge of potential pathologies that may account for a constellation of clinical signs.

In this case, the suspected diagnosis of pneumonia was very plausible — a case made stronger by its relatively common nature. However, the lack of improvement with antibiotic treatment was significant, as was the poor response to 100% oxygen, and recognition of this ensured that timely assistance from a tertiary centre was sought, which was ultimately life-saving.

### HbM methaemoglobinaemia as a rare case of early neonatal benign cyanosis [^116jXtvF]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Early neonatal central cyanosis that is unrelated to cardiopulmonary causes, alerts clinicians to possibility of methaemoglobinaemia. Congenital methaemoglobinaemia due to haemoglobin M is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by lifelong cyanosis. We report a case presentation and review of diagnostic pitfalls of a newborn who presented with central cyanosis; investigations revealed a low methaemoglobin reductase (2.2 IU/g Hb), with normal maternal levels (9.1 IU/g Hb). Therefore, haemoglobinopathy investigations were completed on the mother and her baby, which showed an α-globin variant in both. The maternal α2 globin gene sequencing showed heterozygosity for haemoglobin M Boston (α58 His → Tyr).

### Congenital heart disease [^11571j9G]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Pediatric congenital heart disease comprises a wide spectrum of structural defects. These lesions present in a limited number of ways. An infant presenting with profound shock, cyanosis, or evidence of congestive heart failure should raise the suspicion of congenital heart disease. Although most congenital lesions are diagnosed in utero, the emergency physician must be aware of these cardinal presentations because many patients present in the postnatal period around the time that the ductus arteriosus closes. Aggressive management of cardiopulmonary instability combined with empiric use of prostaglandin E(1) and early pediatric cardiology consultation is essential for positive outcomes.

### Newborn respiratory distress [^111BcH2d]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Newborn respiratory distress presents a diagnostic and management challenge. Newborns with respiratory distress commonly exhibit tachypnea with a respiratory rate of more than 60 respirations per minute. They may present with grunting, retractions, nasal flaring, and cyanosis. Common causes include transient tachypnea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia, sepsis, pneumothorax, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and delayed transition. Congenital heart defects, airway malformations, and inborn errors of metabolism are less common etiologies. Clinicians should be familiar with updated neonatal resuscitation guidelines. Initial evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination. The clinician should monitor vital signs and measure oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry, and blood gas measurement may be considered. Chest radiography is helpful in the diagnosis. Blood cultures, serial complete blood counts, and C-reactive protein measurement are useful for the evaluation of sepsis. Most neonates with respiratory distress can be treated with respiratory support and noninvasive methods. Oxygen can be provided via bag/mask, nasal cannula, oxygen hood, and nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Ventilator support may be used in more severe cases. Surfactant is increasingly used for respiratory distress syndrome. Using the INSURE technique, the newborn is intubated, given surfactant, and quickly extubated to nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Newborns should be screened for critical congenital heart defects via pulse oximetry after 24 hours but before hospital discharge. Neonatology consultation is recommended if the illness exceeds the clinician's expertise and comfort level or when the diagnosis is unclear in a critically ill newborn.

### A review of the current policies and guidance regarding APGAR scoring and the detection of jaundice and cyanosis concerning black, Asian and ethnic minority neonates [^115AhX3T]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The policies for assessing jaundice predominantly rely on skin colour. Some guidance implies that ethnicity may pose a challenge in detecting jaundice. One specific guideline outlined the potential for transcutaneous bilirubinometer assessments to overestimate bilirubin levels in newborns with darker skin colours, although the existing evidence contradicts this.

Cyanosis or hypoxia

The identification of cyanosis and/or hypoxia was performed according to eight guidelines/policies and one training resource.

In cases where an infant is considered at higher risk (e.g. through passage of meconium in utero or prolonged rupture of membranes), the NICE intrapartum guidelines recommend monitoring for central cyanosis and advise "confirming by pulse oximetry if available". Similarly, a sign considered suggestive of congenital heart disease in neonates is "central cyanosis".

When monitoring for respiratory issues, it is recommended to observe "skin colour, pallor, mottling, cyanosis, and any traumatic petechiae around the eyelids, face, and neck". The training resource suggests that an infant displaying a "mottled", "blue", or "pale" colouration may indicate potential respiratory distress. Another guideline highlights " cyanosis " as an abnormal respiratory assessment criterion for a neonate.

One guideline specifically addressed the assessment of cyanosis in neonates. Skin colour assessment was also performed, prompting healthcare professionals to observe for the neonate "appearing pale, ashen, mottled, or blue". None of these guidelines explicitly describe how cyanosis or central cyanosis may manifest across different skin tones, phenotypes, or ethnic characteristics. However, online resources provide more explicit guidance, suggesting that "any change from the established centrally pink colour in a newborn is always abnormal" and that central colour change is most "reliably noted in the lips, gums, and tongue" and can present as "paleness or dusky blue".

Another guideline explicitly emphasised that the recognition of cyanosis should not rely solely on skin colour.

The training resource went one step further, proposing that "skin colour also varies according to genetic determinants and therefore is not a good means of assessing oxygenation". For this reason, they suggested that any baby with a "dusky appearance" should have their pulse oximetry checked.

### Congenital methemoglobinaemia due to Hb F-M-fort ripley in a preterm newborn [^111Mezd4]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Methemoglobinaemia is a rare cause of cyanosis in newborns. Congenital methemoglobinaemias due to M haemoglobin or deficiency of cytochrome b5 reductase are even rarer. We present a case of congenital methemoglobinaemia presenting at birth in a preterm infant. A baby boy born at 29 weeks and 3 days of gestation had persistent central cyanosis immediately after delivery, not attributable to a respiratory or cardiac pathology. Laboratory methemoglobin levels were not diagnostic. Cytochrome b5 reductase levels were normal and a newborn screen was unable to pick up any abnormal variants of fetal haemoglobin. Genetic testing showed a γ globin gene mutation resulting in the M haemoglobin, called Hb F-M-Fort Ripley. The baby had no apparent cyanosis at a corrected gestational age of 42 weeks. Although rare, congenital methaemoglobin aemia should be considered in the differential in a preterm with central cyanosis and investigated with genetic testing for γ globin chain mutations if other laboratory tests are non-conclusive.

### Providing care for infants born at home [^114wDuug]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Assessment, resuscitation, and care of the newborn infant immediately after birth — As recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Heart Association, there should be 2 care providers present at every birth, at least 1 with primary responsibility for the newborn, and of the 2 care providers at least 1 should have training, skills, and equipment to perform full resuscitation in accordance with the Neonatal Resuscitation Program. Temperature, heart rate, skin color, peripheral circulation, respiration, level of consciousness, tone, and activity should be monitored and recorded at least once every 30 minutes until the infant's condition has remained stable for 2 hours. Infants who receive extensive resuscitation (eg, positive-pressure ventilation for more than 30 to 60 seconds) should be transferred to a medical facility for close monitoring and evaluation, and any infant with respiratory distress, continued cyanosis, or other signs of illness should be immediately transferred to a medical facility.

### Exon sequencing of the α-2-globin gene for the differential diagnosis of central cyanosis in newborns: a case report [^1133vZ48]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cyanosis is usually associated with serious conditions requiring urgent treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Hemoglobin M (Hb M) disease is one type of congenital methemoglobinemia characterized by cyanosis. Among these variants, α-globin chain mutations such as Hb M Boston present cyanosis from birth while other variants usually manifest later in life.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a male newborn with cyanosis apparent since birth. Surprisingly, his respiratory and hemodynamic status including normal arterial blood oxygen saturation was stable, but oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry did not increase after 100% supplemental oxygen was started. In addition to routine pulmonary and cardiologic evaluation, further evaluation for dyshemoglobin was conducted; α2-globin gene sequencing showed a single-point variant causing Hb M Boston. Methemoglobin (MetHb) level estimated by co-oximetry was normal. After a 14-day stay in the NICU, the patient remained respiratory and hemodynamically stable without supplemental oxygen except for cyanosis.

Conclusions

Hb M disease is a benign disease and does not require any treatment whereas acquired methemoglobinemia is a potentially fatal condition. Neonatologists should be aware that low oxygenation status on pulse oximetry in the face of normal arterial blood saturation values might indicate the possibility of Hb M disease in early neonatal cyanosis, irrespective of MetHb value.

### A review of the current policies and guidance regarding APGAR scoring and the detection of jaundice and cyanosis concerning black, Asian and ethnic minority neonates [^111jtKhP]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Routine care

General skin colour

Skin colour assessment as a component of routine care was addressed within 11 guidelines and one training resource.

Guidelines propose that an assessment of skin colour within the first few hours of life should be utilised to evaluate the newborn's adaptation to extrauterine life, including for preterm infants. For example, observations should include the following:

Discoloured peripheries and alternative locations

Additional guidelines highlighted that discoloured peripheries could signal a change in the infant's condition, which may warrant closer observation, particularly during skin-to-skin contact.

Colour is a key element in the neonatal early warning trigger and track (NEWTT) chart. In the guidance, a point of concern was defined as an infant who appeared " pale or blue or had an oxygen saturation < 90", while a colour of " pink " or oxygen saturation above 95% was considered normal. According to the updated draft guidance, skin colour components that are "very pale or blue" are considered concerning, while "pink or normal" is not a cause for concern.

Various guidelines recognise that evaluating sufficient infant respiration involves considering multiple components, with skin colouring being just one of them. In addition to assessing skin colour, the NNA/University of Hertfordshire advises assessing infants' mucous membranes. Normal mucous membranes appear pink, while blue mucous membranes are considered abnormal and require action. HEE MIST e-learning states that assessing an infant's oxygenation should not solely rely on their skin colour, and that colour changes in the infant's tongue, gums, or lips as the most reliable indicator of oxygenation.

The Newborn and Infant Physical Examination (NIPE) is conducted "within the first 72 hours " to assess infant wellness. The NIPE screening guideline directs healthcare professionals to monitor neonates' "general tone & central and peripheral colour" during the assessment of potential congenital heart abnormalities, along with observing for any indications of concern, such as:

"Episodes of apnoea lasting longer than 20 seconds or associated with colour change" or "central cyanosis". or "poor colour".

Furthermore, healthcare professionals should ask parents if they have seen any changes in their infant's skin colour when conducting infant screening for heart problems.

Within all the policies for routine neonatal care and skin colour assessment, there is no mention of how ethnicity may impact the assessment of skin colour.

Postnatal care: NICE evidence summary

The review and drafting of recommendations in 2021 were undertaken entirely " afresh". In contrast to the 2006 guideline, which stated, "Healthy babies should have normal colour for their ethnicity", the more recent guidance from 2021 did not specifically address the varied appearance of healthy skin colour in different ethnicities. In the latest review, all studies related to scoring systems for infant illness and indications of serious illness in infants were deemed to be of very low to moderate quality and lacked substantial evidence. Notably, ethnicity was not a focal point in any of the studies presented in either summary.

### Should pulse oximetry be used to screen for congenital heart disease? [^115vFaFD]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2007). Low credibility.

Ten studies (44 969 newborns, 71 severe defects) evaluating the usefulness of neonatal pulse oximetry (PO) screening in timely detection of congenital heart disease (CHD) were reviewed. PO showed a high specificity (99.9–99.99%), and the overall rate of detection of 15 individual defects with PO was 72% (range 46–100%), exceeding that of the clinical examination 58% (9–86%). Similar results were obtained for cyanotic CHD (89% v 69%, respectively). Without PO, discharge of apparently healthy infants with unknown CHD was 5.5 times and 4.1 times more likely in cyanotic CHD and all serious CHD, respectively. The paper describes the technical and practical details of first day and later screening. Diagnosis is reached earliest with first day screening, but it requires more resources. PO screening is not sensitive enough to serve as an independent screen, but along with the clinical examination it helps minimise the morbidity and mortality associated with discharge without diagnosis. Further research is needed for precise delineation of populations that would benefit from PO screening.

### A case series of patients with cor triatriatum dexter: unique cause of neonatal cyanosis [^112wTueJ]. Pediatric Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital heart defect that can lead to cyanosis in a newborn with an otherwise normal exam. The initial evaluation of these patients typically focuses on searching for a pulmonary etiology for arterial desaturation, which often leads to a negative work up. When cardiac evaluation is performed, it may be challenging because the heart lesion can be difficult to visualize on an echocardiogram. The diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and thorough echocardiographic imaging. Once diagnosed, surgical repair can alleviate the shunt created by the defect. This case series describes all patients (3) with cor triatriatum dexter seen at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin from 2000 to 2013.

### COVID-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^114cXoSy]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite increasing evidence demonstrating children have more mild presentations and better outcomes in COVID-19 infections, there is limited documentation of individual cases, especially infants, in the medical literature. Since children appear to most commonly present asymptomatically or mildly symptomatic, they have the potential to serve as undetected vectors of the disease as cities and countries start to loosen restrictions on commerce and socialization. Given the lack of universal testing infrastructure worldwide, the implication therefore may be to focus on opportunities to test these patients whenever possible. With disease modeling estimating continued COVID-19 infection in the years ahead, our case highlights the need for clinicians to consider more subtle presentations in infants such as brief episodes of apnea, cyanosis, and stridor as potential catalysts to prompt testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, caregiver testing, and/or recommending quarantine protocol.

### Exon sequencing of the α-2-globin gene for the differential diagnosis of central cyanosis in newborns: a case report [^112v2X9s]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A male newborn was referred to the neonatal intensive care unit with cyanosis from birth. After applying supplemental oxygen, pre- and postductal saturation was 80%. Tracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation with high inspired oxygen concentration did not improve the low oxygen saturation (SO₂) level. The infant weighed 3400 g and was delivered uneventfully at 38 + 6 weeks from a 32-year-old mother. He did not appear to have any signs of respiratory difficulties except for cyanosis. When SO₂ was 77% according to pulse oximetry, the value of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) on arterial blood gas analysis was 114 mmHg. His complete blood count and C-reactive protein were normal. After ruling out respiratory and cardiac causes based on chest radiographic and echocardiographic studies, further evaluation for hemoglobin derivatives incapable of binding oxygen was conducted. MetHb level estimated by co-oximetry was found to be normal. In addition, hemoglobin electrophoresis at alkaline pH on agarose gel showed normal age profiles with 82.7% Hb F, 17.2% Hb A1, and 0% Hb S. Exon sequencing was conducted for the α-globin chain of hemoglobin because of the cyanosis at birth. We found a c.175C > T point variant of HBA2 exon 2, which causes a change of the 59th amino acid from histidine to tyrosine (Fig. 1 a). This single-point variant causes Hb M Boston. The genetic evaluation of HBA2 in his parents was normal for the above mutation (Fig. 1 b); this appeared to be a de novo mutation. Gene sequencing of erythroid Krüppel-like factor for thalassemia and CYB5R3 for methemoglobinemia types 1 and 2 was negative.

Fig. 1
a The mutation underlying heterozygous hemoglobin M Boston [HBA2 :c.175C > T, p.59His > Tyr] was detected through sequencing only in the proband. b It was not present in his parents. The analysis demonstrated a de novo mutation occurrence

At discharge, the patient remained respiratory and hemodynamically stable without supplemental oxygen except for cyanosis. At 2 years of age, his weight was 16.5 kg and height was 95.5 cm, placing him in the 99th percentile according to national growth charts for children; however, he remained slightly cyanotic at 83% saturation without supplemental oxygen.

### Nitrate / nitrite toxicity: clinical assessment-evaluation… [^113PsoQs]. archive.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Assessment – Evaluation Upon completion of this section, you will be able to
- Describe the clinical assessment of an infant with cyanosis due to overexposure to nitrates and nitrites.
- Describe the signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia. The evaluation of nitrate/nitrite-related health effects most often presents as a clinical evaluation of an infant with cyanosis. Symptomatic methemoglobinemia is generally less common in older children and adults. While systematically working through the differential diagnoses with special emphasis on airway, pulmonary and circulatory causes, appropriate supportive care tailored to the individual patient's clinical status should be provided. The differential diagnosis for cyanosis in an infant includes. 2011]. In addition, the patient is often less ill than one would expect from the severity of cyanosis.

On the other hand, infants with a large proportion of fetal hemoglobin may have severely reduced oxygenation before cyanosis appears clinically. The proportions of each hemoglobin will affect the oxygen saturation at a given PaO2. For example, if an infant has mostly adult hemoglobin and the PaO₂ drops below 50 mmHg, a central cyanosis can appear. If the infant has mostly fetal hemoglobin, a clinical cyanosis may not appear until the PaO₂ drops below 40 mmHg. Therefore, infants with mostly fetal hemoglobin can have severe reductions in oxygenation before cyanosis appears clinically.
- The evaluation of nitrate/nitrite-related health effects most often presents as a clinical evaluation of an infant with cyanosis.
- A central chocolate-brown or slate-gray central cyanosis that does not respond to administration of 100% oxygen is suggestive of methemoglobinemia.
- A patient with methemoglobinemia may appear less ill than what would be expected from the severity of cyanosis, but not always.
- Infants with a large proportion of HbF may have severely reduced oxygenation before cyanosis appears clinically.
- Exposure history for infants should focus on formula preparation and the source of formula dilution water.
- Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are roughly correlated with the percentage of oxidized hemoglobin in the blood.

### Cyanosis… [^111D22aJ]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points Cyanosis can occur as a benign finding or signify a life-threatening event depending on age, location, and associated clinical findings. Cyanosis can be caused by lack of hemoglobin saturation, mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, or abnormalities of hemoglobin. Physical examination findings can rule out or rule in diagnoses but must be performed with appropriate lighting, temperature, and an index of suspicion. Hemoglobin concentration affects appearance of cyanosis; lower hemoglobin requires a lower arterial oxygen saturation for cyanosis to appear. Inversely a higher hemoglobin may present with cyanosis at a higher SaO₂. Echocardiography paired with pulse oximetry screening at 24 hours after birth is useful in determining respiratory versus cardiac cause of cyanosis. If concern for ductal-dependent cyanotic cardiac lesion, prostaglandin infusion is first-line medical management until further evaluation can be performed.

### High risk and low incidence diseases: cyanotic critical congenital heart disease [^116kpvtc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cyanotic critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) is a serious condition associated with high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights key aspects of CCHD, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED), based on current evidence.

Discussion

CCHD encompasses several conditions, including truncus arteriosus, dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA), tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), Ebstein's anomaly, critical pulmonary stenosis, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). These conditions should be considered in critically ill neonates presenting with shock and cyanosis. Evaluation involves a thorough assessment of the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory status. Diagnostic tools include pulse oximetry, laboratory testing, electrocardiogram, chest radiography, and ultrasonography. Management requires prompt recognition and hemodynamic stabilization, which may involve the administration of antibiotics, prostaglandins, vasoactive/inotropic agents, and airway management. Expert consultation and coordination of transfer to a tertiary or quaternary care center are crucial. Surgical repair serves as the definitive treatment.

Conclusion

A thorough understanding of cyanotic congenital heart disease is essential for emergency clinicians to effectively diagnose and manage this potentially life-threatening condition.

### Major heart defects: the diagnostic evaluations of first-year-olds [^116huxBt]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common symptoms in CHD were murmur and cyanosis. Heart murmur is common in healthy and asymptomatic children, but may also indicate a serious heart defect. Newborns with heart murmur are at higher risk, as most asymptomatic newborns with heart murmur have a structural defect. In our study, ventricular septal defect and aortic and pulmonary stenosis were most often manifested by murmur. These defects are usually manifested by systolic murmur in asymptomatic patients. Cyanosis is most often seen in the first weeks of life in children with CHD, when circulation is dependent on the arterial ductus. In our patients, cyanosis was a major sign of critical defects that required repeated surgical corrections. Of well-operable defects, transposition of the great arteries typically manifested by cyanosis, mostly on the first day of life. A murmur and cyanosis were the most important signs of CHD. In this study, newborns with murmur had 5 times higher chance of having acyanotic defects than those without murmur. Children with cyanosis, on the other hand, had (unsurprisingly) 25 times higher chance of having a cyanotic defect than children without cyanosis. Children with leading symptoms other than murmur and cyanosis were 5 times more likely to have acyanotic defects. This is important for more careful examination in children who do not have the most common symptoms of CHD.

### Systematic review of APGAR scores&cyanosis in black, Asian, and ethnic minority infants [^116uKvKa]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and implications

Low Apgar score and neonatal mortality were strongly correlated across all ethnicities, but variations in scoring practices, particularly affecting Black neonates, requires further attention. Additionally, further evaluation is needed to determine how to objectively assess newborn health. Visual detection of cyanosis is challenging, especially in neonates with darker skin, and therefore pulse oximetry is preferred to mitigate the health disadvantages experienced by those from ethnic minorities. However, small but potentially clinically significant differences in pulse oximetry compared to arterial oxygen saturation in neonates with darker skin tones warrants further exploration. Additionally, healthcare provider training gaps impact assessment accuracy. There is an urgent need for the development and robust prospective evaluation of targeted education around assessment in Black, Asian and minority ethnic neonates.

### The newborn examination: part I. emergencies and common abnormalities involving the skin, head, neck, chest, and respiratory and cardiovascular systems [^113mwJWY]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The routine newborn assessment should include an examination for size, macrocephaly or microcephaly, changes in skin color, signs of birth trauma, malformations, evidence of respiratory distress, level of arousal, posture, tone, presence of spontaneous movements, and symmetry of movements. A newborn with one anatomic malformation should be evaluated for associated anomalies. Total and direct bilirubin levels should be measured in newborns with jaundice, and a complete blood count should be obtained in those with pallor or a ruddy complexion. Neurosurgical consultation is necessary in infants with craniosynostosis accompanied by restricted brain growth or hydrocephalus, cephaloceles, or exophytic scalp nodules. Neck masses can be identified by their location and include vascular malformations, abnormal lymphatic tissue, teratomas, and dermoid cysts. Most facial nerve palsies resolve spontaneously. Conjunctivitis is relatively common in newborns. Infants with chest abnormalities may need to be evaluated for Poland's syndrome or Turner's syndrome. Murmurs in the immediate newborn period are usually innocent and represent a transition from fetal to neonatal circulation. Because cyanosis is primarily secondary to respiratory or cardiac causes, affected newborns should be evaluated expeditiously, with the involvement of a cardiologist or neonatologist.

### A review of the current policies and guidance regarding APGAR scoring and the detection of jaundice and cyanosis concerning black, Asian and ethnic minority neonates [^116nh9M9]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the United Kingdom (UK), it is widely recognised that there are ethnic inequalities in maternal and neonatal health and care provision, with women from Black and Asian backgrounds having higher rates of maternal mortality, stillbirth and neonatal mortality than women of white ethnicity.

Health and care guidelines need to be comprehensive and inclusive to standardise practice; however, local settings vary considerably in their existing guidelines and practices. All policies should be formulated to help reduce health inequalities and health disparities and, therefore, should consider the entire population.

Concerns have been raised regarding routine perinatal practices, such as Apgar scores, in which skin colour is a key element of neonatal examination. A much-debated question is whether neonates' colour is assessed appropriately when scoring the Apgar and whether this disadvantages infants with darker skin pigmentation. Guidelines should mitigate these concerns and describe effective and safe means of assessment for all infants. Concerns have also been voiced for other clinical assessments that use skin colour as an element of diagnosis. Moreover, visual inspection of a neonate's skin colour is traditionally used to determine jaundice, which is often subjective and can be inaccurate, with skin pigmentation presenting as a confounding factor. Furthermore, diagnosing poor oxygenation in infants is difficult using visual assessment alone, and the diagnosis varies among clinicians, especially for infants with darker skin tones. Due to the variations and unreliability of these assessments, clear national guidance is needed for healthcare professionals to assess all infants safely.

Textbooks and training have repeatedly been modelled on white skin in the UK and across the globe with little questioning. In a multiethnic society, the competence to recognise clinical symptoms in varied skin tones is crucial for providing holistic care and supporting healthcare professionals in their assessments. Most recently, gaps in healthcare professionals' knowledge of dermatological assessment of different skin colours have been identified due to the limited diversity of educational resources and publications.

The incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the disparities in healthcare provision and supporting technology, with pulse oximeter readings taken in dark-skinned individuals being more likely to yield inaccurate readings. It is argued that aspects of racism in healthcare are structural and therefore embedded in our policies, laws and society. Research to date has not yet determined whether Black, Asian or ethnic minority neonates are accurately described and considered in UK national policy.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^111mPXmi]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) definition — Clinicians should use the term BRUE to describe an event occurring in an infant < 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of ≥ 1 of cyanosis or pallor, absent, decreased, or irregular breathing, marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia), or altered level of responsiveness. Moreover, clinicians should diagnose a BRUE only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.

### Common issues in the care of sick neonates [^116kmqXE]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Newborn infants may be transferred to a special care nursery because of conditions such as prematurity (gestation less than 37 weeks), prolonged resuscitation, respiratory distress, cyanosis, and jaundice, and for evaluation of neonatal sepsis. Newborn infants' core temperature should be kept above 36.4 degrees C (97.5 degrees F). Nutritional requirements are usually 100 to 120 kcal per kg per day to achieve an average weight gain of 150 to 200 g (5 to 7 oz) per week. Standard infant formulas containing 20 kcal per mL and maternal breast milk may be inadequate for premature infants, who require special formulas or fortifiers that provide a higher calorie content (up to 24 kcal per mL). Intravenous fluids should be given when infants are not being fed enterally, such as those with tachypnea greater than 60 breaths per minute. Hypoglycemia can be asymptomatic in large-for-gestational-age infants and infants of mothers who have diabetes. A hyperoxia test can be used to differentiate between pulmonary and cardiac causes of hypoxemia. The potential for neonatal sepsis increases with the presence of risk factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes and maternal colonization with group B streptococcus. Jaundice, especially on the first day of life, should be evaluated and treated. If the infant does not progressively improve in the special care nursery, transfer to a tertiary care unit may be necessary.

### Visual diagnosis: a 7-month-old girl with cyanotic spells [^116DgsSV]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

Infants can develop acquired methemoglobinemia due to intake of well water high in nitrate concentrations. Although methemoglobinemia usually presents with more severe symptoms, this diagnosis should be considered in an infant with intermittent cyanosis in the absence of underlying heart or lung disease. Well water should be avoided in infancy unless properly tested.

### Methaemoglobinaemia in neonates with acute gastroenteritis: lethal, but curable [^116Sratg]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Methaemoglobinaemia is a rare factor that can lead to cyanosis. The predominant cause of acquired methaemoglobinaemia is commonly attributed to anaesthetic agents. This case series presents three instances of acquired methaemoglobinaemia resulting from acute gastroenteritis caused by formula feeds. While uncommon, it is important to consider the potential occurrence of acquired methaemoglobinaemia because of acute gastroenteritis in newborns. This case series highlights the significance of promptly identifying and addressing the issue. The presence of metabolic acidosis and methaemoglobinaemia was detected and promptly treated by administering methylene blue and normal fluid therapy. Following that, the newborns have been discharged on exclusive breastfeeds. Despite being infrequent, the initial manifestation of these instances exhibited characteristics that deviated from the norm for a differential diagnosis in an infant experiencing hypoxia, metabolic acidosis and diarrhoea. It is crucial to promptly identify and administer methylene blue treatment to potentially rescue the life of the neonate.

### Exon sequencing of the α-2-globin gene for the differential diagnosis of central cyanosis in newborns: a case report [^112FGRo4]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Since chemical characterizations of Hb M were first reported in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Gerald, the rare globin chain variants have been investigated by chromatography, electrophoresis, and gene sequencing.

This is the first de novo case of Hb M Boston reported from South Korea. Like other types of Hb M disease, Hb M Boston has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Although de novo mutations are not rare events in human genetic diseases, relatively few have been recorded for Hb M variants and α-chain mutants are rarer than β-chain mutants. This report clearly describes a de novo mutation that was present in the proband by gene sequencing of HBA2. Hb M should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cyanosis in the newborn period, even if no familial cases are detected. Table 1 lists the cases of hemoglobin M disesase with neonatal cynosis presenting immediately after birth.

Table 1
Summary of hemoglobin M diseases presenting as neonatal cyanosis

MetHb methemoglobin

Hemoglobin is constantly being oxidized; however, natural reducing systems such as erythrocyte MetHb reductase maintain the natural MetHb level under 2%. Hb M variants caused by a mutation in α-, β-, or γ-globin make the redox potential of the heme iron more negative; the oxidized heme then becomes more resistant to reduction by erythrocyte MetHb reductases. Consequently, Hb M disease causes methemoglobinemia and contributes to lifelong cyanosis that is unresponsive to oxygen therapy. In particular, the presence of cyanosis in the neonate supports an α-globin chain variant such as Hb M Boston, because of a β-globin mutation present several months later due to low β-chain expression at birth.

### COVID-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^112mddu1]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Data about COVID-19 in the infant population is scarce. Less than 1% of patients in a review of over 72,000 cases from China were younger than 10 years of age, and less than 20% of a pediatric subset were younger than 1 year of age. There is contradictory evidence regarding vertical transmission of COVID-19 between infected mothers and newborns, though the current consensus is that vertical transmission is unlikely to occur. Symptoms in this age group vary as with older age groups. A case series of nine hospitalized patients under the age of one noted that most hospitalized patients were symptomatic with fever and upper respiratory symptoms. Another reported case described a 55-day-old infant who developed more severe symptoms, including pneumonia, and demonstrated evidence of liver and cardiac injury.

In younger populations, viral load may persist for weeks regardless of symptoms, as case reports have noted persistently positive PCR tests even in asymptomatic patients, including in a well 6-month-old who tested positive for 16 days. As our patient's immediate family members were sick one week prior to the onset of his symptoms, his family was the likely source from which he contracted the virus. He tested positive on admission for both hospitalizations via PCR testing, with 21 days between the two tests.

Our patient's presentation, initially for an isolated episode of perioral cyanosis and apnea, was at first attributed to a BRUE. A BRUE is defined as an event lasting less than one minute without an identifiable explanation and with full resolution of symptoms, in an infant less than one year of age, and symptoms can include cyanosis. Past research has found a strong correlation between apparent life-threatening events, a less-specific diagnosis that has been replaced by the term "BRUE", and a positive respiratory viral infection test. However, given his recurrence of symptoms and new onset of stridor in the setting of a persistently positive COVID-19 PCR, his symptoms are more likely to be directly due to his infection by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the recurrence of symptoms after a prolonged asymptomatic period indicates this patient's infection appears to have followed an atypical course.

### COVID-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^111mry9o]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The world is in the midst of a global pandemic due to COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to its novelty there is still limited knowledge about its natural history, and data regarding its effect on pediatric patients is particularly sparse compared to adult patients. From what is currently understood, in the pediatric population, particularly in younger children, morbidity and mortality rates are notably lower than the adult population. The most common clinical features of COVID-19 in children are fever, cough, and fatigue, which are symptoms also associated with numerous common respiratory tract infections. Younger patients usually require only supportive care and generally recover fully within two weeks of symptom onset, though there have been multiple anecdotal reports of COVID-19 related deaths in infants. We present a case of apnea and perioral cyanosis, initially worked up as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE), associated with COVID-19.

Cyanosis in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) — definition, evaluation, and iron management: The definition of cyanosis is "bluish discoloration of the skin and/or mucous membranes resulting from inadequate oxygenation of the blood", and for cyanosis to be visible, at least 5 g/L of unsaturated hemoglobin in tissue is needed. Cyanotic heart disease encompasses a widely heterogeneous group; therefore, an individualized approach is needed for each patient according to the clinical details. Secondary erythrocytosis and polycythemia are fundamentally different conditions that require different treatments. Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals; consequences may include stroke and myocardial ischemia, and iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening test. Limited data suggest that treatment of transferrin saturation < 20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely.

### Systematic review of APGAR scores&cyanosis in black, Asian, and ethnic minority infants [^112juebh]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

This systematic review included 10 observational studies that considered cyanosis or Apgar score assessment and their association with neonatal wellbeing in Black, Asian, or ethnic minority neonates compared to White neonates. Three studies showed Black neonates have lower neonatal mortality rates at low Apgar score than their White counterparts. However, they were also more likely to receive a low Apgar score. Detection of cyanosis was poor for all ethnicities, with the tongue and lips the best places to observe. When using pulse oximetry, occult hypoxia was more likely in Black neonates although this did not reach significance. Only 9.1% of staff in one survey reported receiving adequate training around caring for ethnic minority babies.

### A comprehensive newborn exam: part I. general, head and neck, cardiopulmonary [^116w3nKv]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

A comprehensive newborn examination involves a systematic inspection. A Ballard score uses physical and neurologic characteristics to assess gestational age. Craniosynostosis is caused by premature fusion of the sutures, and 20% of children with this condition have a genetic mutation or syndrome. The red reflex assessment is normal if there is symmetry in both eyes, without opacities, white spots, or dark spots. If the red reflex findings are abnormal or the patient has a family history of pertinent eye disorders, consultation with an ophthalmologist is warranted. Newborns with low-set ears should be evaluated for a genetic condition. Renal ultrasonography should be performed only in patients with isolated ear anomalies, such as preauricular pits or cup ears, if they are accompanied by other malformations or significant family history. If ankyloglossia is detected, a frenotomy may be considered if it impacts breastfeeding. The neck should be examined for full range of motion because uncorrected torticollis can lead to plagiocephaly and ear misalignment. Proper auscultation is crucial for evaluation of the bronchopulmonary circulation with close observation for signs of respiratory distress, including tachypnea, nasal flaring, grunting, retractions, and cyanosis. Benign murmurs are often present in the first hours of life. Pulse oximetry should be performed in a systematic fashion before discharge.

### Congenital heart disease diagnosed with echocardiogram in newborns with asymptomatic cardiac murmurs: a systematic review [^114DTHsK]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death in newborns. CHD prevalence in newborns has increased globally, especially in Asia, from 0.6 per 1000 live births to 9.410 per 1000 live births, according to several recent reports. Despite antenatal screening processes using fetal echocardiogram (Echo), more than 50% of newborns with CHD are unrecognized at birth. As undiagnosed CHD can lead to life-threatening cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest, which are the primary causes of death in infants, screening newborns' cardiac health is vital.

Cardiac assessments, including physical examinations, have been performed for newborns after birth; however, the use of Echo for diagnosing CHD, especially in newborns with asymptomatic, non-syndromic cardiac murmurs (ANCM), has been a subject of debate. Echo, which pediatricians use to evaluate heart function, uses sound waves to produce pictures of the movement of different parts of the heart; thus, it has become the gold standard for diagnosis of CHD in pediatric patients with cardiac murmurs and its use has expanded with advances in technology. Almost all pediatricians agree with performing Echo for newborns with cardiorespiratory symptoms, such as cyanosis and tachypnea; chromosome abnormalities, including Down syndrome; or other non-cardiac anomalies to rule out CHD. The appropriate criteria for the use of Echo in children and adolescents with cardiac murmurs are well established; however, guidelines for the use of Echo in newborns with ANCM have not yet been reported. Cardiac murmurs are commonly found in newborns and are one of the major signs of potential CHD. Moreover, pediatric cardiac murmur is the primary reason for referral and further evaluations. Therefore, CHD detection in newborns with ANCM is necessary for early diagnosis and timely treatment.

Recently, it has become easy to implement Echo in neonatal care. Previous studies reported variable CHD incidence in newborns with ANCM; however, there is no consensus on the use of Echo for early detection of CHD in newborns with ANCM. In this systematic review, we aimed to identify the incidence of CHD diagnosed with Echo and determine whether Echo should be used in the proper management of CHD in newborns with ANCM.

### Can echocardiographic screening in the early days of life detect critical congenital heart disease among apparently healthy newborns? [^113r6d2V]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Efficacy of postnatal echocardiographic screening for CCHD

In this study, postnatal echocardiographic screening did not help improve the detection rate of critical or serious CHD in newborns without prenatal diagnosis or clinical signs. Moreover, such early echocardiographic screening detected non-significant CHDs, which were not associated with clinical manifestations and which resolved spontaneously within the first 6 months of life.

Fetal ultrasound screening allows for early detection of CHD, especially when conducted routinely in tertiary care centers. In our hospital, fetal ultrasound screening is routinely conducted for all pregnant women. When fetal CCHD is recognized by an obstetrician, the pregnant woman is referred for detailed fetal assessment by a pediatric cardiologist. Previous studies have also suggested that collaboration with a pediatric cardiologist may improve the sonographic detection rate of fetal CHD. In this setting, postnatal echocardiographic screening may not significantly improve the early detection rate of CCHD. However, the detection rate of CHD by prenatal ultrasound can be limited by fetal gestational age or position, maternal obesity, and operator experience. In fact, of the newborns delivered during the study period, all except six screened negative for CHD on prenatal ultrasound, while three were postnatally diagnosed as having critical or serious CHD despite having screened negative on prenatal ultrasound; these three newborns had clinical signs indicative of CHD postnatally, including heart murmur and/or cyanosis. However, in newborns with CCHD, murmurs do not always manifest prior to hospital discharge, due to specific anatomic features, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, or reduced contractility. Cyanosis may also be difficult to detect in newborns with mild desaturation or with dark or anemic skin color, as well as when lighting in the room is poor. Because of these problems, routine neonatal examination fails to detect CHD in about half of cases.

### Systematic review of APGAR scores&cyanosis in black, Asian, and ethnic minority infants [^115wxK7c]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Concerns have also been raised around the detection of neonatal hypoxia. This is typically portrayed as a neonate's lips or skin appearing "blue" or "pale". It is difficult to diagnose poor oxygenation in infants through visual assessment alone, with reliability varying between clinicians, including in darker skinned infants. Guidelines recommend that observation of skin color is insufficient to ascertain neonatal oxygenation. Pulse oximetry utilizes a non-invasive approach to assess oxygenation. Screening newborns with pulse oximetry is routinely recommended to identify heart conditions that may not be detected on visual examination. However, pulse oximeters have mainly been calibrated on White skin. Racial bias in pulse oximetry has been suggested to place Black adults at increased risk of occult hypoxemia. These inequalities in healthcare provision were particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, where inconsistencies in technology such as pulse oximeters resulted in dark skinned individuals having a greater likelihood of inaccurate readings.

The aim of this review was therefore to examine associations between neonatal examinations that include a subjective assessment of skin color and any objective measure of neonatal wellbeing in Black, Asian, or minority ethnic neonates compared to their White counterparts. This manuscript specifically focuses on Apgar score and the detection of cyanosis.

Pulse oximetry screening (POS) for detection of C-CHD is supported because visible cyanosis generally requires marked hypoxemia (≥ 4–5 gm/dL deoxyhemoglobin or oxygen saturation ≤ ~80%). In pooled assessments performed after 24 hours of life, sensitivity for detecting C‑CHD was 69.6%, specificity 99.9%, and positive predictive value 47%, with false-positive screens requiring further evaluation in 0.05% of infants screened after 24 hours. A multisociety working group recommended routine use of POS in well-born and intermediate care nurseries, and adoption is nearly universal in the U.S., with 46 states and the District of Columbia incorporating it into newborn screening programs.

### Application of neonatologist performed echocardiography in the assessment and management of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn [^114KcZmX]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Distinguishing between PPHN and cyanotic heart lesions on clinical grounds can be challenging. This, however, is essential since management for these disorders are quite different. Clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of an underlying congenital heart defect are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Clinical signs and symptoms suggestive for a congenital heart defect ('red flags')

Delay in the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of a cyanotic heart disease is associated with worsening prognosis. It is therefore imperative to have a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation to rule out any structural abnormality. When in doubt during the time before echocardiography can be performed, it is advised to start prostaglandin E1 in anticipation of a potential heart defect. In a patient with PPHN, prostaglandin E1 might have some pulmonary vasodilatory effects, and in severe PPHN, it will preserve postductal systemic perfusion, albeit at the expense of cyanosis. It should be noted that the institution of a treatment regimen aiming at pulmonary vasodilation may deteriorate the clinical condition of the patients with certain heart defects, such as total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

The following structural heart defects may clinically mimic PPHN: TAPVC, transposition of great arteries (TGA), pulmonary atresia with or without ventricular septal defect (VSD), severe Fallot's tetralogy, tricuspid atresia, unguarded tricuspid orifice syndrome, severe Ebstein anomaly, and sometimes even left-sided obstructive heart disease (such as coarctation of aorta, interrupted aortic arch, and hypoplastic left heart disease).

### Systematic review of APGAR scores&cyanosis in black, Asian, and ethnic minority infants [^116CsJPN]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Apgar score and cyanosis assessment may disadvantage darker-skinned babies. This review explored cyanosis and Apgar score assessments in Black, Asian, or minority ethnic neonates compared to White neonates.

Material and Methods

Four databases were searched. Studies of any methodology were included. A narrative synthesis was undertaken.

Results

Ten studies were included. Three studies involving over 39 million neonates showed Apgar score ≤ 3 was predictive of neonatal mortality across all ethnicities. Black babies with Apgar score ≤ 3 had lower mortality rates before 28 days, however, variations in scoring practices were also observed. Three further studies (n = 39,290,014) associated low Apgar scores with poorer mental development up to 22 months, especially in mixed ethnicity and Black infants. One study reported inadequate training in assessing ethnic minority neonates. Cyanosis was the focus of three included studies (n = 455) revealing poor visual assessment of cyanosis across ethnicities. With pulse oximetry occult hypoxemia occurred slightly more frequently in Black neonates. Tongue color indicated oxygen requirement at birth, regardless of ethnicity.

Conclusions

Apgar scores correlate well with neonatal mortality in all ethnicities, however scoring variations exist. Cyanosis assessment is challenging, with tongue and lips the best places to observe in the absence of pulse oximetry.

Impact

Assessment of the color component of the Apgar score and of cyanosis visually are not accurate in babies with darker skin. Small racial differences may exist for pulse oximetry in neonates, but it is more reliable than visual assessment.

### A novel haemoglobin variant mimicking cyanotic congenital heart disease [^115d4a6V]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Screening for critical congenital heart defects in newborn babies can aid in early recognition, with the prospect of improved outcome. However, as this universal newborn screening is implemented, there will be an increasing number of false-positive results. In order to avoid multiple investigations and uncertainty, an haemoglobin (Hb) variant must be included in the differential diagnosis in otherwise well newborns with low oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry. We describe a novel fetal Hb variant (heterozygous γ-globin gene (HBG1) mutation in exon 2 c.202G > A (p. Val68Met)) identified in a newborn with positive pulse oximetry screening for congenital heart disease.

### Newborn pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects [^112GJK38]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) European Region is developing a new pocket book for primary health care for children and adolescents in Europe. This article is part of a series of reviews, which aim to summarize the existing recommendations and the most recent evidence on preventive interventions applied to children under five years of age to inform the WHO editorial group to make recommendations for health promotion in primary health care. In this article, we looked at existing recommendations and supporting evidence addressing the effectiveness of pulse oximetry effective for detecting critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) in newborns. We also looked at the impact of timing of oximetry and the site of testing (post-ductal versus pre- and post-ductal) in the accuracy of screening, and at the potential harms and limitations of pulse oximetry screening.

Why is screening for critical congenital heart defects important?

CCHD is defined as any cardiac lesion from which infants die or require surgery or cardiac catheterization within the first 28 days of life to prevent death or severe end-organ damage. Early detection of CCHD before acute cardiovascular collapse leads to improved cardiopulmonary and neurological outcomes. However, most newborns are asymptomatic at birth. Newborn screening for CCHD can help identifying some cases to allow prompt diagnosis and treatment, and may prevent disability or fatal outcome.

2018 AHA/ACC ACHD AP classification — Hypoxemia/hypoxia/cyanosis definitions specify that hypoxemia is oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry at rest ≤ 90%, with severe hypoxemia defined as oxygen saturation at rest < 85%; the text also notes that in the presence of anemia, severe hypoxemia can be present without visible cyanosis.

### Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn [^112KCb3G]. NeoReviews (2015). Low credibility.

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is often secondary to parenchymal lung disease (such as meconium aspiration syndrome) or lung hypoplasia (with congenital diaphragmatic hernia) but can also be idiopathic. PPHN is characterized by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, resulting in right-to-left shunting of blood and hypoxemia. The diagnosis of PPHN is based on clinical evidence of labile hypoxemia often associated with differential cyanosis and confirmed by echocardiography. Lung volume recruitment with optimal use of positive end-expiratory pressure or mean airway pressure and/or surfactant is very important in secondary PPHN due to parenchymal lung disease. Other management strategies include optimal oxygenation, avoiding respiratory and metabolic acidosis, blood pressure stabilization, sedation, and pulmonary vasodilator therapy. Failure of these measures leads to consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, although this rescue therapy is needed less frequently with advances in medical management. Randomized clinical trials with long-term follow-up are required to evaluate various therapeutic strategies in PPHN.

### Cyanosis and stroke due to functional cor triatriatum dexter in a neonate [^114c72Y7]. Neonatology (2018). Low credibility.

Small remnants of the right valve of the sinus venosus are commonly found in adults, but the incidence and risk associated with these embryonic remnants in neonates are not well studied. The following report describes a cyanotic neonate with a large Eustachian valve remnant creating a functional cor triatriatum dexter who was initially diagnosed with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. The cyanosis in this infant improved over the first postnatal week with conservative management, but she suffered multifocal subcortical stroke, likely related to her intracardiac shunt. The clinical presentation and questions regarding long-term management of this rare diagnosis are explored.

Existing evidence

Short history of PO used for newborns screening

In 2009, the AAP and the American Heart Association (AHA) published conjointly a statement of evidence on the routine use of PO in newborns for detection of CCHDs. The evidence supporting this document was mainly based on two studies (de Wahl 2009 and Riede 2010), both included in the Cochrane systematic review by Plana et al. Although the document showed benefits of PO screening, it was concluded that "future studies in larger populations and across a broad range of newborn delivery systems are needed to determine whether this practice should become standard of care in the routine assessment of the neonate". Based on this document, the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) recommended that CCHDs to be added to the recommended uniform screening panel (RUSP). After this, the SACHDNC in collaboration with the AAP, the AHA, and the American College of Cardiology Foundation convened a work group to elucidate how to implement this screening safely and with efficiency. The working group evaluated the new findings of large population-based screening activities in Sweden and England, and published their updated recommendations in 2011, which are the basis for the AAP and CDC current recommendations. Previously called "cyanotic congenital heart diseases", this group recommended renaming the target conditions of the PO screening as "critical congenital heart disease" (CCHD), as "many newborns with the targeted congenital heart defects do not develop clinically appreciable cyanosis until after nursery discharge, and some lesions (e.g. hypoplastic left heart syndrome) may present with significant cardiovascular compromise without apparent cyanosis". As a conclusion, "the work-group members found sufficient evidence to begin screening for low blood oxygen saturation through the use of pulse-oximetry monitoring to detect CCHD in well-infant and intermediate care nurseries", however they identified research gaps, mainly regarding some specifics populations and delivery strategies. Therefore, "the Secretary of the US Health and Human Services has directed an interagency work group to develop a plan to address these critical gaps before recommending that CCHD be a part of the recommended uniform screening panel". The CCHD newborn screening was added to the RUSP in 2011, and two years later, another document was published, addressing some of the implementation challenges.

### The origin of hydrogen sulfide in a newborn with sulfhaemoglobin induced cyanosis [^117EuqNm]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

This report investigated the origin of H₂S in a newborn boy with sulfhaemoglobin induced cyanosis, who died because of multiple organ failure. Frozen material was collected and studied after death. The results suggest that enzymes had been released from deteriorating organs into the blood and abdominal fluid, and that the reaction of one of these enzymes with sulfur containing amino acids might have resulted in increased H(2)S concentrations. It is hypothesised that this release of enzymes resulted from a haemolysin produced by an invasive haemolytic Escherichia coli that was found in the blood and organs of this patient.

### COVID-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^116ivLXP]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Data regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and outcomes in infants are sparse compared to older pediatric and adult populations.

Case Presentation

We present a three-week-old full-term male with a history of mild hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) who was admitted as an inpatient twice for episodes of apnea and perioral cyanosis. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 and negative for other common respiratory viruses at both admissions.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first report of apnea and perioral cyanosis associated with COVID-19 in an infant. This case highlights a previously undocumented COVID-19 presentation and suggests that even mildly symptomatic infants warrant viral diagnostic testing in an effort to prevent further spread of the disease.

### State legislation, regulations, and hospital guidelines for newborn screening for critical congenital heart defects-United States, 2011–2014 [^111qMZvA]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

What is already known on this topic?

Congenital heart defects occur in approximately eight in every 1,000 live births, one fourth of which are considered to be critical congenital heart defects (CCHD). Newborn screening using pulse oximetry can detect hypoxemia, a clinical sign of CCHD.

What is added by this report?

This report represents the first assessment of state's actions to adopt newborn screening for CCHD and requirements for collection of CCHD screening data. Forty-three states have taken action toward newborn screening for CCHD through statute, regulations, or hospital guidelines. Among the 43 states, 32 (74%) are collecting or planning to collect CCHD screening data.

What are the implications for public health practice?

State mandates for newborn screening for CCHD might increase the number of newborns screened, allowing for early identification and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Data collection and reporting are essential to evaluate the effect of this public health program.

### Reversed differential cyanosis in the newborn: a clinical finding in the supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection [^115XQwAx]. Pediatric Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The newborn can experience two types of differential cyanosis (DC). The common type of DC occurs when oxygen saturation in the right hand is greater than in the foot. The second type of DC, reversed differential cyanosis (RDC), occurs when oxygen saturation is lower in the right hand than in the foot. This phenomenon is observed in transposition of the great arteries (TGA) with patent ductus arteriosis (PDA) and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance or in TGA with PDA and preductal aortic interruption or coarctation. This report describes a case of RDC not previously described involving an infant with supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC). In supracardiac TAPVC, RDC results from streaming of highly saturated superior vena cava (SVC) blood into the right ventricle, out the main pulmonary artery, through a PDA, and to the descending aorta, with streaming of more desaturated blood from the inferior vena cava (IVC) into the left atrium across the atrial septal defect (ASD)/foramen ovale. Therefore, as part of a neonatal examination to rule out congenital heart disease (CHD), simultaneous pre- and postductal oxygen saturations should be documented. The presence of RDC should initiate immediate full cardiac evaluation for CHD. Supracardiac TAPVC should be included in the differential diagnosis if RDC is observed.

### Systematic review of APGAR scores&cyanosis in black, Asian, and ethnic minority infants [^113yWAa9]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, although each neonate is assigned an Apgar score, it is suggested that it is seldom used to determine clinical management and is often assigned in retrospect. This is best demonstrated through a United States's study which showed 90% of nurses assigned an Apgar score within a vignette even when data for some Apgar score components were absent, for example heart rate or respiration rate. A correct Apgar score was assigned only 19% to 57% of the time and inter-rater agreement was poor. This has additionally been confirmed through qualitative interviews, where healthcare professionals stated that they simply assigned an Apgar score of 9 or 10 if a neonate was alert and crying without actually assessing each component.

While many high resource countries have moved away from using the Apgar score as a tool for decision-making and rely more on pulse oximetry and electrocardiograms, such medical technology is not always available especially in low resource settings and rural locations. It is therefore of paramount importance that more research is undertaken in countries where the Apgar score is still relied upon for clinical decision making for example some countries in Africa, Asian, and Latin America. Studies within these countries are also essential to better understand any inconsistencies in Apgar scoring where neonates with darker skin tones are in the majority. Additionally, despite questions around the reliability of the Apgar score for clinical decision making especially for neonates with darker skin pigmentation, its routine collection in practice means the Apgar score remains a focus of research studies. Within research there is an overemphasis on the Apgar score to classify neonatal wellbeing and to adjust within regression analyses, with little consideration of its reliability or validity. The limitations of the Apgar score, especially in those with darker skin tones needs to be more clearly understood within the research arena.

### Actions in support of newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease-United States, 2011–2018 [^114JwWRQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

In 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services added critical congenital heart disease (CCHD), which occurs in two of every 1,000 births, to the list of conditions recommended to states for universal newborn screening. Without early detection, infants with CCHD are at risk for substantial morbidity and death in the first weeks and months of life. Based on 2007–2013 data, deaths from CCHD and other cardiac causes in infants aged < 6 months significantly declined in infants born in eight states after they had fully implemented mandated newborn CCHD screening policies by June 2013. CDC collaborated with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Association of Public Health Laboratories' Newborn Screening Technical Assistance and Evaluation Program (NewSTEPs) to update a 2015 report on states' actions toward adopting and implementing policies supporting CCHD newborn screening. In 2018, all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) had implemented CCHD screening policies, and, with one exception, all states mandated that screening be done (California mandates that screening be offered). However, not all states had data systems in place for tracking all screening results and outcomes. Ongoing evaluation activities, which rely on screening data, could help identify program improvement opportunities and monitor the impact of early identification of CCHD.

Congenital heart defects occur in approximately eight of every 1,000 live births; one fourth of infants born with congenital heart defects have CCHD. CCHD typically requires surgical or catheter intervention before age 1 year. Newborn screening can identify newborns with CCHD before signs or symptoms are evident and before hospital discharge after birth. CCHD screening supplements clinical detection of CCHD to facilitate timely identification, treatment, and management of affected infants. Infants are screened for CCHD using pulse oximetry, a noninvasive method to estimate the oxygen saturation in an infant's arterial blood. Hypoxemia (abnormally low oxygen saturation) detected by pulse oximetry screening can result from CCHD or other causes. Additional testing (e.g. chest radiograph or echocardiography) is needed after an abnormal screen to determine the cause of the hypoxemia.

### Rapid implementation of pulse oximetry newborn screening to detect critical congenital heart defects-new Jersey, 2011 [^114mCZY6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

Universal newborn screening is the process by which newborns are screened shortly after birth for conditions that can cause severe illness, disability, or death. Through early identification and treatment, newborn screening provides an opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality. The Recommended Uniform Newborn Screening Panel is a list of conditions for which all newborns should be screened, as recommended by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. * In September 2011, the Secretary approved the addition of screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry to the panel. † Congenital heart disease occurs in nearly 1% of live births; approximately one quarter of cases will be CCHD, defined as those defects requiring cardiac surgery or catheterization before age 1 year.

Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive technology that can be used to detect hypoxemia, a clinical sign of CCHD. In the absence of early detection, newborns with CCHD are at risk for death in the first few days or weeks of life. Current approaches for detection of CCHD include prenatal ultrasound or physical examination findings (e.g. cyanosis or tachypnea), although not all infants with CCHD are detected with prenatal ultrasound screening or by physical examination findings. Predictive values and sensitivity of pulse oximetry screening varies based on the screening protocol used (e.g. timing of screening after birth or number of extremities measured). On June 2, 2011, New Jersey passed legislation requiring that all licensed birthing facilities screen newborns for CCHD at age ≥ 24 hours using pulse oximetry. § This legislation became effective 90 days later, on August 31, 2011, making New Jersey the first state to implement mandatory statewide CCHD screening. This report represents the first systematic gathering of process data on legislatively mandated newborn screening for CCHD in the United States. Most states have not yet mandated universal newborn screening for CCHD; however, similar legislation was introduced or enacted in at least 18 other states during their 2011–2012 legislative sessions (American Academy of Pediatrics, Division of State Government Affairs, unpublished data, 2012).

### Inadvertent methylergonovine administration to a newborn [^115WW7pD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous case reports describe the inadvertent administration of methylergonovine to newborns resulting in rare, life-threatening events including neonatal death. To our knowledge, no case reports exist detailing inadvertent methylergonovine administration in the emergency medicine literature. A newborn infant presented to the emergency department (ED) at hour five of life following methylergonovine administration with periods of apnea and cyanosis. The infant required intubation, mechanical ventilation, and a seven day neonatal intensive care stay. This rare case describes the potential for this error to occur in the community and heightens the vigilance of emergency medicine providers when caring for newborns in their first hours of life.

### Newborn pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects [^115PzHnw]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We looked at existing recommendations and supporting evidence addressing the effectiveness of pulse oximetry effective for detecting critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) in newborns. We also looked at the impact of timing of oximetry and the site of testing in the accuracy of screening, and at the potential harms and limitations of pulse oximetry screening, We conducted a literature search up to the 13 th of August 2019 by using key terms and manual search in selected sources. We summarized the recommendations and the strength of the recommendation when and as reported by the authors. We summarized the main findings of systematic reviews with the certainty of the evidence as reported. Current evidence supports consistent accuracy for detection of CCHDs in newborns by pulse oximetry screening in addition to antenatal ultrasonography and clinical examination. Overall, early diagnosis of CCHD with pulse oximetry is judged to be beneficial and cost-effective, and potential harms associated with false-positive tests are not serious, while missing CCHDs and other serious diseases detected by hypoxaemia in absence of pulse oximetry screening can lead to serious consequences. The site of testing (post-ductal versus pre- and post-ductal) had no significant effect on sensitivity nor specificity for detection of CCHDs.

### Evaluation of circulating cardiovascular biomarker levels for early detection of congenital heart disease in newborns in Sweden [^111UAaqz]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects approximately 1 in 125 newborns and is the most common congenital malformation in humans, causing substantial morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. This prevalence has led to the development of highly specialized services with favorable surgical mortality outcomes, which are largely attributed to centralized pediatric cardiac centers and dedicated intensive care units.

To improve the early identification of CHD, maternity services have implemented prenatal ultrasonography screening programs. Prenatal CHD detection has been associated with improved perinatal care in critical cases, but these screening efforts remain imperfect even in high-income countries. Delayed CHD diagnosis is associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. Critical CHD remains associated with risk of sudden cardiovascular collapse after discharge from maternity services. Early postnatal detection of CHD can be improved through standardized clinical examination protocols, but evaluation of newborns with CHD requires clinical experience because of neonates' transition from fetal to postnatal circulation. Aortic arch obstructions from a slowly closing ductus arteriosus without apparent femoral pulse deficit or only mild cyanosis may go unnoticed. Pulse oximetry (POX) screening has been recommended as a complement to clinical examination because it may help to detect critical CHD. Pulse oximetry screening is based on measuring oxygen saturations in the right arm (preductal) and lower extremities (postductal) approximately 6 to 24 hours after birth to identify cyanosis (< 95% saturation) or a greater than 3% saturation difference between preductal and postductal measurements. If the newborn has a positive screen result (in this study, positive is defined as a problem identified, whereas negative indicates no problem), prompt neonatal assessment and subsequent echocardiographic evaluation are paramount. In this setting, some neonates with even minor hypoxemia owing to delays in adaptation from the fetal circulation or those with primary pulmonary disease will inevitably have positive screen results. This finding has raised questions regarding the ability of POX to detect critical CHD. No prospective studies have been performed on the POX screening method used solely for identifying pulmonary disease. Although concerns remain that POX screening is imperfect for uncovering CHD lesions involving a duct-dependent systemic circulation, the method has become a widespread tool for detecting critical CHD in many health care systems.

### Major heart defects: the diagnostic evaluations of first-year-olds [^116YgBqG]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Although the basic clinical signs of critical and severe heart defects are hypoxemia (cyanosis) and manifestations of heart failure, in our study newborns with unrecognised CHDs were without moderate or severe perinatal symptoms. Newborns with CHDs had mostly normal Apgar scores after delivery, and symptoms of the defect developed later. Clinical stability was probably positively influenced by the presence of foetal shunts. Stable neonates are not routinely screened with a pulse oximeter on the first day in the study region, although this method would have good specificity and sensitivity to detect critical defects. In addition, children with CHDs did not show a higher tendency towards premature birth or hypotrophy. The exception was children with a persistent ductus arteriosus; this diagnosis was due to their immaturity.

The CHD diagnosis was predominantly established in the early neonatal period (three quarters of the children), which is when the child is usually hospitalised in the neonatology department. Although clinical signs were dominant, we expect higher CHD detection under hospitalisation with the introduction of routine pulse oximetry. In our study, all defects with future univentricular circulation requiring multiple operations were detected in the early neonatal period.

Some of the CHDs are not detected prenatally or postnatally in the hospital and the child is discharged home with an unidentified defect. Previous studies on delayed CHDs reported a rate of 20 to 30% neonates with CHDs undetected during birth hospitalisation, which in our study was 25%. The number of these defects is influenced by the development of prenatal diagnostics. Another study showed 10% of delayed cases from all critical defects, which in our study corresponded to a 12% rate. The late neonate stage is an important period for the newborn when foetal shunts close after discharge from the maternity hospital and severe or moderate CHD becomes apparent. The worst pre-operative condition and a critical course of the disease are more frequent in these newborns. Two thirds of our delayed defects occurred in this late neonate period. According to the individual types of defects, coarctation of the aorta and Ebstein's anomaly had the highest rate in this period. Ebstein's anomaly is rare, but coarctation of the aorta has a significant incidence in the population. Up to 30% of coarctation cases are not diagnosed in newborns after delivery; in our study it was 50%. Ventricular septal defect was most commonly detected in infants, although only severe and operated defects were included in this study. For this defect, surgery at high flow in symptomatic children early in infancy is recommended.

Delivery Room Handling of the Newborn: A Historical Perspective

The indications for bag and mask ventilation in the 1992 algorithm were (1) apnea or gasping respirations, (2) heart rate less than 100 beats per minute (bpm), and (3) persistent central cyanosis despite application of 100% oxygen. Ventilation was to be initiated with a rate of 40–60/min. The response was assessed by chest wall motion, auscultation of breath sounds, and any increase in the heart rate. The inspiratory pressure was adjusted to a visible rise and fall of the chest. Chest compressions were to be performed if the heart rate was less than 60 bpm or if heart rate was between 60 and 80 bpm and not rising despite adequate ventilation with 100% oxygen for approximately 30 s. The recommended ventilation to chest compression ratio was 3:1, that is 30 ventilation and 90 compressions per minute. If the heart rate was > 100 bpm, one should check for spontaneous respirations. If respiration seemed adequate, then positive pressure ventilation (PPV) could be discontinued. If the heart rate was between 60 and 100 bpm, one should continue ventilation and consider intubation.

The 1992 AHA guidelines recommended the use of 100% oxygen if PPV was needed. Sodium bicarbonate was freely given if a metabolic acidosis was developed or assumed to develop. Regarding the application of oxygen for newborn resuscitation, it was stated: "Therefore, if cyanosis, bradycardia, or other signs of neonatal distress are noted in a breathing newborn during stabilization, early administration of 100% oxygen is important while the neonate is being assessed for need of additional resuscitative measures. Initially, oxygen can be delivered by free flow through a face mask attached", and further "If respiratory efforts are absent or inadequate so that assisted ventilation is required, 100% oxygen should be delivered by positive pressure ventilation using a face mask or endotracheal tube. Ideally, oxygen should be passed through a warmer and humidifier, although this is not always practical in the delivery room. The hazards of administering too much oxygen during the brief period required for resuscitation should not be a concern".

The 1992 AHA guidelines recommended routine suction of the mouth, nose, and posterior pharynx if there was meconium-stained amniotic fluid even before delivery of the shoulders and thorax to decrease the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), regardless of whether the meconium was thick or thin.

### State legislation, regulations, and hospital guidelines for newborn screening for critical congenital heart defects-United States, 2011–2014 [^1125f1vm]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Critical congenital heart defects (CCHD) occur in approximately two of every 1,000 live births. Newborn screening provides an opportunity for reducing infant morbidity and mortality. In September 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary endorsed the recommendation that critical congenital heart defects be added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) for all newborns. In 2014, CDC collaborated with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Division of State Government Affairs and the Newborn Screening Technical Assistance and Evaluation Program (NewSTEPs) to assess states' actions for adopting newborn screening for CCHD. Forty-three states have taken action toward newborn screening for CCHD through legislation, regulations, or hospital guidelines. Among those 43, 32 (74%) are collecting or planning to collect CCHD screening data; however, the type of data collected by CCHD newborn screening programs varies by state. State mandates for newborn screening for CCHD will likely increase the number of newborns screened, allowing for the possibility of early identification and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Data collection at the state level is important for surveillance, monitoring of outcomes, and evaluation of state CCHD newborn screening programs.

Congenital heart defects occur in approximately eight of every 1,000 live births, one fourth of which are considered to be CCHD. CCHD are defined as those requiring surgery or catheterization before age 1 year. In the absence of early detection, infants with CCHD are at risk for serious complications or death within the first few days or weeks of life. Newborn screening for CCHD uses pulse oximetry, a noninvasive technology to measure blood oxygen saturation. Low oxygen saturation indicates hypoxemia, an early clinical sign of CCHD. Additional testing (e.g. repeat screening, echocardiogram) is needed following an abnormal pulse oximetry screen to determine whether CCHD are present (or to determine the cause of the abnormal result). Thus, unlike most newborn screening conditions, screening for CCHD is not based on performing a blood test. In addition, hypoxemia detected by screening could indicate a medical problem, and requires immediate follow-up before discharge from the hospital.
