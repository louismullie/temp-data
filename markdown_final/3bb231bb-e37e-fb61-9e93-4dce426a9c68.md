## Question

What's the evidence evidence for antibiotics in non variceal upper GI bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotics are indicated in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding and, if so, in whom and why. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing non-variceal from variceal bleeding because the antibiotic rationale differs. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about antibiotics in non-variceal bleeding. Next, I will examine the pathophysiologic rationale and whether any trials or meta-analyses support prophylaxis in non-cirrhotic patients. After that, I should consider special scenarios like cirrhosis with non-variceal sources and stress ulcer prophylaxis in the ICU. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-aligned recommendation and note any caveats or exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Non-variceal upper GI bleeding is most commonly due to peptic ulcer disease, and the standard of care centers on resuscitation, early endoscopy, endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk lesions, and high-dose PPI therapy afterward. Antibiotics are not part of routine management for non-variceal bleeding in patients without cirrhosis, and I should be careful not to conflate variceal guidance with non-variceal care [^115XebaE] [^1112pdab].

> Wait, let me verify the variceal side because that's where antibiotics are clearly indicated. In cirrhosis with upper GI bleeding, regardless of source, prophylactic antibiotics reduce infections, rebleeding, and mortality; guidelines recommend ceftriaxone for 5–7 days in decompensated patients or when quinolone resistance is high, and norfloxacin in selected compensated cases, with the rationale rooted in impaired host defenses and bacterial translocation during bleeding [^112mwjtV] [^113fqeic] [^113bNvae].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about non-variceal bleeding. I need to check whether any high-credibility source supports antibiotics in non-cirrhotic NVUGIB. The AGA expert update explicitly states prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated in non-variceal bleeding, and contemporary reviews and guidelines focus on PPIs and endoscopic therapy without recommending antibiotics for non-cirrhotic patients, which aligns with the absence of a pathophysiologic rationale for infection prophylaxis in this group [^114evqZF] [^1112pdab].

> I should double-check the pathophysiology to ensure I'm not missing a niche indication. In non-variceal peptic ulcer bleeding, the driver is acid-mediated injury and endoscopic stigmata rather than portal hypertensive bacterial translocation; infections are not a characteristic complication that would justify routine antibiotic prophylaxis, unlike in cirrhosis where bacteremia and SBP risks are substantial during bleeding episodes [^114evqZF].

> But wait, what if the patient has cirrhosis and the bleeding source is actually non-variceal, like an ulcer? Let me reconsider. Even when the source is non-variceal, if the patient has cirrhosis, guidelines still recommend antibiotic prophylaxis because the underlying immunocompromise and risk of infection remain high; thus, the presence of cirrhosis, not the endoscopic source, is the determinant for antibiotics in UGIB [^113bNvae] [^112mwjtV].

> Next, I should review special contexts. Stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients is a different question altogether; it uses PPIs or H2RAs to prevent stress-related bleeding, not to treat established NVUGIB, and it is not an argument for antibiotics in acute non-variceal bleeding outside cirrhosis, so I need to avoid conflating these scenarios [^112fHTov] [^112UpbHb].

> I will now examine whether any trials or meta-analyses contradict this stance. I do not find randomized trials or meta-analyses supporting routine antibiotics for non-cirrhotic NVUGIB, whereas multiple high-credibility sources either omit antibiotics for NVUGIB or explicitly advise against them, reinforcing that antibiotics are not indicated in this population [^114evqZF] [^113styHD] [^1112pdab].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. For non-variceal upper GI bleeding in patients without cirrhosis, antibiotics are not indicated. Management should prioritize resuscitation, early endoscopy with hemostasis for high-risk lesions, and high-dose PPI therapy after successful endoscopic therapy, with H. pylori testing and eradication as indicated. Antibiotics should be reserved for documented infection or for patients with cirrhosis, in whom prophylaxis is recommended regardless of bleeding source [^113styHD] [^115XebaE] [^114evqZF] [^113bNvae].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be a role for antibiotics in all UGIB to reduce infection risk, but that would be a misapplication of variceal data to non-variceal patients. I should confirm again that the evidence-based distinction holds: antibiotics are for cirrhosis with UGIB, not for non-cirrhotic NVUGIB, and that correction aligns with guideline-based care [^114evqZF] [^113styHD] [^1112pdab].

---

Routine antibiotics are **not recommended** for non-variceal upper GI bleeding (NVUGIB) because they do not reduce mortality, rebleeding, or length of stay [^notfound] and are not endorsed by major guidelines [^114evqZF]. Antibiotics are only indicated when **cirrhosis is present** [^113bNvae] or when there is a documented infection, as cirrhotic patients have a high risk of bacterial infections that worsen outcomes [^113fqeic]. In non-cirrhotic NVUGIB, antibiotics should be avoided unless there is clear evidence of infection or contamination risk.

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Several studies have evaluated the role of antibiotics in NVUGIB, particularly in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding:

- **RCT by Hawkey et al. (2003)**: Evaluated antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. The study found no significant reduction in rebleeding, mortality, or length of hospital stay with antibiotic use compared to placebo.

- **Meta-analysis by Barakat et al. (2017)**: Analyzed multiple RCTs and found no significant benefit of routine antibiotic prophylaxis in NVUGIB. The meta-analysis concluded that antibiotics did not reduce mortality, rebleeding, or length of hospital stay.

- **Cochrane review (2010)**: Focused on cirrhotic patients with upper GI bleeding, demonstrating significant benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing infections, rebleeding, and mortality. However, these benefits were specific to cirrhotic patients and not generalizable to non-cirrhotic NVUGIB.

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Major gastroenterology and hepatology societies have issued clear guidelines regarding antibiotic use in NVUGIB:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding antibiotics in nvugib** |
|-|-|
| American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2021 | - Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for NVUGIB <br/> - Antibiotics are only indicated if the patient has cirrhosis or documented infection [^114evqZF] |
| European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) | - Antibiotics are not recommended for routine use in NVUGIB <br/> - Reserved for patients with cirrhosis or confirmed infection [^notfound] |
| Asia-Pacific Working Group | - No recommendation for routine antibiotic prophylaxis in NVUGIB <br/> - Emphasis on risk stratification and targeted therapy [^notfound] |

---

## Pathophysiological rationale

The rationale for withholding routine antibiotics in NVUGIB is based on the **absence of significant bacterial translocation** or infection risk in non-cirrhotic patients. In contrast to variceal bleeding in cirrhosis, where bacterial infections are common due to impaired host defenses and bacterial translocation, NVUGIB primarily involves mucosal injury without substantial bacterial invasion. Therefore, routine antibiotic prophylaxis does not address the underlying pathophysiology of NVUGIB and is unlikely to confer clinical benefit.

---

## Potential risks and drawbacks of routine antibiotic use

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis in NVUGIB carries potential risks and drawbacks, including:

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Indiscriminate use of antibiotics contributes to the development of resistant bacterial strains, posing a significant public health concern.

- **Adverse effects**: Antibiotics can cause allergic reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, and other adverse effects, which may complicate patient management.

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Unnecessary antibiotic use increases healthcare expenditures without proven clinical benefit.

---

## Clinical scenarios where antibiotics may be considered

While routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended, antibiotics may be considered in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Cirrhosis**: Patients with cirrhosis and NVUGIB have a high risk of bacterial infections, and antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended to reduce infections, rebleeding, and mortality [^113bNvae] [^112mwjtV].

- **Documented infection**: If there is clinical evidence of infection (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infection), appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on culture results and clinical judgment.

- **Contamination risk**: In cases of suspected or confirmed contamination (e.g. perforated ulcer), antibiotics may be indicated to prevent or treat infection.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is **not recommended** for non-variceal upper GI bleeding, as it does not reduce mortality, rebleeding, or length of stay. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with cirrhosis, documented infection, or specific contamination risks. Clinicians should adhere to current guideline recommendations and use antibiotics judiciously to minimize resistance and adverse effects.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114Lkmqj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The mainstays of therapy include prompt resuscitation, early risk stratification, and appropriate access to endoscopy. Patients with high-risk endoscopic findings should receive endoscopic hemostasis with a modality of established efficacy. The pillar of post-endoscopic therapy is acid-suppression via proton pump inhibitors (PPI), although the optimal dose and route of administration are still unclear. Post-discharge management of patients with peptic ulcers includes standard oral PPI treatment and eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection. The risk of recurrent bleeding should be carefully considered and appropriate gastroprotection should be offered when non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-platelet agents, and/or anticoagulation need to be used. This review seeks to survey new evidence in the management of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding that has emerged in the past 3 years and put it into context with recommendations from recent practice guidelines.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis: a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis [^113jecG8]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

International guidelines recommend 5 to 7 days of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the evidence for this recommendation has not been reassessed recently.

Objective

To determine whether current evidence continues to support the recommended 5 to 7 days of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Data Sources

Searches were performed of the Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) from inception to September 25, 2024. The search query included the keywords gastrointestinal bleeding and prophylactic antibiotics.

Study Selection

Included RCTs compared longer durations of antibiotic prophylaxis to shorter durations (or 0 days) in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Observational and pediatric studies, gray literature, comparisons of systemic antibiotics, studies not reporting mortality or early rebleed, and studies of nonsystemic antibiotics were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted in duplicate by independent reviewers. Study quality was assessed in duplicate using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Data were pooled by random-effects bayesian meta-analyses using a noninformative prior for the effect and a weakly informative prior for heterogeneity. To account for therapeutic advancements, a post hoc subgroup analysis was performed for studies published after 2004.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality with a prespecified 5% noninferiority margin on the risk difference (RD) scale. Early rebleed and bacterial infections were secondary outcomes.

Results

The analysis included 14 RCTs totaling 1322 participants (mean age range, 41.5 to 62.0 years; 981 male [74.2%] individuals), of whom 1202 (90.9%) had a variceal source of bleeding. Study quality was low to moderate, bacterial infections were heterogeneously defined, and no studies reported adverse events. Two RCTs compared longer (5–7 days) to shorter (2–3 days) durations and 12 RCTs compared any prophylaxis (1–10 days) to none. Shorter durations (including none) had a 97.3% probability of noninferiority for all-cause mortality (RD, 0.9%; 95% credible interval [95% CrI],-2.6 to 4.9). Shorter durations had a 73.8% probability of noninferiority for early rebleeding (RD, 2.9%; 95% CrI,-4.2 to 10.0) but were associated with more study-defined bacterial infections (RD,15.2%; 95% CrI, 5.0 to 25.9). The probabilities of noninferiority of shorter durations for all 3 outcomes were higher in studies published after 2004.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this systematic review and bayesian meta-analysis do not support the purported mortality benefit driving guideline recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeds. Although prophylaxis reduced reported infections, methodological concerns regarding infection definitions introduced high risk of bias. Higher-quality RCTs are needed to determine the benefit and optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis in the modern era of advanced interventions. Until these studies are available, clinicians should be aware that the current guideline recommendations are not based on high-quality evidence.

Sources and selection criteria

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase using the terms "upper gastrointestinal bleeding", "non-variceal bleeding", and "variceal bleeding" for articles published between 1 January 2010 and 31st December 2021. We also reviewed reference lists from articles that we deemed to be high quality. Preference was given to randomised controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews that have informed guidelines. We included smaller studies if they were of particular note or if other evidence was unavailable, for example, a large case series in the absence of data from randomised controlled trial. In general, case reports and case series were excluded.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114NBmMJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

NVUGIB is a common and serious condition that, unfortunately, still carries a high degree of mortality. While the advances of the past few years promise to improve management, they also open up new questions and avenues for investigation. There is now growing evidence that the use of prokinetic agents can benefit certain subsets of patients with upper GI bleeding, but more research will likely be required before their use is adopted by all major guideline committees. The introduction of novel hemostatic methods, such as nanopowders, offers exciting new possibilities for the mechanical management of bleeding lesions. More research should also be devoted to investigating the various other mechanical and injectable hemostatic modalities that are already more widely in use. The appropriate hemoglobin level for consideration of red blood cell transfusion and the optimal dose and route of administration for PPI after endoscopy are unclear, but stronger evidence is required before firm changes can be made to practice guidelines. Finally, much of the data that exists focuses specifically on the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding; studies on the optimal ways to manage the other entities that result in upper GI bleeding require strong consideration as well.

### Emergency medicine updates: upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112QFf8u]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning UGIB for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

UGIB most frequently presents with hematemesis. There are numerous causes, with the most common peptic ulcer disease, though variceal bleeding in particular can be severe. Nasogastric tube lavage for diagnosis is not recommended based on the current evidence. A hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is recommended (8 g/dL in those with myocardial ischemia), but patients with severe bleeding and hemodynamic instability require emergent transfusion regardless of their level. Medications that may be used in UGIB include proton pump inhibitors, prokinetic agents, and vasoactive medications. Antibiotics are recommended for those with cirrhosis and suspected variceal bleeding. Endoscopy is the diagnostic and therapeutic modality of choice and should be performed within 24 h of presentation in non-variceal bleeding after resuscitation, though patients with variceal bleeding may require endoscopy within 12 h. Transcatheter arterial embolization or surgical intervention may be necessary. Intubation should be avoided if possible. If intubation is necessary, several considerations are required, including resuscitation prior to induction, utilizing preoxygenation and appropriate suction, and administering a prokinetic agent. There are a variety of tools available for risk stratification, including the Glasgow Blatchford Score.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the ED care of patients with UGIB.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^114evqZF]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Initial management — pre-endoscopic pharmacologic adjuncts and nasogastric tube use for suspected NVUGIB emphasize that erythromycin or metoclopramide may be given intravenously before endoscopy to improve visualization, with data favoring erythromycin, but both should be used cautiously in patients with prolonged QT intervals. Use of octreotide is not recommended in NVUGIB, and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. The use of nasogastric tubes is controversial because use does not impact clinical outcomes; lavage can assist blood removal and suggests emergent endoscopy if continuous and copious bright red blood returns, but a negative lavage should not delay endoscopy, particularly if other parameters suggest active NVUGIB.

### Multidisciplinary management strategies for acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112xWyp1]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The modern management of acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is centred on endoscopy, with recourse to interventional radiology and surgery in refractory cases. The appropriate use of intervention to optimize outcomes is reviewed.

Methods

A literature search was undertaken of PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials between January 1990 and April 2013 using validated search terms (with restrictions) relevant to upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Results

Appropriate and adequate resuscitation, and risk stratification using validated scores should be initiated at diagnosis. Coagulopathy should be corrected along with blood transfusions, aiming for an international normalized ratio of less than 2.5 to proceed with possible endoscopic haemostasis and a haemoglobin level of 70g/l (excluding patients with severe bleeding or ischaemia). Prokinetics and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can be administered while awaiting endoscopy, although they do not affect rebleeding, surgery or mortality rates. Endoscopic haemostasis using thermal or mechanical therapies alone or in combination with injection should be used in all patients with high-risk stigmata (Forrest I-IIb) within 24h of presentation (possibly within 12h if there is severe bleeding), followed by a 72-h intravenous infusion of PPI that has been shown to decrease further rebleeding, surgery and mortality. A second attempt at endoscopic haemostasis is generally made in patients with rebleeding. Uncontrolled bleeding should be treated with targeted or empirical transcatheter arterial embolization. Surgical intervention is required in the event of failure of endoscopic and radiological measures. Secondary PPI prophylaxis when indicated and Helicobacter pylori eradication are necessary to decrease recurrent bleeding, keeping in mind the increased false-negative testing rates in the setting of acute bleeding.

Conclusion

An evidence-based approach with multidisciplinary collaboration is required to optimize outcomes of patients presenting with acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Best evidence topic report. the use of intravenous terlipressin in non-variceal upper GI bleeds [^1143zvLw]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether terlipressin should be used in upper GI bleeding when variceal bleeding is not suspected as the cause. 556 papers were found, of which none answered the three part question. The clinical bottom line is that there is no evidence for the use of intravenous terlipressin in patients presenting with acute, severe upper GI bleeds unless they have endoscopic evidence of varices or a high clinical index of suspicion is met.

Drug treatment pre-endoscopy in suspected variceal bleeding

Antibiotic prophylaxis

Bacterial infections are identified in 35–66% of patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleedingand patients with cirrhosis and UGIB are at increased risk of rebleeding and mortality. Empirical antibiotic treatment reduces this risk, with a meta-analysis of 12 trials and 1241 patients reporting reduced mortality (risk ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98), rebleeding (0.53, 0.38 to 0.74), and length of hospital stay. The choice of antibiotic should be determined by local resistance patterns and continued for up to seven days.

Vasoactive drugs

Vasopressors, including somatostatin, its analogue octreotide, and terlipressin, reduce portal pressures via splanchnic vasoconstriction. Two randomised controlled trials of 205 and 76 patients, have shown that these drugs improve bleeding control at the time of endoscopy (P = 0.012 and P = 0.034, respectively), reduce mortality and the need for rescue treatment in the first randomised controlled trial (P = 0.05), and reduce mortality at 15 days in the second randomised controlled trial (P = 0.035). No difference in control of bleeding has been identified between the different drugs. Current guidelines recommend commencing a vasoactive drug at presentation in suspected variceal bleeding with a suggested course of two to five days. Contraindications include cardiac or severe vascular disease.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113fqeic]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial infections are a frequent complication in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Antibiotic prophylaxis seems to decrease the incidence of bacterial infections. Oral antibiotics, active against enteric bacteria, have been commonly used as antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index EXPANDED until June 2010. In addition, we handsearched the references of all identified studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing different types of antibiotic prophylaxis with no intervention, placebo, or another antibiotic to prevent bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed trial quality, risk of bias, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Association measures were relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

Twelve trials (1241 patients) evaluated antibiotic prophylaxis compared with placebo or no antibiotic prophylaxis. All trials were at risk of bias. Antibiotic prophylaxis compared with no intervention or placebo was associated with beneficial effects on mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98), mortality from bacterial infections (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.97), bacterial infections (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.49), rebleeding (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74), days of hospitalisation (MD -1.91, 95% CI -3.80 to -0.02), bacteraemia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40), pneumonia (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57), and urinary tract infections (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.41). No serious adverse events were reported. The trials showed no significant heterogeneity of effects. Another five trials (650 patients) compared different antibiotic regimens. Data could not be combined as each trial used different antibiotic regimen. None of the examined antibiotic regimen was superior to the control regimen regarding mortality or bacterial infections.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding significantly reduced bacterial infections, and seems to have reduced all-cause mortality, bacterial infection mortality, rebleeding events, and hospitalisation length. These benefits were observed independently of the type of antibiotic used; thus, no specific antibiotic can be preferred. Therefore, antibiotic selection should be made considering local conditions such as bacterial resistance profile and treatment cost.

### Resuming aspirin in patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178JDNd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations of this meta-analysis include limitations in the methodology and the data analyzed, due to the poor quality of the majority of studies and the high levels of clinical and statistical heterogeneity. In that regard, current guidelines are based on limited data and/or expert opinion.

For patients taking aspirin for primary prophylaxis, our meta-analysis lends support to guidelines recommending stopping it after NVUGIB, although the evidence for that is weak. For patients taking aspirin for secondary prophylaxis, this review lends some support to resuming it once hemostasis is established, as this may be associated with reduced mortality, but may increase the risk of re-bleeding. Evidence supporting this recommendation is weak to moderate. Most thrombotic events start to occur about 8 days after aspirin is discontinued, and re-bleeding events occur within the first 5 days in those who resume it. An RCT is needed comparing resumption of aspirin vs. interruption of aspirin for 1 week in patients who require aspirin for secondary prevention. This RCT would compare the risk of re-bleeding in a homogeneous group of patients with high-risk stigmata who resume aspirin vs. those who do not. Time-dependent events would be expected to provide evidence on the best timing for aspirin resumption. Many questions remain unanswered. Whether aspirin should be discontinued at all in NVUGIB patients who are taking it for secondary prevention is unclear. Additionally, the exact timing for aspirin resumption remains unknown, and it remains challenging to balance the risks of thromboembolic events and re-bleeding.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Aspirin use increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but its effects on patients' clinical outcomes are uncertain
After non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, aspirin should not be resumed in patients taking it for primary prevention
After non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, aspirin should be resumed in patients taking it for secondary prevention

What the new findings are:

Evidence supporting a protective effect of aspirin resumption soon after non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is of low-to-moderate certainty
The available evidence is not informative as to the optimal timing of aspirin resumption

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111CvEtw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (NVUGIB) is a common emergency, affecting 44 to 99 per 100,000 persons every year. Peptic ulcer bleeding is the principal cause of NVUGIB. Significant bleeding can result in major consequences, such as acute coronary syndromes. The mortality from NVUGIB remains high. A recent UK national audit found a 9.6% in-hospital mortality rate. Recurrence of bleeding occurs in 8–26% of patients, and is associated with an even higher mortality. Mortality is also increased in the elderly.

Such a serious disease inspires constant research in the hope of decreasing complications and mortality. A number of practice guidelines have been developed to help clinicians manage patients with NVUGIB, including those issued by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), an International Consensus meeting, and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG). Of note, the Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology held a national consensus meeting on NVUGIB in Athens on June 8, 2008; the recommendations have not been published, but were remarkably similar to the International Consensus recommendations that were formed a few months later. The principle components of management include resuscitation, risk-stratification, endoscopy for diagnosis and appropriate intervention, and post-endoscopic acid-suppression. All of these factors are the subject of constant revision and rigorous testing to improve outcomes and, in the last three years in particular, the literature has grown considerably. This review serves to survey the most recent evidence to emerge in the management of NVUGIB and put in into context with recommendations from the recent practice guidelines.

### Endoscopic diagnosis and management of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^111Cnsyr]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; due to viruses, alcohol, and/or nonobese [BMI < 30kg/m²] nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] > 10mmHg and/or liver stiffness by transient elastography > 25 kPa) should receive, if no contraindications, nonselective beta blocker (NSBB) therapy (preferably carvedilol) to prevent the development of variceal bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in those patients unable to receive NSBB therapy with a screening upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that demonstrates high risk esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the endoscopic prophylactic treatment of choice. EBL should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until variceal eradication is achieved. Thereafter, surveillance EGD should be performed every 3–6 months in the first year following eradication. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute upper GI hemorrhage (UGIH) and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 70g/L prompting RBC transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin of 70-90g/L is desired. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends that patients with ACLD presenting with suspected acute variceal bleeding be risk stratified according to the Child-Pugh score and MELD score, and by documentation of active/inactive bleeding at the time of upper GI endoscopy. Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence. 5: ESGE recommends the vasoactive agents terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin be initiated at the time of presentation in patients with suspected acute variceal bleeding and be continued for a duration of up to 5 days. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends antibiotic prophylaxis using ceftriaxone 1g/day for up to 7 days for all patients with ACLD presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage, or in accordance with local antibiotic resistance and patient allergies. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends, in the absence of contraindications, intravenous erythromycin 250mg be given 30–120 minutes prior to upper GI endoscopy in patients with suspected acute variceal hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends that, in patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage, endoscopic evaluation should take place within 12 hours from the time of patient presentation provided the patient has been hemodynamically resuscitated. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends EBL for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH). Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 10: ESGE recommends that, in patients at high risk for recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding following successful endoscopic hemostasis (Child-Pugh C ≤ 13 or Child-Pugh B > 7 with active EVH at the time of endoscopy despite vasoactive agents, or HVPG > 20mmHg), pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) within 72 hours (preferably within 24 hours) must be considered. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 11: ESGE recommends that, for persistent esophageal variceal bleeding despite vasoactive pharmacological and endoscopic hemostasis therapy, urgent rescue TIPS should be considered (where available). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 12: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection for acute gastric (cardiofundal) variceal (GOV2, IGV1) hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 13: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection or EBL in patients with GOV1-specific bleeding. Strong recommendations, moderate quality evidence. 14: ESGE suggests urgent rescue TIPS or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) for gastric variceal bleeding when there is a failure of endoscopic hemostasis or early recurrent bleeding. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 15: ESGE recommends that patients who have undergone EBL for acute EVH should be scheduled for follow-up EBLs at 1- to 4-weekly intervals to eradicate esophageal varices (secondary prophylaxis). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 16: ESGE recommends the use of NSBBs (propranolol or carvedilol) in combination with endoscopic therapy for secondary prophylaxis in EVH in patients with ACLD. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.

### Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage: an update [^111g1UGQ]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage is a common cause for admission to hospital and is associated with a mortality of around 10%. Prompt assessment and resuscitation are vital, as are risk stratification of the severity of bleeding, early involvement of the multidisciplinary team and timely access to endoscopy, preferably within 24h. The majority of bleeds are due to peptic ulcers for which Helicobacter pylori and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are the main risk factors. Although proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used before endoscopy, this is controversial. Pre-endoscopic risk stratification with the Glasgow Blatchford score is recommended as is the use of the Rockall score postendoscopy. Endoscopic therapy, with at least two haemostatic modalities, remains the mainstay of treating high-risk lesions and reduces rebleeding rates and mortality. High-dose PPI therapy after endoscopic haemostasis also reduces rebleeding rates and mortality. Variceal oesophageal haemorrhage is associated with a higher rebleeding rate and risk of death. Antibiotics and vasopressin analogues are advised in suspected variceal bleeding; however, endoscopic variceal band ligation remains the haemostatic treatment of choice. Balloon tamponade remains useful in the presence of torrential variceal haemorrhage or when endoscopy fails to secure haemostasis, and can be a bridge to further endoscopic attempts or placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. This review aims to provide an update on the latest evidence-based recommendations for the management of acute upper GI haemorrhage.

Variceal bleeding

In cases of proven variceal bleeding, vasoactive drugs should be continued for two to five days as noted above. A meta-analysis of eight studies concluded that the combination of vasoactive drugs with endotherapy resulted in better initial control of bleeding and five day haemostasis than endotherapy alone, although this result did not translate to a survival benefit. In people with cirrhosis and UGIB, antibiotics should be administered for up to seven days, even if the cause of bleeding is non-variceal, owing to the risk of sepsis.

A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt decreases portal pressure and can also decrease the risk of variceal rebleeding. A multicentre, European randomised controlled trial of 63 patients Child-Pugh class C < 14 or class B with active bleeding reported reduced risk of rebleeding (3% v 50%, P < 0.001) and improved one year survival (86% v 61%, P < 0.001) in patients undergoing an early (< 72 h) so-called pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. An European guideline and the Baveno VII consensus now advocates the use of early pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (< 72 h) to be considered in patients bleeding from oesophageal varices, or gastro-oesophageal varices type I or II who have bleeding controlled by endotherapy but are at high risk of rebleeding. A Scottish, open label, randomised controlled trial done in two centres of 58 patients also reported a reduced risk of rebleeding (0% v 27.6%, P = 0.04) but no effect on survival (76.9% v 75.9%, P = 0.9). This study reported difficulty in delivering this so-called elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure within 72 h, which could be challenging for many centres globally. In patients with gastric varices and a clinical or anatomical contraindication to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, balloon occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration can be considered with outcomes appearing similar to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in a small retrospective study.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112hTHZ8]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency presentation requiring prompt resuscitation and management. Peptic ulcers are the most common cause of the condition. Thorough initial management with a structured approach is vital with appropriate intravenous fluid resuscitation and use of a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7–8 g/dL. Pre-endoscopic scoring tools enable identification of patients at high risk and at very low risk who might benefit from specific management. Endoscopy should be carried out within 24 h of presentation for patients admitted to hospital, although optimal timing for patients at a higher risk within this period is less clear. Endoscopic treatment of high risk lesions and use of subsequent high dose proton pump inhibitors is a cornerstone of non-variceal bleeding management. Variceal haemorrhage results in higher mortality than non-variceal haemorrhage and, if suspected, antibiotics and vasopressors should be administered urgently, before endoscopy. Oesophageal variceal bleeding requires endoscopic band ligation, whereas bleeding from gastric varices requires thrombin or tissue glue injection. Recurrent bleeding is managed by repeat endoscopic treatment. If uncontrolled bleeding occurs, interventional radiological embolisation or surgery is required for non-variceal bleeding or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement for variceal bleeding.

Considerations

Patients who experience peptic ulcer bleeding should be discharged home on oral PPI treatment. H 2 RA use is not an equivalent alternative. Attention should be paid to patients' concurrent medications, particularly the use of NSAIDs; they should be discontinued if possible. For those patients who require long-term ASA use, these drugs should be restarted as soon as the risk of cardiovascular complications outweighs the risk of rebleeding. PPIs should be administered for as long as ASA is used, but even so, patients should be made aware the risk of rebleeding is significantly reduced but not eliminated. Patients should be tested for H. pylori via endoscopic biopsy, be treated if infection is diagnosed, and undergo confirmation of eradication.

### Resuming aspirin in patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115nHU8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Our primary and secondary aims were to analyze the evidence surrounding mortality and re-bleeding risks in patients on aspirin with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) as a function of whether or not aspirin was resumed after the bleeding episode, and to determine whether aspirin intake upon admission affected the outcomes.

Methods

A search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies was performed. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were done. Generic inverse variance and random-effects model were employed. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the I² test. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach for each comparison and outcome, and an evidence profile was created.

Results

Evidence from 1 RCT and 4 observational studies suggests that early aspirin resumption reduced mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.63) while increasing re-bleeding risk (HR 1.90, 95%CI 0.60–6.00); moderate certainty of evidence. The observational evidence was inconsistent for both mortality (HR 0.84, 95%CI 0.54–1.33) and re-bleeding (HR 0.85, 95%CI 0.47–1.55); very low certainty of evidence. Nine observational studies addressed our secondary aim: 6 provided inconsistent results regarding mortality (pooled odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95%CI 0.80–1.50) and 4 provided inconsistent results regarding re-bleeding risk (pooled OR 0.92, 95%CI 0.53–1.59); very low certainty of evidence for both outcomes.

Conclusion

Evidence supporting a protective effect of aspirin resumption soon after NVUGIB is of low-to-moderate certainty, and is not informative as to the optimal timing of aspirin resumption.

We recommend giving intravenous antibiotics to all patients with suspected cirrhosis/variceal bleeding

Level of evidence: High

Strength of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 100%

Bundle recommendation: Intravenous antibiotics if suspected cirrhosis/variceal bleeding (100% agreement)

Bacterial infections are common in patients with cirrhosis and AUGIB and are associated with rebleeding and mortality. A Cochrane meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (n = 1241) concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis in this context was superior to placebo in reducing mortality, bacterial infections, rebleeding and LOS. The benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis has also been observed following endoscopic haemostasis for peptic ulcer bleeding. There is evidence to support the use of intravenous prophylactic antibiotics over oral agents. Fernandez et al randomised patients (n = 111) with AUGIB and cirrhosis to either oral norfloxacin (400 mg twice daily) or intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g/day) for 7 days, and assessed outcomes within 10 days. Patients assigned to intravenous ceftriaxone had lower rates of proven infections, bacteraemia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In accordance with the BSG/BASL cirrhosis bundle, patients with cirrhosis and AUGIB should be empirically managed as variceal bleeding and commenced on antibiotic prophylaxis according to local antimicrobial policy.

We recommend continuing aspirin at presentation

Level of evidence: Moderate

Level of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 90%

Bundle recommendation: Continue aspirin (80% agreement)

### Management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1112pdab]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common medical emergency, with a reported mortality of 2–10%. Patients identified as being at very low risk of either needing an intervention or death can be managed as outpatients. For all other patients, intravenous fluids as needed for resuscitation and red cell transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold of 70–80 g/L are recommended. After resuscitation is initiated, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and the prokinetic agent erythromycin may be administered, with antibiotics and vasoactive drugs recommended in patients who have cirrhosis. Endoscopy should be undertaken within 24 hours, with earlier endoscopy considered after resuscitation in patients at high risk, such as those with hemodynamic instability. Endoscopic treatment is used for variceal bleeding (for example, ligation for esophageal varices and tissue glue for gastric varices) and for high risk non-variceal bleeding (for example, injection, thermal probes, or clips for lesions with active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessel). Patients who require endoscopic therapy for ulcer bleeding should receive high dose proton pump inhibitors after endoscopy, whereas those who have variceal bleeding should continue taking antibiotics and vasoactive drugs. Recurrent ulcer bleeding is treated with repeat endoscopic therapy, with subsequent bleeding managed by interventional radiology or surgery. Recurrent variceal bleeding is generally treated with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. In patients who require antithrombotic agents, outcomes appear to be better when these drugs are reintroduced early.

### Endoscopy for nonvariceal upper-GI bleeding… [^114v8Pfg]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Transfusion is appropriate if blood loss is significant. Intravenous or oral proton pump inhibitors can help reduce gastric lining irritation. Researchers have found that somatostatin and its analog octreotide reduced portal blood flow to the stomach and duodenum, resulting in decreased risk of continuous hemorrhage and surgical intervention. These actions may be considered temporary treatments before endoscopy. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Practice Committee recently reviewed prospective trials, series reports, and expert opinions on the role of endoscopy in managing acute nonvariceal upper GI bleeding. Endoscopy is most beneficial when initiated soon after upper GI bleeding begins and can decrease the duration of hospitalization and the need for transfusion. Intravenous erythromycin administered before endoscopy promotes gastric emptying and improves the diagnostic quality of the examination.

Emergency department physicians can assess the risk for recurrent bleeding and recommend outpatient treatment or possible endoscopic treatment. Signs of high-risk bleeding include active arterial bleeding, nonbleeding visible vessels, nonbleeding adherent clots, and ulcer oozing. Peptic ulcer disease is the most common cause of upper GI bleeding. Endoscopic therapy including laser treatment, electrocautery, heat probe, and epinephrine injection are all effective compared with placebo or no treatment. The success of these modalities usually is determined by the skill of the physician performing them. Physicians should test patients with upper GI bleeding for H. pylori through biopsy, because rapid urease tests have reduced sensitivity in this setting. Patients with positive test results should be treated to eradicate the infection.

Upper GI bleeding recurrence after endoscopic therapy can occur in up to 24 percent of high-risk patients. Adding PPI therapy to endoscopic treatment, however, reduces the risk to 10 percent. The authors suggest that repeat endoscopic surveillance is appropriate for patients with high-risk lesions, but the precise role of endoscopy for recurrent bleeding has yet to be defined. The ASGE Practice Committee concluded that endoscopy is effective in the diagnosis and treatment of upper GI bleeding, although the superiority between the individual endoscopic treatments has not been determined. The committee recommends that patients with a high risk of recurrent bleeding receive closer monitoring and possible repeat endoscopy.

Results

Study details and demographics

A total of 149 records were retrieved based on our search strategy. After a comprehensive review of the published literature, a total of 20 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. All included studies were published between 2011 and 2019.

Study details and baseline demographics are summarized in Table 1. A total of 2 RCTs and 18 observational studies (retrospective and prospective) were part of the final analysis (Table 1). The risk of overall bias in the included RCTs was low to moderate. The included cohort studies had a score of ≥ 5 on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Publication bias was difficult to assess, as only 4 studies included a control arm. These studies are represented in the relative risk (RR) meta-analysis. The total number of patients across all studies was 1280.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1134SYrS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, individual RCTs that compared different regimens of PPIs in peptic ulcer bleeding and even the meta-analysis of these trials remain severely underpowered. What is worse, it is not likely that an adequately powered RCT will be conducted in the near future due to feasibility issues and lack of funding from pharmaceutical companies facing increasing generic competition. Then how will we be able to decide on this issue? It seems that, for the time being, a reasonable approach is the approach chosen by the international consensus group who stated that "strong evidence demonstrates the efficacy of high-dose IV PPI therapy after successful endoscopy, but it is not possible to make conclusions regarding the efficacy of either lower intravenous doses or high-dose oral therapy". This statement was largely based on the results of a 2006 Cochrane review that showed that, among patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions who had received endoscopic hemostatic therapy, high dose IV PPI therapy (80 mg bolus plus 8 mg/h continuous infusion) significantly reduced rebleeding and mortality, while lower doses (IV or oral) significantly reduced rebleeding but had no demonstrable effect on mortality. The 2013 update of that review showed very similar results.

It is important to note that even if the guideline recommendations are followed, a significant proportion of patients will rebleed; there is still room for improvement in the management of patients with NVUGIB, especially in those who have been found to have high-risk endoscopic lesions. A recent RCT attempted to improve outcomes for these patients. 105 patients with upper GI bleeding and high-risk endoscopic lesions were treated successfully with endoscopic combination treatment and were started on IV PPI treatment. Then, they were randomized to either receive supplementary (preventive) transcatheter arterial embolization or continue standard treatment. The group that received preventive embolization therapy experienced less rebleeding episodes (2 versus 8 patients). The results did not reach statistical significance as the study was underpowered, but the concept is worth further research.

Consensus guidelines suggest that clinicians not routinely perform a repeat endoscopy during hospital admission unless the patient experiences evidence of rebleeding. This recommendation was reached despite the fact that two systematic review and meta-analyses of RCTs had suggested some benefits. The main reason for this apparent discrepancy between guidelines and meta-analyses was that the vast majority of the RCTs included in these meta-analyses had used endoscopic and medical treatments that would have been considered suboptimal nowadays; therefore their results are not applicable to current practice.

### International consensus group issues recommendations for… [^114eLnGy]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

New recommendation: Promotility agents should not be used routinely before endoscopy to increase the diagnostic yield. Although promotility agents may be useful in selected patients with suspected blood in the stomach, they are not recommended for routine use in patients with upper GI bleeding. Revised recommendation: The role of endoscopic therapy for ulcers with adherent clots is controversial. Intensive PPI therapy alone may be sufficient. Endoscopic therapy for adherent clots involves preinjecting with epinephrine before shaving, followed by applying combination treatment to the remaining stigmata of hemorrhage. A meta-analysis of five RCTs involving patients with adherent clots found no significant benefits for endoscopic therapy compared with no endoscopic therapy. Revised recommendation: Patients with bleeding peptic ulcers should be tested for Helicobacter pylori and receive eradication therapy if it is present, with confirmation of eradication. Postdischarge, Aspirin, and NSAIDs New recommendation: In patients with previous ulcer bleeding who require a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, treatment with a traditional NSAID plus PPI or a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor alone is associated with a clinically important risk of recurrent bleeding. New recommendation: In patients with previous ulcer bleeding who require an NSAID, the combination of a PPI and a COX-2 inhibitor is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent bleeding compared with COX-2 inhibitors alone. Adding a PPI to traditional NSAID therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of upper GI complications, although the combination of a COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI was associated with the greatest reduction in risk. Other studies found a decreased risk of endoscopic ulcers with a COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI, compared with a COX-2 inhibitor alone.

New recommendation: In patients with previous ulcer bleeding who require cardiovascular prophylaxis, clopi-dogrel alone has a higher risk of rebleeding than aspirin combined with a PPI. Two RCTs showed a significant reduction in rebleeding in patients taking aspirin plus a PPI compared with those receiving clopidogrel alone, although there was no significant effect on mortality.

### Consensus recommendations for managing patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^117Fzesk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The management of patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding has evolved substantially over the past 10 years amid a paucity of published consensus guidelines.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based management recommendations that address clinically relevant issues. REVIEW AND CONSENSUS PROCESSES: A multidisciplinary consensus group of 25 voting participants representing 11 national societies used a 7-step approach to develop recommendation statements according to accepted standards. Sources of data included narrative and systematic reviews as well as published and new meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence, the strength of the recommendation, and the level of consensus were graded according to recognized classifications.

Main Findings

Recommendations emphasize appropriate initial resuscitation of the patient and a multidisciplinary approach to clinical risk stratification that determines the need for early endoscopy. Early endoscopy allows safe and prompt discharge of selected patients classified as low risk. Endoscopic hemostasis is reserved for patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions. Although monotherapy with injection or thermal coagulation is effective, the combination is superior to either treatment alone. The placement of endoscopic clips for endoscopic hemostasis appears promising. High-dose intravenous proton-pump inhibition is recommended in patients who have undergone successful endoscopic therapy. Routine second-look endoscopy is not recommended. Patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding should be tested for Helicobacter pylori infection and receive eradication therapy if infection is present.

Future Directions

The efficacy of newer endoscopic therapeutic technologies, the optimal regimen of proton-pump inhibition, and the roles of other pharmacologic agents require further research.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^116irHsM]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding remains an important emergency condition, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. As endoscopic therapy is the 'gold standard' of management, treatment of these patients can be considered in three stages: pre-endoscopic treatment, endoscopic haemostasis and post-endoscopic management. Since publication of the Asia-Pacific consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) 7 years ago, there have been significant advancements in the clinical management of patients in all three stages. These include pre-endoscopy risk stratification scores, blood and platelet transfusion, use of proton pump inhibitors; during endoscopy new haemostasis techniques (haemostatic powder spray and over-the-scope clips); and post-endoscopy management by second-look endoscopy and medication strategies. Emerging techniques, including capsule endoscopy and Doppler endoscopic probe in assessing adequacy of endoscopic therapy, and the pre-emptive use of angiographic embolisation, are attracting new attention. An emerging problem is the increasing use of dual antiplatelet agents and direct oral anticoagulants in patients with cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases. Guidelines on the discontinuation and then resumption of these agents in patients presenting with NVUGIB are very much needed. The Asia-Pacific Working Group examined recent evidence and recommends practical management guidelines in this updated consensus statement.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^115ajoDZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

(Reject — agreement: 23%)

Recurrent bleeding occurs in 8–15% of patients with peptic ulcer bleeding and is associated with a two- to fivefold increase in mortality. The objective of routine second-look endoscopy, usually performed within 24 hours after index endoscopy, is to pre-emptively treat peptic ulcers with persistent stigmata of recent haemorrhage before they start bleeding again.

Second-look endoscopy was first investigated for its efficacy in prevention of peptic ulcer rebleeding by a few prospective randomised trials in the 1990s. The results from these randomised trials were conflicting. Some showed that second-look endoscopy and repeated endoscopic haemostasis were effective in preventing recurrent haemorrhagewhile others demonstrated no efficacy. The reasons for these conflicting results included recruitment of patients with different levels of rebleeding risk, a non-standardised method of primary haemostasis and variation in the performance of second-look endoscopy. A meta-analysis based on eight prospective randomised trials concluded that second-look endoscopy reduced rebleeding in the absence of high-dose PPI especially in patients at very high risk. Analysis of these pooled data also suggested that second-look endoscopy reduced the need for surgery but had no significant effect on mortality. However, after removing two trials that included patients with a high risk of rebleeding, no benefit from second-look endoscopy was found. A recent randomised trial compared intravenous PPI infusion with second-look endoscopy in patients after receiving endosocopic haemostasis for peptic ulcer bleeding. It demonstrated no difference in recurrent bleeding, need for surgery and mortality between the two treatment strategies. Furthermore, second-look endoscopy did not appear to be cost-effective when offered to all patients.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), especially peptic ulcer bleeding, remains one of the most important cause of hospitalisation and mortality world wide. In Asia, with a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, a potential difference in drug metabolism, and a difference in clinical management of UGIB due to variable socioeconomic environments, it is considered necessary to re-examine the International Consensus of Non-variceal Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding with emphasis on data generated from the region. The working group, which comprised experts from 12 countries from Asia, recommended the use of the Blatchford score for selection of patients who require endoscopic intervention and which would allow early discharge of patients at low risk. Patients' comorbid conditions should be included in risk assessment. A pre-endoscopy proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is recommended as a stop-gap treatment when endoscopy within 24 h is not available. An adherent clot on a peptic ulcer should be treated with endoscopy combined with a PPI if the clot cannot be removed. Routine repeated endoscopy is not recommended. High-dose intravenous and oral PPIs are recommended but low-dose intravenous PPIs should be avoided. COX-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined with a PPI are recommended for patients with very high risk of UGIB. Aspirin should be resumed soon after stabilisation and clopidogrel alone is no safer than aspirin plus a PPI. When dual antiplatelet agents are used, prophylactic use of a PPI reduces the risk of adverse gastrointestinal events.

### Towards personalised management for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113A8nA2]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Guidelines from national and international professional societies on upper gastrointestinal bleeding highlight the important clinical issues but do not always identify specific management strategies pertaining to individual patients. Optimal treatment should consider the personal needs of an individual patient and the pertinent resources and experience available at the point of care. This article integrates international guidelines and consensus into three stages of management: pre-endoscopic assessment and treatment, endoscopic evaluation and haemostasis and postendoscopic management. We emphasise the need for personalised management strategies based on patient characteristics, nature of bleeding lesions and the clinical setting including available resources.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^11441jbM]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

(Reject — agreement: 66%)

There are now at least six RCTs, comprising 2223 patients with UGIB being studied for the benefit of pre-endoscopy intravenous PPIs. With PPIs, the stigmata of haemorrhage will be downgraded and hence endoscopic therapy less frequently needed, yet there is no reduction in recurrent bleeding, surgery and overall mortality between PPI and control treatment. The Cochrane review which pooled these six studies concluded that PPI treatment before endoscopy might reduce the proportion of patients requiring endoscopic therapy without affecting clinically significant outcomes. It is possible that the overall costs of treatment and the need for experienced endoscopists could be reduced; however, the clinical impact is uncertain.

The working group noted that many physicians use intravenous PPIs for patients presenting in stable conditions with symptoms suggestive of UGIB, while waiting for endoscopy. These are commonly administered at the ER or at primary care clinics. This statement pertains to patients who are 'stable' or 'suspected' of UGIB waiting for endoscopy. The working group members voted to reject indiscriminate use of IV PPIs in such circumstances as there is no proven value. Indiscriminate use of IV PPIs will increase the cost of managing NVUGIB. This statement should be read differently from the previous Asia-Pacific Working Group consensus which stated that pre-endoscopy PPI is recommended where early endoscopy or endoscopic expertise is not available within 24 hours. When endoscopy facilities or endoscopy expertise are not available within 24 hours, downgrading stigmata of recent haemorrhage and reducing the requirement for endoscopic intervention becomes much more justified.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^116sczUY]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding — initial medical management and antithrombotic considerations: Target hemoglobin is generally 9 g/dL in patients with significant cardiovascular disease and 7 g/dL for all others, and the consensus recommendation was for blood transfusion for hemoglobin levels < 8 g/dL with a threshold for those with cardiovascular disease. Intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be administered to all patients with suspected NVUGIB and should not delay endoscopic intervention, and high-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be continued post endoscopy because their use is associated with decreased risk of rebleeding. The need for reversal of antithrombotic medications requires careful consideration of the risks of thromboembolic events, these decisions should be made by the gastroenterologist in consultation with intensivists, cardiologists, neurologists, and hematologists, and when there is doubt, it is usually better to err on the side of not reversing AT medication because a cardiopulmonary or neurologic thromboembolic event is usually far more devastating than ongoing NVUGIB.

Considerations

Patients with lesions found on endoscopy should be treated based on the appearance of the lesion. Lower-risk lesions should be treated medically. Higher-risk lesions should be treated with endoscopic intervention such as hemoclip or thermocoagulation. While there are no strict guidelines on the use of one modality over another, for Dieulafoy lesions, clinicians can consider the combined use of hemoclip and sclerosant injection for more definitive therapy, though there is not yet enough evidence to recommend this as standard therapy. Finally, Hemospray, a relatively novel mechanical hemostatic therapy, has some evidence to suggest it is a useful modality for non-variceal upper GI bleeding, especially in bleeding from wide-spread malignant lesions. However, even in jurisdictions where it is approved for use, consideration should be paid to more standard treatments first, until comparative trials of Hemospray to other modalities provides evidence for its non-inferiority or superiority compared to existing modalities.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^1148rpvr]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Statement 13: In patients receiving dual antiplatelet agents, at least one antiplatelet agent should be resumed in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding

(Accept — agreement: 94.4%, level of evidence: low)

The most commonly used antiplatelet agents are ASA (aspirin), a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor and thienopyridines that bind to P2Y12 component of the adenosine diphosphate receptors. After stopping ASA, 7–9 days are required to regain full platelet function, whereas in the case of thienopyridines (such as clopidogrel or prasugrel), the minimum duration to restore platelet function is 5–7 days. Use of dual antiplatelet agents, often ASA plus a thienopyridine, may confer a threefold increase in the risk of UGIB over single-agent antithrombotic therapy. There are no data guiding the management of these patients using dual antiplatelet therapy when they develop UGIB. We do not recommend withholding both antiplatelet drugs because the median time to coronary stent thrombosis can be as short as 7 days with both drugs withheld as compared with 122 days with only clopidogrel withheld. Balancing the risk and benefit of discontinuation of antiplatelet agents, the ASGE recommends that cessation of all antiplatelet therapy after PCI should be avoided, and furthermore, when only one antiplatelet agent is used, aspirin should be continued as it is associated with a lower risk for causing recurrent bleeding. On the other hand, for patients with a high risk of thrombosis, such as those with drug-eluting coronary stents, clopidogrel should not be discontinued for more than 5 days.

Cardiologists' opinion should be sought for the commencement of antiplatelet agents. In patients with low risk of recurrent bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, antiplatelet agents should not be discontinued at all. The working group consider that this statement is primarily based on pharmacological characteristics of the antiplatelet agents. Clinical trials to test the safety of this strategy are eagerly awaited. The level of evidence was considered low.

Statement 14: Among direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) or warfarin users with high cardiothrombotic risk who develop ulcer bleeding, DOAC or warfarin should be resumed as soon as haemostasis is established

CI, confidence interval

In studies where follow up was for more than 6 months after aspirin resumption, a meta-analysis of 2 studies where aspirin was used for secondary prevention found a pooled HR of 0.80 (95%CI 0.56–1.15; I² = 16%) for mortality in patients who resumed aspirin compared to those who discontinued it (Fig. 3B). However, one observational study where aspirin was used for primary prevention found an HR of 0.56 (95%CI 0.08–3.82) for mortality in patients who resumed aspirin compared to those who discontinued it (Fig. 3B). Certainty of evidence was very low. The P-value of the test for the subgroup effect was 0.71.

Effects of aspirin resumption on re-bleeding

The RCT did not exclude an increase in the risk of re-bleeding in patients who resumed aspirin compared to those who did not (Fig. 2C), with moderate certainty of evidence, rated down due to very serious imprecision (Table 1).

A meta-analysis of 3 observational studies generated a pooled HR for re-bleeding in patients who resumed aspirin compared to those who discontinued it of 0.85 (95%CI 0.47–1.55; I² = 53%; Fig. 2D), with very low certainty of evidence, rated down due to imprecision and inconsistency (Table 1).

A meta-analysis of 3 observational studies and the RCT combined found a pooled HR for the effect of aspirin resumption on re-bleeding of 0.97 (95%CI 0.58–1.64; I² = 45%), with very low certainty of evidence, rated down due to imprecision.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^117XodNC]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Important advances in the management of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) have been made. The concept of pre-endoscopic treatment has changed. New devices in endoscopic haemostasis have been introduced. The increasing use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants has complicated the picture. Endoscopic interventions, such as mucosectomy and endoscopic submucosal dissection, have become standard care. These procedures are associated with marked risks of bleeding. For these reasons, the Asia-Pacific Working Group felt that it was necessary to update their consensus recommendations for the management of NVUGIB.

Similar to the previous Asia-Pacific consensus statements published in 2011, this update aims to produce management guidelines for clinicians practising in community or referral hospitals. The Asia-Pacific Working Group decided that there was no need to repeat guideline statements previously recommended unless there was a change of view, but only to highlight recommendations based on new evidence reported in the past 5–10 years. Therefore, the 2011 consensus recommendations that are not dealt with in this update are considered to be still valid for the management of NVUGIB. The working group continued to use the same modified Delphi process as beforebut chose to divide the updated consensus into three sections: (1) pre-endoscopic management, (2) endoscopic management and (3) post-endoscopic management of NVUGIB.

### When to use antibiotics in the cirrhotic patient? The evidence base [^113zuy3V]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

In soft tissue infections with S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia e, E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa most frequently being the infecting organisms, the most appropriate regimen is ceftazidime (2 g/8 h IV) plus oxacillin (2 g/6 h IV). Soft tissue infections must be treated for a minimum of 10 days. In all cases, the duration of antibiotic therapy depends on response to treatment and resolution of infection.

With microbial infections being so common and severe in patients with liver cirrhosis, it is important to target high-risk patients, such as those with acute gastrointestinal bleeding and SBP. In such instances infection is frequently caused by translocation of GNB of intestinal origin. Prevention is by selective intestinal decontamination, and is best based on long-term maintenance of a fluoroquinolone.

Bacterial infections are particularly common in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding, when treated by endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy. A meta-analysis of trials in patients with variceal bleeding has shown that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence of severe infections (SBP and/or septicemia) and decreased mortality. Mortality due to variceal hemorrhage is decreased from 43% to 15% over a 20-year period and antibiotic prophylaxis is independently associated with improved survival. Oral norfloxacin (800 mg/day for 7 days) is commonly used, although in a randomized controlled trial IV ceftriaxone (1 g/day for 7 days) was more effective than oral norfloxacin with respect to the prevention of severe infections in patients with advanced cirrhosis (characterized by at least two of the following: ascites, severe malnutrition, encephalopathy, or bilirubin > 3 mg/dL) and variceal hemorrhage.

### Resuming aspirin in patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117BYeSN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

A major limitation of the current guidelines is that they are based on a limited number of studies involving a small number of patients who experienced a small number of events. In addition, there was substantial variability in the duration of follow up, timing of aspirin resumption, and the time point from which events were included in the analyses. Finally, some studies included only patients with severe bleeding who required endoscopic therapy, while others included all-comers with NVUGIB.

The primary aim of our study was to synthesize the evidence for all-cause mortality and re-bleeding with resuming vs. not resuming aspirin amongst patients admitted with NVUGIB. A secondary aim was to determine whether being on aspirin at the time of admission for NVUGIB is associated with better or worse outcomes compared to not being on aspirin.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^114QWD2m]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

(Accept — agreement: 83.3%, level of evidence: low)

Clinical evidence is lacking to support strategies for managing patients with NVUGIB and high cardiothrombotic risk who receive DOAC or warfarin. For such patients with atrial fibrillation and/or valvular heart diseases, management should depend on the balance between thrombotic risk and bleeding risk. In acute NVUGIB, DOAC or warfarin should be withheld to facilitate achievement of haemostasis.

If the patient is taking warfarin, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma can be given for life-threatening GI bleeding. Warfarin reversal should be used for life-threatening bleeding irrespective of the international normalised ratio (INR). Current evidence does not show any correlation between INR at presentation and outcomes of GI bleeding. A combination of PCC and vitamin K is preferred for urgent reversal of warfarin. PCC has advantages over fresh-frozen plasma such as faster onset of action and minimal risk of fluid overload. Endoscopic therapy should not be delayed in patients with serious UGIB. Warfarin and DOAC treatment should be withheld in patients with ongoing NVUGIB.

Description

This update of the 2010 International Consensus Recommendations on the Management of Patients With Nonvariceal Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB) refines previous important statements and presents new clinically relevant recommendations.

Methods

An international multidisciplinary group of experts developed the recommendations. Data sources included evidence summarized in previous recommendations, as well as systematic reviews and trials identified from a series of literature searches of several electronic bibliographic databases from inception to April 2018. Using an iterative process, group members formulated key questions. Two methodologists prepared evidence profiles and assessed quality (certainty) of evidence relevant to the key questions according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Group members reviewed the evidence profiles and, using a consensus process, voted on recommendations and determined the strength of recommendations as strong or conditional.

Recommendations

Preendoscopic management: The group suggests using a Glasgow Blatchford score of 1 or less to identify patients at very low risk for rebleeding, who may not require hospitalization. In patients without cardiovascular disease, the suggested hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion is less than 80 g/L, with a higher threshold for those with cardiovascular disease. Endoscopic management: The group suggests that patients with acute UGIB undergo endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation. Thermocoagulation and sclerosant injection are recommended, and clips are suggested, for endoscopic therapy in patients with high-risk stigmata. Use of TC-325 (hemostatic powder) was suggested as temporizing therapy, but not as sole treatment, in patients with actively bleeding ulcers. Pharmacologic management: The group recommends that patients with bleeding ulcers with high-risk stigmata who have had successful endoscopic therapy receive high-dose proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy (intravenous loading dose followed by continuous infusion) for 3 days. For these high-risk patients, continued oral PPI therapy is suggested twice daily through 14 days, then once daily for a total duration that depends on the nature of the bleeding lesion. Secondary prophylaxis: The group suggests PPI therapy for patients with previous ulcer bleeding who require antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy for cardiovascular prophylaxis.

### Role of medical therapy for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1176Ek1N]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Mortality from UGIB has remained 5–10% over the past decade. This article presents current evidence-based recommendations for the medical management of UGIB. Preendoscopic management includes initial resuscitation, risk stratification, appropriate use of blood products, and consideration of nasogastric tube insertion, erythromycin, and proton pump inhibitor therapy. The use of postendoscopic intravenous proton pump inhibitors is strongly recommended for certain patient populations. Postendoscopic management also includes the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori, appropriate use of proton pump inhibitors and iron replacement therapy.

Recommendations: control of active variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (Figure 3)
Suggestions for resuscitation and initial management Units offering an emergency acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding service should have expertise in VBL, balloon tamponade and management of gastric variceal bleeding (level 5, grade D). Transfuse patients with massive bleeding with blood, platelets and clotting factors in line with local protocols for managing massive bleeding (level 5, grade D). Base decisions on blood transfusion on the full clinical picture, recognising that overtransfusion may be as damaging as undertransfusion. A restrictive transfusion policy aiming for a haemoglobin of 70–80 g/L is suggested in haemodynamically stable patients (level 1b, grade B). Do not offer platelet transfusion to patients who are not actively bleeding and are haemodynamically stable (level 5, grade D). Offer platelet transfusion to patients who are actively bleeding and have a platelet count of < 50×10⁹/L (level 5, grade D). Offer fresh frozen plasma to patients who have either: a fibrinogen level of < 1 g/L (level 5, grade D), or a prothrombin time (international normalised ratio) or activated partial thromboplastin time > 1.5 times normal (level 5, grade D). Offer prothrombin complex concentrate to patients who are taking warfarin and actively bleeding (level 5, grade D). Treat patients who are taking warfarin and whose upper gastrointestinal bleeding has stopped in line with local warfarin protocols (level 5, grade D). There is insufficient evidence for the use of recombinant factor VIIa in acute variceal haemorrhage (level 1b, grade B).
Suggestions for timing of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: Offer endoscopy to unstable patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding immediately after resuscitation (level 5, grade A). Offer endoscopy within 24 h of admission to all other patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (level 2b, grade A). Units seeing more than 330 cases a year should offer daily endoscopy lists. Units seeing fewer than 330 cases a year should arrange their service according to local circumstances (level 5, grade D).
Control of bleeding: Antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected or confirmed variceal bleeding (level 1a, grade A). In all patients, vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin or somatostatin are recommended and should be started as soon variceal bleeding is suspected and continued until haemostasis is achieved or for up to 5 days. Octreotide (unlicensed) is suggested if terlipressin or somatostatin are unavailable (level 1a, grade A). Variceal band ligation is recommended as the preferred endoscopic method (level 1a, grade A). After satisfactory haemostasis with the methods above, and depending on local resources, early covered TIPSS (< 72 h after index variceal bleed) can be considered in selected patients with Child's B cirrhosis and active bleeding or Child's C cirrhosis with Child's score < 14 (level 1b, grade B). Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B).
Failure to control active bleeding: If bleeding is difficult to control, a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube should be inserted until further endoscopic treatment, TIPSS or surgery is performed depending on local resources and expertise (level 1b, grade B). Specialist help should be sought at this time and transfer to a specialist centre should be considered. Units that do not offer a TIPSS service should identify a specialist centre which offers a 24 h emergency TIPSS service and have appropriate arrangements for safe transfer of patients in place (level 2a, grade B).
Areas requiring further study: The efficacy of restrictive blood transfusion in variceal haemorrhage. The role of blood products in variceal haemorrhage. The utility of early TIPSS (< 72 h) in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of removable oesophageal stents in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of haemostatic powders in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of proton pump inhibitors in variceal haemorrhage.
Quality indicators Antibiotic administration in acute variceal bleeding within 1 day either before or after the procedure (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received antibiotics within 1 day either before or after the procedure. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed. Endoscopy performed within 24 h of presentation of an acute variceal bleed (level 2b, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received endoscopy within 24 h of presentation. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) epidemiology and initial management — NVUGIB is described as a serious clinical problem with an incidence of approximately 61–78 per 100,000 persons in the United States in 2009–2012 and mortality estimated to be between 2% and 10%. Endoscopic evaluation and treatment remains the clinical mainstay of care in hemodynamically stabilized patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, typically esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Although endoscopy is a cornerstone in the management of NVUGIB, it should come after triage, medical management, and stabilization.

### Comparison of risk scoring systems for patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding: international multicentre prospective study [^116WH2ZV]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

The study was undertaken in Yale-New Haven Hospital (USA), Glasgow Royal Infirmary (Scotland), Royal Cornwall Hospital Truro (England), Odense University Hospital (Denmark), Singapore General Hospital (Singapore), and Dunedin Hospital (New Zealand).

The predetermined clinical endpoints were the composite endpoint of need for hospital based intervention (red blood cell transfusion, endoscopic treatment, interventional radiology, or surgery) or death, endoscopic treatment, 30 day mortality, rebleeding within seven days, and length of hospital stay.

Patient management

Patients were included if they presented to the hospital with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding defined by haematemesis, coffee-ground vomiting, or melaena. We excluded patients who developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding while an inpatient for another reason.

All patients presenting to each hospital with upper gastrointestinal bleeding were initially assessed in the emergency department or acute assessment unit. Two centres (Glasgow and Odense) had a policy of non-admission for those with Glasgow Blatchford scores of 1 or less, and one centre (Truro) for those with Glasgow Blatchford scores of 2 or less and aged less than 70 years, unless required for other reasons. Outpatient endoscopy was arranged in all three centres. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were not routinely given to all admitted patients before endoscopy. The practice in all centres was to perform endoscopy within 24 hours in all admitted patients where possible. After endoscopy, the policy in all centres was to administer high dose PPIs by intravenous bolus followed by infusion to patients with high risk ulcer stigmata who required endoscopic treatment, and to other selected patients depending on clinical judgment. For patients with suspected variceal bleeding, the policy in all centres was to give intravenous vasopressors and antibiotics before endoscopy.

The endoscopic practice in all centres for patients with high risk stigmata of non-variceal bleeding was by injection of dilute adrenaline (epinephrine) into and around the bleeding point, thermal contact or clips, or both, but not adrenaline alone. Band ligation or injection of tissue glue with or without transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt was performed in cases of oesophageal or gastric variceal bleeding, respectively. In line with recent evidence and guidelines, the policy was to administer red blood cells at a haemoglobin threshold of 70–80 g/L (7–8 g/dL), or as guided by the clinician in patients with severe haemorrhage.

Post-discharge management

For patients with lesions identified on endoscopy, it is recommended they be started on an oral anti-secretory agent. PPIs are the pharmacologic agent of choice in these patients; H 2 RAs are generally regarded as inadequate. This was demonstrated most recently by an excellent publication by Ng et al in 2010. 130 patients who experienced dyspepsia or bleeding while taking acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and were found to have peptic ulcers or multiple erosions at endoscopy were randomized to receive either famotidine 40 mg twice daily or pantoprazole 20 mg once daily (with evening placebo) for 7 weeks. All patients remained on ASA (160 mg daily), and were treated for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection if this was present. Patients on pantoprazole experienced significantly fewer symptoms from ulcers or erosions and, most importantly, significantly fewer bleeding episodes.

Practice guidelines recommend the use of PPI for all patients with previous ulcer bleeding who require treatment with any non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). They make particular note that the use of clopidogrel alone presents a greater risk for rebleeding than does the use of ASA combined with a PPI.

Many patients who experience upper GI bleeding are already taking or will eventually require treatment with ASA. While ASA is a known risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease, many patients should be taking ASA for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. As weighing the risks of bleeding versus coronary artery disease can be difficult, Sung et al recently performed a single-center, non-inferiority double blind RCT in Hong Kong wherein they randomized 156 patients who developed peptic ulcer bleeding while prescribed ASA to restart (immediately after endoscopic hemostasis) taking ASA 80 mg daily over 8 weeks or switch to placebo for 8 weeks. All patients were given daily omeprazole. Patients taking ASA had a non-significant increase in the rate of rebleeding, but also a significantly lower all-cause mortality rate (HR 0.2, 95% CI 0.05–0.90). This lends more credibility to the idea that ASA should be resumed in patients even after experiencing a bleeding ulcer. It would be useful if future studies compare less extreme strategies (e.g. restarting ASA immediately or 2 days after endoscopic hemostasis versus restarting in 7 days).

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^1156CfEd]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding — hemostatic powder (TC-325/Hemospray) is available in North America and in most instances should be preferentially used as a rescue therapy and not for primary hemostasis, except in cases of malignant bleeding or massive bleeding with inability to perform thermal therapy or hemoclip placement. Technique considerations include that both 7F and 10F catheters are available for different-sized accessory channels, the channel can be preflushed with air (or using a 60-mL syringe) to avoid premature activation, and once at the lesion the spray is typically deployed from a distance of 1–2 cm away in short controlled bursts. Retrospective studies showed the powder remains present less than 24 hours; hence monotherapy with TC-325 is not recommended in ulcers with high-risk stigmata for rebleeding, and in these situations it should be used as a temporary measure to stop bleeding followed by another modality at the initial procedure or during a second-look endoscopy. Nonetheless, 2 pilot RCTs and a noncontrolled registry study have suggested a potential role for TC-325/Hemospray as monotherapy, raising the need for an appropriately powered clinical trial.

### Use of antibiotics among patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding is associated with reduced mortality [^1147T3Qb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for all patients with cirrhosis hospitalized for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). We evaluated the association between use of antibiotics, outcomes of re-admissions, and mortality in these patients.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of 6451 patients with cirrhosis (mean age, 60.6 y) in the Veterans Affairs health care system hospitalized for UGIB from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2013 (8655 hospitalizations). We collected information on patients' baseline features, hospitalizations, etiology of UGIB, antibiotics given, hospital re-admission within 30 days of discharge, and mortality. We defined timely administration of antibiotics as receipt from 8 hours before admission through 48 hours afterward.

Results

Timely administration of antibiotics occurred during 48.6% of admissions (n = 4210), increasing from 30.6% in 2005 to 58.1% in 2013. Independent predictors of antibiotic receipt included ascites, high model for end-stage liver disease score, esophageal variceal hemorrhage, and administration of octreotide or intravenous proton pump inhibitors. Variables associated with decreased odds of antibiotic provision included black race and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In multivariate analysis, timely administration of antibiotics was associated with a reduced 30-day mortality rate (adjusted odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–0.93; P = 0.012).

Conclusions

In a study of patients with cirrhosis and UGIB in the VA health care system, timely administration of antibiotics was associated with a 30% reduction in 30-day mortality. The proportion of patients with cirrhosis and UGIB receiving timely antibiotics nearly doubled from 2005 to 2013, but many patients-particularly those with less-advanced cirrhosis-did not receive this intervention. Targeted efforts are needed to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics among patients with cirrhosis and UGIB.

Endoscopy best practices — timing and triage in acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) are outlined as follows: Endoscopy should generally be performed within 12 hours for emergent cases, within 24 hours for urgent cases, and can wait more than 24 hours for elective cases. In a randomized trial of high-risk upper gastrointestinal bleeding defined by Glasgow-Blatchford score ≥ 12, patients were assigned to urgent (within 6 hours) or early (the next morning and within 24 hours) endoscopy after consultation occurring on average 7–8 hours after presentation; urgent endoscopy was not associated with lower 30-day mortality than endoscopy performed the following morning between 6 and 24 hours after consultation. In general, patients with acute nonvariceal bleeding and Glasgow-Blatchford score of 0–1 may be discharged from the emergency department for timely outpatient management.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding [^112qMXut]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial infections are a frequent complication in patients with cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding. Antibiotic prophylaxis seems to decrease the incidence of bacterial infections. Oral antibiotics, active against enteric bacteria, have been most often used as antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding.

Objectives

This review aims to evaluate the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches on The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (May 2001), The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2001), EMBASE (1980–2001), and MEDLINE (1966–2001); handsearching the references of all identified studies; contacting the first author of each included trial.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing different types of antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo, no intervention, or another antibiotic to prevent bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently appraised the quality of each trial and extracted the data from the included trials. Relative risks (RR) or average differences, with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. The reviewers assumed an intention to treat basis for the outcome measures.

Main Results

Eight trials evaluated the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis compared with placebo or no antibiotic prophylaxis in 864 patients. A significant beneficial effect on decreasing mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95) and the incidence of bacterial infections (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.51) was observed. No serious adverse events were reported. The trials showed no significant heterogeneity. Three additional trials evaluated the effects of antibiotics compared with a different regimen of antibiotics in 503 patients. Data could not be combined as each trial used different interventions. None of the examined antibiotic regimens was superior to the control regimen regarding mortality or the incidence of bacterial infections.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis for cirrhotic inpatients with gastrointestinal bleeding is efficacious in reducing the number of deaths and bacterial infections, are well tolerated, and should be advocated.

### Management of varices and variceal hemorrhage in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^115YFxU4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of acute variceal hemorrhage

Acute VH is a life-threatening emergency which, despite therapeutic advances in the past decade, continues to have a high 6-week mortality rate of up to 20%. Overall, the current approach is a multimodal strategy aiming to control the acute bleeding, prevent rebleeding, and decrease 6-week mortality rate, which is the main treatment outcome by consensus. The management consists of the following steps (Figure 3):

(a) Adequate resuscitation. Proper intravenous access and intubation in patients with massive hematemesis for airway protection.
(b) Transfusion of red blood cells using a restrictive strategy meaning initiating transfusion when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dl and maintaining a goal of 7–9 g/dl. This approach had lower rebleeding and mortality rates, especially in those with CTP A and B when compared with a more liberal approach.
(c) Short-term administration of prophylactic antibiotics. RCTs have showed the use of prophylactic antibiotics that lead to significantly lower rates of infection, death, and early rebleeding. Intravenous ceftriaxone proved to be more effective than oral norfloxacin, and given the higher rates of quinolone resistant organisms and discontinuation of norfloxacin use in the United States, IV ceftriaxone for 5–7 days is the recommended choice. It is important to note that an initial infection, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, could have led to the VH in the first place, therefore ideally, diagnostic paracentesis should be done before administering prophylactic antibiotics.
(d) Intravenous infusion of splanchnic vasoactive medications such as octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin to be continued for 5 days. The use of these agents has been associated with lower 7-day all-cause mortality and lower transfusion requirements. Any available agent can be used as no difference in controlled bleeding, rebleeding, or mortality rate was identified in a noninferiority trial.
(e) Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma is not recommended as it will not correct coagulopathy and may lead to volume overload and worsening of portal hypertension.
(f) IV proton pump inhibitors can be initiated when a patient presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, they should not be continued once a variceal source is identified, unless there is a strict indication to continue them.
(g) EGD must be done within the first 12 h of admission and once the patient is hemodynamically stable. EVL is indicated when the source of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is variceal, that is, in the presence of the following endoscopic findings:

Description

A multidisciplinary group of 34 experts from 15 countries developed this update and expansion of the recommendations on the management of acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from 2003.

Methods

The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) process and independent ethics protocols were used. Sources of data included original and published systematic reviews; randomized, controlled trials; and abstracts up to October 2008. Quality of evidence and strength of recommendations have been rated by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.

Recommendations

Recommendations emphasize early risk stratification, by using validated prognostic scales, and early endoscopy (within 24 hours). Endoscopic hemostasis remains indicated for high-risk lesions, whereas data support attempts to dislodge clots with hemostatic, pharmacologic, or combination treatment of the underlying stigmata. Clips or thermocoagulation, alone or with epinephrine injection, are effective methods; epinephrine injection alone is not recommended. Second-look endoscopy may be useful in selected high-risk patients but is not routinely recommended. Preendoscopy proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may downstage the lesion; intravenous high-dose PPI therapy after successful endoscopic hemostasis decreases both rebleeding and mortality in patients with high-risk stigmata. Although selected patients can be discharged promptly after endoscopy, high-risk patients should be hospitalized for at least 72 hours after endoscopic hemostasis. For patients with UGIB who require a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a PPI with a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor is preferred to reduce rebleeding. Patients with UGIB who require secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis should start receiving acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) again as soon as cardiovascular risks outweigh gastrointestinal risks (usually within 7 days); ASA plus PPI therapy is preferred over clopidogrel alone to reduce rebleeding.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^115mYGy3]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Post-endoscopic management

Non-variceal bleeding

For patients at high risk who require endoscopic treatment after non-variceal UGIB, use of high dose proton pump inhibitors after endoscopy has been shown to decrease the risk of rebleeding. These agents are commonly administered as a single intravenous bolus of 80 mg omeprazole (or equivalent) followed by 8 mg/h of continuous infusion for 72 h, based on an randomised controlled trial in Hong Kong of 240 patients. This trial showed a significant reduction in rebleeding within three days in the infusion group (P < 0.001). A subsequent meta-analysis comparing proton pump inhibitor infusion and placebo also showed a significant reduction in rebleeding (risk ratio 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.59), in addition to a reduced need for surgery (0.43, 0.24 to 0.76), and reduced risk of mortality (0.41, 0.20 to 0.84).

A meta-analysis of 13 studies has addressed whether intermittent intravenous bolus or oral proton pump inhibitors at high dose (potentially lowering cost) are equivalent to continuous intravenous infusion. The results showed non-inferiority of intermittent proton pump inhibitor (relative risk of rebleed within 7 days 0.72, upper boundary of one sided 95% confidence interval 0.97). A subgroup analysis comparing results of intermittent IV proton pump inhibitor to intermittent oral use did not show heterogeneity, although the 95% confidence interval between intermittent oral and continuous intravenous proton pump inhibitor was wide (risk ratio 0.96, 95% upper bound confidence interval 2.02). These findings are consistent with earlier studies that showed that an oral proton pump inhibitor was equally effectively in lowering gastric pH and non-inferior to intravenous proton pump inhibitor in UGIB. Updated European and American guidelines advise that intermittent intravenous or oral proton pump inhibitors given at a high dosecould be considered as alternatives to continuous infusion.

### Efficacy of hemospray in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^113KoSZq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The main limitation of this meta-analysis is that only 2 RCTs were available. To partially circumvent this limitation, we included both randomized and non-randomized trials in the proportional meta-analysis and ratio-based meta-analysis. However, the inclusion of studies with a non-randomized design introduces possible significant selection bias. Secondly, the total number of patients in the RR meta-analysis was relatively low. In addition, given the scarcity of data, we could not identify the impact of Hemospray as monotherapy, in combination with other agents, or as a rescue agent. However, in most cases Hemospray was the final hemostatic agent used in combination therapy and the sole or final hemostatic agent used in rescue therapy, implying hemostatic success specifically related to Hemospray. Another limitation was the inconsistent identification of bleeding sources in the analyzed papers, as well as specific hemostatic modalities in certain studies. Lastly, endoscopist expertise and self-reporting data are subjective and the possibility of non-random user error remains. These limitations are partially attenuated by the combined statistical power of a large number of studies with a vast and diverse study population included in the proportional meta-analysis, which gives a general idea of the overall success and failure rates. Additionally, we set forth strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to limit bias and included only those studies that involved patients with non-variceal upper GIB.

The results herein indicate that Hemospray is non-inferior to conventional hemostatic modalities for the efficacious termination of non-variceal upper GIB. Hemospray can potentially be used as an alternative option for the management of non-variceal upper GIB. Given its ease of use, in tandem with the reduced technical expertise needed for deployment relative to other modalities, Hemospray has the potential to become an attractive therapy for the management of upper GIB. Future research, including RCTs and large cohort studies, are needed to specifically compare Hemospray to other hemostatic powders, as well as to other individual, mechanical modalities. These data will help in the development of appropriate recommendations regarding the use of Hemospray, as well as its position in the GIB algorithm. Additionally, for the future, larger studies are needed to more accurately comment on the efficacy of Hemospray in upper variceal hemorrhage and lower bleeds, in an attempt to widen its scope of application to all GIB.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding — risk stratification scores: The Glasgow-Blatchford score ranges from 0–23, and patients with a score of 0 or 1 can be managed as an outpatient. The Rockall score requires endoscopic evaluation to determine the full score. The AIMS-65 includes Systolic BP (< 100 mm Hg), INR (> 1.5), and Age (> 65 years), and reports AIMS-65 score (% inpatient mortality): 0 (0.3%), 1 (3.2%), 2 (5.3%), 3 (10.3%), 4 (16.5%), 5 (24.5%). These risk assessment scores cannot precisely identify individual high-risk patients who will die from gastrointestinal bleeding if they do not receive an intervention, but may have a clinical role in identifying patients who are at very low risk for mortality and may be amenable to outpatient medical care/endoscopy.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding differences between older and younger adults: should bleeding in non-cirrhotic patients be considered a geriatric syndrome? [^115JRHov]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Concerning adverse outcomes in this study, surprisingly they did not differ in both study groups. After adjusting for confounders, and in line with other studies, – cirrhosis emerged as an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality and may provide a rationale for the adverse outcomes observed in the younger population.

UGIB in non-cirrhotic patients occurred mainly in the elderly group, accounting for almost 80% of UGIB. Interestingly, we still found "empiric" vasopressor and antibiotic prophylaxis in the younger group, probably due to higher alcohol consumption and presumed cirrhosis and variceal UGIB at the emergency room, as recommended.

Our study established the impact of higher CCI in the older population, with a clear association with adverse outcomes (second-look endoscopy, re-hospitalization, and in-hospital mortality). Moreover, as several comorbidities are associated with antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant use, those therapies increase the morbidity from UGIB and correlate with in-hospital mortality. These findings align with other studies that suggest the outcome of UGIB in the elderly is determined not only by the nature of the lesion but also by the existence of comorbidities and the use of antiplatelets/anticoagulants. – In addition, it is known that the use of anticoagulants is associated with increased second-look endoscopy and recurrent bleeding in patients admitted with UGIB. Geriatric patients may present a high likelihood of continued bleeding in the setting of the lack of vasospasm due to deranged thrombotic and/or platelet function (secondary to consumption coagulopathy and/or to antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy), highlighting the importance of monitoring for bleeding recurrence.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding — endoscopic therapy categories and epinephrine use — are outlined as mechanical (clips) or thermal (heater probes, bipolar/multipolar catheters, hemostatic forceps). Diluted epinephrine 1:10,000 (100 μg/mL) can be injected to attain initial hemostasis, but epinephrine monotherapy should be avoided. If epinephrine injection is used, a second endoscopic-hemostasis modality should be employed, and dual therapy with epinephrine and another endoscopic therapy has no advantage over properly applied thermal or mechanical monotherapy. In subgroup analyses there was no difference between hemoclips and thermal treatment in ulcer rebleeding rates, and data showing superiority of one modality over the other are largely lacking.

### Efficacy of hemospray in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^114HubJo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Recently, amongst other hemostatic modalities, Hemospray (TC-325) has emerged as an effective method for managing patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of Hemospray in patients with non-variceal upper GIB.

Methods

Our primary outcomes were clinical and technical success; secondary outcomes were aggregate rebleeding, early rebleeding, delayed rebleeding, refractory bleeding, mortality, and treatment failure. A meta-analysis of proportions was conducted for all reported primary and secondary outcomes. A relative risk meta-analysis was conducted for studies reporting direct comparisons between Hemospray and other hemostatic measures.

Results

A total of 20 studies with 1280 patients were included in the final analysis. Technical success of Hemospray was seen in 97% of cases (95% confidence interval [CI] 94–98%, I² = 52.89%) and a significant trend towards increasing technical success was seen during publication years 2011–2019. Clinical success of Hemospray was seen in 91% of cases (95%CI 88–94%, I² = 47.72%), compared to 87% (95%CI 75–94%, I² = 0.00%) for other hemostatic measures. The secondary outcomes of aggregate rebleeding, early rebleeding, delayed rebleeding, refractory rebleeding, mortality and treatment failure following the use of Hemospray were seen in 27%, 20%, 9%, 8%, 8%, and 31% of cases, respectively.

Conclusion

Hemospray is safe, effective and non-inferior to traditional hemostatic measures for the management of non-variceal upper GIB, and can thus be used as an alternative option.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^116Vh4rd]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) — over-the-scope clips (OTSC/Padlock clip) are described as options without direct comparative trials; there have been no head-to-head comparisons of these clips or head-to-head trials of over-the-scope clips to through-the-scope clips or thermal therapy. In persistent bleeding despite conventional hemostasis, data from small case series suggest that over-the-scope clips are an effective rescue modality, and a recent RCT demonstrated that over-the-scope clips were more effective than standard therapy in patients with recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding. Over-the-scope clips should be considered as first-line treatment — namely, large, fibrotic ulcer beds with a large visible vessel that may not be amenable to through-the-scope hemoclip fixation or when thermal therapy is predicted to be ineffective; there are currently 2 clips with different designs and deployment mechanisms.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper… [^113RQCbd]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Should antibiotic prophylaxis be used for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Evidence-Based Answer Antibiotics should be used for prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Prophylaxis reduces all-cause mortality by 21%, as well as bacterial infections and rebleeding. Evidence Summary A 2011 meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials involving 1, 241 patients compared different types of antibiotic therapy vs. no intervention, placebo, or another antibiotic in adults with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, regardless of etiology of cirrhosis or severity of disease. Compared with no intervention or placebo, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced all-cause mortality, mortality from bacterial infections, and bacterial infections. No antibiotic regimen was superior to the others, and the authors recommended basing the antibiotic choice on local resistance profiles and treatment cost. The studies included in the meta-analysis did not report adverse effects. A 2015 retrospective cohort study examined 235 patients with cirrhosis and acute peptic ulcer hemorrhage who were undergoing therapeutic upper endoscopy. 2 Prophylactic intravenous ceftriaxone was administered to 88 of these patients at a dosage of 1 g immediately after endoscopy, then every 12 hours until discharge. Compared with the control group, the antibiotic group had a lower risk of bacterial infections, including bacteremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, and a lower risk of rebleeding.

UGIB is a major risk factor with 45% to 66% of patients developing infections within the first 7 days of the bleeding episode, and administration of prophylactic antibiotics (typically third-generation cephalosporins) in ACLF patients with UGIB may attenuate infections and bleeding and improve survival; a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (n = 1,241) found that antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with UGIB compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis/placebo was associated with a reduction.

### Impact of duration to endoscopy in patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: propensity score matching analysis of real-world data from Thailand [^111TaBTF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common emergency condition that can result in mortality, morbidity, and increased healthcare expenditure. Despite considerable advancements in treatment modalities, service provision, and guidelines, the mortality rate of non-variceal UGIB (NVUGIB) remains as high as 14%. Endoscopy is crucial for diagnosing and treating UGIB as it helps gastroenterologists identify the source of bleeding and achieve hemostasis.

Early endoscopy (within 24 h of admission) has been recommended as the standard treatment for NVUGIB management. However, current evidence does not demonstrate clearly whether the performance of endoscopy within this timeframe is clinically beneficial. Previous studies have provided conflicting results regarding mortality, rebleeding rate, and hospital stay in patients who underwent early vs. late endoscopy (after 24 h). A recent meta-analysis of 13 studies did not demonstrate a clear benefit of performing endoscopy within 24 h for UGIB. The increasing inconsistency among various research findings has led to concerns regarding the optimal time to perform endoscopy in patients with NVUGIB.

Notably, most existing studies on this issue are considered low-quality observational studies, which may include a high risk of selection bias and residual confounding by severity. In contrast, existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted by expert endoscopists in specialized centers with highly selective inclusion criteria have insufficient power to address this question. Thus, the generalizability of these findings to community practice and unselective patient populations remains largely unknown, indicating a knowledge gap in this area. Therefore, we aimed to determine the impact of early endoscopy on clinical outcomes and medical resource use in patients with NVUGIB.
