## Question

Patient presents with alcoholic fatty liver, fibroscan shows F4, he has stopped drinking and is on naltrexone for addiction management. what is the best management for this patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the best management approach for a patient with alcohol-related cirrhosis indicated by FibroScan F4 who is abstinent and currently taking naltrexone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming cirrhosis stage and whether the disease is compensated or decompensated. Then, I should verify the safety and role of naltrexone in cirrhosis. Next, I will consider the comprehensive cirrhosis care bundle, transplant referral criteria, adjunctive or disease-modifying options, and a structured monitoring plan. Finally, I need to integrate patient education and finalize a practical plan with dosing and surveillance details, ensuring alignment with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the disease stage and clinical status. F4 generally corresponds to cirrhosis, but I should ensure whether this FibroScan-derived staging aligns clinically with compensated versus decompensated disease by checking for ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, jaundice, and synthetic function markers such as INR, bilirubin, and albumin, because this distinction determines immediate risks and medication safety, including whether certain agents can be continued or need modification.

> Now, I need to evaluate naltrexone safety in cirrhosis. The APA 2018 guideline advises against naltrexone in acute hepatitis or liver failure, but not in stable compensated cirrhosis, so I should confirm the absence of acute liver failure or active hepatitis and review LFTs and INR before continuing therapy, noting that hepatotoxicity signals in labeling were mainly observed at supratherapeutic doses rather than the standard 50 mg daily dose, which supports cautious continuation with monitoring in compensated disease [^114yDfTU] [^114yDfTU] [^1143Uras]. Wait, let me verify the dosing specifics and typical safety framing; the FDA labeling supports 50 mg daily as the studied dose for alcohol dependence with adverse hepatic events mainly at much higher daily doses, reinforcing that standard-dose naltrexone is acceptable with prudent monitoring in the absence of acute hepatic injury [^115ahuC3] [^116t6QHX].

> I should now optimize the alcohol use disorder treatment plan. Abstinence is the key determinant of outcomes in alcohol-related liver disease, so maintaining an integrated approach with psychosocial support is essential, and extended-release naltrexone (380 mg IM monthly) can improve adherence when used as part of a comprehensive program; I should also counsel about increased opioid sensitivity and overdose risk if naltrexone is discontinued and review OUD history to avoid precipitated withdrawal if any occult opioid use is present [^113BtqwE] [^112TFLLb] [^116Tkmub] [^111idaHM]. Hold on, I should confirm first-line status and alignment with primary care guidance; AAFP 2024 and Canadian guidelines endorse naltrexone as first-line for AUD to reduce heavy drinking and support abstinence, which aligns with continuing therapy here if liver function is stable [^1143Uras] [^116t6QHX].

> Next, I will implement the core cirrhosis care bundle. I need to arrange HCC surveillance with abdominal ultrasound with or without AFP every 6 months, perform variceal screening with upper endoscopy and initiate non-selective beta blockade if medium or large varices are found, optimize nutrition with high-protein intake and correction of deficiencies, and strictly avoid alcohol and minimize hepatotoxic or sedating medications that could precipitate renal injury or encephalopathy, as these steps reduce morbidity and align with standard cirrhosis management in alcohol-related disease [^113BtqwE] [^112eMUf9] [^113M8xTc]. Wait, I should also emphasize dietitian referral and structured nutrition plans given the high prevalence of malnutrition in ALD, as this can reduce complications even if survival benefits are difficult to demonstrate consistently, so a dietitian consult is appropriate now [^111zCJZZ] [^113M8xTc].

> Let me consider disease-modifying or antifibrotic therapies. I initially thought rifaximin-α might reverse fibrosis, but wait, I should double-check the GALA-RIF data; the phase 2 trial did not demonstrate regression of fibrosis but did show reduced progression over 18 months in the per-protocol analysis, suggesting a potential role to slow worsening in selected patients, though this is not yet standard of care and should be discussed as adjunctive and investigational rather than routine [^113g32yy] [^113Czjpy]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; if used, it should be framed as off-label with uncertain long-term outcome benefits pending confirmatory trials, and decisions should consider portal hypertension severity and inflammatory activity on a case-by-case basis [^113g32yy].

> I should assess transplant candidacy early. If there is any decompensation, a MELD score of 15 or higher, or HCC within Milan criteria, referral to a transplant center is appropriate, and importantly, arbitrary abstinence duration should not be the sole determinant for listing decisions; integrating an addiction specialist into pre-transplant care reduces relapse risk, aligning with contemporary European and transplant practices [^113BtqwE] [^112eMUf9] [^113wevFS]. But wait, what if the center still requires six months of sobriety; I need to counsel that policies are evolving and that early evaluation does not preclude continued sobriety documentation and multidisciplinary optimization while candidacy is considered [^113BtqwE].

> Next, I should outline longitudinal monitoring. I will plan regular labs including CMP, CBC, and INR every 3 to 6 months, and use imaging-based noninvasive liver stiffness assessment for staging and tracking; however, I need to reconcile some guidance: I initially considered using FIB-4 routinely, but hmm, wait a minute, the 2025 AASLD blood-based guidance notes insufficient evidence for blood tests to stage fibrosis specifically in ALD, whereas ACG 2024 suggests combining FIB-4 with elastography; to resolve this, I will prioritize elastography for staging and longitudinal assessment and may use FIB-4 as an adjunct when helpful, interpreting changes in stiffness within the patient's clinical context per AASLD imaging guidance [^1171K9pn] [^1155Uf7H] [^113biJp8]. I should also monitor alcohol use with validated questionnaires and consider biomarkers like PEth or EtG because feedback on liver injury and biomarkers can support behavior change and reduce harmful drinking, which is crucial even in abstinent patients at risk for relapse [^115xGPjo].

> I need to ensure patient and family education is explicit. Emphasize that sustained abstinence is the cornerstone and can even be associated with fibrosis regression in selected cases, including case-level evidence even at advanced stages, while acknowledging that regression is variable and not guaranteed; also, explain the heightened risk of opioid overdose if naltrexone is discontinued due to loss of tolerance and surmountable blockade, and engage family to support adherence and relapse prevention within an integrated hepatology–addiction model [^115CyLEV] [^116Tkmub] [^111g1tAh]. Hold on, I should verify that the message stays realistic; I will stress that fibrosis is dynamic and can improve with removal of the injurious agent, but careful monitoring remains essential because progression risk persists if relapse occurs or other cofactors intervene [^114eadTQ].

> Putting this together, my final management plan is as follows. Continue naltrexone at 50 mg daily or transition to extended-release naltrexone 380 mg IM monthly if adherence is a concern, provided there is no acute hepatitis or liver failure, with LFT monitoring monthly for 3 months then quarterly and ongoing psychosocial support; perform HCC surveillance every 6 months and schedule an upper endoscopy for variceal screening with non-selective beta blockers if indicated; institute structured nutrition with high-protein intake and vitamin repletion, strict alcohol abstinence, and avoidance of NSAIDs and unnecessary sedatives; consider early transplant referral if decompensation emerges, MELD is 15 or higher, or HCC within Milan criteria is detected; use elastography to track liver stiffness at 6–12 month intervals and interpret longitudinal changes in clinical context, using FIB-4 adjunctively if needed; maintain regular AUD monitoring with questionnaires and biomarkers, and provide overdose education regarding opioid sensitivity if naltrexone is stopped; discuss rifaximin-α only as a potential adjunct to slow fibrosis progression with the clear caveat that it is not current standard of care and should be individualized [^115ahuC3] [^115A9tKZ] [^113BtqwE] [^112eMUf9] [^113wevFS] [^116Tkmub] [^113biJp8] [^1155Uf7H] [^115xGPjo] [^113g32yy].

The best management for a patient with alcoholic fatty liver and F4 fibrosis who has stopped drinking and is on naltrexone is to maintain **lifelong abstinence** [^113BtqwE] and continue naltrexone with regular LFT monitoring, alongside **standard cirrhosis care**: screen for varices and HCC, manage complications, provide nutritional support, and monitor for decompensation [^112eMUf9] [^1155Uf7H]. If decompensation occurs, refer for **liver transplantation evaluation** [^113wevFS]. Naltrexone is appropriate in compensated cirrhosis but should be discontinued if acute hepatitis or liver failure develops [^111idaHM].

---

## Alcohol abstinence and relapse prevention

- **Abstinence**: Lifelong abstinence is the cornerstone of management [^113BtqwE] and significantly improves survival and reduces complications.
- **Naltrexone**: Continue as first-line therapy [^114yDfTU] to reduce relapse risk and heavy drinking days [^116t6QHX].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor LFTs [^111idaHM] and clinical status to detect hepatotoxicity or decompensation [^1143Uras].

---

## Management of cirrhosis (F4 fibrosis)

### Surveillance and monitoring

- **HCC surveillance**: Ultrasound with or without AFP every 6 months [^111zCJZZ].
- **Variceal screening**: Upper endoscopy at diagnosis; repeat every 2–3 years if no varices, or annually if small varices [^112eMUf9].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: CBC, LFTs, INR, creatinine, and sodium every 3–6 months [^111zCJZZ].

---

### Management of complications

- **Ascites**: Sodium restriction, diuretics (spironolactone ± furosemide), and therapeutic paracentesis as needed [^1155Uf7H].
- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Lactulose and rifaximin [^111zCJZZ].
- **Variceal bleeding**: Non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol or nadolol) or endoscopic variceal ligation [^112eMUf9].
- **Nutritional support**: High-protein diet (1.2–1.5 g/kg/day), adequate calories, and vitamin supplementation (especially B vitamins and vitamin D) [^113M8xTc].

---

## Role of liver transplantation

For the **indication**, consider decompensated cirrhosis or complications (refractory ascites, recurrent variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or HCC within Milan criteria) [^113BtqwE]. Regarding the **abstinence requirement**, most centers require at least 6 months of abstinence and participation in addiction treatment before listing [^113wevFS].

---

## Safety and monitoring of naltrexone in advanced liver disease

Regarding **safety**, naltrexone is generally safe in compensated cirrhosis; avoid it in acute hepatitis or liver failure [^111idaHM]. For **monitoring**, obtain regular LFTs and discontinue if significant hepatotoxicity or decompensation occurs [^1117nBQv].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A **team-based approach** coordinates hepatology, addiction medicine, nutrition, and primary care to optimize outcomes and prevent relapse [^111g1tAh].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Management aspect** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Alcohol abstinence | - Lifelong abstinence <br/> - Continue naltrexone |
| HCC surveillance | Ultrasound ± AFP every 6 months |
| Variceal screening | - Endoscopy at diagnosis <br/> - Repeat per findings |
| Ascites management | - Sodium restriction <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Paracentesis |
| Hepatic encephalopathy | - Lactulose <br/> - Rifaximin |
| Nutritional support | - High-protein diet <br/> - Vitamin supplementation |
| Liver transplantation | Consider if decompensated |
| Multidisciplinary care | - Hepatology <br/> - Addiction <br/> - Nutrition <br/> - Primary care |

---

Optimal management includes **lifelong abstinence**, continued naltrexone with monitoring, standard cirrhosis care, and multidisciplinary support; consider transplantation if decompensation occurs [^113BtqwE] [^1155Uf7H].

### Advances in the understanding and management of alcohol-related liver disease [^113BtqwE]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological trends indicate recent and predicted increases in the burden of disease. Disease progression is driven by continued alcohol exposure on a background of genetic predisposition, together with environmental cofactors. Most individuals present with advanced disease despite a long history of excessive alcohol consumption and multiple missed opportunities to intervene.

Increasing evidence supports the use of non-invasive tests to screen for and identify disease at earlier stages. There is a definite role for public health measures to reduce the overall burden of disease. At an individual level, however, the ability to influence subsequent disease course by modifying alcohol consumption or the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remains limited due to a comparative lack of effective, disease-modifying medical interventions.

Abstinence from alcohol is the key determinant of outcome in established ALD and the cornerstone of clinical management. In those with decompensated ALD, liver transplant has a clear role. There is consensus that abstinence from alcohol for an arbitrary period should not be the sole determinant in a decision to transplant.

An increasing understanding of the mechanisms by which alcohol causes liver disease in susceptible individuals offers the prospect of new therapeutic targets for disease-modifying drugs. Successful translation will require significant public and private investment in a disease area that has traditionally been underfunded compared to others.

### Evaluation and management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^112BgUFv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum of liver diseases that occur in the absence of alcohol consumption in amounts considered injurious to the liver. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We present an integrated approach that utilizes both clinical and laboratory studies to diagnose and manage a patient with suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The goals of treatment include:

- **Correction of the underlying risk factors**: Addressing these factors is crucial for preventing disease progression.
- **Avoidance of factors that promote progression of liver disease**: Patients should be educated on lifestyle changes to mitigate risk.
- **Specific treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis**: Tailored therapeutic interventions should be considered based on individual patient needs.

This structured approach aids in comprehensive management and improved patient outcomes.

The ASAM 2020 guidelines for the medical management of opioid use disorder specifically advise against the use of oral naltrexone for treating OUD, except under very limited circumstances due to issues with medication adherence. It should be reserved for patients who are capable of complying with techniques designed to enhance adherence, such as observed dosing. It is recognized that extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces, but does not completely eliminate, problems with medication adherence.

### Alcoholic liver disease [^112Th1Mi]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2018). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most prevalent type of chronic liver disease worldwide. ALD can progress from alcoholic fatty liver (AFL) to alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), which is characterized by hepatic inflammation. Chronic ASH can eventually lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis and, in some cases, hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Additionally, severe ASH (with or without cirrhosis) can lead to alcoholic hepatitis, which is an acute clinical presentation of ALD associated with liver failure and high mortality. Most individuals consuming more than 40g of alcohol per day develop AFL; however, only a subset will develop more advanced disease. Genetic, epigenetic, and non-genetic factors might explain the considerable interindividual variation in ALD phenotype.

The pathogenesis of ALD includes hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, acetaldehyde-mediated toxicity, and cytokine- and chemokine-induced inflammation. Diagnosis of ALD involves assessing patients for alcohol use disorder and signs of advanced liver disease. The degree of AFL and liver fibrosis can be determined by ultrasonography, transient elastography, MRI, measurement of serum biomarkers, and liver biopsy histology. Alcohol abstinence achieved by psychosomatic intervention is the best treatment for all stages of ALD. In the case of advanced disease, such as cirrhosis or HCC, liver transplantation may be required. Thus, new therapies are urgently needed.

### Mechanisms of synergy between alcohol and hepatitis C virus [^111Zdsms]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), extensive literature has emerged on the interaction between alcohol and HCV.

The goal of this study is to understand the impact of alcohol and HCV infection on the severity of liver disease and the mechanisms of interaction between the two.

Of 1,269 articles (1991 to 2006) searched through MEDLINE and cited cross-references, 133 were thoroughly reviewed to assess:

- **Prevalence of combined alcohol use and HCV**: HCV prevalence is 3-fold to 30-fold higher in alcoholics compared with the general population.

- **Severity of liver disease**: Patients with HCV infection and alcohol abuse develop more severe fibrosis with a higher rate of cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer compared with nondrinkers. Increased oxidative stress seems to be the dominant mechanism for this synergism between alcohol and HCV. Abstinence is key to managing liver disease due to HCV and alcohol.

- **Treatment response**: Data have shown that lower response rates to interferon in alcoholics with HCV infection are likely due to noncompliance.

- **Mechanisms of interaction between HCV and alcohol**: The study extracted data on study design, patient demographics, diagnostic tests used, and study outcomes for critical analysis.

In conclusion, alcoholics with HCV infection have more severe liver disease compared with nondrinkers. Patients should be encouraged to enroll in rehabilitation programs to improve treatment adherence and response.

### Advances and challenges in the management of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^1121xAxU]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

NAFLD and NASH are increasingly recognized as important causes of cirrhosis and its complications. The presence of multiple components of metabolic syndrome and advanced fibrosis are considered risk factors for liver-related mortality. Although weight loss through lifestyle modification can be effective and is always recommended, its efficacy is limited and not sustained.

Few drug treatments are available for NASH; however, numerous clinical trials of pharmacological agents targeting one or more pathways in the pathogenesis of NASH are underway. Given the complexity of NASH pathogenesis, treatment options may require a combination of different drugs. Additionally, treatment duration may necessitate long-term maintenance. One could envision a short-term, intense 'induction' treatment regimen, followed by a long-term, potentially lifelong maintenance regimen.

As these regimens are developed, it is crucial to establish their efficacy and safety, and also to demonstrate an improvement in patient-reported outcomes. Finally, these regimens must be cost-effective and provide long-term value to patients and society.

### Histological parameters and alcohol abstinence determine long-term prognosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease [^116erVY3]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Few data exist on predictors of long-term prognosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Most studies have only assessed short-term prognosis in patients with advanced ALD. We aimed to assess the prognostic impact of clinical, biochemical, and histological parameters on long-term prognosis in patients with early/compensated and decompensated ALD.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients (n = 192) with biopsy-proven liver disease due to alcohol abuse were analyzed retrospectively. Prognostic factors were evaluated in patients with early/compensated ALD (n = 60) and in patients with decompensated ALD (clinical decompensation and/or bilirubin > 3 mg/dL at entry) (n = 132). Factors that predict long-term survival were identified using Cox regression models.

- **Results**: Liver-related mortality at 5 years was 13% in early/compensated and 43% in decompensated ALD. In early/compensated ALD patients, long-term prognosis was determined by fibrosis stage, but not by clinical or biochemical variables. Severe fibrosis (F3/4) was present in 52% and had a major impact on 10-year mortality (F3/4: 45% vs. F0–2: 0%, p < 0.001). In contrast, in decompensated patients, a combination of clinical features (sex), biochemical markers of liver failure (bilirubin, international normalized ratio [INR]), and histological features (pericellular fibrosis) predicted long-term survival. During follow-up, abstinence from alcohol was an important predictor of survival in both early/compensated and decompensated ALD.

- **Conclusion**: Fibrosis stage is the main predictor of long-term survival in patients with ALD. Abstinence from alcohol also plays a crucial role in improving survival rates in both early/compensated and decompensated ALD.

### Long-acting injectable naltrexone induction: A randomized trial of outpatient opioid detoxification with naltrexone versus buprenorphine [^116qwbph]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

At present, there is no established optimal approach for transitioning opioid-dependent adults to extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-naltrexone) while preventing relapse. The authors conducted a trial examining the efficacy of two methods of outpatient opioid detoxification for induction to XR-naltrexone.

- **Method**: Participants were 150 opioid-dependent adults randomly assigned 2:1 to one of two outpatient detoxification regimens: naltrexone-assisted detoxification or buprenorphine-assisted detoxification, followed by an injection of XR-naltrexone. Naltrexone-assisted detoxification lasted 7 days and included a single day of buprenorphine followed by ascending doses of oral naltrexone along with clonidine and other adjunctive medications. Buprenorphine-assisted detoxification included a 7-day buprenorphine taper followed by a week-long delay before the administration of XR-naltrexone, consistent with official prescribing information for XR-naltrexone. Participants from both groups received behavioral therapy focused on medication adherence and a second dose of XR-naltrexone.

- **Results**: Compared with participants in the buprenorphine-assisted detoxification condition, participants assigned to naltrexone-assisted detoxification were significantly more likely to be successfully inducted to XR-naltrexone (56.1% compared with 32.7%) and to receive the second injection at week 5 (50.0% compared with 26.9%). Both models adjusted for the primary type of opioid use, route of opioid administration, and morphine equivalents at baseline.

These results demonstrate that naltrexone-assisted detoxification can significantly improve induction success and adherence to extended-release naltrexone therapy compared to buprenorphine-assisted detoxification in the outpatient setting.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^117LwsHF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, particularly concerning naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend planning and monitoring the transition from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine. Transitioning from an antagonist (naltrexone) to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally simpler than transitioning from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist. This is because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment, thus no possibility of precipitated withdrawal.

When starting methadone or buprenorphine, begin with initial low doses. Patients transitioning from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone do not have a physical dependence on opioids. Ensure that a significant amount of naltrexone is no longer in the patient's system before making the transition: approximately 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol use disorder in patients with end-stage alcoholic liver disease [^112hYRw7]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Between 14% and 30% of the world's population is affected by alcohol use disorder (AUD), with excessive alcohol consumption being the most common cause of liver disease in the Western world. The clinical presentation of alcoholic end-stage liver disease is extremely complex. Manifestations such as alcohol withdrawal syndrome, craving, and physical dependence, as well as extrahepatic alcohol-related diseases, merge with the complications of advanced cirrhosis. This makes AUD recognition and assessment difficult, and its management arduous, as many drugs commonly used to treat complications such as alcohol withdrawal syndrome are often contraindicated due to the presence of hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome.

Reaching and maintaining abstinence is the cornerstone of managing patients with AUD and end-stage liver disease. Psychosocial interventions are an essential component of treatment to achieve these goals. However, these interventions alone often prove insufficient in AUD patients and even more frequently in those with end-stage liver disease due to inadequate adherence attributable to poor functional and physical status. Pharmacological treatments need to be incorporated, but the available options are greatly limited in end-stage liver disease. Many GABA-ergic drugs can favor the development of hepatic encephalopathy, and drugs undergoing extensive liver metabolism should be avoided or used with the utmost caution. Given these limitations, the management of end-stage AUD is extremely challenging and requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach.

### Rates of and factors associated with placebo response in trials of pharmacotherapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111MuCvz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

It is important to understand the extent of the placebo effect in designing randomized controlled trials for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to accurately calculate sample size and define treatment endpoints.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the placebo groups from randomized controlled trials of adults with NASH that provided histologic and/or magnetic resonance image-based assessments. We identified trials through a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus from each database's inception through January 2, 2018.

- **Results**: We identified 39 randomized controlled trials, comprising 1,463 patients who received a placebo. Histologic assessment data (the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity scores, NAS) were available from 956 patients; magnetic resonance spectroscopy data were available from 295 patients, and magnetic resonance proton density fat fraction measurements from 61 patients. Overall, 25% of patients given a placebo had an improvement in NAS by 2 or more points (95% CI, 21%-29%) with a small amount of heterogeneity (I² = 27%). There were improvements by at least 1 point in steatosis scores of 33% ± 3% of patients, hepatocyte ballooning scores of 30% ± 3% of patients, lobular inflammation scores of 32% ± 3% of patients, and fibrosis scores of 21% ± 3% of patients, with a moderate amount of heterogeneity among trials (I² range, 51%-63%). Patients given a placebo had a statistically significant improvement in NAS (by 0.72 ± 0.19).

### Alcohol-associated liver disease: Integrated management with alcohol use disorder [^111g1tAh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is the most common cause of cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in many regions worldwide. Around 75% of patients with cirrhosis are unaware of their disease until they are referred to the emergency department. An innovative, noninvasive screening approach is required for an earlier diagnosis of liver fibrosis. In patients with ALD, the physician is inevitably dealing with two major disorders: the liver disease itself and the alcohol use disorder (AUD). Focusing only on the liver disease will inevitably lead to failure, because transient improvements in liver function are rapidly overturned if the patient returns to alcohol consumption. For this reason, integrated models of care provided by hepatologists and addiction specialists are an effective approach, which are, however, not widely available.

There are multiple pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies for AUD. Progress has recently been made in the management of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) who have improved survival through a better understanding of the concept of response to medical treatment, improved survival prediction, and the advent of early liver transplantation. The emerging concept is that listing for transplantation a patient with severe ALD could lead to adjusting the duration of abstinence according to the severity and evolution of liver dysfunction and the patient's addictive profile.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^115ntJca]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

The widely accepted European definition of NAFLD emphasizes the absence of excessive alcohol consumption (defined as ≥ 30 g per day for men and ≥ 20 g per day for women) and a quantitative alcohol history is essential for diagnosis. Patients with NAFLD should undergo regular reassessment of their alcohol consumption (Recommendation 21, Table 1). There are additive and synergistic interactions between alcohol and cardiometabolic risk factors in the progression of fatty liver disease. Much of the evidence linking alcohol to health outcomes relies on cohort studies where alcohol consumption was measured only once at baseline, but it is recognized that alcohol consumption fluctuates widely over the life course. In view of this, it is recommended that patients with NAFLD should have a quantitative alcohol history taken at regular intervals.

The transition from compensated to decompensated disease is associated with greatly increased morbidity and mortality. In people with alcohol-related liver disease, continued drinking is a stronger risk factor for decompensation than any histological or laboratory parameters. As cofactors, both alcohol use and obesity have been shown to correlate with the progression of portal hypertension in chronic liver disease.

In patients with NAFLD who do not have cirrhosis, the 2016 NICE clinical guideline reported insufficient evidence to restrict alcohol consumption beyond the national recommended advisory limits. However, alcohol can be a source of additional dietary calories, and minimizing its use may help avoid further weight gain, which can worsen health outcomes.

### Fibrosis and alcohol-related liver disease [^114wcZPU]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Histological fibrosis stage is one of the most important prognostic factors in compensated and decompensated alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). Morphological assessment of fibrosis is useful for patient stratification, enabling individualized management and evaluation of treatment effects in clinical studies.

In contrast to most chronic liver diseases, where fibrosis is portal-based, fatty liver disease (FLD) of alcoholic or non-alcoholic aetiology (NAFLD) is associated with a centrilobular pattern of injury, which leads to perivenular fibrosis and/or pericellular fibrosis. Progression of FLD drives expansive pericellular fibrosis, linking vascular structures and paving the way for the development of cirrhosis. At the cirrhotic stage, ongoing tissue damage leads to increasing fibrosis severity due to parenchymal loss and proliferation of fibrous scars.

Histologic fibrosis staging systems have been devised, based on topography and the extent of fibrosis, for most chronic liver diseases. The utility of histological staging is reflected in different risks associated with individual fibrosis stages, which cannot be reliably distinguished by non-invasive fibrosis assessment.

In contrast to NAFLD, ALD-specific staging systems that enable the standardized prognostication required for clinical management and trials are lacking. Although morphological similarities between NAFLD and ALD exist, differences in clinical and histological features may substantially limit the utility of established NAFLD-specific staging systems for prognostication in ALD.

### Therapeutic targets in alcohol-associated liver disease: progress and challenges [^113M8xTc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Non-pharmacological treatment modalities**: Malnutrition is common among patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), particularly those with acute severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and has been associated with worse outcomes. Although intensive enteral nutrition has no proven survival benefit, inadequate calorific intake of less than 21.5 kcal/kg per day has been associated with a higher frequency of complications, including infections. Therefore, adequate nutrition that includes sufficient protein intake and correction of specific nutrient deficits should be provided.

- **Treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD)**: AH treatment targets, although useful in the short term, do not provide any long-term mortality benefit. Continued alcohol consumption remains a major determinant of long-term prognosis. In one French multicenter study, severe relapse occurred in 20% of post-liver transplant (LT) patients, of whom 35% developed re-alcohol-related cirrhosis. Accordingly, patients with ALD should undergo screening for possible AUD using tools such as the AUDIT questionnaire. Those with comorbid AUD should receive appropriate treatment with the goal of achieving long-term abstinence and preventing relapse. Both psychosocial and pharmacological interventions are beneficial. In a recently published retrospective cohort study of 9,635 patients with AUD who were followed for a mean period of 9.2 years, patients who received medical therapy for AUD were found to have 63% lower odds of being diagnosed with ALD, and those with preexisting comorbid ALD were found to have a 65% lower odds of developing hepatic decompensation.

### Outpatient management of alcohol-related liver disease [^111zCJZZ]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease has become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States, partly due to an increase in the prevalence of high-risk drinking behavior and alcohol use disorder, particularly among young women. Achieving sustained alcohol abstinence might not only prevent the development and progression of alcohol-related liver disease but could also lead to clinically significant improvements, even in the advanced stages of disease. In this series paper, we discuss the diagnosis and outpatient management of alcohol-related liver disease, with an emphasis on treatment options for alcohol use disorder and the assessment of nutritional status.

### Treatment of alcohol use disorders in patients with alcoholic liver disease [^114bBu3X]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are one of the leading causes of disease and disability in almost all European countries. Among alcohol-related diseases, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most common. At present, alcohol is the most frequent cause of liver cirrhosis in the Western world. The cornerstone of treatment for ALD is achieving total alcohol abstinence and preventing relapse. Medical and surgical treatments for ALD are limited when drinking continues. This narrative review summarizes treatments for AUDs, with a particular emphasis on the treatment of AUDs in patients with ALD. Medical management, along with psychosocial and pharmacological interventions, is analyzed, highlighting limitations and options for AUD patients. Finally, this review discusses the most appropriate setting for the management of AUD patients with advanced liver disease, as well as the indications for liver transplantation in AUD patients.

### Rifaximin-α for liver fibrosis in patients with alcohol-related liver disease (GALA-RIF): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^113g32yy]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

GALA-RIF, an 18-month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, showed that rifaximin-α did not lead to regression of liver fibrosis in patients with biopsy-confirmed alcohol-related liver disease. However, rifaximin-α seemed to reduce the progression of liver fibrosis, possibly due to the attenuation of liver inflammation, despite a higher self-reported alcohol consumption in the rifaximin-α group during the trial. Our results suggest that rifaximin-α might be beneficial in patients with asymptomatic alcohol-related liver disease by preventing progression to decompensated cirrhosis.

Alcohol-related liver disease is the most prevalent cause of cirrhosis in the United States and Europe, and liver fibrosis is the main prognostic factor contributing to liver-related morbidity and mortality. Over the past decade, non-invasive tests such as transient elastography and blood-based biomarkers have allowed for early identification of liver fibrosis in patients with asymptomatic alcohol-related liver disease. This has facilitated a rapidly growing need for pharmaceutical treatments that can prevent progression to cirrhosis. In this trial, 550 mg of rifaximin-α twice daily over 18 months significantly reduced the progression rate of liver fibrosis in the per-protocol population, with a number needed to treat of six. Furthermore, rifaximin-α seemed to reduce histological hepatic inflammation and improved non-invasive markers of fibrosis, inflammation, and extracellular matrix remodelling. The gut microbiome and gut-barrier function are altered in patients with alcohol-related liver disease.

### Cirrhosis improvement to alcoholic liver fibrosis after passive abstinence [^115CyLEV]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

We present a rare case of long-term alcoholic liver disease that progressed from alcoholic liver fibrosis to alcoholic liver cirrhosis, and following passive abstinence, the patient's condition then improved to alcoholic liver fibrosis. A 70-year-old Japanese man, who had consumed large amounts of alcohol since he was 20 years old, received a liver biopsy for evaluation of liver dysfunction at the age of 48 in 1991. The biopsy indicated alcoholic liver fibrosis, stage 2. Eight years later, a second biopsy indicated alcoholic liver cirrhosis.

The patient continued to drink until a cerebral hemorrhage in 2000 led to left hemiparesis. Thereafter, he had to accept passive abstinence. He then received follow-up liver biopsies in 2001 and 2002, both of which indicated improvement of the fibrosis.

### The natural history of alcohol-related liver disease [^1174n6dr]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

This review describes the natural history of alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD) in light of recent data that have synthesized existing knowledge on this topic and described new research cohorts to improve our understanding of progression and outcomes in ArLD.

- **Recent findings**: ArLD occurs following a threshold of alcohol consumption, but this threshold is lowered by the presence of comorbid factors, with obesity being the most common. The most common stage of ArLD is alcohol-related steatosis, which is associated with a low rate of progression to cirrhosis (3% per year), and nonliver-related morbidity is more likely to occur (4% versus 1% per year). In contrast, alcohol-related steatohepatitis or cirrhosis is more dangerous, with higher rates of both nonliver and liver-related mortality. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs at approximately 3% per year among people with ArLD cirrhosis.

- **Summary**: These data allow an understanding of ArLD to accurately counsel patients and guide public health policies. Awareness of the shortcomings of the available data, highlighted in a recent systematic review, will inform the design of further research, in particular to describe the multiple interacting factors that may cause ArLD to regress or progress.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^117LTqtE]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most prevalent cause of advanced liver disease in Europe and is the leading cause of death among adults with excessive alcohol consumption. There is a dose-response relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and the risk of ALD. The relative risk of cirrhosis increases in subjects who consume more than 25 g/day. The burden of alcohol-attributable liver cirrhosis and liver cancer is high and is entirely preventable. Health agencies should develop population-based policies to reduce the prevalence of harmful and/or hazardous alcohol consumption and foster research in this field to provide new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

Disease progression of patients with ALD is heavily influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of fibrosis have opened new perspectives in the early detection of advanced ALD in asymptomatic patients. Alcoholic hepatitis, the most severe form of ALD, carries a high short-term mortality (around 30–50% at 3 months). Corticosteroids improve short-term survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, but the duration of therapy should be adapted to early response. Liver transplantation is the best option for patients with severe liver dysfunction. However, alcohol relapse after transplantation remains a critical issue, and drinking habits of transplanted patients need to be routinely screened.

### Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis [^115Rq5w5]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Liver biopsy has long been an important tool for assessing the degree of liver fibrosis. Information on the presence and degree of liver fibrosis is useful before making therapeutic decisions or predicting disease outcomes. The need to stage liver fibrosis, however, should decrease as treatment options become more successful, as has occurred with viral hepatitis. In recent years, noninvasive tests have demonstrated a reasonable ability to identify significant fibrosis, cirrhosis in particular. It is not surprising that liver disease specialists and patients favor a noninvasive approach. However, only those tests with the highest diagnostic accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and availability should be implemented. Apart from their diagnostic accuracy, the potential ability of these tests to predict disease outcomes (a more relevant endpoint) should be compared with that of liver biopsy. Indeed, the use of a standardized system to evaluate the utility of biomarkers would facilitate their implementation in clinical practice.

### Evaluation of liver fibrosis: "Something old, something new… " [^114eadTQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Hepatic fibrosis is a central pathological healing process in progressive chronic liver disease. For many years, it was thought to be irreversible. The first notion of the regression of liver fibrosis appeared in medical literature in 1979 when Perez-Tamayo, analyzing the activity of liver collagenase, presented data supporting that cirrhosis could be reversible. Over the last three decades, fibrosis has been widely accepted as a dynamic process with a strong potential for significant resolution.

Substantial evidence has originated from data showing that successful treatment of underlying liver disorders could reverse fibrosis and probably even cirrhosis. Moreover, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver injury and insights into fibrogenesis have led to the development of novel therapeutic approaches and advanced drug targets, especially for patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (CHB) or C (CHC).

Scientific attention is currently focused on new anti-fibrotic therapies aiming at fibrosis reversibility and cirrhosis regression. It is, therefore, important, now more than ever, to ensure accurate and prompt assessment of hepatic fibrosis in therapeutic trials of chronic liver disease. Liver biopsy still remains the reference for assessing fibrosis, but it is now accepted that it is not a "gold standard". The dynamic process of fibrosis should be best measured as a continuous variable, and classical histological staging systems do not permit this.

This review focuses on histopathological and clinical challenges in the evaluation of liver fibrosis.

We identified potential participants from a clinical study that screened for alcohol-related liver fibrosis in individuals from primary and secondary care who had alcohol overuse, defined as 24 g per day or more for at least 1 year in women, and 36 g or more per day for at least 1 year for men. Sex was identified through medical records. Patients with a history of hepatic decompensation or any known liver disease were excluded. On the basis of the screening result, patients at risk of having liver fibrosis had a liver biopsy. Based on the histological assessment of liver biopsy samples, we included patients aged 18–75 years with liver fibrosis and histological features in keeping with alcohol-related liver disease.

In the protocol, patients were required to have an Ishak score of 1–4 for liver fibrosis on biopsies. However, in an amendment of the study protocol, we replaced the Ishak score with the Kleiner score for fibrosis (F1–F4). The reason for the revision was that no accepted fibrosis grading system for alcohol-related liver disease existed at the time of the study initiation. Since then, European guidelines on the management of alcohol-related liver disease proposed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) scoring systems as alternatives for fibrosis staging due to the large histological overlap between alcohol-related liver disease and NAFLD. For participant inclusion, we used the histological assessment by the on-call pathologist at the hospital. Women of child-bearing potential were required to be using a safe contraceptive and provide a negative pregnancy test.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^115ahuC3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids or the exacerbation of a preexisting subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting naltrexone hydrochloride treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids.

- **Switching from buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone, or methadone**: There are no systematically collected data that specifically address the switch from buprenorphine or methadone to naltrexone hydrochloride. However, a review of postmarketing case reports has indicated that some patients may experience severe manifestations of precipitated withdrawal when being switched from opioid agonist therapy to opioid antagonist therapy. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to the precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as 2 weeks. Healthcare providers should be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications.

- **Treatment of alcoholism**: A dose of 50 mg once daily is recommended for most patients. The placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an adjunctive treatment of alcoholism used a dose regimen of naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. Other dose regimens or durations of therapy were not evaluated in these trials.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^111h9ukH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride. If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter. A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids. As with many non-agonist treatments for addiction, naltrexone hydrochloride is of proven value only when given as part of a comprehensive plan of management that includes some measure to ensure the patient takes the medication.

- **Naloxone challenge test**: Clinicians are reminded that there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful if there is any question of occult opioid dependence. If signs of opioid withdrawal are still observed following naloxone challenge, treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride should not be attempted. The naloxone challenge can be repeated in 24 hours. The naloxone challenge test should not be performed in a patient showing clinical signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, or in a patient whose urine contains opioids. The naloxone challenge test may be administered by either the intravenous or subcutaneous routes.

- **Intravenous administration**: Inject 0.2 mg naloxone. Observe for 30 seconds for signs or symptoms of withdrawal. If no evidence of withdrawal is observed, inject 0.6 mg of naloxone and observe for an additional 20 minutes.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^1143Uras]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed.

In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with naltrexone hydrochloride should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone hydrochloride exposure during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing period. Transient, asymptomatic hepa

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^1117nBQv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

During two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trials to evaluate the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an adjunctive treatment of alcohol dependence, most patients tolerated naltrexone hydrochloride well. In these studies, a total of 93 patients received naltrexone hydrochloride at a dose of 50 mg once daily. Five of these patients discontinued naltrexone hydrochloride because of nausea. No serious adverse events were reported during these two trials.

- **Adverse reactions**: While extensive clinical studies evaluating the use of naltrexone hydrochloride in detoxified, formerly opioid-dependent individuals failed to identify any single, serious untoward risk of naltrexone hydrochloride use, placebo-controlled studies employing up to five-fold higher doses (up to 300 mg per day) than recommended for opiate receptor blockade have shown that naltrexone hydrochloride causes hepatocellular injury in a substantial proportion of patients exposed at higher doses (see warnings and precautions: laboratory tests).

Aside from this finding and the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal, available evidence does not incriminate naltrexone hydrochloride, used at any dose, as a cause of any other serious adverse reaction for patients who are opioid-free. It is critical to recognize that naltrexone hydrochloride can precipitate or exacerbate abstinence signs and symptoms in any individual who is not completely free of exogenous opioids.

Patients with addictive disorders, especially opioid addiction, are at risk for multiple nume

### Does knowledge of liver fibrosis affect high-risk drinking behaviour (KLIFAD): an open-label pragmatic feasibility randomised controlled trial [^115xGPjo]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

While not powered to show a statistical difference in key indicators of behavior change related to alcohol intake, our study revealed promising trends. At six months, the intervention group compared to the control group was more likely to reduce or stop drinking and to reduce the AUDIT category. In the intervention group, 41% reduced the AUDIT category to a level that they no longer had alcohol use disorder, compared to 21% in the control group. The finding of normal or elevated liver stiffness did not lead to unintended negative effects, such as an exacerbation in alcohol consumption.

Our study suggests that biomarker feedback may improve outcomes, and there is an increasing body of data to support this. A recent systematic review suggested that providing feedback to patients based on markers of liver injury is an effective way to reduce harmful alcohol intake. A feasibility study invited 1,128 individuals with hazardous or harmful drinking from nine primary care practices in the UK to have a liver fibrosis test using the Southampton Traffic Light (STL) test. Of them, 38% (n = 393) attended to have STL. Follow-up AUDIT scores at 8–12 months were available for 77% (303), with 50% (n = 76/153) with evidence of liver damage reducing drinking compared to 35% (n = 52/150) without liver damage. A prospective cohort control study invited 156 individuals who self-identify as high-risk drinkers and presented to community alcohol services to have liver fibrosis tested using TE. Of invited individuals, 56% (n = 87) attended TE appointments, and 38% had raised LSM.

### Treatment of alcoholic liver disease [^114Ga5P5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains a significant cause of liver-related mortality in the US and worldwide. The correct diagnosis of ALD can usually be made on a clinical basis in conjunction with blood tests, and a liver biopsy is not typically required. Abstinence is the cornerstone of therapy for ALD, and nutritional therapy is the first line of therapeutic intervention.

- **Role of steroids**: The role of steroids in patients with moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis is gaining increasing acceptance, with the caveat that patients be evaluated for the effectiveness of therapy at 1 week.

- **Pentoxifylline effectiveness**: Pentoxifylline appears to be especially effective in ALD patients with renal dysfunction/hepatorenal syndrome.

- **Use of biologics**: Biologics such as specific anti-TNFs have been disappointing and should probably not be used outside of the clinical trial setting.

- **Transplantation outcomes**: Transplantation is effective in patients with end-stage ALD who have stopped drinking (usually for ≥ 6 months), and both long-term graft and patient survival are excellent.

### Management of alcohol use disorder in patients with cirrhosis in the setting of liver transplantation [^115BLCbA]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

The prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been steadily increasing over the past decade. In parallel, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) has been increasing at an alarming rate, especially among young patients. Data suggest that most patients with ALD do not receive AUD therapy. Although liver transplantation is the only curative therapy for end-stage ALD, transplant candidacy is often a matter of debate given concerns about patients being under-treated for AUD and fears of post-transplantation relapse affecting the allograft.

In this review, we discuss diagnosis, predictors and effects of relapse, behavioral therapies, and pharmacotherapies. We propose an integrative, multidisciplinary, and multimodal approach for treating AUD in patients with cirrhosis, especially in the setting of liver transplantation. Notably, this approach takes into account the utility of AUD pharmacotherapy in patients on immunosuppressive medications and those with renal impairment after liver transplantation. We also propose a comprehensive and objective definition of relapse utilizing contemporary biomarkers to guide future clinical trials. Future research using the proposed approach and definition is warranted with the goal of optimizing AUD treatment in patients with cirrhosis, the transplant selection process, and post-transplantation care of patients with AUD.

The following constitutes key background information on alcohol-related liver disease:

- **Definition**: ALD encompasses a spectrum of disorders that may take an acute form (alcoholic hepatitis) or present as a chronic disease (steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis).

- **Pathophysiology**: ALD is caused by heavy alcohol use.

- **Disease course**: Alcohol abuse results in steatosis followed by steatohepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis due to inflammation, hepatocellular damage, and liver fibrosis. Disease progression may also cause liver decompensation and HCC.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 1-year mortality of ALD as a single group is around 20%.

### Designing clinical trials to address alcohol use and alcohol-associated liver disease: An expert panel consensus statement [^113eHZ54]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Most patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) engage in heavy drinking, defined as four or more drinks per day (56g) or eight (112g) or more drinks per week for women, and five or more drinks per day (70g) or 15 (210g) or more drinks per week for men. Although abstinence from alcohol after diagnosis of ALD improves life expectancy and reduces the risk of decompensation of liver disease, few studies have evaluated whether treatment of alcohol use disorders will reduce progression of liver disease and improve liver-related outcomes.

In November 2021, the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism commissioned a task force that included hepatologists, addiction medicine specialists, statisticians, clinical trialists, and members of regulatory agencies to develop recommendations for the design and conduct of clinical trials to evaluate the effect of alcohol use, particularly treatment to reduce or eliminate alcohol use in patients with ALD. The task force conducted extensive reviews of relevant literature on alcohol use disorders and ALD. Findings were presented at one in-person meeting and discussed over the next 16 months to develop the final recommendations. As few clinical trials directly address this topic, the 28 recommendations approved by all members of the task force represent a consensus of expert opinions.

### Evaluation of liver fibrosis: "Something old, something new… " [^113MEQUz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In the past decade, several non-invasive methods for assessing hepatic fibrosis have been published, resulting in more non-invasive tests than histologic scoring systems. The non-invasive tests were introduced to estimate the likelihood of advanced liver fibrosis in patients with chronic viral liver disease at presentation and on follow-up to assess fibrosis regression post-treatment. These tests were later applied in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

- **Three general categories of non-invasive tests**:
	1. Serologic panels or tests.
	2. Combinations with other serum tests and/or clinical features (such as age and gender) in complex algorithms.
	3. Imaging-based techniques.

Today, non-invasive methods are widely available. Their most important advantages are the absence of contra-indications and dangerous complications for the patients, and their reproducibility. In contrast to liver biopsy, many non-invasive methods can effectively evaluate fibrosis extent in the whole organ and not only in a part of it. Their potential ability to identify and differentiate between advanced fibrosis stages, the high specificity and sensitivity to diagnose cirrhosis, and their easy application make them useful tools in daily clinical practice. Their role becomes more significant because their diagnostic accuracy can be increased if they are combined; for instance, a serological panel may be used in conjunction with an imaging technique.

### Advances and challenges in the management of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^111TpW3i]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis treatment involves several strategies:

- **Nonpharmacological options**: Currently, lifestyle modification is the first-line recommendation for the treatment of NASH. In this context, lifestyle modification should lead to sustained weight loss. Although diet and exercise can lead to weight loss, less than 15% of patients can maintain the weight loss in the long run. Furthermore, a small amount of weight loss (3–5%) can lead to improvement in hepatic steatosis, while 7–10% weight loss is required to see improvement in necroinflammation and fibrosis in NASH. Additionally, exercise may also play a beneficial role. It was recently shown that either aerobic or resistance exercise, in moderate intensity, 3–4 times a week for 20–40 minutes per session, is ideal for fat mobilization from the liver. It should be noted that increased physical activity should be accompanied by a healthier diet to achieve the desired goals. As noted previously, the sustainability of weight loss through lifestyle modification is quite limited.

### Rifaximin-α for liver fibrosis in patients with alcohol-related liver disease (GALA-RIF): A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^113Czjpy]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The leading cause of liver-related mortality worldwide is alcohol, with the gut-liver axis playing a critical role in the development of alcohol-related liver disease. Rifaximin-α has been found to improve gut-barrier function and reduce systemic inflammation in patients with cirrhosis. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of rifaximin-α versus placebo in individuals with alcohol-related liver disease.

The GALA-RIF trial was an investigator-initiated, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre, phase 2 trial conducted at Odense University Hospital in Denmark. Eligible participants were adults aged 18 to 75 who had a history of alcohol overuse (defined as consumption of at least 24 g of alcohol per day for women and 36 g for men over a minimum of 1 year), biopsy-proven alcohol-related liver disease, and no prior hepatic decompensation. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) via a web-based randomisation system to receive either oral rifaximin-α (550 mg) twice daily or a matched placebo for 18 months. The randomisation process was conducted in blocks of four, stratified by fibrosis stage and alcohol abstinence. The study was blinded for participants, sponsors, investigators, and nurses regarding the randomisation outcome.

The primary endpoint of the study was a histological decrease of at least one fibrosis stage from baseline to the 18-month treatment mark, measured by the Kleiner fibrosis score. Additionally, the study assessed the number of patients showing progression by at least one fibrosis stage over the same period. Primary analyses were conducted in the per-protocol and modified intention-to-treat populations, with safety assessments integrated throughout.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116Tkmub]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Vulnerability to opioid overdose**: After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have reduced tolerance to opioids. As the blockade of exogenous opioids provided by naltrexone hydrochloride wanes and eventually dissipates completely, patients who have been treated with naltrexone hydrochloride may respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used, just as they would shortly after completing detoxification. This could result in potentially life-threatening opioid intoxication, such as respiratory compromise or arrest and circulatory collapse if the patient uses previously tolerated doses of opioids. Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients after discontinuing treatment.

Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to the patient of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose [see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients].

There is also the possibility that a patient who is treated with naltrexone hydrochloride could overcome the opioid blockade effect of naltrexone hydrochloride. Although naltrexone hydrochloride is a potent antagonist, the blockade produced by naltrexone hydrochloride is surmountable. The plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade. This poses a potential risk to individuals who attempt on.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^114WCTNs]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Identification of people with NAFLD is crucial. The use of defined pathways for the investigation of suspected liver disease has been shown to increase the diagnosis of significant liver disease and reduce unnecessary referrals. Therefore, services should have an agreed local clinical pathway for the investigation of suspected liver disease that includes an assessment for liver fibrosis using available non-invasive liver fibrosis tests (Recommendation 1, Table 1). Key aspects to consider when developing pathways are described below.

NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, which is defined as any three of the following: impaired fasting glucose or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, increased waist circumference, or high blood pressure. NAFLD is highly prevalent in those with T2DM or the metabolic syndrome, and the presence of these risk factors is associated with more progressive liver disease in NAFLD. Therefore, consider the possibility of liver fibrosis due to NAFLD in those with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or the metabolic syndrome (Recommendation 2, Table 1).

Proactive assessment for the presence of liver fibrosis in patients at risk can permit earlier identification of significant liver disease. The 'Scarred Liver Project', which offered community fibrosis testing to people with diabetes or obesity alongside those with hazardous alcohol consumption, identified 3,688 patients at risk from a cohort of 25,018. Overall, 20% of at-risk individuals who attended a follow-up clinic had evidence of significant liver disease.

### Historical features are poor predictors of liver fibrosis in Canadian patients with chronic hepatitis C [^112eBrRi]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2001). Low credibility.

The progression of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) is related to host factors, including age, gender, and alcohol consumption. Due to the morbidity and potential mortality associated with liver biopsy, a noninvasive method of assessing hepatic fibrosis is needed. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of historical features in predicting fibrosis using published rates of fibrosis progression.

Charts of 239 untreated patients with HCV were reviewed. Patients who had a liver biopsy and whose duration of infection could be estimated (n = 106) were categorized according to gender, age at infection (≤ 40 years), and peak alcohol consumption (≥ 50 g/day). Estimates of fibrosis were calculated using the product of the interval between infection and biopsy and published rates of fibrosis progression. These estimates were compared with liver biopsies staged according to the Metavir system (F0-F4; F0 = no fibrosis; F4 = cirrhosis).

The mean age of patients was 42 ± 8 years, with 61% being male and 36% consuming more than 50 g of alcohol daily. The mean duration of infection was 19 ± 9 years (range, 1–40), and ALT was elevated to more than 1.5 times the upper normal level in 63%.

- **Mild fibrosis (F0-F2)**: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of an estimate of mild fibrosis were 60%, 55%, 78%, and 34%, respectively.
- **Severe fibrosis (F3-F4)**: Estimates showed a sensitivity of 55%, specificity of 60%, positive predictive value of 34%, and negative predictive value of 78%.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^114Maziq]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Ideally, second-stage non-invasive testing should be delivered in the community to reduce the unnecessary referral to secondary care for some individuals with a false positive simple NIT. However, where these services are not available in the community, patients should be referred to secondary services for further workup.

The overwhelming majority of liver-related complications in patients with NAFLD occur in those with cirrhosis. NITs have high negative predictive values for advanced fibrosis, so they can reliably exclude the presence of cirrhosis. Moreover, long-term follow-up studies have shown that patients with low-risk NITs have a very low risk of liver-related events in the short- to medium-term, and their main morbidity is cardiovascular disease and non-hepatic malignancy. One recent long-term follow-up study of 1,057 patients showed that individuals with NAFLD and a FIB-4 score < 1.3 had a very low incidence rate for liver-related events of 2.6 per 1,000 patient years. Therefore, for these patients, the focus should be on lifestyle advice and cardiovascular risk reduction with the aim of improving their overall quality and length of life. NAFLD can progress to advanced fibrosis in a significant proportion of patients in the medium-term, particularly those with, or who develop, T2DM and those who gain weight. Therefore, individuals with these risk factors should be targeted for more proactive lifestyle modification, optimization of treatment for T2DM, and cardiovascular risk reduction.

### Rezdiffra [^114yiN9z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Table 8 presents the Month 12 histopathology results comparing REZDIFFRA with placebo on:

- **Percentage of patients with resolution of steatohepatitis and no worsening of liver fibrosis**: Two pathologists, Pathologist A and Pathologist B, independently read the liver biopsies for each patient.

- **Percentage of patients with at least one stage improvement in liver fibrosis and no worsening of steatohepatitis**: Both the 80 mg once daily and the 100 mg once daily dosages of REZDIFFRA demonstrated improvement on these histopathology endpoints at Month 12 compared to placebo.

In a statistical analysis incorporating both pathologists' independent readings, REZDIFFRA achieved statistical significance on both histopathology endpoints for both doses.

Examination of age, gender, diabetes status (Yes or No), and fibrosis stage (F2 or F3) subgroups did not identify differences in response to REZDIFFRA among these subgroups. The majority of patients in the trial were white (89%); there were too few patients of other races to adequately assess differences in response by race.

Starting at Month 3 and through Month 12, there was a trend of greater reductions from baseline in average ALT and AST in the REZDIFFRA groups as compared to the placebo group.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^117PLnHE]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The presence of steatosis typically precedes the development of fibrosis, but the influence of fat accumulation on the progression of fibrosis is not well known. The long-term survival of patients with isolated steatosis is clearly reduced compared to that of abstinent controls. After a mean follow-up of approximately 10 years, patients with alcoholic steatosis died more frequently than those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (74% vs. 25%) and more patients developed cirrhosis (21% vs. 1%). Twenty-five percent of the observed deaths among heavy drinkers were associated with cirrhosis and 75% were attributed to other diseases related to alcohol.

Patients with underlying severe fibrosis or cirrhosis and heavy alcohol intake can present a form of acute-on-chronic liver failure called alcoholic hepatitis (AH). This is characterized by an abrupt rise in serum bilirubin levels, jaundice, and liver-related complications. Previously, it was considered that AH could occur in patients with mild underlying liver disease. However, more recent studies using tru-cut needles have shown that the majority of patients with severe AH have underlying cirrhosis. Patients with severe forms of AH show high short-term mortality around 30–50% at 3 months. Patients with AH disclosed the fastest progression of fibrosis and consequently an increased risk of liver-related death. Among other factors, obesity is an independent risk factor for progression to cirrhosis. Heavy drinkers who are overweight for at least 10 years have a 2-fold risk of developing cirrhosis.

### Noninvasive measures of liver fibrosis [^116cCegg]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

As novel therapies for liver fibrosis evolve, non-invasive measurement of liver fibrosis will be required to help manage patients with chronic liver disease. Although liver biopsy is the time-honored gold standard for the measurement of liver fibrosis, it is poorly suited to frequent monitoring due to its expense and morbidity. Its accuracy also suffers from sampling variation.

Currently, serum markers and imaging methods are available and increasingly being used as alternatives to biopsy. However, many questions remain about their indications, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. More investigation is required before they are put into widespread use. The development of safe, inexpensive, and reliable noninvasive fibrosis measurement tools remains a research priority in clinical hepatology.

### Pathobiology of liver fibrosis: A translational success story [^115Pkdgh]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Reversibility of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis following antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C has advanced the prospect of developing antifibrotic therapies for patients with chronic liver diseases, especially non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Mechanisms of fibrosis have focused on hepatic stellate cells, which become fibrogenic myofibroblasts during injury through 'activation' and are at the nexus of efforts to define novel drug targets. Recent studies have clarified pathways of stellate cell gene regulation and epigenetics, emerging pathways of fibrosis regression through the recruitment and amplification of fibrolytic macrophages, nuanced responses of discrete inflammatory cell subsets, and the identification of the 'ductular reaction' as a marker of severe injury and repair.

Based on our expanded knowledge of fibrosis pathogenesis, attention is now directed towards strategies for antifibrotic therapies and regulatory challenges for conducting clinical trials with these agents. New therapies are attempting to: 1) Control or cure the primary disease or reduce tissue injury; 2) Target receptor-ligand interactions and intracellular signaling; 3) Inhibit fibrogenesis; and 4) Promote resolution of fibrosis. Progress is urgently needed in validating non-invasive markers of fibrosis progression and regression that can supplant biopsy and shorten the duration of clinical trials. Both scientific and clinical challenges remain, however, the past three decades of steady progress in understanding liver fibrosis have contributed to an emerging translational success story.

### Alcohol consumption in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Convenient vs. inconvenient truths [^117FER9J]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Understanding the role of modest alcohol consumption in patients with non-alcohol induced fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains a significant challenge, with no clear guidance on counseling regarding alcohol use. Conventionally, the strong association of alcohol excess and the development of complications related to chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma, has led practitioners to advocate complete abstinence for those with NAFLD. New evidence published in this issue of the Red Journal challenges the historic paradigm by showing that modest, non-binge wine consumption (< 70g/week) is associated with a significantly lower risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis on biopsy compared with complete abstinence across a well-characterized single-center cohort of nearly 200 patients with NAFLD.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^113wevFS]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major indication for liver transplantation worldwide. Patients needing a transplant due to ALD often present with multisystemic effects of long-term ethanol abuse at the time of transplantation. These comorbidities include malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, non-immune hemolytic anemia, peripheral and central neural system abnormalities, nephropathy, muscle wasting due to alcoholic myopathy, and others. Therefore, the integral care of the transplanted patient with ALD ideally requires a multidisciplinary approach.

Most liver programs require a 6-month period of abstinence prior to the evaluation of alcoholic patients. The rationale behind this strategy is to allow for disease regression in patients with recent alcohol abstinence and to ensure proper alcohol counseling to prevent relapse after liver transplantation. As with other causes of decompensated liver disease, patients are listed if the MELD score is ≥ 15. In patients with ALD, the survival benefit among transplant recipients arises only from this threshold.

- **Alcohol abstinence**: Abstinence is a critical issue, and the drinking habits of transplanted patients need to be routinely screened by physicians using tools of proven reliability. However, there is no consensus concerning the definition of alcohol relapse. For some experts, any drinking is considered a relapse, whereas others define excessive drinking as a relapse because only this drinking pattern is associated with alcohol-induced liver injury.
