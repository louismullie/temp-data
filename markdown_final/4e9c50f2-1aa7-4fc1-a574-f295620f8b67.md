## Question

what is the treatment for ileus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of ileus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing mechanical from paralytic ileus because management diverges fundamentally. Then, I should verify the universal supportive measures that apply to all cases. Next, I will examine prevention and treatment within an ERAS framework, including early feeding, opioid minimization, and thoracic epidural analgesia. After that, I need to review pharmacologic options such as alvimopan, methylnaltrexone, and prokinetics, and check the evidence for chewing gum and acupuncture. Finally, I should address special scenarios like gallstone ileus, fulminant C. difficile with ileus, and prolonged ileus requiring parenteral nutrition, and close with a practical algorithm and outcome monitoring plan.

> Let me first confirm the foundational distinction, because if I misclassify this, I could harm the patient. Mechanical ileus requires surgical relief of the physical obstruction, whereas paralytic (adynamic) ileus reflects impaired motility without a fixed blockage and is managed medically unless complications arise, so I need to ensure imaging and clinical correlation before committing to an operative pathway [^115wAddC] [^116UQ4dv].

> Next, I should review universal supportive measures that apply regardless of etiology. I need to check electrolytes, especially potassium, magnesium, and calcium, correct hypovolemia or fluid overload with goal-directed therapy, and avoid routine nasogastric decompression unless there is severe vomiting or marked distension, because unnecessary NG tubes can worsen dysmotility and delay recovery. I should also minimize opioids and implement early mobilization to facilitate gut function [^115ENUjh] [^113EvPng].

> Now, I will examine prevention and treatment within an ERAS protocol, since this is where the strongest evidence lies. Wait, let me verify the timing of feeding: contemporary guidelines recommend offering a regular diet within 24 hours after elective colorectal surgery, which accelerates GI recovery and shortens length of stay without increasing complications, so I should not default to prolonged NPO unless there is a compelling reason [^113j3HK6] [^116EXMwB]. I should confirm opioid-sparing strategies, including multimodal analgesia and regional techniques, because opioids directly suppress GI motility and contribute to ileus; thoracic epidural with local anesthetic is particularly beneficial in open surgery and can reduce ileus duration by blocking inhibitory neural reflexes and reducing opioid requirements [^113EvPng] [^115ENUjh]. I need to ensure minimally invasive approaches when feasible, as laparoscopy reduces surgical trauma and inflammatory signaling that drive ileus [^115ENUjh].

> I will now examine pharmacologic therapy, starting with peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists. Alvimopan is FDA-approved for postoperative ileus after bowel resection and accelerates GI recovery and discharge in open surgery. However, I should double-check that its benefit is less clear in laparoscopic surgery within modern ERPs, and I must remember the boxed warning and inpatient-only restriction due to MI risk signals in long-term use outside the POI indication [^1112BABV] [^112jgaVX]. Hold on, I should verify methylnaltrexone's role: despite biologic plausibility, phase 3 trials did not show benefit for POI, so I should not rely on it for this indication even though pediatric anesthesia literature suggests potential utility for opioid-induced ileus in children, which is a different context [^115ni48k] [^1147cW1F].

> Let me consider prokinetic agents next, but I should be cautious. Metoclopramide and erythromycin have been studied, yet high-quality evidence does not support their routine use to hasten ileus resolution; EAST recommends early enteral nutrition but issues no recommendation for or against these prokinetics, so I should avoid reflexively prescribing them unless there is a specific indication like gastroparesis or bezoar risk where erythromycin might be reasonable [^112yiYsi] [^113zR5uD].

> But wait, what about chewing gum as sham feeding to stimulate vagal tone. The Cochrane review suggests modest reductions in time to flatus and bowel movement and a small decrease in length of stay, yet heterogeneity is high and benefits appear attenuated within ERAS programs. Moreover, pediatric meta-analysis shows no benefit, so I should frame gum chewing as low-risk and possibly helpful but not a substitute for core ERAS measures [^112Edr49] [^112HR2b1]. I should also note that newer trials in emergency settings suggest potential benefit, but replication and quality remain concerns, so I will not overstate its effect size [^113E7Dzy].

> Next, I should review neuromodulatory options. Electroacupuncture at ST36 reduced time to first defecation and halved prolonged POI incidence in a multicenter RCT embedded in ERAS, which is intriguing; however, I need to ensure availability, standardization, and patient acceptance before recommending routine adoption, and I should confirm that results are reproducible across centers and surgical contexts [^115b1wtv].

> I will now examine special scenarios, starting with gallstone ileus. Let me think about site-specific management: for stones impacted in the small bowel, two-stage surgery with enterolithotomy followed by interval cholecystectomy and fistula repair is generally favored due to lower mortality, whereas for duodenal or colonic impactions, one-stage repair may be reasonable when the patient's condition allows. I should confirm that fistula persistence carries risks of recurrence and cholangitis, guiding the timing of definitive biliary surgery [^111j3gXP] [^115WYjRM].

> For fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection with ileus, I should confirm dual therapy is indicated. High-dose oral vancomycin plus intravenous metronidazole is standard, and if oral delivery is compromised by ileus, vancomycin should be administered rectally as retention enemas to ensure colonic drug exposure. I need to ensure dosing at 500 mg every 6 hours rectally in addition to 500 mg IV metronidazole every 8 hours, recognizing that adjunctive rectal therapy is supported by IDSA/SHEA and ESCMID despite limited direct outcome data [^113T3r2f] [^114HDVgv].

> For prolonged paralytic ileus beyond about 5–7 days without signs of obstruction or ischemia, I should consider parenteral nutrition to prevent malnutrition while continuing motility-supportive measures. I need to ensure that EN is not forced in the face of severe intolerance, but I should also revisit the diagnosis to exclude evolving mechanical obstruction or pseudo-obstruction before labeling the case as refractory [^112wXU4s] [^1148hPNR].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with evidence. First, confirm the diagnosis and exclude mechanical obstruction with exam and imaging when indicated. Second, implement supportive care with electrolyte correction, fluid optimization, early mobilization, and selective NG decompression. Third, apply ERAS principles including early feeding within 24 hours, opioid minimization with regional anesthesia when appropriate, and minimally invasive techniques. Fourth, in open colorectal surgery with expected opioid exposure, consider alvimopan. Fifth, consider adjuncts like chewing gum or electroacupuncture where feasible, recognizing variable evidence. Sixth, tailor management to special etiologies such as gallstone ileus or fulminant C. difficile. And seventh, escalate to parenteral nutrition if ileus persists beyond a week without resolution, reassessing for missed obstruction or pseudo-obstruction [^115ENUjh] [^1112BABV] [^112Edr49] [^115b1wtv].

> Finally, I should confirm how to monitor outcomes, because inconsistent endpoints have plagued the literature. The core outcome set for POI studies recommends tracking incidence of POI, time to tolerance of solid diet, time to first flatus and bowel movement, need for NG decompression, length of stay, readmission, and patient-reported recovery, and I should align local quality metrics with these domains to enable benchmarking and continuous improvement [^115Z3JbH] [^112PGjyA].

The cornerstone of ileus management is **multimodal supportive care** with early mobilization, correction of electrolytes, and careful fluid management [^115ENUjh] [^113EvPng]. Early enteral feeding is encouraged when safe, and **opioid-sparing analgesia** is essential to reduce opioid-induced dysmotility [^113j3HK6] [^116M2wv3]. Pharmacologic options include **alvimopan** for opioid-related ileus after open bowel resection [^1112BABV] and **neostigmine** for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction [^115wzqAQ]. Nasogastric decompression is reserved for severe distension or vomiting, and surgery is indicated only for complications or refractory cases [^115wzqAQ].

---

## Supportive care measures

Supportive care forms the foundation of ileus management, aiming to restore normal gastrointestinal motility and prevent complications [^112yiYsi].

- **Early mobilization**: Encourage ambulation within 24 hours postoperatively to stimulate gastrointestinal motility and reduce ileus duration [^115nd8mz].

- **Electrolyte correction**: Promptly correct electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as these significantly impact bowel function [^111ujv1s].

- **Fluid management**: Use goal-directed fluid therapy to avoid both dehydration and fluid overload, which can exacerbate ileus [^115ENUjh].

- **Nasogastric decompression**: Reserve for patients with severe abdominal distension, persistent vomiting, or significant discomfort. Routine use is discouraged due to potential complications [^115ENUjh].

---

## Nutritional strategies

Nutritional interventions play a critical role in managing ileus, with **early enteral nutrition (EN)** strongly recommended when feasible [^112yiYsi]. Early EN — initiating within 24 hours postoperatively — is associated with faster return of bowel function, reduced length of hospital stay, and lower incidence of postoperative complications [^1172M3qC]. If EN is contraindicated or not tolerated, initiate parenteral nutrition (PN) within 3–5 days to meet nutritional needs and prevent malnutrition [^115wzqAQ].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacologic agents are adjuncts to supportive care, targeting specific mechanisms underlying ileus [^112yiYsi].

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Alvimopan | Peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist | Postoperative ileus after open bowel resection | Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence [^1112BABV] |
| Neostigmine | Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor | Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) | Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence [^notfound] |
| Metoclopramide | Dopamine antagonist | Gastroparesis or delayed gastric emptying | Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence [^notfound] |
| Erythromycin | Motilin agonist | Gastroparesis or delayed gastric emptying | Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence [^notfound] |

---

Alvimopan is particularly effective in **opioid-related ileus** after open bowel resection, accelerating gastrointestinal recovery and reducing length of stay [^1112BABV]. Neostigmine is effective for **acute colonic pseudo-obstruction**, especially when conservative measures fail [^115wzqAQ].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for refractory cases or complications. Indications include **prolonged ileus** (typically > 7–10 days without improvement despite conservative therapy) and **complications** such as suspected perforation, ischemia, or severe obstruction. Surgical options include exploratory laparotomy with adhesiolysis, bowel resection, or bypass, tailored to the underlying cause and patient condition [^115wAddC].

---

## Preventive strategies

Preventing ileus is as important as treating it, with **multimodal enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols** significantly reducing incidence and severity [^116Bf5NY].

- **Minimally invasive surgery**: Laparoscopic approaches reduce tissue trauma and postoperative ileus incidence [^115ENUjh].

- **Opioid-sparing analgesia**: Multimodal analgesia, including NSAIDs and regional anesthesia, minimizes opioid use and associated gastrointestinal dysfunction [^112P9mzX].

- **Early feeding**: Initiating oral intake within 24 hours postoperatively promotes gastrointestinal motility and reduces ileus duration [^111aXZqZ].

- **Chewing gum**: Sham feeding stimulates gastrointestinal motility and may reduce ileus duration, though evidence is mixed [^112Edr49].

---

## Emerging therapies

Recent research has explored novel therapies, including **vagus nerve stimulation**, which shows promise in reducing postoperative ileus but requires further validation [^113Bptt2], and **acupuncture**, which may reduce ileus duration and improve gastrointestinal recovery, though evidence remains limited [^115b1wtv].

---

## Complications and prognosis

Untreated or prolonged ileus can lead to significant complications, including **malnutrition** due to prolonged inability to tolerate enteral feeding, increased risk of pneumonia from aspiration and atelectasis, and higher rates of venous thromboembolism from immobility. Prognosis is generally favorable with appropriate management, though prolonged ileus increases morbidity, length of stay, and healthcare costs [^115Z3JbH].

---

Effective ileus management relies on **multimodal supportive care**, early enteral nutrition, and selective pharmacologic therapy, with surgery reserved for refractory cases or complications. Preventive strategies, including ERAS protocols and opioid-sparing analgesia, are essential to minimize incidence and severity [^115ENUjh].

### Mechanical decompression of the intestine in treatment of ileus… [^113pQ25h]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The production of immediate and complete relief from distention of the small bowel associated with acute mechanical intestinal obstruction by performing enterostomy and stripping, or milking, the contents of the bowel at the time of operation would be a desirable accomplishment if the necessary manipulation of the intestine were not accompanied by considerable immediate or delayed undesirable effects. The evaluation of the procedure on the basis of clinical experience has resulted in the expression of widely divergent opinions by observers who have had equal or comparable experience in the management of intestinal obstruction. Clinicians who have advocated stripping or evacuation of the intestinal contents at the time of operation for the relief of acute intestinal obstruction include Moynihan, 1 Cheever, 2 Holden3 and Van Zwalenburg. 4 Morton, 5 on the other hand, expressed the opinion of physicians who are opposed to the method and asserted that emptying.

Treatment

Principles of treatment

In general, since natural stone exclusion occurs at a low rate of approximately 1.3%, surgery is indicated for cases of gallstone ileus involving both stone extraction to resolve the ileus and closure of the fistula. However, whether surgery should be performed as a one-stage or two-stage operation remains unclear. Based on a study in 1994, Reisner and Cohenindicated that despite mortality rate in simple stone extraction of 11.7%, one-stage surgery shows higher mortality rate of 16.9% with a higher level of invasiveness. Based on a study in 2014, Halabi et al reported significantly increased length of hospital stay and mortality rates in patients who underwent one-stage internal biliary fistula closure; for patients with ileus, one-stage surgery is excessively invasive, and associated postoperative complications are common. Nevertheless, those studies assessed overall cases of gallstone ileus regardless of the impaction site, and majority of the cases included showed impaction at the small intestine.

With regard to two-stage surgery for gallstone ileus, the initial procedure involves simple stone extraction, followed by fistula closure performed separately. However, two-stage surgery has a disadvantage of associated risk of recurrence, retrograde cholecystitis, and cancer development due to remaining cholecystointestinal fistula. Surgeons should consider three related issues as follows.

Effects of persistent cholecystointestinal fistula

Persistence of cholecystointestinal fistula is a potential causal factor for retrograde cholecystitis or gallbladder cancer. The cholecystointestinal fistula remained untreated in 86.7% of cases of recurrent gallstone ileus, while cholecystectomy is necessary indication in patients with symptomatic gallstone. A total proportion of 11% of cholecystoduodenal fistula and 60% of cholecystocolonic fistula resulted in cholangitis, and 15% of cases of fistula showed complication of gallbladder cancer.

### Reducing the burden of postoperative ileus: evaluating and implementing an evidence-based strategy [^114qVDai]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus remains a significant clinical and economic burden to the health care system. Over the last decade, several advances in both medical and surgical therapies have been made to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative ileus. Despite these advances, though, the incidence of ileus remains high. This narrative review focuses on interventions aimed to prevent and treat postoperative ileus while presenting a step-by-step process for implementation of an evidenced-based strategy.

Methods

A literature search was performed using Medline/PubMed, and articles related to postoperative ileus were identified. The bibliographies of all retrieved articles were reviewed to obtain additional articles of relevance.

Results

There are many factors that can influence gastrointestinal recovery that can be categorized as management-, drug-, or surgery-related. While several strategies exist to improve gastrointestinal recovery, few have been shown to reduce length of hospital stay. These strategies are described here, along with a structured approach organized by preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative considerations.

Conclusions

Postoperative ileus is associated with a significant clinical and economic burden to the health care system. Strategies such as the development of a multidisciplinary team and the creation of a multimodal protocol are encouraged with continuous quality assurance to assess outcomes at the local level.

### Gallstone ileus: revisiting surgical outcomes using national surgical quality improvement program data [^111KeczL]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although surgical management remains the mainstay of therapy for gallstone ileus, the optimal approach — enterolithotomy alone or combined with biliary-enteric fistula disruption — is controversial because of the reliance on small single-center series to describe outcomes. Using the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, we sought to (1) review the outcomes of patients undergoing surgical management of gallstone ileus and (2) determine if cholecystectomy in addition to enterolithotomy increased morbidity or mortality rate.

Methods

We analyzed the demographics, comorbidities, acuity, operative time, postoperative hospitalization length, and 30-d morbidity and mortality rates of 127 patients from 2005 to 2010 who underwent a procedure for the relief of gallstone ileus. We identified a subset of 14 patients who underwent simultaneous cholecystectomy. We compared the "no cholecystectomy" and "cholecystectomy" groups using standard statistical methods.

Results

The overall 30-d postoperative morbidity and mortality rate was 35.4% and 5.5%, respectively. Superficial surgical site infection and urinary tract infection were the most common complications. There was no significant difference in mortality rate between the no cholecystectomy and the cholecystectomy groups (5.3% versus 7.1%, respectively; P = 0.78), but the latter group did experience more minor complications, longer operations, and longer postoperative hospitalization.

Conclusions

Other recent studies on this topic have collected data or reviewed literature across several decades, making this study in particular one of the largest truly modern series. Perhaps reflecting changes in perioperative management, surgical treatment of gallstone ileus is less morbid than previously described, but there is still insufficient evidence to favor concurrent cholecystectomy.

This article will review the pathophysiology of postoperative ileus, with emphasis on potential therapeutic targets, and examine the efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Proposed mechanisms include actuation of spinal and local sympathetic neural reflexes, inflammatory mediation, and exacerbation by anesthetic or surgical procedures. Some procedures or agents have shown clinical benefit, and these include use of laparoscopic surgery, thoracic epidurals, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opiate antagonists. Other procedures may be helpful with low risk of adverse effects. These include early feeding and ambulation, laxatives, and possibly neostigmine.

### Peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists and postoperative ileus: mechanisms of action and clinical applicability [^112nRoCW]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Postoperative ileus (POI), a transient cessation of coordinated bowel function after surgery, is an important health care problem. The etiology of POI is multifactorial and related to both the surgical and anesthetic pathways chosen. Opioids used to manage surgical pain can exacerbate POI, delaying gastrointestinal (GI) recovery. Peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor (PAM-OR) antagonists are designed to mitigate the deleterious effects of opioids on GI motility. This new class is investigational for POI management with the goal of accelerating the recovery of upper and lower GI tract function after bowel resection. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms by which POI occurs and the role of opioids and opioid receptors in the enteric nervous system, discuss the mechanism of action of PAM-OR antagonists, and review clinical pharmacology and Phase II/III POI trial results of methylnaltrexone and alvimopan. Finally, the role of anesthesiologists in managing POI in the context of a multimodal approach is discussed.

### Safety and efficacy of methylnaltrexone in shortening the duration of postoperative ileus following segmental colectomy: results of two randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials [^115ni48k]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Postoperative ileus contributes to surgical morbidity and is associated with prolonged hospitalization and increased health care costs. The efficacy and safety of the peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist methylnaltrexone in shortening the duration of postoperative ileus following segmental colectomy was evaluated.

Methods

Two identically designed, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies randomly assigned patients undergoing segmental colectomy (study 1, N = 515; study 2, N = 533) to receive 12 or 24 mg of methylnaltrexone intravenously or placebo every 6 hours starting within 90 minutes of surgery completion, continuing for up to 10 days or up to 24 hours after gastrointestinal recovery. The primary efficacy end point was the time from the end of surgery to the first bowel movement. Safety was evaluated via standard assessments (ie, adverse events and related withdrawals, physical examinations, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms) and assessment of surgical complications.

Results

The primary and secondary efficacy outcomes (time to discharge eligibility, time to hospital discharge, and clinically meaningful events of nausea and vomiting following segmental colectomy) did not differ significantly between patients treated with either a dose of methylnaltrexone or with placebo. Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were comparable across all treatment groups in both studies. The most commonly observed adverse events were nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting.

Conclusions

Although the efficacy of methylnaltrexone in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus was not demonstrated in these studies, intravenous methylnaltrexone at doses of 12 mg and 24 mg was safe, in general, and well tolerated in postcolectomy patients. The utility of intravenous methylnaltrexone in treating postoperative ileus remains unproven.

### Pathophysiology and management of postoperative ileus in adults and neonates: a review [^1172GrdJ]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Postoperative ileus (POI) is caused by enteric neural dysfunction and inflammatory response to the stress of surgery as well as the effect of anesthetics and opioid pain medications. POI results in prolonged hospital stays, increased medical costs, and diminished enteral nutrition, rendering it a problem worth tackling. Many cellular pathways are implicated in this disease process, creating numerous opportunities for targeted management strategies. There is a gap in the literature in studies exploring neonatal POI pathophysiology and treatment options. It is well known that neonatal immune and enteric nervous systems are immature, and this results in gut physiology which is distinct from adults. Neonates undergoing abdominal surgery face similar surgical stressors and exposure to medications that cause POI in adults. In this review, we aim to summarize the existing adult and neonatal literature on POI pathophysiology and management and explore applications in the neonatal population.

### Effect of acupuncture on postoperative ileus after laparoscopic elective colorectal surgery: a prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^112tp87X]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative ileus (POI) is a block of coordinated bowel motility after surgery and is considered an often-unavoidable consequence of abdominal or retroperitoneal surgery. During the past decade, although the management of POI has changed from a 'supportive' to 'active' strategy aimed at identifying, preventing, and treating all perioperative factors contributing to POI, the reported duration is still as long as 4 days. Therefore, it is clearly associated with prolonged hospital stay, increasing costs, and higher 30-day readmission rate. Due to inability to fulfil social roles and obligations and curtailment of normal social activities, POI had a profound negative impact on daily life, physical and psychosocial functioning, and wellbeing.

With the implementation of minimally invasive surgery and the emergence of enhanced recovery protocols (ERAS), patient's physical conditions have been improved, reflected in shortened hospitalisation and reduced costs. However, the improvement is still insufficient, and often requires combination with pharmacological treatments, such as prokinetics and opioid antagonists. Alvimopan, a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist, is the only pharmacological treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States (FDA), but it is not approved in China. In addition, the clinical benefit of alvimopan was most apparent in a subgroup of patients who received opioids for post-operative pain management. With the increasing use of opioid-sparing postoperative analgesia, the role of alvimopan in alleviation of POI might be limited. Therefore, a more safe and effective treatment is urgently needed.

### Bowel stimulation before loop ileostomy closure to reduce postoperative ileus: a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^114SUEeC]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Loop ileostomies are commonly employed for temporary protection of high-risk colorectal anastomoses. However, a second operation is required to restore intestinal continuity, and loop ileostomy closure is associated with considerable postoperative morbidity. Of all complications following closure, postoperative ileus (POI) is the most common, with large observational studies reporting incidences ranging from 10 to 20%. POI is also a leading cause of 30-day readmission following loop ileostomy closure, particularly in the context of modern Enhanced Recovery Protocols (ERP) with early, or even same-day, discharge.

While transient gut dysmotility can be expected after any gastrointestinal operation, in the case of an ileostomy, the defunctionalized segment of bowel undergoes a series of structural and functional changes that may increase the time it takes for motility to resume after closure. Studies have demonstrated that defunctionalization of the ileum leads to atrophy of its villi and muscular layers, as well as changes in gut hormone production and the absorptive capacity in the distal bowel segments. These functional and structural changes may provide a unique target for preoperative intervention in an attempt to improve postoperative return of bowel function. In 2014, Abrisqueta et al. published a single-center randomized controlled trial of 70 patients, evaluating the impact of preoperative bowel stimulation through the efferent limb of the ileostomy on POI after loop ileostomy closure. They demonstrated a decreased rate of POI in the stimulated group (3% vs. 20%, p < 0.001) and a 2-day reduction in postoperative length of stay. To date, this was the only randomized trial to assess bowel stimulation before ileostomy closure.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative bowel stimulation on the development of POI after loop ileostomy closure.

### Management of ileus and small-bowel obstruction following benign gynecologic surgery [^117NUcww]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe practice preferences for the diagnosis and management of ileus and small-bowel obstruction (SBO) following benign gynecologic surgery.

Methods

A secondary descriptive analysis was performed on data from a multicenter case-control study of patients who underwent gynecologic surgery and subsequently developed ileus or SBO. Information was collected regarding interventions such as type of imaging ordered for diagnosis, diet alterations, antiemetic administration, and need for reoperation.

Results

In total, 144 cases were identified. Abdominal X-ray was the most common imaging modality, occurring in 54 (37.5%) cases. Sixty-nine (65.1%) of the 106 women who underwent imaging were given definitive radiologic diagnoses of either ileus (50 [72.5%]) or SBO (19 [27.5%]); 57.9% (n = 11) of the SBO diagnoses and 90.0% (n = 45) of the ileus diagnoses were managed conservatively. Eighteen (12.5%) patients underwent reoperation for bowel obstruction. There were no significant differences in rate of reoperation between cases involving the use of single antiemetics and those involving the use of multiple antiemetics (P = 0.18), or between diet statuses on postoperative day 1 (P = 0.08).

Conclusion

Most study centers initially performed an abdominal X-ray for diagnostic purposes. The majority used a multimodal treatment approach. None of the management options decreased the likelihood of reoperation.

### New therapeutic strategies for postoperative ileus [^114CwAuT]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Patients undergoing an abdominal surgical procedure develop a transient episode of impaired gastrointestinal motility or postoperative ileus. Importantly, postoperative ileus is a major determinant of recovery after intestinal surgery and leads to increased morbidity and prolonged hospitalization, which is a great economic burden to health-care systems. Although a variety of strategies reduce postoperative ileus, including multimodal postoperative rehabilitation (fast-track care) and minimally invasive surgery, none of these methods have been completely successful in shortening the duration of postoperative ileus. The aetiology of postoperative ileus is multifactorial, but insights into the pathogenesis of postoperative ileus have identified intestinal inflammation, triggered by surgical handling, as the main mechanism. The importance of this inflammatory response in postoperative ileus is underscored by the beneficial effect of pharmacological interventions that block the influx of leukocytes. New insights into the pathophysiology of postoperative ileus and the involvement of the innate and the adaptive (T-helper type 1 cell-mediated immune response) immune system offer interesting and important new approaches to prevent postoperative ileus. In this Review, we discuss the latest insights into the mechanisms behind postoperative ileus and highlight new strategies to intervene in the postoperative inflammatory cascade.

### Electroacupuncture vs sham in postoperative ileus treatment after laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer… [^115b1wtv]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to 4 sessions of EA or sham electroacupuncture after surgery. All patients were treated within the ERAS protocol. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the time to first defecation. Secondary outcomes included other patient-reported outcome measures, length of postoperative hospital stay, readmission rate within 30 days, and incidence of postoperative complications and adverse events. During this trial, guidelines of the ERAS protocol were implemented according to the Consensus and Guidelines on ERAS in China. 21 The ERAS protocol at each of the participating hospitals was compared and found to be similar in the preventive use of antibiotics, perioperative multimodal analgesia, avoidance of opioid use, early removal of urinary catheter and nasogastric tubes, early mobilization, nutritional support, and others.

To our best knowledge, this was the first multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing EA with SA in the treatment of postoperative ileus with the adoption of the ERAS protocol. Compared with SA, EA shortened the duration of POI and reduced the incidence of prolonged POI after laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer without serious AEs. EA may provide a reasonable treatment option for patients after colorectal surgery to facilitate GI function recovery. Low expectations may create a nocebo effect, thereby counteracting the placebo effects. The results of this present trial are consistent with previous studies and added further evidence in supporting the use of acupuncture in the perioperative care of patients going through laparoscopic resection with the ERAS protocol. Notably, in the present trial, the incidence rate of prolonged POI was halved in the EA group compared with the SA group and was lower than those previously reported with other interventions in the ERAS program. 2 The incidence rate was also lower than acupuncture-related therapies that did not adopt the ERAS protocol. 29 Meng et al29 reported that acupuncture could decrease the incidence of prolonged POI by 4. 2%. Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation decreased the risk of postoperative paralytic ileus by 32%. 30 Differences between results of the present trial and the aforementioned studies are likely attributable to the enhanced benefits of EA when combined with the ERAS protocol. Our trial supports that EA, when combined with the ERAS protocol, confers faster postoperative recovery after laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer.

### Review of the pathophysiology and management of postoperative ileus [^115HhGsQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Investigations in the pathophysiology and treatment of postoperative ileus continue to evolve. Bowel rest is no longer a mandatory component of postoperative recovery. Tolerance of enteral nutrition and normalization of the abdominal examination are more accurate indications of the resolution of postoperative ileus than passage of flatus or first bowel movement. A multimodal "fast track" recovery approach incorporated into a clinical pathway provides a more rapid return of intestinal function and shortened hospital stay in patients undergoing major, uncomplicated gastrointestinal surgery.

### Does gum chewing ameliorate postoperative ileus? Results of a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^111Jk21P]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Background

A preliminary report has been interpreted to suggest that gum chewing reduces duration of postcolectomy ileus.

Study Design

We rigorously tested this hypothesis in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients undergoing open colectomy (n = 66) were randomized to receive 1 of 3 postoperative regimens beginning on postoperative day 1: sips (control, n = 21); sips and accupressure wrist bracelet (placebo, n = 23); and sips and gum chewing (treatment, n = 22). Patients were unaware of which regimen constituted placebo or treatment; end points were assessed by blinded investigators. Power was set a priori at 85% to detect a 0.75-day difference in time to first postoperative passage of flatus between placebo and treatment groups. Groups were compared using the log-rank test.

Results

Groups were equivalent with respect to demographic and surgical characteristics. Median times to first postoperative passage of flatus were as follows: sips, 67 hours; bracelet and sips, 72 hours; gum and sips, 60 hours (p = 0.384). There were no significant differences in time to passage of first bowel movement, time until patients were ready for discharge, or time until actual discharge among the three groups. Inpatient and 30-day followup demonstrated no difference in frequency or distribution of postoperative complications.

Conclusions

In contrast to findings of a preliminary study, our clinical trial suggests that gum chewing, although safe, does not reduce duration of postcolectomy ileus.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^112M29By]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society — antimicrobial therapy for treatment failure in intra-abdominal infection (IAI): Early treatment failure in patients with IAI, occurring within 48 hours of source control, is typically the result of an unsuccessful initial intervention and not a failure of antimicrobial therapy, and the consensus of the task force is that continuation of previous antimicrobial therapy is appropriate in most patients with IAI who experience early treatment failure. In contrast, patients with late treatment failure, occurring after 48 hours, are likely to have a somewhat more resistant microbial flora because of longer-duration antimicrobial therapy, and broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy, tailored to the expected risk of resistant pathogens, should be provided to patients with late treatment failure; if feasible, a switch in the class of antibiotic agents being administered should be considered. If diagnostic studies have negative results, further antimicrobial therapy for IAI is not generally warranted, and retrospective analyses have indicated that use of prolonged antibiotic courses, even in patients with ongoing fever or leukocytosis, does not provide any benefit. Moreover, the recent STOP-IT trial found that patients with IAI randomized to antimicrobial therapy continued two days beyond resolution of fever, leukocytosis, and ileus fared no better than patients randomized to having antibiotic agents stopped at four days, when two of the three signs were still present; this finding applied even to patients with higher APACHE II scores.

### Core outcome set for clinical studies of postoperative ileus after intestinal surgery [^116cqhhN]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Ethics and governance

Research ethics approval was confirmed by the University of Sheffield Ethics Committee on 27 September 2019. A collaborative steering committee was convened with representation from Asia, Australasia, Europe, and North America, and included medical, allied healthcare professional, and patient investigators. The study was registered with the COMET Initiative and the protocol was reported previously. An extended description of the methods and results is provided in Appendix S1. An abridged summary is reported here.

Scope and definitions

The scope of the core outcome set was defined according to the Core Outcome Set — Standards for Development recommendations. The health condition was postoperative ileus; the population was adult patients undergoing intestinal surgery for any indication; and the setting was clinical studies assessing the effectiveness of a clinical intervention to reduce ileus. Intestinal surgery was considered to represent any intra-abdominal procedure via any surgical approach on the intestinal tract with or without formation of a stoma.

Participants

Stakeholder representation was designed to reflect the multidisciplinary management of postoperative ileus as well as the challenge it presents on an international scale. Three key stakeholder panels were defined: patients with previous experience of intestinal surgery, allied healthcare professionals (including nurses and dietitians), and medical professionals (including abdominal surgeons and perioperative clinicians). Medical and allied healthcare professionals were considered as two separate panels throughout the study to ensure that potentially diverging perspectives were captured. During each phase of the study, participants were recruited via national and international organizations as well as through social media.

### The efficacy of peripheral opioid antagonists in opioid-induced constipation and postoperative ileus: a systematic review of the literature [^1141bAtX]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Opioid-induced constipation has a negative impact on quality of life for patients with chronic pain and can affect more than a third of patients. A related but separate entity is postoperative ileus, which is an abnormal pattern of gastrointestinal motility after surgery. Nonselective μ-opioid receptor antagonists reverse constipation and opioid-induced ileus but cross the blood-brain barrier and may reverse analgesia. Peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists target the μ-opioid receptor without reversing analgesia. Three such agents are US Food and Drug Administration approved. We reviewed the literature for randomized controlled trials that studied the efficacy of alvimopan, methylnaltrexone, and naloxegol in treating either opioid-induced constipation or postoperative ileus. Peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists may be effective in treating both opioid-induced bowel dysfunction and postoperative ileus, but definitive conclusions are not possible because of study inconsistency and the relatively low quality of evidence. Comparisons of agents are difficult because of heterogeneous end points and no head-to-head studies.

Ileus prevention — alvimopan for open colorectal surgery: Alvimopan is recommended to hasten recovery after open colorectal surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. A systematic review up to May 2020 identified 31 studies of alvimopan in colorectal surgery, of which 23 demonstrated a positive effect and 8 reported no effect; of the 6 randomized trials, 4 were positive and 2 showed no effect. Several RCTs and pooled post hoc analyses reported accelerated recovery of GI function with alvimopan 6- and 12-mg doses and a significantly shorter hospital LOS in the alvimopan 12-mg group for patients undergoing open surgery. A Cochrane review of 9 studies found alvimopan better than placebo in reversing opioid-induced increased GI transit time and constipation and that it was safe and efficacious in decreasing postoperative ileus, but studies were limited to open surgery patients without an ERP in place, and there have been no randomized trials after laparoscopic surgery.

### American society for enhanced recovery and Perioperative Quality Initiative joint consensus statement on postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction within an enhanced recovery pathway for elective colorectal surgery [^1157Z9rf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

The primary driver of length of stay after bowel surgery, particularly colorectal surgery, is the time to return of gastrointestinal (GI) function. Traditionally, delayed GI recovery was thought to be a routine and unavoidable consequence of surgery, but this has been shown to be false in the modern era owing to the proliferation of enhanced recovery protocols. However, impaired GI function is still common after colorectal surgery, and the current literature is ambiguous with regard to the definition of postoperative GI dysfunction (POGD), or what is typically referred to as ileus. This persistent ambiguity has impeded the ability to ascertain the true incidence of the condition and study it properly within a research setting. Furthermore, a rational and standardized approach to prevention and treatment of POGD is needed. The second Perioperative Quality Initiative brought together a group of international experts to review the published literature and provide consensus recommendations on this important topic with the goal to (1) develop a rational definition for POGD that can serve as a framework for clinical and research efforts; (2) critically review the evidence behind current prevention strategies and provide consensus recommendations; and (3) develop rational treatment strategies that take into account the wide spectrum of impaired GI function in the postoperative period.

### Bowel stimulation before loop ileostomy closure to reduce postoperative ileus: a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^112GGyyy]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this international, multicenter, single-blinded randomized controlled trial, preoperative bowel stimulation via the efferent limb of the ileostomy reduced POI after elective loop ileostomy closure. Bowel stimulation is a promising intervention in this patient population, and may be incorporated into ERPs and prehabilitation programs going forward. Future studies should focus on better understanding the minimal number of stimulation sessions required to reduce POI and how the intervention may be delivered at home, in order to minimize hospital resources and maximize patient participation.

### Mechanisms and treatment of postoperative ileus… [^113EvPng]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

The etiology of postoperative ileus can best be described as multifactorial. A multimodality treatment approach should include limiting the administration of agents known to contribute to postoperative ileus, using thoracic epidurals with local anesthetics when possible, and selectively applying nasogastric decompression. Peripheral CRF decreases gastric emptying of a nonnutrient or nutrient meal in rats, mice, and dogs when administered intravenously. In theory, epidurals with local anesthetics can block afferent and efferent inhibitory reflexes, increase splanchnic blood flow, and have anti-inflammatory effects. 63, 64 Epidural anesthetics have the added benefit of blocking the afferent stimuli that trigger the endocrine metabolic stress response to surgery and thus inhibit the catabolic activity of hormones released during this process.

65 In most studies, 66–76 thoracic epidurals with bupivacaine hydrochloride significantly reduced ileus vs systemic opioid therapy in patients undergoing abdominal surgical procedures. In one of the statistically nonsignificant studies, 64 an epidural anesthesia of 24-hours' duration was used as opposed to that of 48 to 72 hours' duration, as used in other studies. At least 4 studies67, 72, 74, 75 have compared epidural bupivacaine with epidural opioid, and 3 of these studies demonstrated a significant reduction in the duration of postoperative ileus in the epidural bupivacaine group compared with the epidural opioid group. The additive effect of these actions is to decrease colonic motility. 79 However, treatment with the morphine receptor antagonist naloxone hydrochloride has proven ineffective in the treatment of postoperative ileus. 2 New µ-opioid receptor antagonists are being developed and may have the potential to alleviate opiate-related adverse effects.

Methylnaltrexone bromide, a quaternary derivative of naltrexone, is one such drug. Cisapride is a serotonin agonist that facilitates acetylcholine release from the intrinsic plexus. At least 9 randomized clinical trials119–127 have been performed on patients treated with cisapride for postoperative ileus after undergoing various surgical procedures. However, comparison of these studies is difficult because various end points were used, patients underwent different surgical procedures, and the doses, durations, and routes were variable.

### Methods for decreasing postoperative gut dysmotility [^112Ptw9E]. The Lancet: Oncology (2003). Medium credibility.

Postoperative disturbances of gastrointestinal function (postoperative ileus) are among the most significant side-effects of abdominal surgery for cancer. Without specific treatment, major abdominal surgery causes a predictable gastrointestinal dysfunction which endures for 4–5 days and results in an average hospital stay of 7–8 days. Ileus occurs because of initially absent and subsequently abnormal motor function of the stomach, small bowel, and colon. This disruption results in delayed transit of gastrointestinal content, intolerance of food, and gas retention. The aetiology of ileus is multifactorial, and includes autonomic neural dysfunction, inflammatory mediators, narcotics, gastrointestinal hormone disruptions, and anaesthetics. In the past, treatment has consisted of nasogastric suction, intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and observation. Currently, the most effective treatment is a multimodal approach. Median stays of 2–3 days after removal of all or part of the colon (colectomy) are now achievable. Recent discoveries have the potential to significantly reduce postoperative ileus in patients with cancer who have had abdominal surgery.

### Core outcome set for clinical studies of postoperative ileus after intestinal surgery [^112PGjyA]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Consensus meeting

Twenty-nine outcomes were considered by participants during the consensus meeting. Following detailed discussion, 23 outcomes that had achieved consensus during the Delphi process were ratified and two of six borderline outcomes (incidence of vomiting, patient-reported perception of postoperative ileus) reached consensus to be added according to the predefined threshold for consensus (Table 1).

During the meeting, the agreed outcomes 'incidence of postoperative ileus' and 'incidence of prolonged postoperative ileus' were considered to be markedly similar, and consensus was reached to combine these into a single construct 'incidence of postoperative ileus' (12 of 13 agreed, 2 abstentions). It was also noted that four agreed outcomes (abdominal infection, anastomotic leak, peritonitis, enterotomy) were akin to risk factors rather than conventional outcomes of ileus. Consensus was reached to retain these to reflect essential contextual information required alongside other outcomes in the set (12 of 12 agreed, 3 abstentions).

A final core outcome set comprising 24 outcomes was agreed (Table 3). Consensus was achieved to group outcomes into domains to reflect the patient journey and to rationalize the presentation of the set. Clustering of outcomes was achieved wholly through consensus, with the final wording of domains finalized by the steering committee. This produced a total of six domains along with three outcomes that remained ungrouped.

### Postoperative ileus: a review [^111ujv1s]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Postoperatively, some patients experience a prolonged inhibition of coordinated bowel activity, which causes accumulation of secretions and gas, resulting in nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and pain. This prolonged inhibition can take days or weeks to resolve and often is referred to as postoperative paralytic ileus lasting more than three days after surgery. This article reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment options of postoperative ileus.

Methods

The relevant literature from 1965 to 2003 was identified and reviewed using MEDLINE database of the U.S. Medical Library of Medicine. Both retrospective and prospective studies were included in this review.

Results

The pathophysiology of postoperative ileus is multifactorial. The duration of postoperative ileus correlates with the degree of surgical trauma and is most extensive after colonic surgery. However, postoperative ileus can develop after all types of surgery including extraperitoneal surgery. A variety of treatment options have been used to decrease the duration of postoperative ileus. However, it is difficult to compare these studies because of small sample sizes and differences in operations performed, anesthesia protocols provided both intraoperatively and postoperatively, patient comorbidities, and in the measured end points, such as the time to the presence of bowel sounds, flatus, or bowel movements, tolerance of solid food, or discharge from the hospital. However, despite these drawbacks, some conclusions can be made.

Conclusions

Paralytic postoperative ileus continues to be a significant problem after abdominal and other types of surgery. The etiology is multifactorial and is best treated with a combination of different approaches. Currently, the important factors that could effect the duration and recovery from postoperative ileus include limitation of narcotic use by substituting alternative medications such as nonsteroidals and placing a thoracic epidural with local anesthetic when possible. The selective use of nasogastric decompression and correction of electrolyte imbalances also are important factors to consider.

### Establishing core outcome sets for gastrointestinal recovery in studies of postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction: protocol for a nested methodological study [^114bwQJ8]. Colorectal Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal recovery describes the restoration of normal bowel function in patients with bowel disease. This may be prolonged in two common clinical settings: postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction. Improving gastrointestinal recovery is a research priority but researchers are limited by variation in outcome reporting across clinical studies. This protocol describes the development of core outcome sets for gastrointestinal recovery in the contexts of postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction.

Method

An international Steering Group consisting of patient and clinician representatives has been established. As overlap between clinical contexts is anticipated, both outcome sets will be co-developed and may be combined to form a common output with disease-specific domains. The development process will comprise three phases, including definition of outcomes relevant to postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction from systematic literature reviews and nominal-group stakeholder discussions; online-facilitated Delphi surveys via international networks; and a consensus meeting to ratify the final output. A nested study will explore if the development of overlapping outcome sets can be rationalized.

Dissemination and Implementation

The final output will be registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials initiative. A multi-faceted, quality improvement campaign for the reporting of gastrointestinal recovery in clinical studies will be launched, targeting international professional and patient groups, charitable organizations and editorial committees. Success will be explored via an updated systematic review of outcomes 5 years after registration of the core outcome set.

### Economic burden and cost-effectiveness of therapies forinfection: a narrative review [^113XRWT4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of C. difficile

Treatment should be started only in patients with CDI symptoms; presence of the C. difficile toxin without symptoms of the infection is not an indication for treatment. Treatment begins with discontinuation of the inciting antibiotic if possible. Traditionally, metronidazole and vancomycin were considered the cornerstones of treatment; however, more recently, guidelines from different societies are shifting away from metronidazole because of its lower efficacy and poor tolerance.

The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)recommends either vancomycin (125 mg orally four times per day) or fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily) for 10 days over metronidazole for an initial episode of CDI. In settings where access to vancomycin or fidaxomicin is limited, using metronidazole (500 mg orally three times per day for 10 days) is suggested for an initial episode of non-severe CDI only. For fulminant CDI (characterized by hypotension or shock, ileus, or megacolon), vancomycin (500 mg orally four times per day, or per rectum 500 mg in 100 mL normal saline every 6 h in case of ileus) is the regimen of choice. Intravenously administered metronidazole 500 mg every 8 h should be administered together with oral or rectal vancomycin, particularly if ileus is present. Antibiotic treatment options for patients with recurrence of CDI include oral vancomycin therapy using a tapered and pulsed regimen, a standard course of oral vancomycin followed by rifaximin, or fidaxomicin. FMT is recommended for patients with multiple recurrences of CDI who have failed appropriate antibiotic treatments.

Table 2
Participant characteristics of Delphi and consensus meeting stages

Outcome longlisting

Seventy-three outcomes were identified from a systematic review of previous evidence which was refined by the steering committee to eliminate duplication (Fig. S1). Six unique outcomes were added from stakeholder focus groups and 12 by the steering committee, resulting in 75 unique outcomes used to populate round 1 of the Delphi process.

Delphi process

During round 1, a total of 75 outcomes were presented to participants and 13 reached the threshold to be considered at the consensus meeting. Eight unique outcomes were generated via free-text responses and were carried forward to round 2 (Box S1). During round 2, 70 outcomes (including those generated in the earlier round) were presented and nine reached the meeting threshold. The remaining 61 outcomes were re-presented during round 3 and one more reached the threshold. After consideration by the steering committee, six outcomes were considered to have 'borderline' consensus, and it was agreed to re-present these for a final decision at the meeting. The full Delphi results are shown in Tables S2 and S3.

### Promotility agents for the treatment of ileus in adult surgical patients: a practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma [^112yiYsi]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ileus is a common challenge in adult surgical patients with estimated incidence to be 17% to 80%. The main mechanisms of the postoperative ileus pathophysiology are fluid overload, exogenous opioids, neurohormonal dysfunction, gastrointestinal stretch, and inflammation. Management includes addressing the underlying cause and supportive care. Multiple medical interventions have been proposed, but effectiveness is uncertain. A working group of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of metoclopramide, erythromycin, and early enteral nutrition (EEN) on ileus in adult surgical patients and to develop recommendations applicable in a daily clinical practice.

Methods

Literature search identified 45 articles appropriate for inclusion. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was applied to evaluate the effect of metoclopramide, erythromycin, and EEN on the resolution of ileus in adult surgical patients based on selected outcomes: return of normal bowel function, attainment of enteral feeding goal, and hospital length of stay. The recommendations were made based on the results of a systematic review, a meta-analysis, and evaluation of levels of evidence.

Results

The level of evidence for all PICOs was assessed as low. Neither metoclopramide nor erythromycin were effective in expediting the resolution of ileus. Analyses of 32 randomized controlled trials showed that EEN facilitates return of normal bowel function, achieving enteral nutrition goals, and reducing hospital length of stay.

Conclusion

In patients who have undergone abdominal surgery, we strongly recommend EEN to expedite resolution of Ileus, but we cannot recommend for or against the use of either metoclopramide or erythromycin to hasten the resolution of ileus in these patients.

### Gallstone ileus: a review [^111j3gXP]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

In the treatment approach for cases of gallstone ileus, selection of surgical method should be based on the impaction site. Two-stage surgery is recommended for cases with impaction at the level of the small intestine, while one-stage surgery is recommended for cases with impaction at other sites. However, surgeons should judge the feasibility of one-stage surgery on the basis of the patient's general condition.

### Pharmacologic options to prevent postoperative ileus [^115Csios]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize the evidence on pharmacologic options in preventing postoperative ileus (POI).

Data Sources

The Cochrane Database of Reviews and OVID databases and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Web site were searched (1950-April 2009) using the term postoperative ileus.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials were included for review. The FDA Web site was searched for clinical reviews and label information for drugs indicated for the prevention of POI.

Data Synthesis

Three meta-analyses, 2 on gum-chewing and 1 on alvimopan, and 18 clinical trials were identified. Only gum chewing and alvimopan were effective in preventing POI. Gum chewing reduced the time to first flatus and bowel movement (weighted mean difference 21h; p = 0.0006 and 33h; p = 0.0002, respectively). In one meta-analysis, gum chewing significantly reduced length of stay (LOS) by 2.4 days (p < 0.00001) but this was not replicated in the second meta-analysis. Alvimopan shortened the time to reach a composite endpoint of solid food intake, plus/minus flatus, and bowel movement (93 vs 105 h; p < 0.001). A higher incidence of myocardial infarction was observed in a 12-month study of alvimopan for the treatment of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, but not in studies in patients undergoing bowel resection. Alvimopan decreased the time to written hospital discharge order (hazard ratio 1.35; p < 0.01), while the significance of a reduction in LOS (0.2–1.3 days) was not reported.

Conclusions

Gum chewing and alvimopan are effective in preventing POI, but given safety concerns and higher cost with alvimopan, gum chewing may be preferred.

### The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia recommendations for the use of opioids in children during the perioperative period [^1147cW1F]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

13.3 Perioperative opioids and ileus

A common complication of opioids in both the acute and chronic care setting is slowing of bowel motility and specifically constipation or ileus. In the acute care setting, this can result in significant morbidity and delayed discharge. Postoperative opioid‐related decreased bowel motility or ileus is well documented in the adult population 223, 224 and is importantly associated with readmission in children. 200 Treatment and incidence of opioid‐induced ileus has only minimally been explored in the literature in infants and children. 225, 226 Contrary to adult studies, methylnaltrexone appears to be helpful in children. 225, 226, 227, 228

Recommendation: Postoperative opioid‐induced ileus may be improved with methylnaltrexone in infants and children.

Strength of evidence: B.

### Postoperative ileus-an ongoing conundrum [^1163msgF]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus is common and is a major clinical problem. It has been widely studied in patients and in experimental models in laboratory animals. A wide variety of treatments have been tested to prevent or modify the course of this disorder.

Purpose

This review draws together information on animal studies of ileus with studies on human patients. It summarizes some of the conceptual advances made in understanding the mechanisms that underlie paralytic ileus. The treatments that have been tested in human subjects (both pharmacological and non-pharmacological) and their efficacy are summarized and graded consistent with current clinical guidelines. The review is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview of ileus, but rather a general understanding of the major clinical problems associated with it, how animal models have been useful to elucidate key mechanisms and, finally, some perspectives from both scientists and clinicians as to how we may move forward with this debilitating yet common condition.

### Immediate surgery or conservative treatment for complicated acute appendicitis in children? A meta-analysis [^115fysUT]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study carried out a meta-analysis to compare immediate surgery (IS) with conservative treatment (CT) of complicated acute appendicitis (CAA) in children.

Methods

Systematic literature research was performed for relevant studies published from 1969 to date. Trials of IS compared with CT were included. Outcomes of interest were postoperative morbidity and length of hospital stay (LOS).

Results

Fifteen trials were studied (1.243 patients). CT achieved better rates of any complication type (odds ratio [OR] 0.22, [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14, 0.38], p = 0.001) and wound infection (OR: 0.40 [95% CI: 0.17, 0.96], p = 0.041). Neither intraabdominal abscess (OR: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.31, 3.37], p = 0.958) nor postoperative ileus (OR: 0.29 [95% CI: 0.06, 1.44], p = 0.130) was affected by the treatment option. The polled difference in LOS showed a trend for shorter LOS in the IS group (standard mean difference [SMD]: 0.25 [95% CI: 0.07, -0.43], p = 0.007).

Conclusions

IS was associated with shorter LOS, while overall complication rates and wound infection declined significantly with CT. The development of intraabdominal abscess and postoperative ileus was not affected by the treatment of choice. The heterogeneity of most studies depicts the need for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to discover safe management of CAA in children.

### Alvimopan, for postoperative ileus following bowel resection: a pooled analysis of phase III studies [^117Khf94]. Annals of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To obtain further analysis regarding specific outcomes and alvimopan doses in bowel resection (BR) patients.

Summary Background Data

Although postoperative ileus (POI) is common after BR, there is currently no recognized treatment or prevention available. Alvimopan, a novel, peripherally active mu-opioid receptor antagonist, accelerated GI recovery after BR or hysterectomy in 3 phase III trials.

Methods

A pooled retrospective subset analysis of BR patients in alvimopan phase III trials was performed. Randomized BR patients received alvimopan 6 mg (n = 397), 12 mg (n = 413), or placebo (n = 402) ≥ 2 hours before surgery and twice daily until hospital discharge for ≤ 7 days. The primary endpoint of each trial was time to recovery of GI function. Hospital discharge order (DCO) written, readmission, and morbidities were also assessed. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze treatment effects on time-to-event endpoints.

Results

Alvimopan (6 or 12 mg) significantly accelerated GI recovery (GI-3; hazard ratio = 1.28 and 1.38, respectively; P ≤ 0.001 for both). Alvimopan significantly accelerated time to DCO written by 16 hours for 6 mg and 18 hours for 12 mg (P < 0.001 for both) from a mean of 147 hours for placebo. Alvimopan-treated patients had reduced postoperative morbidity compared with placebo, and incidence of prolonged hospital stay or readmission was significantly reduced (P < 0.001). Tolerability profiles were similar among groups.

Conclusions

Alvimopan significantly accelerated GI recovery in BR patients. A 12-mg dose provided more consistent benefits across both sexes and all ages. Postoperative morbidity rates, prolonged hospital stay, and rates of hospital readmission were significantly reduced. Alvimopan reduces the consequences of POI after BR.

### Alvimopan for the management of postoperative ileus [^112xhWK9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, dosage, and administration of alvimopan, a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist, in the management of postoperative ileus (POI).

Data Sources

A literature search (1980-October 2004) applying the terms alvimopan, ADL 8–2698, and LY246736 was conducted using MEDLINE. Information was also obtained from scientific congress abstracts and data on file with the manufacturer.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies and abstracts investigating alvimopan and POI were considered for inclusion; however, they were restricted to English-language articles.

Data Synthesis

Alvimopan is a novel, peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that is currently under evaluation for the management of POI. POI presents significant clinical challenges that can delay patient recovery and contribute to increased morbidity and prolonged hospitalization after surgery. Clinical trials have demonstrated that alvimopan, at oral doses of 6 and 12 mg, can accelerate time to recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function and time to hospital discharge following abdominal surgery. The incidence of adverse events with alvimopan therapy was shown to be similar to that of placebo.

Conclusions

Alvimopan is well tolerated and effective at accelerating GI recovery and time to discharge in patients who have undergone bowel resection or hysterectomy when administered prior to surgery and twice daily thereafter until discharge or for up to 7 days. Alvimopan potentially offers significant benefits for patients with POI over currently available treatments.

### Daikenchuto for reducing postoperative ileus in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery [^115oBgES]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus is a major complication for persons undergoing abdominal surgery. Daikenchuto, a Japanese traditional medicine (Kampo), is a drug that may reduce postoperative ileus.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of Daikenchuto for reducing prolonged postoperative ileus in persons undergoing elective abdominal surgery.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 3 July 2017: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ICHUSHI, WHO (World Health Organization) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), EU Crinical Trials registry (EU-CTR), UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR), ClinicalTrials.gov, The Japan Society for Oriental Medicine (JSOM), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endscopic Surgeons (SAGES). We set no limitations on language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Daikenchuto with any control condition in adults, 18 years of age or older, undergoing elective abdominal surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We applied standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently reviewed the articles identified by literature searches, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of the included studies using the Cochrane software Review Manager 5.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with a total of 1202 participants. Overall, we judged the risk of bias as low in four studies and high in three studies. We are uncertain whether Daikenchuto reduced time to first flatus (mean difference (MD) -11.32 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) -17.45 to -5.19; two RCTs, 83 participants; very low-quality evidence), or time to first bowel movement (MD -9.44 hours, 95% CI -22.22 to 3.35; four RCTs, 500 participants; very low-quality evidence) following surgery. There was little or no difference in time to resumption of regular solid food following surgery (MD 3.64 hours, 95% CI -24.45 to 31.74; two RCTs, 258 participants; low-quality evidence). There were no adverse events in either arm of the five RCTs that reported on drug-related adverse events (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02, 568 participants, low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of Daikenchuto on patient satisfaction (MD 0.09, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.37; one RCT, 81 participants; very low-quality of evidence). There was little or no difference in the incidence of any re-interventions for postoperative ileus before leaving hospital (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.62; one RCT, 207 participants; moderate-quality evidence), or length of hospital stay (MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -1.21 to 0.22; three RCTs, 292 participants; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from current literature was unclear whether Daikenchuto reduced postoperative ileus in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery, due to the small number of participants in the meta-analyses. Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain whether Daikenchuto improved postoperative flatus or bowel movement. Further well-designed and adequately powered studies are needed to assess the efficacy of Daikenchuto.

### Postoperative ileus-immune mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions [^1163ea5B]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus (POI) is a condition marked by a temporary suppression of gastrointestinal motility following abdominal surgery. The mechanism of POI encompasses various factors and is characterized by two phases: the early neurogenic phase involving both adrenergic and non-adrenergic neural pathways; the later immune-mediated phase is characterized by a sterile inflammatory response that lasts several days. Activation of muscularis macrophages triggers a sterile inflammatory process that results in dysfunction of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and a reversible inhibition of gastrointestinal motility.

Purpose

In this minireview, recent insights in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying POI and potential new therapeutic strategies are described.

Ileus Prevention

21. Patients should be offered a regular diet within 24 hours after elective colorectal surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.

A 2019 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 17 RCTs that compared early feeding (ie, within 24 hours of surgery) versus "later commencement" after lower GI surgery. In this review, early feeding was associated with a 2-day decrease in length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.95; 95% CI, 0.91–2.99). However, perioperative management strategies varied significantly within the included trials and the mean LOS in the control group ranged from 6 to 24 days. Furthermore, the risk of complications such as anastomotic leak, wound infection, pneumonia, and mortality were not affected by early feeding. Even symptoms of nausea and vomiting were not significantly higher in the early feeding group in this review. Early enteral feeding is associated with faster return of GI function and with shorter time to flatus and first bowel movement. Although there is heterogeneity between trials, the overall body of evidence supports the benefits of early feeding.

### Does chewing gum lead to earlier postoperative gastrointestinal recovery in children? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112HR2b1]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative ileus is a common occurrence among children undergoing major operations, including gastrointestinal and spinal surgeries. Preliminary evidence in adults suggests that chewing gum plays a role in accelerating the return of postoperative gastrointestinal function. However, evidence is scarce in the paediatric population. The aim of this study was to investigate whether chewing gum has benefits for children.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Trials databases for randomised controlled trials that compare gum chewing with standard care after elective surgery in children from 1st Jan 2005 to 31st July 2021. We assessed the identified trials for quality and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with PRISMA and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022358801). The main outcome measures examined were time to flatus and stool postoperatively, time to tolerate oral intake, and length of hospital stay, which were analysed using fixed effects models. We also examined clinical complication rates and postoperative pain control.

Results

We included six eligible trials, with a total of 357 enrolled patients. The intervention was well tolerated without complications. There was no significant difference in time to flatus (-2.86 h; 95% CI: -6.2 to 0.47 h, p = 0.09), time to stool (-6.39 h; 95% CI: -13.9 to 1.2 h, p = 0.1), time to tolerate oral intake (-0.03 days; 95% CI: -0.15 to 0.1 days, p = 0.68), and length of hospital stay (0.08 days; 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.22 days, p = 0.29). Postoperative pain control (opioid consumption, pain score, nausea score) was similar in both groups (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Current evidence demonstrates that gum chewing is not associated with earlier postoperative gastrointestinal recovery in children. Future adequately powered and well-designed trials are necessary to evaluate any clinical benefit of chewing gum for children and whether it could result differences in healthcare satisfaction.

### Phase III trial of alvimopan, a novel, peripherally acting, mu opioid antagonist, for postoperative ileus after major abdominal surgery [^113WFb6P]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Postoperative ileus presents significant clinical challenges that potentially prolong hospital stay, contribute to readmission, and increase morbidity. There is no approved treatment for postoperative ileus. Alvimopan is a novel, peripherally acting, mu opioid receptor antagonist currently in development for the management of postoperative ileus.

Methods

Patients undergoing partial colectomy or simple or radical hysterectomy were randomized to receive alvimopan 6 mg (n = 152), alvimopan 12 mg (n = 146), or placebo (n = 153) orally 2 hours before surgery and twice daily thereafter until discharge or for up to seven days. The primary efficacy end point, time to return of gastrointestinal function, was a composite measure of passage of flatus or stool and tolerating solid food. Secondary end points included time to the hospital discharge order written. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study.

Results

Mean time to gastrointestinal recovery was significantly reduced in patients treated with alvimopan 6 mg vs. placebo (hazard ratio = 1.45; P = 0.003), with a smaller reduction seen with alvimopan 12 mg (hazard ratio = 1.28; P = 0.059). Mean time to the hospital discharge order written was significantly accelerated in patients treated with alvimopan 6 mg (hazard ratio = 1.50; P < 0.001). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events across all treatment groups were nausea, vomiting, and hypotension; the incidence of nausea and vomiting was reduced by 53 percent in the alvimopan 12-mg group.

Conclusions

In patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, alvimopan accelerated gastrointestinal recovery and time to the hospital discharge order written compared with placebo and was well tolerated.

C. Postoperative ileus — Guideline 26 states that laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is associated with a low incidence of postoperative ileus, and patients developing a postoperative ileus should be initially treated non-operatively with fluid administration, bowel rest, and/or gastric decompression (Low quality, Weak recommendation). There is no uniformly accepted definition of prolonged ileus following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, but no return of bowel activity for more than five days is infrequent. Reported outcomes include a prospective trial of 144 patients with a mean time of 1.8 days to return of bowel function with a range of 0–8 days, a retrospective study with a 1.3% incidence of postoperative ileus with a duration greater than 7 days, other authors defining prolonged ileus as longer than 24 hours with reported rates of 20%, and a study of 819 laparoscopic hernia repairs with a 3% incidence of prolonged ileus; in each of these studies, postoperative ileus resolved uneventfully.

### Effect of acupuncture on postoperative ileus after laparoscopic elective colorectal surgery: a prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^111KGQBW]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Postoperative ileus has historically been considered an unavoidable outcome of major abdominal surgery, which is associated with significant clinical and economic burdens. In this trial of EA for patients undergoing elective segmental colorectal resection, we hypothesised that the addition of EA with the ERAS pathway could further improve patient outcomes, and then found a statistically significant improvement in shortening the time of recovery of gastrointestinal motility favouring the EA at ST36 group, with no significant improvement in the EA at ST25 group. ERAS combined with laparoscopy surgery has been shown to have a synergistic effect in enhancing recovery and are the best perioperative strategies after laparoscopic surgery for colon disease. The finding that EA at ST36 with standard care was beneficial for POI patients is of vital significance to clinical work, as minimally invasive surgeries with the ERAS pathway continue to increase in popularity.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for colorectal surgery, more specifically with respect to postoperative ileus prevention (ERASS), ERAS 2019 guidelines recommend to offer a multimodal approach including the following measures to minimize the development of postoperative ileus:

- limiting opioid administration through multimodal anesthesia and analgesia techniques

- using minimally invasive surgical techniques when feasible

- eliminating routine placement of nasogastric tubes

- using goal-directed fluid therapy.

World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

There is good quality evidence to support early enteral feeding using a gradual incremental protocol with nasoenteric feeding reserved for those who have gastroparesis or feed intolerance, with the routine use of prokinetics and adjunctive treatments recommended. Following established nutrition, society guidelines are supported for this goal. For planned surgery, clear carbohydrate liquids till 2 h preoperative are recommended to avoid prolonged preoperative starvation in those tolerating enteral feed.

Discontinuous gut ("clip and drop") of bowel ends is a well‐described part of damage control surgery. Although the gut remains discontinuous and where this involves duodenum, small bowel, and proximal large bowel, we recommend early consideration for parenteral nutrition starting around day 3 provided physiological improvement had occurred and the resuscitation phase is complete.

Once gut continuity has been restored early enteral feeding within 6–8 h with a trickle‐feed approach is supported in the existing critical care nutrition literature.

Commence enteral nutrition (oral or tube‐feed) within 6–8 h postsurgery (trickle‐feed) once gut is continuous. Use parenteral nutrition by day 3–5 in those unable to achieve continuity of gut.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) along with the onset of acute colonic dilatation are common reasons for delayed feeding in nonventilated trauma patients. Trauma patients fit the high‐risk group for PONV. For the management of PONV, the recommended therapies include multimodal and regional analgesia, parenteral paracetamol, dexmedetomidine, lidocaine infusion, dexamethasone early during surgery, and droperidol or ondansetron at the end of surgery. The recent guidelines are a consensus of multiple societies and we support this guideline. Postoperative ileus (adynamic ileus) is common and there is a consensus evidence‐based guideline from the EAST group for the prevention and treatment of ileus. For acute colonic dilatation, there is a role for escalating therapy, from prokinetics, to neostigmine, to flatus tube placement or bedside colonoscopic decompression, with surgery reserved for patients with signs suggesting bowel ischemia. Bowel dilated beyond 11 cm predicted the need for surgical intervention.

### Novel opioid antagonists for opioid-induced bowel dysfunction and postoperative ileus [^112jgaVX]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists methylnaltrexone and alvimopan are a new class of drugs designed to reverse opioid-induced side-effects on the gastrointestinal system without compromising pain relief. This article gives an overview of the pharmacology, the efficacy, and adverse effects of these drugs. Both compounds seem to be generally well tolerated and effective for the treatment of opioid-related bowel dysfunction and postoperative ileus. Methylnaltrexone recently received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency for treatment of opioid-related bowel dysfunction in patients with advanced illness. Alvimopan was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of postoperative ileus, but the use of the drug is restricted to inpatients because it has been associated with an increased rate of myocardial infarction. Further research should assess the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in clinical practice.

### Postoperative ileus following major colorectal surgery [^116Bf5NY]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus (POI) is characterized by delayed gastrointestinal recovery following surgery. Current knowledge of pathophysiology, clinical interventions and methodological challenges was reviewed to inform modern practice and future research.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE and Embase databases was performed using search terms related to ileus and colorectal surgery. All RCTs involving an intervention to prevent or reduce POI published between 1990 and 2016 were identified. Grey literature, non-full-text manuscripts, and reanalyses of previous RCTs were excluded. Eligible articles were assessed using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias.

Results

Of 5614 studies screened, 86 eligible articles describing 88 RCTs were identified. Current knowledge of pathophysiology acknowledges neurogenic, inflammatory and pharmacological mechanisms, but much of the evidence arises from animal studies. The most common interventions tested were chewing gum (11 trials) and early enteral feeding (11), which are safe but of unclear benefit for actively reducing POI. Others, including thoracic epidural analgesia (8), systemic lidocaine (8) and peripheral μ antagonists (5), show benefit but require further investigation for safety and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion

POI is a common condition with no established definition, aetiology or treatment. According to current literature, minimally invasive surgery, protocol-driven recovery (including early feeding and opioid avoidance strategies) and measures to avoid major inflammatory events (such as anastomotic leak) offer the best chances of reducing POI.

### Does gum chewing reduce postoperative ileus following open colectomy for left-sided colon and rectal cancer? A prospective randomized controlled trial [^111q1tVb]. Colorectal Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Postoperative ileus is common after colorectal resection and can prolong hospital stay. Gum chewing, a type of sham feeding, may to stimulate gut motility via cephalic-vagal stimulation, and thereby reduce the length of ileus. This study aimed to determine whether gum chewing in the immediate postoperative period facilitated recovery from ileus following resection for left-sided colorectal cancer.

Methods

In a prospective randomized control trial, 38 patients undergoing open surgery for left-sided colorectal cancer were allocated to standard postoperative care (control group, n = 19) or to standard postoperative care plus the immediate use of chewing gum (treatment group, n = 19).

Result

Control patients passed flatus by mean of 2.7 days (SD 1.0) and faeces by 3.9 days (SD 1.5); for the treatment group, this was 2.4 days (SD 1.0) and 3.2 days (SD 1.5) respectively, (NS, P = 0.56 and P = 0.38). Length of hospital stay was 11.1 days (SD 7.3) in control group and 9.4 days (SD 2.5) in the treatment group (NS, P = 0.75).

Conclusion

The addition of gum chewing to a standardized postoperative regimen did not reduce the period of postoperative ileus or shorten length of stay following open surgery for left-sided colorectal cancer.

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^115iKxpE]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Medium credibility.

Enhanced recovery after colorectal surgery — alvimopan: Alvimopan is recommended to hasten recovery after open colorectal surgery, although its use in minimally invasive surgery remains less clear, with a grade of recommendation of strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. In open abdominal surgery, several randomized controlled trials and pooled post hoc analyses showed accelerated recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function with alvimopan 6- and 12-mg doses versus placebo and a significantly shorter hospital length of stay in the 12-mg group; one large RCT (n = 911) did not report a significant overall advantage but a post hoc analysis found benefit in patients receiving patient-controlled analgesia. A Cochrane review of 9 studies affirmed that alvimopan was better than placebo in reversing opioid-induced increased GI transit time and constipation and that it was safe and efficacious in treating postoperative ileus, though these studies were in open laparotomy with no ERP in place. For laparoscopic colorectal surgery, results are conflicting: some data showed decreased postoperative ileus without significant decreases in length of stay, a meta-analysis of 5 studies reported a 75% relative risk reduction in postoperative ileus with no impact on length of stay or readmission, other reports found no benefit when used with an ERP, and a case-matched retrospective review > 6000 patients showed no added benefit to patient outcomes with potential cost savings if alvimopan was eliminated, while other retrospective reviews reported cost savings.

### Clinical perspective on postoperative ileus and the effect of opiates [^115nd8mz]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2004). Low credibility.

Postoperative ileus (POI) is a mandatory period of cessation of intestinal function, after abdominal surgery. Over the last decade research has continued into this field, and while we continue to learn about pathogenesis, few controlled data are available for management. The clinical manifestations of POI are reviewed. Management techniques are also reviewed, including the use of postoperative care plans with early ambulation and diet, the effects of epidural anaesthesia, benefits of laparoscopic approaches for intestinal resection, and potential avenues for prevention using novel medications.

### Gallstone ileus: a review [^115WYjRM]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Background Gallstone ileus is an important complication of cholecystolithiasis. In general, surgery is the treatment of choice for such cases, but clinicians face difficulty in the selection of an appropriate approach. Closure of a cholecystoenteric fistula can be achieved through one-stage or two-stage operation. Two-stage operation has a lower mortality rate than a one-stage procedure, but persistence of the cholecystoenteric fistula is associated with the risk of carcinogenesis and recurrence of gallstone ileus.

Objective This study reviews the different surgical approaches according to the impaction site of the gallstone, using data of previous studies by our group and clinical reports in the literature.

Conclusions First, for cases involving impaction at the duodenum, the cholecystoenteric fistula can be repaired in the same surgical field, and one-stage operation obtains favourable outcome; hence, one-stage operation is considered as treatment of choice. Second, for cases involving impaction at the small intestine, natural closure of the cholecystoenteric fistula or low mortality is expected; hence, two-stage operation may be performed, possibly using minimally invasive laparoscopy. Third, for cases involving impaction at the colon, natural closure of the cholecystocolonic fistula is unlikely, and patients have a high risk of reflux cholangitis due to faecal fluid; hence, one-stage operation is considered as treatment of choice.

### Prognosis of liver transplantation: does postoperative ileus matter? [^111LQffy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Liver transplantation is not only a definitive treatment for liver diseases, but also is the second most common solid organ transplantation. Although doctors and researchers take complications of liver transplantation seriously and carry out treatments, POI is ignored by researchers. Postoperative ileus is a common complication after most abdominal surgeries, which is associated with longer hospitalization and increased medical costs. Fluid overload, exogenous opioids, surgical procedure are key mechanisms of POI. Among the 293 patients enrolled in this study with liver diseases who underwent LT, univariate analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors between patients with and without POI, apart from the lower MELD score and postoperative total bilirubin in HBV-patients with ileus, and Child-pugh score of HCC patients with ileus was low. Study has reported that goal-directed fluid therapy does not reduce postoperative ileus in gastrointestinal surgery. It is possible that fluid overload is not necessary risk factor, which also been proved in our results. Besides, patients with POI had worse overall survival rates than patients without POI.

### The value of drugs in the relief of ileus… [^115wAddC]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The classification of cases of ileus into mechanical and paralytic varieties or, according to a different terminology, dynamic and adynamic varieties, is a distinction of fundamental importance. The mechanical or dynamic variety, by definition, is characterized by some condition which physically prevents the normal progress of intestinal contents toward the anus. The relief of such a physical obstruction is essentially a surgical matter involving relief of intestinal kinking, division of bands of adhesions, removal of new growths, circumvention of constrictions by accessory openings between adjacent intestinal loops or other surgical procedures, according to the indications presented by the individual case. If the patient with such an obstruction comes to operation early, this purely surgical therapy is all that is required. In the paralytic or adynamic ileus, however, a different state of affairs exists.

### Gallstone ileus: a review [^111QfYGB]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone ileus is a relatively rare complication of cholelithiasis and a type of mechanical ileus involving impaction of gallstone in the intestinal tract. Owing to the high prevalence of gallstones, such cases may be presented in routine medical practice, and clinicians should consider gallstone ileus in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen. However, selection of appropriate treatment is difficult due to poor general condition of the patients with ileus, and physicians need to make a decision on the choice of immediate one-stage or two-stage closure of the cholecystointestinal fistula or waiting for natural closure.

My previous studies reported the experience with cases of gallstone ileus with different sites of impaction, including the disease treatment. These studies indicate that in each patient, the choice of surgical approach should be based on the site of gallstone impaction. This paper describes a treatment approach for gallstone ileus based on findings of current reports.

### Bowel stimulation before loop ileostomy closure to reduce postoperative ileus: a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^115TAVpB]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative bowel stimulation on the development of postoperative ileus (POI) after loop ileostomy closure.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (NCT025596350) including adult (≥ 18 years old) patients who underwent elective loop ileostomy closure at 7 participating hospitals. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a centralized computer-generated sequence with block randomization to either preoperative bowel stimulation or no stimulation (control group). Bowel stimulation consisted of 10 outpatient sessions within the 3 weeks prior to ileostomy closure and was performed by trained Enterostomal Therapy nurses. The primary outcome was POI, defined as an intolerance to oral food in the absence of clinical or radiological signs of obstruction, on or after postoperative day 3, that either (a) required nasogastric tube insertion; or (b) was associated with two of the following: nausea/vomiting, abdominal distension, or the absence of flatus.

Results

Between January 2017 and November 2020, 101 patients were randomized, and 5 patients never underwent ileostomy closure; thus, 96 patients (47 stimulated vs. 49 control) were analyzed according to a modified intention-to-treat protocol. Baseline characteristics were well balanced in both groups. The incidence of POI was lower among patients randomized to stimulation (6.4% vs. 24.5%, p = 0.034; unadjusted RR: 0.26, 95% CI 0.078–0.87). Stimulated patients also had earlier median time to first flatus (2.0 days (1.0–2.0) vs. 2.0 days (2.0–3.0), p = 0.025), were more likely to pass flatus on postoperative day 1 (46.8% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.022), and had a shorter median postoperative hospital stay (3.0 days (2.0–3.5) vs. 4.0 days (2.0–6.0), p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Preoperative bowel stimulation via the efferent limb of the ileostomy reduced POI after elective loop ileostomy closure.

### Systemic prokinetic pharmacologic treatment for postoperative adynamic ileus following abdominal surgery in adults [^113zR5uD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative adynamic bowel atony interferes with recovery following abdominal surgery. Prokinetic pharmacologic drugs are widely used to accelerate postoperative recovery.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic acting prokinetic drugs to treat postoperative adynamic ileus in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified by computerised searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group specialised register. The reference lists of included trials and review articles were tracked and authors contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled parallel-group trials (RCT) comparing the effect of systemically acting prokinetic drugs against placebo or no intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality. Trial authors were contacted for additional information if needed.

Main Results

Thirty-nine RCTs met the inclusion criteria contributing a total of 4615 participants. Most trials enrolled a small number of patients and showed moderate to poor (reporting of) methodological quality, in particular regarding allocation concealment and intention-to-treat analysis. Fifteen systemic acting prokinetic drugs were investigated and ten comparisons could be summarized. Six RCTs support the effect of Alvimopan, a novel peripheral mu receptor antagonist. However, the trials do not meet reporting guidelines and the drug is still in an investigational stage. Erythromycin showed homogenous and consistent absence of effect across all included trials and outcomes. The evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of cholecystokinin-like drugs, cisapride, dopamine-antagonists, propranolol or vasopressin. Effects are either inconsistent across outcomes, or trials are too small and often of poor methodological quality. Cisapride has been withdrawn from the market due to adverse cardiac events in many countries. Intravenous lidocaine and neostigmine might show a potential effect, but more evidence on clinically relevant outcomes is needed. Heterogeneity among included trials was seen in 10 comparisons. No major adverse drug effects were evident.

Authors' Conclusions

Alvimopan may prove to be beneficial but proper judgement needs adherence to reporting standards. Further trials are needed on intravenous lidocaine and neostigmine. The remaining drugs can not be recommended due to lack of evidence or absence of effect.

### Economic impact of alvimopan considering varying definitions of postoperative ileus [^116QiYam]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged postoperative ileus (POI) is the predominant cause of extended hospitalization after bowel resection surgery. Alvimopan accelerates gastrointestinal recovery, potentially reducing health care costs. We examined the value of alvimopan in reducing prolonged POI and length of stay for patients undergoing abdominal surgery using different definitions of POI.

Study Design

We developed a decision analytic model to examine costs and outcomes associated with postoperative treatment with either an accelerated care pathway (ACP) only or alvimopan+ACP. To represent an overall perspective for alvimopan, data from four phase 3 bowel resection trials and one phase 4 radical cystectomy trial were used to populate the model with 3 different definitions of POI. The period analyzed included start of surgery to 7 days post discharge. Costs were obtained from standard US costing sources and are reported in 2015 US dollars. Due to variations in published definitions of POI, alternative definitions based on adverse event reports, NG tube insertion, and time to food toleration were examined.

Results

The combined clinical trial data included 1,003 ACP and 1,013 alvimopan+ACP patients. When POI was reported as an adverse event, the incidence of POI was significantly lower with alvimopan+ACP (n = 70 [7%]) vs ACP alone (n = 148 [15%]; p < 0.0001). Time to discharge order written was shorter for patients with POI who were treated with alvimopan+ACP than with ACP (202 ± 115 hours vs 266 ± 138 hours; p < 0.0001). As a result, costs were $731 lower with alvimopan+ACP ($17,835) vs ACP ($18,566). Alternative definitions of POI produced similar results.

Conclusions

The addition of alvimopan to existing treatment pathways for patients undergoing abdominal surgery can reduce overall hospital costs.

### Does alvimopan enhance return of bowel function in laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery? A meta-analysis [^1128BMKx]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Postoperative ileus (POI) remains a major impediment in patient recovery and leads to longer lengths of stay at the hospital, readmission rates, and hospital costs
Alvimopan, a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, lowers POI incidence following open gastrointestinal surgery

What the new findings are:

There was an over 75% relative risk reduction in POI when patients were given alvimopan compared to patients not receiving alvimopan (OR 0.24, 95%CI 0.12–0.51, P = 0.02)
The number needed to treat with alvimopan to prevent one POI episode was 11 patients
There was a modest reduction in the length of hospitalization in the alvimopan group, but there was no difference in the frequency of the 30-day readmission rate

### Paralytic ileus in the orthopaedic patient [^113paEBS]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Paralytic ileus is marked by the cessation of bowel motility. This condition is a major clinical concern that may lead to severe patient morbidity in orthopaedic surgery and trauma patients. Ileus most commonly occurs following spinal surgery, traumatic injury, or lower extremity joint reconstruction, but it may also occur following minor orthopaedic procedures. Possible consequences of ileus include abdominal pain, malnutrition, prolonged hospital stay, hospital readmission, bowel perforation, and death. Therapies used in the treatment of ileus include minimization of opioids, early patient mobilization, pharmacologic intervention, and multidisciplinary care. Orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms of paralytic ileus and should understand treatment principles of this relatively common adverse event.

### Core outcome set for clinical studies of postoperative ileus after intestinal surgery [^114Q28Gj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Overview of study methods

The study consisted of three phases, in accordance with Delphi methodology, and was conducted between 17 January 2020 and 6 March 2021. In phase 1, a long list of candidate outcomes was generated from a systematic review of previous literature, a series of four international patient and clinician focus groups, and consultation within the steering committee. In phase 2, candidate outcomes were presented to stakeholders via a three-round Delphi survey with between-round feedback. Suggestions for additional outcomes were invited during round 1. During each round, participants voted on the importance of each outcome using a numerical rating scale (1–9), and those that fulfilled a predefined threshold of consensus were carried forward iteratively to the consensus meeting (Table 1). In phase 3, an online consensus meeting was convened to ratify the final outcome set. This was chaired by an independent chairperson and participants were sampled purposively to represent key stakeholder groups across an international setting. Final anonymized voting took place on the final composition and presentation of the set.

### Core outcome set for clinical studies of postoperative ileus after intestinal surgery [^115Z3JbH]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative ileus is a common and distressing complication after intestinal surgery. It presents clinically as impairment of intestinal motility, characterized by abdominal pain, vomiting, and delayed recovery of defaecatory function. For patients, this increases the risk of serious complications, such as pneumonia, venous thromboembolic events, and malnutrition. For healthcare systems, it leads to a substantial economic burden associated with increased medical, nursing, dietitian, and laboratory costs. Accordingly, postoperative ileus is now recognized as a research priority by expert and public stakeholder groups.

Numerous clinical interventions have been evaluated in efforts to prevent postoperative ileus, but few have led to meaningful patient benefit. A key challenge for researchers is the absence of a standardized and agreed framework to describe the effectiveness of new interventions in clinical studies. Common outcomes include the time taken until first passage of flatus/stool, time until tolerance of oral diet, and the return of bowel sounds. It remains unclear, however, whether these are sufficiently relevant to patients and healthcare professionals when evaluating new treatments and implementing them in clinical practice.

A solution to this problem is the development of an agreed core outcome set developed through patient–clinician consensus. Core outcome sets provide a minimum set of outcomes that should be reported in all studies of a defined clinical condition and are supported by the Core Outcome Measures in Effective Trials (COMET) Initiative. The present report describes the international development and final content of an agreed core outcome set for postoperative ileus relevant to patients undergoing intestinal surgery.

### Risk factors for prolonged ileus after resection of colorectal cancer: an observational study of 2400 consecutive patients [^111vGouk]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Prolonged ileus-the failure of postoperative ileus to resolve within a few days after major abdominal surgery-leads to significant medical consequences for the patient and costs to the hospital system. The aim of this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was to identify independent preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for prolonged ileus in a large consecutive series of patients who had undergone resection for colorectal cancer.

Methods

Patients were drawn from a hospital registry of 2400 consecutive resections over the period 1995–2009. Thirty-four potential predictors of prolonged ileus were analyzed by logistic regression.

Results

Prolonged ileus occurred in 14.0% of patients. Statistically significant independent predictors of prolonged ileus were male sex (OR: 1.7, P < 0.001), peripheral vascular disease (OR: 1.8, P < 0.001), respiratory comorbidity (OR: 1.6, P < 0.001), resection at urgent operation (OR: 2.2, P < 0.001), perioperative transfusion (OR: 1.6, P < 0.010), stoma constructed (OR: 1.4, P < 0.001), and operation lasting ≥ 3 hours (OR: 1.6, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

These features can be used to alert medical and nursing staff to patients likely to experience prolonged ileus after bowel resection so that they can be monitored closely in the postoperative period and available treatments targeted toward them. These features may also be useful in the research context to facilitate the more efficient selection of high-risk patients as subjects in clinical trials of prevention or treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES jerusalem guidelines [^115Eoa82]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 6.1 Non-operative management is a reasonable first-line treatment for appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess. Percutaneous drainage as an adjunct to antibiotics, if accessible, could be beneficial, although there is a lack of evidence for its use on a routine basis. Laparoscopic surgery in experienced hands is a safe and feasible first-line treatment for appendiceal abscess, being associated with fewer readmissions and fewer additional interventions than conservative treatment, with a comparable hospital stay. Recommendation 6.1 We suggest non-operative management with antibiotics and — if available — percutaneous drainage for complicated appendicitis with a periappendicular abscess, in settings where laparoscopic expertise is not available [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2B].

Statement 6.2 Operative management of acute appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess is a safe alternative to non-operative management in experienced hands and may be associated with shorter LOS, reduced need for readmissions, and fewer additional interventions than conservative treatment. Recommendation 6.2 We suggest the laparoscopic approach as treatment of choice for patients with complicated appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess where advanced laparoscopic expertise is available, with a low threshold for conversion. [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2B].

Q.6.2: Is interval appendectomy always indicated for patients with acute appendicitis following successful NOM?

The reported rate of recurrence after non-surgical treatment for perforated AA and phlegmon is up to 12%. In order to avoid this quite high chance of recurrence, some authors recommend routine elective interval appendectomy following initial conservative management. However, this procedure is associated with a non-negligible rate of morbidity of 12.4%. The systematic review by Hall et al. including three retrospective studies for a total of 127 cases of non-surgical treatment of appendix mass in children, showed that after successful non-operative treatment the risk of recurrent AA was found to be 20.5%. Overall, the complications reported included SSI, prolonged postoperative ileus, hematoma formation, and small bowel obstruction, but the incidence of any individual complication was not determined.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of chewing-gum therapy in the reduction of postoperative paralytic ileus following gastrointestinal surgery [^1149Y9Wh]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus has long been considered an inevitable consequence of gastrointestinal surgery. It prolongs hospital stay, increases morbidity, and adds to treatment costs. Chewing is a form of sham feeding reported to stimulate bowel motility. This analysis examines the value of chewing-gum therapy in treatment of postoperative ileus.

Methods

A search for randomized, controlled trials studying elective gastrointestinal surgery was undertaken using MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and reference lists. Outcomes were extracted including time to first flatus and bowel motion, length of stay, and complications. Statistical analysis was undertaken using the weighted mean difference (WMD) and random-effects model with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

Seven studies with 272 patients were included. For time to first flatus the analysis favored treatment with a WMD of 12.6 h (17%) reduction (95% CI -21.49 to -3.72; P = 0.005). For time to first bowel motion, treatment was favored with a WMD of 23.11 h (22%) reduction (95% CI -34.32 to -11.91; P < 0.001). For length of stay, the analysis showed a nonsignificant trend toward treatment with WMD of 23.88 h (12%) reduction (95% CI -53.29 to +5.53; P = 0.11). There were no significant differences in complication rates.

Conclusions

Chewing-gum therapy following open gastrointestinal surgery is beneficial in reducing the period of postoperative ileus, although without a significant reduction in length of hospital stay. These outcomes are not significant for laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery.

### Chewing gum for postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function [^112Edr49]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ileus commonly occurs after abdominal surgery, and is associated with complications and increased length of hospital stay (LOHS). Onset of ileus is considered to be multifactorial, and a variety of preventative methods have been investigated. Chewing gum (CG) is hypothesised to reduce postoperative ileus by stimulating early recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function, through cephalo-vagal stimulation. There is no comprehensive review of this intervention in abdominal surgery.

Objectives

To examine whether chewing gum after surgery hastens the return of gastrointestinal function.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (via Ovid), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCO) and ISI Web of Science (June 2014). We hand-searched reference lists of identified studies and previous reviews and systematic reviews, and contacted CG companies to ask for information on any studies using their products. We identified proposed and ongoing studies from clinicaltrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and metaRegister of Controlled Trials.

Selection Criteria

We included completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that used postoperative CG as an intervention compared to a control group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently collected data and assessed study quality using an adapted Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool, and resolved disagreements by discussion. We assessed overall quality of evidence for each outcome using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Studies were split into subgroups: colorectal surgery (CRS), caesarean section (CS) and other surgery (OS). We assessed the effect of CG on time to first flatus (TFF), time to bowel movement (TBM), LOHS and time to bowel sounds (TBS) through meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We investigated the influence of study quality, reviewers' methodological estimations and use of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programmes using sensitivity analyses. We used meta-regression to explore if surgical site or ROB scores predicted the extent of the effect estimate of the intervention on continuous outcomes. We reported frequency of complications, and descriptions of tolerability of gum and cost.

Main Results

We identified 81 studies that recruited 9072 participants for inclusion in our review. We categorised many studies at high or unclear risk of the bias' assessed. There was statistical evidence that use of CG reduced TFF [overall reduction of 10.4 hours (95% CI: -11.9, -8.9): 12.5 hours (95% CI: -17.2, -7.8) in CRS, 7.9 hours (95% CI: -10.0, -5.8) in CS, 10.6 hours (95% CI: -12.7, -8.5) in OS]. There was also statistical evidence that use of CG reduced TBM [overall reduction of 12.7 hours (95% CI: -14.5, -10.9): 18.1 hours (95% CI: -25.3, -10.9) in CRS, 9.1 hours (95% CI: -11.4, -6.7) in CS, 12.3 hours (95% CI: -14.9, -9.7) in OS]. There was statistical evidence that use of CG slightly reduced LOHS [overall reduction of 0.7 days (95% CI: -0.8, -0.5): 1.0 days in CRS (95% CI: -1.6, -0.4), 0.2 days (95% CI: -0.3, -0.1) in CS, 0.8 days (95% CI: -1.1, -0.5) in OS]. There was statistical evidence that use of CG slightly reduced TBS [overall reduction of 5.0 hours (95% CI: -6.4, -3.7): 3.21 hours (95% CI: -7.0, 0.6) in CRS, 4.4 hours (95% CI: -5.9, -2.8) in CS, 6.3 hours (95% CI: -8.7, -3.8) in OS]. Effect sizes were largest in CRS and smallest in CS. There was statistical evidence of heterogeneity in all analyses other than TBS in CRS. There was little difference in mortality, infection risk and readmission rate between the groups. Some studies reported reduced nausea and vomiting and other complications in the intervention group. CG was generally well-tolerated by participants. There was little difference in cost between the groups in the two studies reporting this outcome. Sensitivity analyses by quality of studies and robustness of review estimates revealed no clinically important differences in effect estimates. Sensitivity analysis of ERAS studies showed a smaller effect size on TFF, larger effect size on TBM, and no difference between groups for LOHS. Meta-regression analyses indicated that surgical site is associated with the extent of the effect size on LOHS (all surgical subgroups), and TFF and TBM (CS and CRS subgroups only). There was no evidence that ROB score predicted the extent of the effect size on any outcome. Neither variable explained the identified heterogeneity between studies.

Authors' Conclusions

This review identified some evidence for the benefit of postoperative CG in improving recovery of GI function. However, the research to date has primarily focussed on CS and CRS, and largely consisted of small, poor quality trials. Many components of the ERAS programme also target ileus, therefore the benefit of CG alongside ERAS may be reduced, as we observed in this review. Therefore larger, better quality RCTS in an ERAS setting in wider surgical disciplines would be needed to improve the evidence base for use of CG after surgery.

### Bortezomib-induced paralytic ileus is a potential gastrointestinal side effect of this first-in-class anticancer proteasome inhibitor [^112dxwFG]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Bortezomib is the first anticancer proteasome inhibitor introduced into clinical practice. It has been recently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, an incurable plasma cell tumour that accounts for 10–15% of all haematologic malignancies and for approximately 20% of deaths. Gastrointestinal toxicity associated with the use of this drug is common but generally mild to moderate. Paralytic ileus in patients undergoing bortezomib treatment has been reported, although a definite attribution to bortezomib administration has not been established. We report a myeloma patient who developed severe paralytic ileus during bortezomib therapy, which presented in the context of progressive constipation without other known causes and which regressed promptly with medical management after drug cessation, suggesting a direct causal relationship. Awareness of the various potential gastrointestinal toxic effects of bortezomib is of relevance given the growing number of patients undergoing treatment with this important and effective new cancer drug.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^112WyyUQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — initial and severe/fulminant CDI treatment recommend for an initial nonsevere episode that oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 d be used (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) or that oral fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 d be used (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), while oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 d may be considered in low-risk patients. As initial therapy for severe CDI, we recommend vancomycin 125 mg 4 times a day for 10 d (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) and we recommend fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 d (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Patients with fulminant CDI should receive medical therapy that includes adequate volume resuscitation and treatment with 500 mg of oral vancomycin every 6 hr (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence) for the first 48–72 hr, and combination therapy with parenteral metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hr can be considered (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with an ileus, the addition of vancomycin enemas (500 mg every 6 hr) may be beneficial (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Effect of acupuncture on postoperative ileus after laparoscopic elective colorectal surgery: a prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^1111Wsbt]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Analyses were performed in an intention-to-treat setting using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). All tests applied were two-tailed, p < 0·05 was considered statistically significant. For the primary outcomes, the p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons (p < 0·025) using Bonferroni correction.

### Pathogenesis and clinical and economic consequences of postoperative ileus [^116UQ4dv]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Postoperative ileus is a preventable disease with surprising economic consequences. Understanding the triad of dysmotility in conjunction with an enhanced recovery program improves patient outcome, decreases length of stay in hospital, and lowers the cost. Alvimopan and other investigational promotility medications can help attain these goals. Surgeons should avoid labeling all postoperative abdominal distention as ileus, which not only prevents timely diagnosis and treatment of early postoperative small bowel obstruction or acute colonic pseudo-obstruction but also increases patient morbidity and mortality.

### The effect of chewing gum on postoperative ileus after laparotomy for gastroduodenal perforations: a randomized controlled trial [^113E7Dzy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged postoperative ileus is linked to a higher risk of additional complications, longer hospital stays, and higher healthcare expenses. There are few randomized controlled trials on the impact of chewing gum on the duration of ileus in patients undergoing emergency surgery, notably those with peritonitis. Compelling evidence from studies on elective procedures demonstrates that chewing gum can lessen the duration of ileus. This trial aimed to examine the effect of chewing gum on the length of the postoperative ileus which develop after laparotomy for gastroduodenal perforations.

Materials and Methods

Multicentre randomized controlled trial. Fifty-two patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Group A received routine care with chewing gum, while group B only received routine care. The primary outcome was the length of postoperative ileus, while the secondary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, in-hospital morbidity, and mortality. The continuous variables were compared using the nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank sum (Mann-Whitney U) test while the categorical outcomes were compared using the chi-squared test in SPSS version 26. The protocol was retrospectively registered with the WHO Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (Number: PACTR202206468032528) on the 1st of June 2022.

Results

Of the 52 participants included in the analysis, the majority were males (80.8%) with a mean age of 34.23 (SD = 11.52) years. There was no statistically significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the study participants between the two groups (P > 0.05 for all). The median duration of postoperative ileus was 21.5 h less in the chewing gum group (28.5 versus 50.0, P = 0.002), while the length of hospital stay was 2.5 days less in the chewing gum group (5.4 versus 7.9, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference noted in the occurrence of complications.

Conclusion

Chewing gum that is readily available and reasonably priced may help shorten the duration of post-operative ileus, which has the extra benefit of enabling early discharge.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for colorectal surgery, more specifically with respect to postoperative ileus prevention, ASCRS/SAGES 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering sham feeding (chewing gum for ≥ 10 minutes 3–4 times daily) after colorectal surgery for reduced length of hospital stay and small improvements in gastrointestinal recovery.
