## Question

Ocular sarcoidosis steroid regimen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a steroid regimen for ocular sarcoidosis stratified by anatomic location, with tapering rules, triggers for steroid-sparing therapy, and monitoring, all with supporting references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify disease by site and severity and confirm the need for urgent therapy if vision is threatened. Then, I should define initial corticosteroid choices by anatomic compartment. Next, I need to outline tapering principles and thresholds that signal the need for steroid-sparing agents. After that, I will examine preferred immunomodulators and biologics and when to use local implants. Finally, I should specify monitoring for treatment response and toxicity and summarize maintenance and relapse management, making sure each step aligns with consensus guidance and available trial or labeling data [^1174QzoW] [^112mieeo].

> Let me first confirm the framework for initial assessment, because treatment selection hinges on anatomy and severity. Ocular sarcoidosis commonly presents as anterior, intermediate, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis, and I need to check visual acuity, degree of intraocular inflammation, macular status, vasculitis, and optic nerve involvement, since posterior segment disease, cystoid macular edema, persistent inflammation, and optic neuropathy portend worse outcomes and may mandate more aggressive therapy [^1134Q3rZ] [^112mieeo]. Hold on, I should verify prevalence and the rationale for prompt detection and treatment: ocular involvement occurs in roughly 20–40% of sarcoidosis cohorts, and guidelines endorse routine eye evaluation because timely therapy can preserve vision and guide systemic care [^1174QzoW] [^112mieeo].

> For anterior uveitis, I need to ensure we start with intensive topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia while avoiding undertreatment. Let me double-check dosing: prednisolone sodium phosphate 1% ophthalmic solution can be given as 1–2 drops up to every hour during the day and every 2 hours at night initially, then tapered to every 4 hours when a favorable response is observed, and further to 3–4 times daily for maintenance, with duration individualized to response per FDA labeling [^117KLZ6f]. Wait, I should verify adjuncts: add mydriatic/cycloplegic agents to prevent posterior synechiae, and escalate to periocular or systemic corticosteroids only if topical therapy is insufficient or disease is severe or bilateral per IWOS-informed recommendations [^113b7Dhy].

> For intermediate uveitis, let me consider laterality and severity carefully. I should confirm that first-line options include periocular or intravitreal corticosteroid injections for unilateral or focal disease and systemic corticosteroids for bilateral, recurrent, or severe presentations, with the choice tailored to edema, vasculitis, and patient comorbidity profiles [^113b7Dhy] [^112mieeo]. Hold on, I should verify that local steroid delivery carries risks of IOP rise, cataract, and rare injection-related complications, which must be weighed against the benefits in each case [^113b7Dhy].

> For posterior uveitis or panuveitis, I need to check that systemic corticosteroids are first-line and that sight-threatening disease may require pulses. Let me verify dosing: for most moderate noninfectious posterior disease, prednisone 20–40 mg daily is reasonable initially, with escalation for refractory activity, whereas severe or vision-threatening presentations can receive IV methylprednisolone 500–1000 mg daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisone about 40 mg/day, then taper to the lowest effective dose as inflammation settles [^113b7Dhy]. I should confirm that neurosarcoidosis or optic neuropathy typically warrants higher-dose regimens (around 0.5–1 mg/kg/day or 40 mg/day) and early consideration of second-line agents if tapering fails, consistent with neurosarcoid treatment algorithms and ERS guidance for refractory cases [^112WSA7h] [^1114kZyn].

> Now, on tapering, I need to ensure we avoid both steroid toxicity and inflammatory rebound. Let me double-check the relapse thresholds: symptoms often recur when tapering under about 20–25 mg/day of prednisone equivalents in neurosarcoidosis, suggesting careful, slow decrements once control is achieved, for example by 5–10 mg every 1–2 weeks down to 20 mg, then slower reductions thereafter, adjusting to activity and macular status [^112WSA7h]. Hold on, I should verify triggers for adding a steroid-sparing agent: inability to taper below roughly 10–20 mg/day within 3–6 months without relapse, or emergence of significant steroid adverse effects, supports escalation to immunomodulators in line with tapering principles used across sarcoidosis [^111wSTy1] [^112WSA7h].

> Next, I should review steroid-sparing systemic immunosuppressants and confirm first-line choices. Let me verify that methotrexate (often 15–25 mg weekly with folate) is the most studied agent and appears effective for ocular sarcoidosis, with emerging comparative data suggesting longer time to relapse and better visual outcomes versus mycophenolate or azathioprine in non-anterior sarcoid uveitis, acknowledging retrospective design limits [^112PbjEc] [^116Lqm14]. I need to check that mycophenolate mofetil (1–2 g/day) and azathioprine are acceptable alternatives when MTX is contraindicated or poorly tolerated, and that combined initiation of corticosteroids with a conventional DMARD may improve failure-free survival and provide steroid-sparing benefit in non-anterior disease, albeit from retrospective cohorts [^112PbjEc] [^1172VP3D]. But wait, I should also ensure alignment with consensus that immunomodulators are escalated earlier in ocular disease to mitigate steroid complications while maintaining quiescence [^112mieeo].

> Regarding biologic therapy, I need to confirm where it fits and which agents have supportive evidence. Let me first verify that adalimumab is FDA-approved for noninfectious intermediate, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis and has robust phase 3 data supporting steroid-sparing control of inflammation, making it a reasonable option for refractory or intolerant cases after antimetabolites [^112zJ2jh] [^1119EQyk]. Hold on, I should verify that infliximab is recommended by ERS for neurosarcoidosis not controlled by corticosteroids plus a second-line agent, which is pertinent when optic pathway disease or CNS involvement drives ocular risk [^1114kZyn]. I need to double-check that etanercept has not shown benefit in ocular sarcoidosis and should generally be avoided for this indication based on randomized trial data [^113UAG5M].

> I will now examine the role of local sustained-release steroid implants in refractory or unilateral cases. Let me verify that dexamethasone and fluocinolone acetonide implants can improve intraocular inflammation and macular edema but carry increased risks of IOP elevation and cataract, with MUST trial data suggesting systemic therapy may be preferable for bilateral disease when considering long-term safety and cost-effectiveness, whereas implants are reasonable for unilateral disease or when systemic therapy is contraindicated or has failed [^116Nzq4o] [^112puMnZ]. Wait, I should also note injection-related risks and underscore the need for close IOP monitoring and cataract surveillance with any intraocular steroid approach [^113b7Dhy].

> Monitoring needs to be explicit, so I should confirm a schedule and key parameters. I need to check that each visit assesses visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit-lamp cells/flare, and fundus activity, with OCT for macular edema and documentation of vasculitis or choroiditis, initially weekly to monthly during active treatment and every 3–6 months in maintenance, adapting to severity and treatment changes [^113b7Dhy]. Hold on, I should verify counseling and surveillance for steroid toxicities: systemic glucocorticoids are associated with weight gain, hypertension, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, bone loss, and ocular complications, reinforcing the impetus for steroid-sparing regimens and proactive risk mitigation [^115PabbU].

> Special situations can shift thresholds for intensity. Let me consider optic neuropathy and neurosarcoidosis: reports show improvement with high-dose IV then oral steroids but frequent early relapses on taper, often necessitating the addition of immunosuppressants; thus, I should confirm early escalation if visual function is threatened or tapering provokes recurrence, and avoid subtherapeutic initial dosing in CNS disease given poorer response with progressive courses [^114rtQua] [^112WSA7h] [^1135t8Zo]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought typical pulmonary-sarcoid doses would suffice for optic neuropathy, but I should correct that to emphasize higher neurosarcoid dosing and earlier second-line therapy when vision is at stake [^112WSA7h] [^1114kZyn].

> For long-term maintenance and discontinuation, I need to ensure the strategy prioritizes quiescence before tapering immunosuppression. Let me verify that ocular sarcoidosis is frequently chronic, with prolonged active disease in many cohorts, so I should aim for zero inflammation for at least several months before tapering steroids, maintain the immunomodulator during the steroid taper, and only consider reducing the immunomodulator after sustained quiescence, recognizing that many severe cases need 2–3 years or longer of low-dose therapy to minimize relapse risk [^1134Q3rZ] [^111jpAv9]. I should double-check that relapses warrant prompt re-induction with higher-dose steroids, sometimes with IV pulse therapy, and reassessment of the steroid-sparing regimen [^111jpAv9].

> Putting this into a concise algorithm, I should confirm we start with precise anatomic and severity assessment; initiate topical steroids plus cycloplegia for anterior disease; choose periocular/intravitreal versus systemic steroids for intermediate disease based on laterality and severity; and use systemic steroids for posterior or panuveitis, escalating to IV pulses if sight is threatened, while planning a deliberate taper and early addition of methotrexate or another antimetabolite when tapering below 10–20 mg/day fails or toxicity emerges, reserving adalimumab or infliximab for refractory cases or neurosarcoidosis and implant options for unilateral or systemic-therapy–intolerant patients, all under close ocular and systemic monitoring to balance efficacy and safety [^112mieeo] [^112zJ2jh]. Hold on, I should verify one last time that each step aligns with IWOS-informed recommendations and available guidelines, adjusting for individual risk, comorbidity, and patient preferences in a multidisciplinary framework [^113b7Dhy] [^1174QzoW].

The steroid regimen for ocular sarcoidosis is tailored to inflammation location and severity, with **topical steroids for anterior uveitis** and **systemic steroids for posterior or panuveitis** [^112mieeo] [^113txXga]. Start topical **prednisolone acetate 1% every 1–2 hours**, then taper to the lowest effective dose over weeks to months [^117KLZ6f]. For posterior or panuveitis, initiate **oral prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg/day)**, taper over 6–12 months, and add steroid-sparing agents if maintenance > 10 mg/day is needed. Periocular or intravitreal steroids are options for unilateral or refractory cases, with close monitoring for cataract and glaucoma [^112PbjEc] [^112puMnZ]. Use the lowest effective dose and taper slowly [^111wSTy1] to minimize relapse and adverse effects [^115PabbU].

---

## Topical corticosteroids for anterior uveitis

Topical corticosteroids are the **first-line treatment** for sarcoid-associated anterior uveitis [^113txXga]. Prednisolone acetate 1% ophthalmic suspension is commonly used for its efficacy in controlling anterior segment inflammation [^117KLZ6f].

- **Initial dosing**: Instill one or two drops into the conjunctival sac every hour during the day and every two hours at night, depending on the severity of inflammation [^117KLZ6f].

- **Tapering**: Once inflammation is controlled [^111wSTy1], gradually reduce the frequency to one drop every four hours, then further to three to four times daily as needed [^117KLZ6f].

- **Duration**: Treatment duration varies based on response [^113txXga], typically ranging from several days to weeks. Chronic active lesions may require prolonged therapy with careful monitoring for relapse [^117KLZ6f].

---

## Systemic corticosteroids for posterior segment involvement

Systemic corticosteroids are indicated for **intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis**, as well as for optic nerve involvement [^113txXga]. Oral prednisone is the standard agent [^112mieeo].

- **Initial dosing**: Oral prednisone is typically initiated at 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, with a maximum dose of 60 mg/day.

- **Tapering**: Gradual tapering is essential to prevent relapse [^113b7Dhy]. The tapering schedule should be individualized based on clinical response, typically over several months [^111wSTy1].

- **Maintenance dose**: Long-term maintenance doses of prednisone (≤ 10 mg/day) may be required in chronic or recurrent cases.

---

## Periocular and intravitreal corticosteroid injections

Periocular and intravitreal corticosteroid injections are **useful adjuncts** for unilateral disease or macular edema, or when systemic therapy is contraindicated or insufficient [^113txXga].

- **Periocular injections**: Triamcinolone acetonide (20–40 mg) administered into the sub-Tenon's or orbital floor space provides transient control of inflammation, typically lasting 2–4 months.

- **Intravitreal injections**: Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide or sustained-release dexamethasone implants (Ozurdex) are effective for macular edema and posterior segment inflammation [^112PbjEc] [^116Nzq4o].

- **Risks**: Elevated intraocular pressure, cataract progression [^112puMnZ], and injection-related complications (e.g. endophthalmitis, retinal detachment) necessitate careful monitoring [^112PbjEc] [^113b7Dhy].

---

## Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents

Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents are recommended when **prolonged systemic corticosteroids** are required or when steroid-related side effects occur [^113txXga]. Methotrexate is the **most commonly used agent** [^111cZHky], effective in controlling inflammation [^112PbjEc] and reducing corticosteroid dependence [^116Lqm14]. Mycophenolate mofetil is an **alternative**, particularly useful in chronic or refractory cases [^116Lqm14] [^112PbjEc]. Azathioprine is another option, though less commonly used than methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil [^112PbjEc] [^111cZHky].

---

## Monitoring and management of corticosteroid side effects

Long-term corticosteroid therapy carries **significant side effects**, including cataract formation, glaucoma, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, and increased infection risk [^115PabbU]. Regular **monitoring and preventive measures** are essential [^113PhBj7], with ophthalmic follow-up (regular intraocular pressure checks and cataract assessments) and systemic monitoring (blood pressure, blood glucose, bone density, and infection surveillance). Preventive measures include calcium and vitamin D supplementation, bisphosphonates for osteoporosis prevention, and antihypertensive or antidiabetic medications as needed.

---

## Clinical outcomes and relapse rates

Corticosteroid therapy is **effective in controlling ocular inflammation** and preventing vision loss [^112mieeo]; however, **relapse rates are significant**, particularly during tapering or discontinuation of therapy. Approximately **25% of patients experience relapse**, necessitating re-initiation or escalation of treatment [^1177WBDW].

## Summary of corticosteroid regimens for ocular sarcoidosis

| **Clinical scenario** | **Corticosteroid regimen** | **Tapering schedule** | **Adjunctive therapy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Anterior uveitis | Topical prednisolone acetate 1% every hour | Gradual reduction over weeks | Mydriatic agents [^113txXga] |
| Intermediate/posterior uveitis | Oral prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day | Gradual taper over months | Immunosuppressive agents [^112mieeo] |
| Unilateral/macular edema | Periocular/intravitreal triamcinolone | Repeat every 2–4 months as needed | Systemic corticosteroids [^116Nzq4o] |
| Chronic/refractory disease | Systemic corticosteroids + immunosuppressive agents | Individualized tapering | Biologic agents (adalimumab) [^1119EQyk] |

---

Corticosteroids are the **cornerstone of ocular sarcoidosis management**, with topical steroids for anterior uveitis and systemic steroids for posterior segment involvement [^112mieeo] [^113txXga]. Periocular and intravitreal injections are adjunctive options [^112puMnZ], and steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents are recommended for chronic or refractory cases. Regular monitoring and individualized tapering schedules are essential to minimize side effects and prevent relapse [^111wSTy1].

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: Challenges and solutions [^112PbjEc]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic immunosuppressive agents are used as a corticosteroid-sparing strategy when prolonged steroid therapy is required, in cases of failure of treatment, or relapse. The corticosteroid-sparing approach is generally employed earlier in ocular disease than in other forms of sarcoidosis because of the significant risk of ocular complications caused by both the disease itself and the steroid use.

Preferred medications in patients with chronic ocular or systemic sarcoidosis are antimetabolites. Methotrexate (MTX) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a selective suppressor of T- and B-lymphocyte proliferation, are favored as first-line steroid-sparing agents. MTX is currently the most studied cytotoxic agent in chronic ocular disease and sarcoidosis in general. Several retrospective studies have shown satisfactory outcomes in terms of inflammatory control with such agents, but only a small number of prospective comparative studies evaluating their safety and efficacy exist.

A recent study by Browne et al. inquiring uveitis experts on their preference on antimetabolite use in uninfectious posterior uveitis revealed that experts believed MMF 2 g/day was more effective than MTX 25 mg/week in controlling inflammation. Despite that, an RCT by Rathinam et al. comparing the relative effectiveness of MTX and MMF for uninfectious uveitis showed no statistically significant difference in corticosteroid-sparing control of inflammation between the two groups, but MTX was favored by a 22% difference in treatment success. In 2012, Baughman et al. conducted a retrospective review.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate [^117KLZ6f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Depending on the severity of inflammation, instill one or two drops of solution into the conjunctival sac up to every hour during the day and every two hours during the night as necessary as initial therapy. When a favorable response is observed, reduce dosage to one drop every four hours. Later, further reduction in dosage to one drop three to four times daily may suffice to control symptoms.

The duration of treatment will vary with the type of lesion and may extend from a few days to several weeks, according to therapeutic response. Relapses, more common in chronic active lesions than in self-limited conditions, usually respond to retreatment.

### Extrapulmonary sarcoidosis with a focus on cardiac, nervous system, and ocular involvement [^113b7Dhy]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Treatment of OS**: The International Workshop on OS (IWOS) has provided expert recommendations on the management of anterior, intermediate, and posterior uveitis in OS. A total of 98 participants from 29 countries completed a survey and participated in a consensus workshop to establish these recommendations for the management of OS.

Effective treatment for OS is pivotal, as a delay in treatment is strongly associated with a lack of improvement or deterioration in visual acuity. Frequent topical CS, along with mydriatic agents, is the first-line treatment for anterior uveitis and is sufficient for most cases. Second-line therapy for anterior uveitis can include a local CS injection or systemic CS if needed. For intermediate uveitis, first-line therapy consists of local CS injection and systemic CS. For posterior uveitis, first-line therapy consists of systemic CS alone or with CS-sparing non-biologic systemic IA.

Intraocular injections of CS can be administered in severe cases but carry the risks of retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, and visual loss. Notably, with the long-term use of topical CS or local injections, the clinician should be aware of the risk of development of cataract and steroid-induced glaucoma. In this context, initiation of steroid-sparing IA needs to be considered to avoid further complications associated with CS use. CS-refractory cases may also require the initiation of IA. In up to 15% of cases of uveitis associated with sarcoidosis, steroid-sparing IA may be required to achieve quiescence. MTX has been most often used; additional non-biologic therapies might also be applicable.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: Current management and emerging therapy [^114Vptzr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Uveitis, a group of conditions characterized by intraocular inflammation, is a major cause of sight loss in the working population. Most uveitis cases in Western countries are noninfectious and appear to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory in nature, requiring treatment with immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory drugs.

In this educational review, we outline the ideal characteristics of drugs for uveitis and review the data to support the use of and emerging therapies in this context. It is crucial that we continue to develop new therapies for use in uveitis that aim to suppress disease activity, prevent the accumulation of damage, and preserve visual function for patients with the minimum possible side effects.

### Ocular manifestations of sarcoidosis in a South Florida population [^114YygUR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

To describe the ocular manifestations of sarcoidosis in a South Florida population and identify risk factors for the presence of ocular disease, a retrospective consecutive case series was conducted.

- **Methods**: Medical charts of individuals with sarcoidosis seen in the University of Miami pulmonary department were reviewed for ocular disease. Odds ratios were used to identify risk factors for ocular sarcoidosis.

- **Results**: Fourteen of 108 individuals with sarcoidosis had ocular involvement. The mean age of the 14 individuals was 56 ± 15 years. Seventy-one percent were female, 50% were Black, and 21% were Hispanic. Twelve had uveitis, of which panuveitis was the most common subtype. Five had ≤ 20/70 vision in at least one eye due to uveitis. Neurosarcoidosis was a risk factor for ocular sarcoidosis (OR 6.14, p = 0.03, 95% CI 1.21–31.09).

- **Conclusion**: Ocular manifestations occurred in a minority of individuals in a pulmonary sarcoidosis clinic in South Florida. Uveitis was the most common ocular manifestation. Neurosarcoidosis was a risk factor for ocular involvement.

### Atypical sarcoidosis-associated uveitis: Diagnostic challenges [^112QTeN2]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown aetiology with pulmonary involvement in most patients. Uveitis is common and often characteristic. We report a case of ocular sarcoidosis with grossly atypical contiguous optic neuropathy and choroiditis, and describe the diagnostic challenges in this highly unusual presentation. High-dose systemic corticosteroid and immunosuppressive treatment were required for sustained control of intraocular inflammation.

### Choroidal manifestations of non-ocular sarcoidosis: An enhanced depth imaging OCT study [^114KgE9q]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Although choroidal thickening was reported as a sign of active inflammation in ocular sarcoidosis, there has been no research on the choroidal changes in non-ocular sarcoidosis (defined as systemic sarcoidosis without overt clinical signs of ocular involvement). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate choroidal structural changes in patients with non-ocular sarcoidosis.

- **Methods**: This retrospective case–control study was conducted at Asan Medical Center, a tertiary referral center. We evaluated 30 eyes with non-ocular sarcoidosis and their age- and spherical equivalent-matched healthy control eyes. The subfoveal choroidal thickness, area ratio (Sattler layer-choriocapillaris complex [SLCC] area to Haller layer [HL] area), and choroidal vascularity index (CVI, luminal area to choroidal area) were analyzed using enhanced depth imaging in optical coherence tomography. Systemic and ocular factors associated with the choroidal thickness were investigated.

- **Results**: Compared with the healthy control group, the non-ocular sarcoidosis group had significantly thicker subfoveal choroid (total and all sublayers [SLCC and HL]) and lower area ratio. There were no significant differences in the CVIs at all sublayers between groups. In the non-ocular sarcoidosis group, eyes under oral steroid treatment had thinner choroid than eyes under observation. In the control group, eyes with older age and more myopic spherical equivalent had thinner choroidal thickness.

- **Conclusion**: Total and all sublayers of the subfoveal choroid were significantly thicker without significant vascular changes in non-ocular sarcoidosis patients compared to healthy controls.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: challenges and solutions [^112zJ2jh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Ocular disease is an important manifestation of sarcoidosis and can lead to significant visual disability or blindness if not adequately or promptly treated. A wide variation in clinical presentation renders this entity one of the most challenging to diagnose and manage, usually requiring a multidisciplinary approach. With the ever-growing spectrum of available and emerging therapies targeting different aspects of the granuloma-formation pathway, successfully managing ocular sarcoidosis is becoming more achievable.

Although corticosteroids have traditionally been the cornerstone of treatment, appropriate escalation to steroid-sparing medications is crucial to avert significant side effects from prolonged or high-dose intake. Corticosteroid-sparing options have expanded over recent years to include intravitreal therapy and biologic modifiers. Systemic immunomodulators are currently the second-line treatment when a steroid-sparing option is required.

- **TNFα inhibitors**: These are gaining ground rapidly, with randomized controlled studies generating more robust evidence on safety and efficacy in disease remission. Adalimumab is the first anti-TNFα agent with FDA approval for use in active and inactive refractory cases of uninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis through two large successful Phase III studies, introducing a new era in intraocular inflammation management.

Along with a better understanding of the mechanisms of the granulomatous inflammation in sarcoidosis comes the need for a targeted treatment approach.

### Extrapulmonary sarcoidosis with a focus on cardiac, nervous system, and ocular involvement [^1134Q3rZ]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

OS is usually associated with a favorable outcome, with most patients experiencing mild or no permanent visual impairment. One series of 83 patients reported that 60% of cases achieved complete recovery of vision, and none developed blindness (< 20/400 visual acuity). However, severe visual impairment (defined as best-corrected visual acuity < 20/200 in at least one eye) occurs in 2–10% of sarcoid patients with uveitis. Factors associated with a worse visual prognosis include advanced age, Black race, female gender, posterior segment uveitis, cystoid macular edema, multifocal choroiditis, persistent ocular inflammation, and glaucoma. Unfortunately, OS is generally chronic, with approximately 90% of patients demonstrating chronic uveitis. Close follow-up and compliance with a medication regimen are needed to achieve treatment success, as a small case series of OS demonstrated the mean duration of the patients' active disease was six years.

- **Important questions for future research in extrapulmonary sarcoidosis**: Small studies involving imaging to assess cardiac sarcoidosis (CaS) include CMR and 18 FDG-PET/CT, which suggest these methods may help with diagnosis and treatment efficacy. Unfortunately, patients' insurance rarely covers these expensive imaging modalities. Thus, appropriately designed and powered clinical trials are needed to determine their impact on diagnosis, prognosis, and responsiveness to treatment. Additionally, the most effective treatment for nervous system sarcoidosis (NS) has not been established. Therefore, multicenter RCTs involving NS at centers of excellence are needed to evaluate the most effective therapies.

### Long-term corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppression for cardiac sarcoidosis [^115toAQv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In this context, answering two key questions could help clarify the utility of different treatment regimens and ultimately design appropriate randomized trials: (1) Are steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents effective for maintaining long-term disease quiescence in cardiac sarcoidosis (CS)? (2) In patients with adequate disease control, what is the likelihood of disease recurrence after discontinuation of immunosuppression? The goal of this study is to address these two questions using a retrospective, single-center series of patients who were treated for newly diagnosed CS with short-duration high dose corticosteroids followed by long-term methotrexate with or without adalimumab. A subset of these patients chose to discontinue immunosuppression after achieving remission, permitting us to evaluate the frequency of clinical and radiologic CS recurrence after cessation of immunosuppression therapy.

### Sympathetic ophthalmia: Where do we currently stand on treatment strategies [^117CRPch]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

Earlier indications of immunomodulators in sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) included cases where there is a contraindication for steroid use, the occurrence of significant steroid-induced side effects, flare-ups on tapering or stopping of steroid therapy, or cases that do not respond adequately to steroid therapy. A large multicenter retrospective case series noted that 70.7% of 130 SO patients needed immunosuppressive therapy.

However, many authors recommend that SO is one of the few indications in which early initiation of immunomodulators should be considered. This would enable achieving an adequate effect of immunomodulators before the steroids are tapered to low levels. Owing to the significant toxicities of these agents, close monitoring is necessary, preferably in consultation with a rheumatologist or internist.

### Sarcoidosis [^112G2Wdw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis has a multitude of manifestations and affects the human body widely. Pulmonary complaints are most common; however, cardiac, optic, and neurologic manifestations carry high mortality and morbidity. Acute presentations in the emergency room can cause life-altering effects if not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Generally, less severe cases of sarcoidosis have a favorable prognosis and can be treated with steroid therapy. Resistant and more severe cases of the disease carry high mortality and morbidity. It is incredibly important to arrange specialty follow-up for these patients when needed. This review focuses on the acute presentations of sarcoidosis.

### Granuloma-like formation in deeper retinal plexus in ocular sarcoidosis [^113sGA9J]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multi-system disease characterized by the presence of non-caseating epithelioid granulomas in affected tissues and is the most frequent cause of noninfectious uveitis in Japan. Ocular manifestations of sarcoid uveitis vary enormously and are commonly characterized by granulomatous anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, and posterior uveitis, such as retinal periphlebitis, choroiditis, optic nerve granuloma, and papillitis. However, case reports of multiple granuloma formations related to sarcoid uveitis are uncommon. This report describes the use of optical coherence tomography angiography to visualize changes occurring in granuloma formation in the deeper retinal plexus before and after systemic corticosteroid treatment.

### Hit-hard and early versus step-up treatment in severe sarcoidosis [^1155K31s]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Immunomodulatory drugs such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and leflunomide can be used as steroid-sparing options in sarcoidosis, with methotrexate being used most often. Methotrexate was recently found to be effective in up to 80% of pulmonary sarcoidosis patients. However, an upfront approach for methotrexate or other steroid-sparing medications in sarcoidosis is not yet supported by rigorous evidence.

A Delphi consensus study on sarcoidosis treatment revealed large variations in treatment regimens but emphasized the use of immunomodulators such as methotrexate in cases likely to require prolonged treatment or as a steroid-sparing option in patients at high risk of steroid toxicity. The Delphi study does not provide firm guidance on exactly when to initiate methotrexate (e.g. upfront as monotherapy, upfront together with steroids, or after the inability to taper steroids). However, it is notable that a patient-reported outcome study in sarcoidosis patients reported side effects in 78% of prednisone-treated patients versus 49% of methotrexate-treated patients.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: Challenges and solutions [^1119EQyk]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

When corticosteroids and cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy fail to produce complete and sustainable remission, or in cases of intolerance, the relatively novel option of biologic-response modifiers is often considered. These are recombinant proteins or antibodies regarded as targeting specific molecules or cytokines involved in the inflammatory cascade of the disease pathway. A fundamental feature of these agents is specifically targeted suppression of the immunoeffector responses that are accountable for damaging tissue.

The advent of biologic agents and the recent FDA approval of adalimumab for uninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis has been a game changer in the field of uveitis management. While antimetabolites have been established as steroid-sparing agents without necessarily being more potent, biologic therapy offers an equally or more efficacious choice for chronic disease, capable of inducing complete and prolonged quiescence. In ocular sarcoidosis, where systemic therapy holds an important place in achieving control of inflammation, biologic agents are becoming an increasingly popular choice.

Although growing evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the use of biologic agents is gradually coming to light with promising results, due to limited long-term safety and efficacy data, these agents remain a second-line treatment choice among uveitis experts, reserved for use if and when antimetabolites fail to induce and sustain remission.

### ERS clinical practice guidelines on treatment of sarcoidosis [^1114kZyn]. The European Respiratory Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of sarcoidosis, and specifically the management of neurosarcoidosis, the ERS 2021 guidelines recommend considering the addition of infliximab for patients with neurosarcoidosis who are treated with corticosteroids and a second-line agent (such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil) but continue to have the disease.

### Corticosteroid treatment in sarcoidosis [^111B3Dtp]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

At present, there is no curative treatment for sarcoidosis. Immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulatory drugs can, however, be used for controlling the disease. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of therapy. They function by suppressing the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are involved in cell-mediated immune responses and granuloma formation. Only in a select group of patients is it justifiable to use these drugs, after careful evaluation of the pros and cons. Importantly, disease severity, such as threatened organ functions, and not disease activity itself, should be the deciding factor in this process.

In the case of parenchymal involvement, there is substantial evidence that corticosteroids can improve respiratory symptoms and chest radiography and lung function parameters over 6–24 months. Other generally acknowledged (empirical) criteria for systemic treatment include neurological, cardiac, and sight-threatening ocular involvement and hypercalcemia. Remarkably, despite over 50 years of use, there is no proof of long-term survival benefit from corticosteroid treatment. In addition, there are still no data regarding the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy. One of the weightiest questions remaining is whether or not these drugs can prevent scarring in patients with a fibrogenic phenotype.

As new agents, including infliximab and thalidomide, enter the stage and new diagnostic tools are now available, there is clearly a momentum to design multicentric randomized controlled trials with a long enough follow-up (over five years) to answer these critical questions.

### Sarcoidosis [^113S84tR]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause affecting young and middle-aged adults. Patients commonly present with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, and ocular and skin lesions. The heart, liver, spleen, salivary glands, muscles, bones, kidneys, and central nervous system may also be involved. Diagnosis is based on clinicoradiologic findings, histologic evidence of noncaseating epithelioid granulomas, and exclusion of other granulomatous diseases. Prognosis correlates with mode of onset, host characteristics, initial clinical course, and extent of disease.

The optimal management of sarcoidosis has not been well defined. Although corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment, there is little evidence for the optimal initiation, dosage, or duration of therapy. Topical steroids may be considered for the treatment of anterior uveitis and skin lesions. Systemic steroids are indicated for the treatment of cardiac, nervous system, severe ocular, and symptomatic or progressive pulmonary involvement. There is little evidence for the efficacy of inhaled steroids. Cytotoxic agents and immunomodulators are usually reserved for treatment of complex or refractory disease. Of these agents, methotrexate is used more frequently because of its safety profile and possible steroid-sparing effects. Antimalarial agents are used frequently for skin lesions, and they have limited success in the treatment of pulmonary disease. Lung and cardiac transplantation is reserved for end-stage disease. Monitoring for symptoms of drug toxicity is essential.

### Granuloma-like formation in deeper retinal plexus in ocular sarcoidosis [^11251oyj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

A 74-year-old female with recently diagnosed biopsy-supported systemic sarcoidosis involving the lungs presented with decreased vision and metamorphopsia in the right eye over a six-month period. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 10/20 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Fundus examination of the right eye was unremarkable (Figure 1A). En face OCT angiography demonstrated small round areas of hyperreflectivity in the deeper capillary plexus of the right eye, likely to be granuloma lesions (Figure 1B and C). However, the superficial capillary plexus appeared to be within normal limits (Figure 1D).

At a two-month follow-up after systemic corticosteroid treatment, OCT angiography of the affected right eye showed resolution of these lesions, and BCVA was 20/20 in the right eye. The patient has provided written informed consent for the publication of the case details. This case report did not require Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee approval.

- **Case report**: A 74-year-old woman presented with a six-month history of ocular sarcoidosis. Fundus examination of the right eye was unremarkable (A). On spectral-domain OCT and 3×3 mm macular cube OCT angiography conducted in the right eye, granulomatous-like lesions were evident in the deeper retinal plexus (B, C: yellow arrow), but not in the superficial plexus (D). After systemic corticosteroid treatment, these lesions resolved completely (E).

### Rare presentation of sarcoidosis with optic neuropathy and third nerve palsy [^114YUQtJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic, idiopathic, and granulomatous disease, which most commonly affects the skin, lungs, and lymph nodes but can affect virtually any organ. Neurosarcoidosis can be the presenting or the only clinical manifestation, accounting for 5%-15% of sarcoid diagnoses. In contrast to uveitis, which is the most common ophthalmic manifestation, neuro-ophthalmic signs are uncommon in sarcoidosis. Optic neuropathy is the most common neuro-ophthalmic sign, occurring in 70% of cases in one series. Sarcoid-related optic neuropathy commonly presents with a picture similar to optic neuritis. Less commonly, optic nerve involvement occurs secondary to compressive lesions or from direct granulomatous infiltration. Neuroimaging is crucial to identify the location of the lesion. We describe a case of sarcoid-related compressive optic neuropathy and third nerve palsy and highlight the challenging nature of neurosarcoidosis in a patient without a prior diagnosis of the disease.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114AnZJG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: Should patients with sarcoidosis who do not have ocular symptoms undergo screening for ocular sarcoidosis by routine eye examination?

- **Rationale for question**: Sarcoidosis can involve almost every portion of the eye, including the orbit, anterior and posterior chambers, lacrimal gland, sclera, and conjunctiva. Uveitis and retinal involvement are the most concerning manifestations because they can result in blindness and are not typically apparent on a routine physical examination. Some patients present with uveitis as their initial clinical manifestation. The prevalence of ocular involvement varies by sex and race, with higher rates noted in women, Japanese, and persons of African descent. The diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis is based on a combination of signs and tests, often not sought until symptoms develop. The committee asked whether patients with sarcoidosis without ocular symptoms should undergo ophthalmologic screening for ocular sarcoidosis.

- **Summary of evidence**: Our systematic review identified 582 potentially relevant articles; the full text of 25 was reviewed and 18 were selected. None of the studies compared eye exams to no eye exams; all were nonrandomized studies that enrolled patients with extraocular sarcoidosis and reported the frequency of abnormal eye exams and other outcomes. Although the question is intended for patients with sarcoidosis without ocular symptoms, all studies included patients with and without ocular symptoms. Eye exams identified abnormalities consistent with ocular sarcoidosis in 26% (95% CI, 23–29%) of patients.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: challenges and solutions [^111RTEeW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

The management of ocular sarcoidosis, especially intraocular inflammation in the form of uveitis, which is by far the most common and serious presentation, has traditionally been challenging for ophthalmologists due to the complexity of the disease, difficulty in reaching a diagnosis, and lack of a standardized algorithm. A stepwise approach is usually recommended, with sight-threatening situations requiring a more aggressive therapeutic scheme. Corticosteroids, either topical (eyedrops, periocular, intraocular injections) or systemic, have been the cornerstone of ocular sarcoidosis management for many decades and continue to be pivotal. However, in recent years, the introduction of immunomodulators and more contemporary biologic agents has tremendously altered the landscape in managing ocular sarcoidosis, establishing a new era in the successful treatment of many inflammatory ocular diseases.

We conducted a review of the recent literature from the last 5 years (September 2012–September 2017) regarding treatment modalities in chronic ocular sarcoidosis, including available topical and systemic therapies. We searched PubMed for all published literature on the management of chronic sarcoid-related eye disease, focusing mainly on the principal manifestation of intraocular inflammation (uveitis). All clinical studies reported the employment of topical, periocular, and intraocular systemic corticosteroids, systemic immunomodulatory therapy (alkylating agents, antimetabolites), and biologic agents (anti-TNFα monoclonal antibodies).

### Programmed cell death 1 blockade in the setting of severe ocular sarcoidosis: Cancer immunotherapy in a patient with autoimmunity [^116ZWn2F]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

It is estimated that more than 15,000 patients die from cSCC annually in the United States. Fortunately, anti–PD-1 agents have greatly improved outcomes in patients with advanced and metastatic cSCC, leading to high rates of objective responses, which tend to be durable. Unfortunately, clinical trials of ICIs typically exclude patients receiving long-term systemic immunosuppression for AID or organ transplant, due to concerns for decreased efficacy and increased toxicity.

In our patient with severe ocular sarcoidosis, there was major concern for vision loss with PD-1 inhibitor initiation. However, as our patient's cSCC continued to progress with multiple cutaneous and lung metastases, the risk of death from cSCC far outweighed the risk of sarcoidosis exacerbation. Fortunately, our patient experienced durable benefit with an ongoing impressive response for more than two years and without exacerbation of the underlying AID, demonstrating that the use of ICIs may be safe in a subset of patients with AID.

Several studies have recently shown the feasibility of using ICIs in patients with AID or allografts, although close monitoring is warranted in these high-risk patients as they are likely to require aggressive management of IRAEs. It is important that clinical decisions regarding ICI use in patients at high risk of IRAEs are implemented following a thorough and personalized risk-benefit analysis in each patient's unique clinical context.

### Extrapulmonary sarcoidosis with a focus on cardiac, nervous system, and ocular involvement [^112mieeo]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a poorly understood granulomatous disease that involves the lungs and/or intrathoracic lymph nodes in more than 90% of cases. Although pulmonary sarcoidosis is the leading cause of mortality in this disease, this review focuses on three sites of extrapulmonary involvement (heart, nervous system, and eyes) since involvement of any of these sites can be catastrophic, leading to death, debilitation, or blindness.

Patients with cardiac, ocular, and neurosarcoidosis necessitate a multidisciplinary approach with careful and long-term follow-up. Prompt diagnosis with imaging and/or biopsy and treatment is required to avoid irreversible damage. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy and are often associated with rapid and durable remissions. Immunosuppressive or biologic agents are reserved for patients failing or experiencing side effects from steroids. Managing sarcoidosis requires vigilance, judgment, and awareness of the vagaries of this fascinating disease.

### Toxicity risk from glucocorticoids in sarcoidosis patients [^115PabbU]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids (GC) are considered first-line therapy for treating sarcoidosis, but there are few data about the adverse consequences of GC. Although there are several steroid-sparing medications available for treatment, a large proportion of patients are treated with prolonged courses of GC. The toxicities of GC in sarcoidosis populations have not been carefully evaluated.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all newly diagnosed sarcoidosis patients who had the entirety of their medical care in a single health system. We analyzed the time to development of a composite toxicity endpoint, including diabetes, hypertension, weight gain, hyperlipidemia, low bone density, and ocular complications of GC using Cox proportional hazards analysis.

- **Results**: One hundred and five patients were ever treated with GC, whereas 49 were not treated during a median follow-up of 101 months. GC-treated patients developed 1.3 ± 1.1 toxicities during therapy, versus 0.6 ± 1.0 in the non-treated group. After adjustment for age, gender, race, and preexisting conditions, the hazard ratio for ever-treated patients was 2.37 (1.34–4.17) for the composite endpoint. Age and the presence of preexisting conditions also were associated with reaching the endpoint. Similar effects were seen when analyzed for cumulative GC dose and for duration of GC use. For individual endpoints, weight gain (HR 2.04) and new hypertension (HR 3.36) were associated with any use of GC.

- **Conclusions**: Our data suggest that GC are associated with clinically important toxicities in sarcoidosis patients.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: Current management and emerging therapy [^1155JmFM]. Clinical ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Uveitis, a group of conditions characterized by intraocular inflammation, is a major cause of sight loss in the working population. Most uveitis seen in Western countries is noninfectious and appears to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory in nature, requiring treatment with immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory drugs. In this educational review, we outline the ideal characteristics of drugs for uveitis and review the data to support the use of emerging therapies in this context. It is crucial that we continue to develop new therapies for use in uveitis that aim to suppress disease activity, prevent accumulation of damage, and preserve visual function for patients with the minimum possible side effects.

### Ophthalmologic assessments in patients with newly diagnosed sarcoidosis: An observational study from a universal healthcare system [^1175Ggrw]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Consensus guidelines for the management of sarcoidosis recommend screening eye examinations for all patients, even those without ocular symptoms. We aimed to determine the proportion of sarcoidosis patients who complete ophthalmologic evaluations and the factors associated with their performance.

- **Methods**: We identified patients with sarcoidosis using population health services data from Ontario, Canada, between 1991 and 2019. Sarcoidosis was defined by having ≥ 2 physician visits for sarcoidosis within a two-year period. Ophthalmologic evaluations were based on an optometrist or ophthalmologist visit within the year prior or two years following the diagnosis. We estimated correlations between the number of eye care professionals and the proportion of sarcoidosis patients completing ophthalmologic assessments within regional health units. We evaluated associations between ophthalmologic screening and patient characteristics using multivariable logistic regression.

- **Results**: We identified 21,679 patients with sarcoidosis in Ontario. An ophthalmologic evaluation was performed in 14,751 (68.0%), with a similar number of individuals seeing ophthalmologists and optometrists (43.7% vs. 42.2%). The percentage of sarcoidosis patients undergoing ophthalmologic evaluation within corresponding regional health units was moderately correlated with the number of practicing ophthalmologists (r = 0.64, p = 0.01) but not with the number of optometrists (r = 0.08, p = 0.77). Patients who were older [OR per year 1.02 (95% CI 1.01–1.02), p < 0.001] and female [OR 1.54 (95% CI 1.44–1.63)] were more likely to complete ophthalmologic evaluations.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: Challenges and solutions [^116Nzq4o]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Overall, the safety and efficacy of the Dex implant have been illustrated in a number of large studies with favorable outcomes in terms of BCVA and central macular thickness improvement in uninfectious uveitis patients; however, recurrence of inflammation and CME post-treatment are the main disadvantages, while raised IOP is usually medically managed. Repeated implants seem to work with the same efficacy, with minimal additional side effects. However, among the limitations of the existing literature are that most studies are retrospective in nature with relatively small samples. Few studies have looked into the long-term effects of the implant, and no studies have investigated the response to treatment according to the underlying etiology of uveitis and concomitant therapy in subgroup analysis. This is particularly important in sarcoidosis cases, where patients usually receive additional systemic therapy.

A sustained-release fluocinolone acetonide (FA) implant in two dosage formulations (0.59 mg and 0.19 mg) has been approved for use in uninfectious posterior uveitis in the US. The MUST trial is the largest randomized comparative trial (RCT) at the time of writing that has investigated the efficacy, safety, and impact on quality of life of the FA implant in comparison with systemic immunosuppression. The implant achieved better outcomes in terms of inflammation control and CME resolution in the short term, but had an increased rate of IOP rise requiring treatment.

### Optic neuropathy associated with systemic sarcoidosis [^114rtQua]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The median (range) length of follow-up was 8 (0–20) years. The median (range) change in visual acuity, defined as the best acuity following treatment even after relapse, was +0.46 (−0.01 to +1.22) in bilateral cases and +0.175 (−0.05 to +1.25) in unilateral cases. The median final acuity in these two groups was 0.7 (0–1.25) and 0.5 (0–1.25).

- **Subacute syndrome**: Those with a subacute syndrome showed a median improvement of +0.225 (range −0.01 to +1.22). In contrast, those in the progressive subgroup showed no improvement in visual acuity with treatment, although there was resolution of meningeal enhancement over time in each case.

- **MRI and treatment correlations**: While there was a suggestion that MRI abnormalities at onset correlated with nadir acuity and improvement following treatment, this was not statistically significant (p > 0.3).

- **Treatment without progressive disease or perineuritis**: 12 patients were treated with IV followed by oral steroids; the median (range) acuity was 0.02 (0–1) and increased to 0.75 (0.02–1), with a median change of +0.3. Those treated with oral steroids at onset showed an increase from 0.1 (0–1) to 0.75 (0–1.25), with a median change of +0.5 (p = 0.77).

- **Relapse incidents**: Relapse occurred in 13 cases, mostly early on. For example, patients treated with 60 mg prednisolone developed recurrence of symptoms and signs at 40 to 20 mg, which settled with an escalation of treatment. Immunosuppressive agents were added in 7 cases — azathioprine in 4 cases, mycophenolate and methotrexate in one each. The patient treated with methotrexate had repeated relapses, which stopped on the immunosuppressive drug.

### Sarcoidosis of the lacrimal gland: The prominence of the differential diagnosis [^111evMht]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease that can involve any organ, with the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin being the most commonly affected. Compatible clinical and imaging features, the identification of non-caseous granulomas on biopsy, and the exclusion of other causes of granulomatous disorders help formulate the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. A bilateral symmetrical hilar lymphadenopathy, together with the typical perilymphatic distribution of nodules, is often visible on high-resolution CT. The average age of onset is 48 years. Ocular sarcoidosis is not rare and is reported in 25% of cases.

Half of the patients with sarcoidosis resolve spontaneously; treatment is only indicated in cases with severe symptoms or signs of organ damage. Classical treatments are based on the use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapies, sometimes combined.

### Overview of neurosarcoidosis: Recent advances [^112WSA7h]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment

Corticosteroids are considered the drug of choice for the treatment of sarcoidosis, with monitoring for potential adverse events such as peptic ulcer disease, systemic fungal infection, active tuberculosis, hypersensitivity, cataract formation, diabetes mellitus, or osteoporosis [reviewed in 1, 20–23, 30, 36, 51, 53, 59]. According to the latest treatment algorithm for neurosarcoidosis (NS) proposed by Nozaki et al. in 2013, with input from Professors Barney Stern and Robert P. Baughman, cranial neuropathy — particularly when nerve VII is affected — should be treated with prednisone at a daily dose of 20–40 mg, decreasing over 1–6 months to the lowest effective dose. If corticosteroids cannot be tapered to less than 10 mg/day of prednisone equivalent within 3–6 months, consideration should be given to higher-dose prednisone and/or alternative agents; symptoms tend to recur at prednisone doses less than 20–25 mg/day [reviewed in 1, 36, 51].

For mild to moderate NS, treatment usually begins with 20–60 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent, decreasing the dosage to the lowest effective dose. Like in cranial neuropathy, if corticosteroids cannot be tapered to less than 10 mg/day of prednisone equivalent within 3–6 months, higher doses of prednisone and/or alternative agents should be considered [reviewed in 20, 36].

In severe NS cases, such as those with altered sensorium, visual loss, weakness, or in situations where oral agents are not effective or NS is refractory, the administration of intravenous methylprednisolone is recommended.

### Extrapulmonary sarcoidosis with a focus on cardiac, nervous system, and ocular involvement [^111jpAv9]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the lack of RCTs, clinical experience strongly supports aggressive treatment with CS (alone or combined with IA) for clinically evident CaS. CS therapy is warranted for every patient with CaS unless specific contraindications exist. IA should be used in cases refractory to or as a CS-sparing agent. Additionally, an ICD is mandatory for patients with severe VA, heart block, or cardiomyopathy. For patients with proven or suspected CaS, we initiate treatment with CS. Symptomatic patients or those with severe VA typically receive a 3-day pulse of intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (500–1000 mg daily), followed by prednisone 40 mg/day for 4 weeks. Prednisone is then tapered to a maintenance dose of 10 mg by 6 months, depending on clinical status. We add an IA — typically methotrexate (MTX) or azathioprine (AZA) — at 6 weeks, but other agents may be considered. At 12 weeks, we sometimes add hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 200 mg once or twice daily. The duration of therapy depends upon the individual case, but we typically maintain low-dose prednisone (5–10 mg daily) with low-dose IA for a minimum of 2–3 years since relapses can be life-threatening and may cause permanent damage. Clinical relapses of CaS require re-treatment with high-dose CS (usually IV pulse methylprednisolone) with or without IA. A multicenter randomized trial to assess efficacy and toxicity associated with standard dose prednisone therapy versus low-dose prednisone plus MTX is in progress.

Favorable responses to tumor necrosis factor antagonists (TNFA) have been cited in patients with CaS.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1174QzoW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The systematic review estimated the prevalence of ocular sarcoidosis to be 26%. The committee was concerned that this estimate is higher than the actual prevalence among the population of interest (patients with sarcoidosis without ocular symptoms), as most patients with ocular abnormalities had ocular symptoms. However, other studies have similarly estimated the prevalence of ocular sarcoidosis to be 20–40%, and one study indicated that some patients with uveitis are asymptomatic. Among Japanese patients, the prevalence may be over 50%.

Regardless of the exact prevalence, the committee concluded that eye exams are required for detection of ocular involvement and are neither harmful nor burdensome; vision is very precious to patients; and treatment may be beneficial in reducing harm, such as reduction of loss of vision. The impact of treatment is based on the committee's clinical experience and the systematic review, which suggested that most treated patients had improvement or stabilization of their visual acuity. However, the systematic review did not target treatment, and, therefore, better evidence about treatment of ocular sarcoidosis may exist. The committee's recommendations also factored in the ancillary benefits of routine eye exams, such as identification of abnormalities that may guide non-immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. for glaucoma) or detection of sarcoidosis treatment-related toxicity (e.g. hydroxychloroquine-induced retinopathy) that could impair vision if not identified.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: challenges and solutions [^115hUYa8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis constitutes one of the leading causes of ocular inflammation. Chronic ocular sarcoidosis can affect any segment of the eye and its adnexa, producing a wide range of clinical manifestations and severity. If left untreated, permanent visual impairment or even blindness may ensue. Treatment approaches vary from topical therapy to systemic agents that induce immunosuppression to different levels according to disease severity.

- **Objective**: To review the published literature on the management options for chronic ocular sarcoidosis and provide a comprehensive list of available treatment strategies, including the newer biologics.

- **Summary**: Ocular disease remains a challenging aspect of sarcoidosis and may even be the presenting sign of the disease. Prompt and effective therapy may reverse visual damage and prevent permanent loss of vision. Because of the complexity of the disease, a multidisciplinary approach is often required, with a view to addressing both the ocular and other systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis. Recent data suggest that achieving overall optimal systemic control is of paramount importance in controlling eye inflammation as well. Cytotoxic immunosuppressive agents for refractory chronic ocular disease, as well as biologic anti-TNFα therapies, have advanced the management of chronic disease and should be considered corticosteroid-sparing strategies before the onset of significant steroid-induced morbidity.

### Ocular sarcoidosis: New diagnostic modalities and treatment [^116tPeHo]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Ocular involvement in sarcoidosis occurs in up to 80% of patients and often manifests before the diagnosis of the underlying systemic disease. Early diagnosis of the underlying disease can lead to better therapeutic outcomes for patients presenting with ocular inflammation. Several ocular findings suggestive of sarcoidosis include granulomatous keratic precipitates, iris nodules, vitreous humor cells known as snowballs and snowbanks, and retinal periphlebitis. High suspicion is crucial for diagnosing sarcoidosis. This review on ocular sarcoidosis primarily focuses on new diagnostic and treatment modalities.

- **Recent findings**: Recent studies have identified potential new diagnostic indicators for ocular sarcoidosis, which include serum profiles and vitreous sample analysis. Advances in ophthalmologic imaging techniques now allow detailed investigation of ocular structures. Results from recent uveitis clinical trials have considered sarcoidosis as an underlying cause and reported positive results.

- **Summary**: Diagnosing ocular sarcoidosis can be challenging. High suspicion is necessary, along with various laboratory and ophthalmic tools, to diagnose ocular sarcoidosis effectively. Multiple treatment options exist, including various biologic agents.

### Optic neuropathy associated with systemic sarcoidosis [^1177WBDW]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Spontaneous improvement occurred, as has been noted previously, although the majority of patients were treated with steroids. Following this, a substantial improvement in vision often took place even after several weeks without treatment. There was no relationship between nadir acuity and final acuity. Relapse occurred in 25% of cases, necessitating recommencement or escalation of treatment. In the majority, this occurred early as steroids were withdrawn. Relapse itself was not a marker of poor visual outcome. Repeated relapse was treated successfully with the addition of immunosuppression.

Six cases (11%) had a more progressive disease course and showed more widespread neurologic involvement, each with evidence for adjacent meningeal inflammation. Visual outcomes in this subgroup were poor, even though the disease process required, in general, a higher and more prolonged dose of steroids, concomitant immunosuppression, and in 2 cases, a requirement for biological agents with refractory disease. Evidence for neurosarcoidosis, defined as the presence of intracranial meningeal enhancement, arose in 16 cases overall — all of those with a progressive course and 10 with a subacute course.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: challenges and solutions [^112puMnZ]. Clinical ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

A number of reports from MUST, a landmark trial in uveitis comparing the FA implant to systemic immunosuppression, disclosed among other results that FA-implant therapy is associated with a clinically important increased risk of glaucoma and cataract, suggesting careful monitoring and early intervention to prevent glaucoma. Based on cost-effectiveness and side-effect considerations, systemic therapy may be indicated as the initial treatment for many bilateral uveitis cases. The FA implant is a reasonable alternative for unilateral cases and when systemic therapy is intolerable or has failed. There is immediate improvement of vision-related quality of life in patients with uninfectious uveitis in the implant group compared to patients receiving systemic therapy.

Sustained-release corticosteroid implants are a promising strategy in managing chronic, refractory cases of sarcoidosis-related uveitis. Different devices with variable duration and side effects are available. More data from well-conducted RCTs are available for the Dex implant in achieving satisfactory control of inflammation with fewer side effects than the FA implants. However, the duration of effect is shorter. Further studies are warranted to determine long-term efficacy, as well as comparative studies between the Dex and FA implants. While steroid implants are a new area in ocular inflammation, the application in sarcoidosis has been limited due to it being a systemic disease and aggressive topical therapy often being replaced by systemic treatment early on during the course of the disease.

### Pulmonary sarcoidosis in a preschool patient [^113Fe72L]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a rare disease, especially in the preschool age group where it usually presents with eye, joint, and skin involvement, sparing the lungs. Multiple treatment regimes have been described, with oral prednisolone being the usual first-line treatment. We describe a case of a 4-year-old boy presenting with pulmonary sarcoidosis with no other organ involvement. The child was successfully managed with pulse intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone and has had a good outcome.

### Choroidal manifestations of non-ocular sarcoidosis: an enhanced depth imaging OCT study [^112TL4dn]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Several reports demonstrated a subsequent decrease in choroid thickness following steroid treatments when initially increased due to intraocular inflammation in conditions such as human leukocyte antigen-B27-related uveitis, Behçet's disease, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. Notably, in this non-ocular sarcoidosis group, steroid treatment also showed a significant association with choroidal thickness; eyes treated with oral steroids had thinner choroids compared with eyes under observation. This choroidal response to steroid treatment may further support that eyes with non-ocular sarcoidosis are under subclinical choroidal inflammation.

Unfortunately, we could not identify serum biomarkers reflecting localized and subclinical choroidal inflammation status in eyes with non-ocular sarcoidosis; choroidal thickness in the non-ocular sarcoidosis group did not show significant association with CRP (an inflammation marker in various inflammatory systemic diseases) or ACE (a biomarker for systemic sarcoidosis, correlated with the granuloma burden and disease severity) levels. Caution is needed in interpreting these results due to a time gap between blood tests and OCT acquisition caused by referral-to-ophthalmologic screening duration (mean 33.38 ± 41.12 days). Further prospective studies, including additional blood test components besides CRP and ACE, are necessary for validation of this issue.

Age and axial length are considered significant factors influencing choroidal thickness, with older age and longer axial length associated with reduced total choroidal thickness.

### Programmed cell death 1 blockade in the setting of severe ocular sarcoidosis: Cancer immunotherapy in a patient with autoimmunity [^111JXc1o]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old White male developed multiple in-transit metastases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in 2020, six years after the removal of the primary infiltrative cSCC on the scalp in 2014. This occurred in the context of long-term systemic immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g/day, from 2014 to 2020) and intermittent courses of high-dose prednisone (up to 40 mg/day) for the treatment of panuveitis due to ocular sarcoidosis. After the diagnosis of recurrent cSCC in 2020, his immunosuppressive regimen was reduced to only prednisone 10 mg every other day.

Over the subsequent two years, he underwent several Mohs procedures for multifocal in-transit metastases and bilateral cervical lymph node dissections for metastases in the right suboccipital lymph node and contralateral left cervical lymph node metastases. He also received courses of radiation therapy to the bilateral scalp and neck regions. Unfortunately, he continued to experience additional loco-regional recurrences in the head and neck region, as well as distant metastases, including a right apical chest wall mass.

In September 2022, the patient was started on pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every three weeks after extensive discussion of the risks and benefits, given his underlying ocular sarcoidosis. Four months later, computed tomography imaging studies showed complete regression of the scalp and cervical lymph node disease and partial regression of the lung metastases, thoracic lymphadenopathy, and right upper chest wall mass. The patient has been receiving pembrolizumab for more than two years with close ophthalmologic monitoring.

### Approach to tapering antisarcoidosis therapy [^111wSTy1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease that commonly affects the lungs. The natural course of the disease and its prognosis vary significantly, ranging from asymptomatic spontaneous remission to progressive disease requiring treatment. Once treatment is initiated, tapering therapy can present challenges.

Corticosteroids are recommended as first-line therapy; however, the optimal regimen and duration of treatment are not well established. Treatment may vary based on disease severity, extrapulmonary involvement, and both physician and patient preferences. This review examines currently recommended regimens, particularly for pulmonary sarcoidosis, and discusses the use of alternative treatments as corticosteroid-sparing agents.

Corticosteroid use is very effective as initial therapy but is associated with significant side effects. An approach to tapering sarcoidosis therapy is not standardized due to the lack of evidence-based data. This review provides guidance based on the available literature.

### Orbitopalpebral and ocular sarcoidosis: What does the ophthalmologist need to know [^116EniFX]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic multisystemic disease of unknown etiology, characterized by non-caseating granulomas. The rate of ocular involvement ranges from 30% to 60% among individuals with sarcoidosis and can vary widely, making diagnosis a challenge for ophthalmologists. Cutaneous manifestations occur in about 22% of sarcoidosis cases, though eyelid involvement is rare. Eyelid swelling and nodules are the most frequent forms of eyelid involvement, yet other findings have been reported. The joint analysis of clinical history, ancillary exams, and compatible biopsy is necessary for diagnosis, alongside the exclusion of other possible conditions. This review aims to describe the different forms of presentations, the clinical reasoning, and treatment options for ocular, eyelid, and orbital sarcoidosis.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: challenges and solutions [^113kLoDj]. Clinical ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Daclizumab (Zenapax; Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD25 portion of the IL2 receptor on activated T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells. The most recent study on the use of daclizumab in sarcoid-related uveitis, among other etiologies, comes from Wroblewski et al, who demonstrated efficacy in the reduction of concomitant immunosuppressive medication, stabilization of VA, and prevention of uveitic flares in most of the 78 cases; however, solid-tumor malignancies were observed in four patients during the 11-year follow-up.

Rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech) is a CD20-directed cytolytic antibody that has proven efficacious in ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, peripheral ulcerative keratitis, and scleritis associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive vasculitis and sarcoidosis, as well as sarcoid-related uveitis. Few data on its use in sarcoid uveitis and systemic sarcoidosis exist in the literature, mainly in the form of case reports or case series, and only one Phase II trial on the safety of the drug in pulmonary sarcoidosis.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: Challenges and solutions [^11262NmN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Due to the remarkable heterogeneity in presentation, clinical findings, and natural history, along with the absence of a unique identifying feature and biomarker, diagnosing sarcoidosis remains a challenge. It is usually based on compatible history and a constellation of clinical findings combined with histological confirmation of nonnecrotizing granulomas in affected tissue and the exclusion of other granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis. In the case of ocular sarcoidosis, biopsies of intraocular tissue to obtain a definitive diagnosis are not performed due to the high risk of visual loss.

In 2009, the International Workshop on Ocular Sarcoidosis published criteria for diagnosing ocular sarcoidosis, identifying seven clinical signs suggestive of ocular sarcoidosis, five laboratory investigations in suspected ocular sarcoidosis, and four levels of certainty of a sarcoid diagnosis. Ocular adnexal involvement is not included in these criteria, as it can theoretically be confirmed by histopathological analysis of the accessible affected lesions. Despite efforts to determine universal diagnostic criteria for correctly recognizing ocular sarcoidosis, diagnosis still poses great difficulties, making sarcoidosis an underrecognized or misclassified disorder.

### Etanercept for refractory ocular sarcoidosis: Results of a double-blind randomized trial [^113UAG5M]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of a tumor necrosis factor receptor antagonist, etanercept, in the treatment of chronic ocular sarcoidosis.

- **Subjects and methods**: Eighteen patients with ocular sarcoidosis and ongoing inflammation in the eyes participated in the study. All patients had received at least 6 months of therapy with methotrexate and were currently receiving corticosteroids. The patients were randomized to receive either etanercept (25 mg subcutaneously twice a week) or a placebo in a double-blind randomized trial. The study monitored treatment for ocular inflammation with systemic and local corticosteroids at the beginning and end of the 6-month treatment period. All patients underwent an ocular examination at the beginning and the end of the study, conducted by one ophthalmologist who was blinded to the treatment assignments.

- **Results**: By the end of the study, three of the patients treated with etanercept and one treated with placebo were using lower doses of corticosteroids. However, three of the patients in the etanercept group and one in the placebo group required higher doses of corticosteroids. The ophthalmology global assessment showed improvement in two of the etanercept-treated patients and three of the placebo-treated patients.

- **Conclusion**: Most patients did not experience a significant improvement in their chronic ocular disease with etanercept therapy.

### Choroidal granulomas in systemic sarcoidosis [^113wbYEn]. Retina (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the clinical course, including the response to therapy, of patients with macular and peripapillary choroidal granulomas secondary to systemic sarcoidosis, a retrospective case study and literature review were conducted. Nine patients with choroidal granulomas were identified. Eight patients had a tissue biopsy confirming sarcoidosis; one was diagnosed based on clinical history and a typical gallium scan. Ocular examinations included fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and visual field examination. Eight patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to look for intracranial granulomas. Treatment consisted of oral prednisone in eight patients, with one also receiving a subconjunctival triamcinolone; one patient received no treatment due to good vision and granuloma location in the nasal retina. Variables studied included visual acuity (VA), response of granulomas to treatment, time to recurrence, and associated anterior segment findings.

Eight of the nine patients had solitary lesions, whereas one had multifocal involvement. The granulomas ranged in size from half to four disk diameters. Eight patients reported blurry vision; one was asymptomatic. All nine patients had hilar adenopathy and/or pulmonary parenchymal disease. No patient had nonocular neurologic symptoms, and in the eight patients who underwent MRI examination, no intracranial granulomas were detected. Of the eyes treated (n = 8), all showed a decrease in the size of the choroidal mass, averaging 4 months of treatment. Two patients experienced complete resolution. The mean follow-up was 29.2 months.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: challenges and solutions [^116hKzj6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis constitutes one of the leading causes of ocular inflammation. Chronic ocular sarcoidosis can affect any segment of the eye and its adnexa, producing a wide range of clinical manifestations and severity. If left untreated, permanent visual impairment or even blindness may ensue. Treatment approaches vary from topical therapy to systemic agents that induce immunosuppression to different levels according to disease severity.

- **Objective**: To review the published literature on the management options for chronic ocular sarcoidosis and provide a comprehensive list of available treatment strategies, including the newer biologics.

- **Summary**: Ocular disease remains a challenging aspect of sarcoidosis and may even be the presenting sign of the disease. Prompt and effective therapy may reverse visual damage and prevent permanent loss of vision. Because of the complexity of the disease, a multidisciplinary approach is often required, with a view to addressing both the ocular and other systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis. Recent data suggest that achieving overall optimal systemic control is of paramount importance in controlling eye inflammation as well. Cytotoxic immunosuppressive agents for refractory chronic ocular disease, as well as biologic anti-TNFα therapies, have advanced the management of chronic disease and should be considered corticosteroid-sparing strategies before the onset of significant steroid-induced morbidity.

### Current treatment of sarcoidosis [^111cZHky]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous systemic disease of unknown cause, with the lung being the most frequently affected organ. Therapeutic management of the disease is challenging, as clinical presentation and prognosis are very heterogeneous. In this review, we summarize the main advances in sarcoidosis therapy.

- **Recent findings**: Sarcoidosis therapies are categorized into three lines: glucocorticoids (first line), immunosuppressants (second line), and biologics (third line). Recent glucocorticoid studies have reported similar efficacy with both high and low doses, though higher doses increase side effects. In the category of immunosuppressants, recent publications on mycophenolate and repository corticotropin injection (RCI) have provided additional information about their use and efficacy. New evidence has also been published regarding the use of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNFα) agents in refractory cardiac sarcoidosis and neurosarcoidosis.

- **Summary**: Sarcoidosis therapy is constantly evolving, with new drugs being added to the recommended treatments. However, extensive clinical trials are still necessary to optimize these recommendations.

### Methotrexate versus conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in the treatment of non-anterior sarcoidosis-associated uveitis [^116Lqm14]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and azathioprine (AZA) in treating non-anterior sarcoidosis-associated uveitis. The retrospective study included cases of non-anterior sarcoidosis-associated uveitis according to the revised International Workshop on Ocular Sarcoidosis criteria. The primary outcome was defined as the median time to relapse or occurrence of serious adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.

A total of 58 patients were included: 33 with MTX, 16 with MMF, and 9 with AZA. The time to treatment failure, i.e. the primary outcome, after adjustment for corticosteroid dose and the presence of vasculitis, was significantly higher with MTX. The median time was 34.5 months with MTX (IQR: 11.8 - not reached) versus 8.4 months (3.1–22.9) with MMF and 16.8 months (8.0–90.1) with AZA (p = 0.020). The risk of relapse at 12 months was more than twice as low with MTX compared to MMF (p = 0.046). Low visual acuity at the last visit was significantly less frequent with MTX, which was observed in 4% of cases compared to 9% in the MMF group and 57% in the AZA group (p = 0.008).

Regarding all 75 lines of treatment (MTX (n = 39), MMF (n = 24), and AZA (n = 12)), MTX demonstrated higher efficacy than MMF and AZA in achieving a treatment response at 3 months (OR 10.85; 95% CI 1.13 to 104.6; p = 0.039). A significant corticosteroid-sparing effect at 12 months (p = 0.035) was only observed under MTX. Serious adverse events were observed in 6 out of 39 (15%) cases with MTX, 5 out of 24 (21%) with MMF, and 2 out of 12 (17%) with AZA.

In conclusion, for non-anterior sarcoidosis-associated uveitis, MTX seems to be more effective in comparison to MMF and AZA.

### Coexistence of open-angle glaucoma and sarcoidosis-associated optic neuropathy [^1135t8Zo]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

The treatment of ocular or neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of sarcoidosis remains empirical, primarily utilizing corticosteroids initially, followed by steroid-sparing immunosuppressants. Methotrexate has been the most widely used steroid-sparing agent for sarcoidosis. Most previous studies have reported good responses to such treatments in patients with neurosarcoidosis involving the optic nerve. However, our case presented contradicting results, which we speculated might have been due to the delayed and insufficient initial dose (0.3 mg/kg/day) of prednisolone administered.

Typically, for pulmonary sarcoidosis, it is suggested to initiate treatment with oral prednisolone at a dose of 20–40 mg/day. However, neurosarcoidosis necessitates a recommended dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg/day or 40 mg/day. It is important to emphasize that when neurosarcoidosis is present, more prolonged higher-dose corticosteroid treatment is required from the outset. Moreover, neurological manifestations caused by acute inflammation respond better to corticosteroids than those caused by chronic fibrotic reactions. Our case, which had a more progressive disease course with sequential bilateral involvement, might have required prolonged high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants from the outset. Additionally, neurosarcoidosis involving the central nervous system is reported to show less treatment response.

Systemic corticosteroid treatment for sarcoidosis can cause steroid-induced IOP elevation or glaucoma based on the dosage, frequency, and duration of corticosteroid use. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor patients closely to mitigate these risks.

### Corticosteroids with or without conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug as first-line therapy in nonanterior sarcoidosis uveitis [^1172VP3D]. Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is one of the leading causes of non-infectious uveitis. Systemic immunosuppressive treatment is required in 45–70% of cases for severe intermediate or posterior uveitis, and relapses are frequent (30–60%) during follow-up. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of systemic corticosteroid therapy alone versus corticosteroid plus conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (Cs-DMARDs) as first-line therapy in patients with non-anterior sarcoidosis uveitis.

- **Design**: We conducted a multicentric retrospective study.

- **Participants**: 163 patients with non-anterior sarcoidosis-related uveitis were included.

- **Intervention**: We compared a first-line therapy with systemic corticosteroid therapy alone (CTC group) (n = 122) versus corticosteroid associated with Cs-DMARD (CTC-DMARD group) (n = 41).

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome was treatment failure-free survival (TFFS), defined by the discontinuation of treatment for inefficiency or the occurrence of relapse.

- **Results**: TFFS at 12 months was 0.83 [95%CI 0.67;0.91] and 0.65 [95%CI 0.55;0.72], respectively, in the CTC-DMARD and CTC group. In multivariable analysis adjusted for multifocal choroiditis and baseline dose of corticosteroids, the TFFS was significantly higher in the CTC-DMARD group compared to the CTC group (hazard ratio (HR) 2.21 [1.18;4.14], p = 0.01). There was a significant steroid-sparing effect at 3 and 6 months (p < 0.05) in the CTC-DMARD group compared to the CTC group. Fourteen (34%) and fifty (41%) patients had at least one adverse event in the CTC-DMARD and CTC groups, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: In non-anterior sarcoidosis uveitis, the combined use of corticosteroids with Cs-DMARDs as first-line therapy results in improved treatment failure-free survival and a steroid-sparing effect compared to corticosteroids alone.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: Challenges and solutions [^115SE5BA]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic idiopathic granulomatous inflammatory disease that was first described by Sir Jonathan Hutchinson in 1878 as a dermatological disorder. It was later, in 1909, that Heerfordt, a Danish ophthalmologist, reported for the first time the uveoparotid-fever syndrome ("Heerfordt syndrome"), thus introducing ocular involvement as a clinical manifestation of sarcoidosis. Known to be a systemic disorder, sarcoidosis affects multiple major organ systems, primarily the lungs in more than 90% of cases, which tend to be in the spotlight of clinical attention. Extrapulmonary disease frequently involves the lymph nodes, skin, eyes, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. Despite being known for more than 100 years, sarcoidosis remains an enigmatic disease, the etiology of which has yet to be resolved, demonstrating a heterogeneous clinical course that often poses a diagnostic and treatment challenge for the treating physician.

The prevalence of this entity varies around the world, and large regional diversities exist. Some of the variability in prevalence and phenotype might relate to differences in surveillance procedures, diagnostic criteria employed by physicians, genetic factors, and exposure to environmental agents. Within Europe, it has been noted that Western Europeans are more commonly affected than Eastern Europeans, with Scandinavians having an incidence as high as 19 per 100,000/year. UK estimates report an annual incidence of five per 100,000 of the population, with an Irish preponderance.

### Recommendations for the management of ocular sarcoidosis from the International Workshop on Ocular Sarcoidosis [^113txXga]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

The study aimed to establish expert recommendations for the management of ocular sarcoidosis (OS).

The methods involved circulating a question-based survey on the management of OS to international uveitis experts, who were members of the International Uveitis Study Group and the International Ocular Inflammation Society. The survey was disseminated electronically. Subsequently, a consensus workshop was conducted at the 7th International Workshop on Ocular Sarcoidosis (IWOS) in June 2019 in Sapporo, Japan, as part of the Global Ocular Inflammation Workshops. Statements on the management of OS that were supported by a two-thirds majority of 10 international panel members of the workshop, after discussion and voting, were taken as consensus agreement.

A total of 98 participants from 29 countries responded to the questionnaire survey. The subsequent consensus workshop established recommendations for the management of OS in five sections:

- **Evaluation and monitoring**: This section concerned the evaluation and monitoring of inflammation.
- **Ocular manifestations and indications for treatment**: The second, third, and fourth sections described ocular manifestations that were indications for treatment, and the management of anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, and posterior uveitis.
- **Systemic treatment**: In the fifth section, the use of systemic corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressive drugs were detailed.

In conclusion, recommendations for the management of OS were formulated through the IWOS consensus workshop.

### Extrapulmonary sarcoidosis with a focus on cardiac, nervous system, and ocular involvement [^114GRMLF]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a poorly understood granulomatous disease that involves the lungs and/or intrathoracic lymph nodes in more than 90% of cases. Although pulmonary sarcoidosis is the leading cause of mortality in this disease, this review focuses on three sites of extrapulmonary involvement: the heart, nervous system, and eyes. Involvement of any of these sites can be catastrophic, leading to death, debilitation, or blindness.

Patients with cardiac, ocular, and neurosarcoidosis necessitate a multidisciplinary approach with careful and long-term follow-up. Prompt diagnosis with imaging and/or biopsy and treatment is required to avoid irreversible damage. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy and are often associated with rapid and durable remissions. Immunosuppressive or biologic agents are reserved for patients failing or experiencing side effects from steroids. Managing sarcoidosis requires vigilance, judgment, and awareness of the vagaries of this fascinating disease.

### The management of sarcoidosis in the 2020s by the primary care physician [^113PhBj7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic granulomatous disease that occurs worldwide and can affect any organ. Because the presenting symptoms of sarcoidosis are not specific to the disease, the primary care physician is usually the first provider to assess these patients. Additionally, patients who have previously been diagnosed with sarcoidosis are typically followed longitudinally by primary care physicians. Therefore, these physicians are often the first to address sarcoidosis patient symptoms related to exacerbations of the disease and to observe complications of sarcoidosis medications. This article outlines the approach to the evaluation, treatment, and monitoring of sarcoidosis patients by the primary care physician.
