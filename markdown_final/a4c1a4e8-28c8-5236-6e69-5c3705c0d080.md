## Question

Leticia, Scarlett, and Percy decide to eat at a Greek restaurant for lunch. The prices for their dishes cost $10, $13, and $17, respectively. If the trio gives the waiter a 10% tip, how much gratuity should the waiter receive in dollars?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to calculate a 10% tip on a restaurant bill totaling $10, $13, and $17, and to express the gratuity in dollars. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about adding the individual meal costs to get the total bill. Then, I should verify the percentage calculation for 10% of that total. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and state the answer clearly with the correct unit.

> Let me first confirm the total cost of the meals. Leticia's dish is $10, Scarlett's is $13, and Percy's is $17, so the sum is $10 + $13 + $17, which equals $40 exactly. Wait, let me verify that addition one more time: 10 plus 13 is 23, and 23 plus 17 is indeed 40, so the pre-tip total is $40.

> Next, I should review the tip calculation. A 10% tip means multiplying the total bill by 0.10, so $40 times 0.10 equals $4.00. Hold on, I should verify the decimal placement: 10% is the same as 0.10, and 40 times 0.10 is 4.0, which is $4.00, so the gratuity is $4.

> I will now examine whether any rounding is needed. The total is a whole number and 10% of 40 is a whole number, so no rounding is necessary. The exact tip amount is $4.00, which I should report as $4 for simplicity in dollars.

> Final answer: The waiter should receive a $4 gratuity.

---

The total bill is $10 + $13 + $17 = **$40**. A 10% tip is **$40 × 0.10 = $4**. Therefore, the waiter should receive **$4** in gratuity.

---

## Calculation of the total bill

Leticia's dish: $10\
Scarlett's dish: $13\
Percy's dish: $17\
Total bill: $10 + $13 + $17 = **$40**

---

## Calculation of the tip

Tip percentage: 10%\
Tip amount: 10% of $40 = 0.10 × $40 = **$4**

---

## Final answer

The waiter should receive **$4** in gratuity.

### Estimating total spending by source of funding on routine and supplementary immunisation activities in low-income and middle-income countries, 2000-17: a financial modelling study [^aecf0edd]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Figure 1 
Total spending on immunisation by financing source, 2000–17

Spending estimates are presented in inflation-adjusted 2019 US dollars. Total spending estimates: $3·2 billion in 2000 and $10·2 billion in 2017. Immunisation spending in low-income and middle-income countries increased from $5·9 billion (95% UI 5·6–6·2) in 2010 to $9·6 billion (9·2–10·1) in 2017, with 55·9% (50·6–60·5) of the increase coming from domestic governments. Error bars denote 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of total spending.

Development assistance was the second largest source of immunisation spending, accounting for 28·2% (95% UI 26·7–29·2), or $31·7 billion, of the total immunisation spending over the study period. Of this, around $13·3 billion was channelled through Gavi, while approximately $18·3 billion was disbursed by other development agencies. In addition to Gavi, UN agencies were the most prominent agencies through which immunisation programmes were funded, with UNICEF accounting for 23·8% ($4·3 billion) of non-Gavi development assistance for health and WHO accounting for 24·4% ($4·4 billion). Bilateral agencies provided a similar amount of funding, at 15·8% ($2·9 billion), whereas the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation disbursed 19·7% ($3·6 billion) directly. Additionally, NGOs disbursed 15·3% ($2·8 billion), and the World Bank disbursed 0·5% ($87·4 million), whereas disbursements from the European Commission, development banks, and US-based charitable and philanthropic foundations accounted for 0·6% ($104·3 million). In 2017 alone, development assistance for immunisation spending was estimated at $3·1 billion, with $1·5 billion from Gavi and $1·6 billion from other channels. The largest share of development assistance that can be traced to a specific geographical region was targeted to sub-Saharan Africa.

Results

We identified 50 387 lawsuits that were filed by 67 Virginia hospitals from June 25, 2018, to September 10, 2020. Of those lawsuits, 33 204 (65.9%) were warrant in debts and 17 183 (34.1%) were wage garnishments. In the preintervention period, there were 30 760 lawsuits, 19 329 warrant in debts, and 11 431 wage garnishments cases filed. In the postintervention period, there were 12 510 lawsuits, 8651 warrant in debts, and 3859 wage garnishments filed (Figure 1). Hospitals sued for a total of $38 700 209 during the preintervention period and $13 960 300 during the postintervention period. Comparing the preintervention period with the postintervention period, there was a 59% decrease in the number of lawsuits filed, a 55% decrease in the number of warrant in debt cases filed, a 66% decrease in the number of wage garnishments filed, and a 64% decrease in the dollar amount pursued in court.

### Getting to 100%: research priorities and unanswered questions to inform the US debate on universal health insurance coverage [^62e54e66]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A majority of Americans favor universal health insurance, but there is uncertainty over how best to achieve this goal. Whatever the insurance design that is implemented, additional details that must be considered include breadth of services covered, restrictions and limits on volumes of services, cost-sharing for individuals, and pricing. In the hopes that research can inform this ongoing debate, we review evidence supporting different models for achieving universal coverage in the US and identify areas where additional research and stakeholder input is needed. Key areas in need of further research include how care should be organized, how costs can be reduced, and what healthcare services universal insurance should cover.

Figure 4 
Factors of change in government health spending per capita, 1995–2016

Change in government health spending per capita by global (A), high-income (B), and low-income and middle-income countries (C), reported in inflation-adjusted 2018 US dollars. Error bars represent uncertainty intervals. Black dots represent the estimated change in government spending per capita. GBD=Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors. GDP=gross domestic product.

Globally, health spending reached $8·0 trillion (95% UI 7·8–8·1) in 2016, $10·3 trillion (10·1–10·6) in purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars, and comprised 8·6% (8·4–8·7) of global GDP in 2016. 81·0% (80·0–81·9) was spent in high-income countries, 15·7% (14·9–16·6) in upper-middle-income countries, 3·0% (2·7–3·3) in lower-middle-income countries, and 0·4% (0·3–0·4) in low-income countries, despite low-income countries comprising 10·0% of the global population. 41·7% (40·9–42·5) of total health spending worldwide was in the USA alone, while the countries of sub-Saharan Africa collectively comprised 1·0% (0·9–1·0) of total health spending. Health spending per capita increased to $1077 (1058–1096), despite significant variation across regions and income groups (figure 1B, table 1). Per capita health spending in high-income countries was $5252 (5184–5319), ranging from $261 (208–326) in the Northern Mariana Islands to $10 802 (9469–12 352) in Bermuda; and $40 (38–43) in low-income countries, ranging from $15 (13–17) in Somalia to $106 (91–124) in Zimbabwe. Disparities persist across geographical regions, with per capita spending ranging from $37 (29–48) in Bangladesh to $84 (69–100) in Bhutan in south Asia, where health spending is the lowest of all regions (table 1).

### Just price for PCSK9 inhibitors: No less, No more [^44e902be]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In summary, if we truly aspire to create a sustainable health system, there must be room for those who raise uncomfortable questions about what will we get for what we pay? For this, Ko et al deserve our deepest appreciation for providing insights on existing gaps between the price and value derived from PCSK9 inhibitors. 6 If these studies can successfully facilitate conversations among stakeholders to agree on the just price for 1‐2% absolute CVD risk reduction, no less, no more, I am confident that the cost of PCSK9 inhibitors will no longer be the top story in 2019.

### Federal and individual spending on the 10 costliest medications in Medicare part D from 2011 to 2015 [^7124631f]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

Access to prescription medications is critical as the U.S. population ages. Escalating drug costs have garnered mounting attention from the public with increasing federal scrutiny. The Medicare Part D program will increasingly be relied upon to support the health of our nation's older people. We reviewed the publically available Medicare Part D usage data from 2011 to 2015 to quantify the cost of the 10 costliest medications for Part D, evaluated the number of beneficiaries treated with these medications, and measured beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs. We observed over the analysis period, an increase in spending for these medications, a reduction in number of patients that received them, with increased out-of-pocket costs for the patient. In 2015 U.S. dollars, the amount Medicare Part D spent on the 10 costliest medications increased from $21.5 billion in 2011 to $28.4 billion in 2015-a 32% increase. The number of beneficiaries who received 1 of the 10 costliest medications fell from 12,913,003 in 2011 to 8,818,471-a 32% drop, with an average annual decrease of 7.9%. Out of pocket spending by patients that use these medications increased over the study period. For beneficiaries without the low-income subsidy, the average out-of-pocket cost share for 1 of the 10 costliest medications increased from $375 in 2011 to $1,366 in 2015-a 264% increase overall and an average 66% increase per year. Specialty medications are a growing portion of the costliest medications. As medication costs continue to escalate, and specialty medications become more common, the U.S. will be increasingly challenged with devising mechanisms to access sustainable, affordable medications for all older adults.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines—the writing committee “recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines,” with the threshold to be “periodically reexamined,” “not be adjusted annually for inflation,” and “revised every 10 years (or sooner …).” Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that “suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY,” a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income (“per capita disposable income of $60 300 … approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY”), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating “$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY,” translating to “$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY” after GDP growth; while “no single method … can be considered the ‘gold standard,’” these three approaches “produced similar results.”

Future

Sustained growth in health spending is expected to continue, with global spending projected to reach $10·6 trillion (95% UI 10·2–10·9) in 2030 and $15·0 trillion (14·0–16·0) in 2050 (table 2, figure 1C, 1D). In purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars, these values are $14·3 trillion (13·7–15·0) in 2030 and $21·3 trillion (19·8–23·1) in 2050. These values are projected to comprise 8·9% (8·4–9·4) of global GDP in 2030 and 9·4% (7·6–11·3) of global GDP in 2050. Despite this growth, health spending is expected to remain skewed, with 69·4% (67·2–71·5) of this spending in countries that are currently considered high-income, 25·1% (23·1–27·1) in upper-middle-income countries, 4·9% (4·4–5·5) in lower-middle-income countries, and only 0·6% (0·6–0·7) in low-income countries, despite low-income countries comprising an estimated 15·7% of the global population by 2050. In per-capita terms, projected total health spending globally is $1264 (1219–1309) per capita in 2030 and $1667 (1567–1767) per capita in 2050 (table 2). Per capita spending in 2030 is projected to be $6313 (6135–6499) for high-income groups, $772 (707–847) for upper-middle-income groups, $121 (108–137) for lower-middle-income groups, and $48 (44–51) for low-income groups. In 2050, this spending is projected to increase to $8286 (7851–8725) for high-income groups, $1435 (1264–1632) for upper-middle-income groups, $200 (176–225) for lower-middle-income groups, and $66 (60–73) for low-income groups (table 2). The fastest growth in per capita health spending is predicted among lower-middle-income countries, with 2·64% (2·28–3·02) annual growth per capita projected between 2017 and 2050, and upper-middle-income countries, with 3·20% (2·84–3·58) annual growth per capita projected between 2017 and 2050 (table 2). Health spending per capita in 2050 is expected to remain the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa ($111 [102–121]) and South Asia ($180 [146–220]).

### Resource utilization for ovarian cancer patients at the end of life: how much is too much? [^fe20bc1f]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

End-of-life (EOL) medical care consumes 10-12% of national health care expenditures and 27% of Medicare dollars annually. Studies suggest that hospice services decrease EOL expenditures by 25-40%. The goal of this study was to compare the total cost of hospital-based resources utilized in ovarian cancer patients during their last 60 days of life for those enrolled in hospice versus those not on hospice.

Methods

Study eligibility included patients who expired from ovarian cancer from 1999 to 2003. Medical records were reviewed for demographic data as well as treatment, response and recurrence rates, histologic type, grade and stage. Billing records were analyzed for costs of inpatient and outpatients visits, including radiologic, laboratory and pharmacy charges. Total cost of hospital resources was compared between patients managed on hospice for >10 days (hospice group) versus <10 days (non-hospice group) using the following methods: Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis and Student's t tests. Overall survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier statistics.

Results

Of the 84 patients analyzed, 67 (79.8%) were in the non-hospice group and 17 (20.2%) were in the hospice group. Demographic, histologic and staging characteristics as well as platinum sensitivity were similar between the two groups before the last 60 days of life. Mean number of chemotherapy cycles before the study period was also similar (20.4 and 21.0, respectively). However, during the study period, the mean total cost per patient in the non-hospice group was dollar 59,319 versus dollar 15,164 in the hospice group (P = 0.0001). A significant difference in cost was noted for mean inpatient days (dollar 6584 vs. dollar 1629, P = 0.0007), radiology (dollar 6063 vs. dollar 2343, P = 0.003), laboratory (dollar 12,281 vs. dollar 2026, P = 0.0004) and pharmacy charges (dollar 13,650 vs. dollar 4465, P = 0.0017) as well as for treating physician per patient (dollar 112,707 vs. dollar 34,677, P = 0.04). Overall survival for the two groups was the same.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that there is a significant cost difference with no appreciable improvement in survival between ovarian cancer patients treated aggressively versus those enrolled in hospice at the EOL. These data suggest that earlier hospice enrollment is beneficial. Furthermore, cost variations between physicians and patients imply that education may be an important variable.

### Trends in clinical research including Asian American, native hawaiian, and pacific islander participants funded by the US National Institutes of Health, 1992 to 2018 [^225750f2]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Overall Trends Over Time

Figure 2 A shows the dollar amounts for AA/NHPI clinical research grants over time. Total AA/NHPI dollars ($775 536 121) composed 0.17% of the overall NIH expenditures ($451 284 075 000) between 1992 and 2018, and 0.18% ($677 479 468) of the NIH research budget after 2000. In all, AA/NHPI-only and AA/NHPI plus non-AA/NHPI dollar amounts made up 0.10% ($362 547 841) and 0.09% ($314 931 627) of the total NIH expenditures after 2000, respectively (eTable 2 in the Supplement). There was a statistically significant positive trend in total AA/NHPI funding dollars between 1992 and 2018 (estimated dollar amount, $12 860 000; 95% CI, $9 215 000-$16 504 000; P <.001), but the proportion of the total NIH budget has only increased from 0.12% before 2000 to 0.18% after 2000, with no difference in funding before vs after 2000 (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Compared with funding before 2000, there was a statistically significant increase in funding amounts after 2000 for AA/NHPI-only projects (estimated dollar amount, $92 962 000; 95% CI, $13 756 000-$172 167 000; P =.02), while funding amounts for AA/NHPI plus non-AA/NHPI significantly decreased after 2000 (estimated dollar amount, −$115 265 000; 95% CI, −$183 009 000 to −$47 521 000; P <.001) (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^4f494f4f]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Contemporary debates about drug pricing feature several widely held misconceptions, including the relationship between incentives and innovation, the proportion of total healthcare spending on pharmaceuticals, and whether the economic evaluation of a medicine can be influenced by things other than clinical efficacy.

Main Body

All citizens should have access to timely, equitable, and cost-effective care covered by public funds, private insurance, or a combination of both. Better managing the collective burden of diseases borne by today's and future generations depends in part on developing better technologies, including better medicines. As in any innovative industry, the expectation of adequate financial returns incentivizes innovators and their investors to develop new medicines. Estimating expected returns requires that they forecast revenues, based on the future price trajectory and volume of use over time. How market participants decide what price to set or accept can be complicated, and some observers and stakeholders want to confirm whether the net prices society pays for novel medicines, whether as a reward for past innovation or an incentive for future innovation, are commensurate with those medicines' incremental value. But we must also ask "value to whom?"; medicines not only bring immediate clinical benefits to patients treated today, but also can provide a broad spectrum of short- and long-term benefits to patients, their families, and society. Spending across all facets of healthcare has grown over the last 25 years, but both inpatient and outpatient spending has outpaced drug spending growth even as our drug armamentarium is constantly improving with safer and more effective medicines. In large part, this is because, unlike hospitals, drugs typically go generic, thus making room in our budgets for new and better ones, even as they often keep patients out of hospitals, driving further savings.

Conclusion

A thorough evaluation of drug spending and value can help to promote a better allocation of healthcare resources for both the healthy and the sick, both of whom must pay for healthcare. Taking a holistic approach to assessing drug value makes it clear that a branded drug's value to a patient is often only a small fraction of the drug's total value to society. Societal value merits consideration when determining whether and how to make a medicine affordable and accessible to patients: a drug that is worth its price to society should not be rendered inaccessible to ill patients by imposing high out-of-pocket costs or restricting coverage based on narrow health technology assessments (HTAs). Furthermore, recognizing the total societal cost of un- or undertreated conditions is crucial to gaining a thorough understanding of what guides the biomedical innovation ecosystem to create value for society. It would be unwise to discourage the development of new solutions without first appreciating the cost of leaving the problems unsolved.

### Trends in hospital lawsuits filed against patients for unpaid bills following published research about this activity [^ba05f44a]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Suing patients and garnishing their wages for unpaid medical bills can be a predatory form of financial activity that may be inconsistent with the mission of a hospital. Many hospitals in the state of Virginia were discovered to be suing patients for unpaid medical bills, as first presented in a 2019 research article that launched 2.5 months of media attention on hospital billing practices and a grassroots public demand for hospitals to stop the practice.

Objective

To evaluate the association of a research publication and subsequent media coverage with the number of hospital lawsuits filed against patients for unpaid medical bills.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study of Virginia hospitals that sued patients for unpaid medical bills used an interrupted time series analysis. Data on hospitals suing patients for unpaid medical bills were collected during a preintervention period (June 25, 2018, to June 24, 2019), an intervention period (June 25, 2019, to September 10, 2019), and a postintervention period (September 11, 2019, to September 10, 2020).

Exposures

Publication of a research article and subsequent media coverage.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The total number of warrant in debt and wage garnishment lawsuits filed by Virginia hospitals and the frequency of those lawsuits filed before, during, and after the intervention period on a weekly basis.

Results

A total of 50 387 lawsuits, filed by 67 Virginia hospitals, were included; 33 204 (65.9%) were warrant in debt lawsuits, and 17 183 (34.1%) were wage garnishment lawsuits. From the preintervention period to the postintervention period, there was a 59% decrease in the number of lawsuits filed (from 30 760 lawsuits to 12 510 lawsuits), a 55% decrease in the number of warrant in debt cases filed (from 19 329 to 8651), a 66% decrease in the number of wage garnishments filed (from 11 431 to 3859), and a 64% decrease in the dollar amount pursued in court (from $38 700 209 to $13 960 300). During the study period, 11 hospitals banned the practice of suing patients for unpaid medical bills. The interrupted time series analysis showed a significant decrease of 5% (incidence rate ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.96) in the total weekly number of lawsuits in the postintervention period.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that research leading to public awareness can shift hospital billing practices.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^39127231]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cost/value methodology—U.S. cost-effectiveness thresholds and guideline recommendation are as follows: Empirical updates suggest a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY, with other demand-side approaches yielding willingness to pay of approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY based on a per capita disposable income of $60 300, and an alternative US estimate of $95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY corrected to $112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY. Given the available evidence, the consensus of the writing committee is to recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines, which should be periodically reexamined, should not be adjusted annually for inflation, and should be revised every 10 years or sooner in case of large shocks to the United States health care economy that cause a substantial shift in health care costs.

### Ethical perspectives on costly drugs and health care: AAN position statement [^4b1e094c]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Drug pricing ethics—price justifications, examples, and development attrition are detailed, noting that “Pharmaceutical companies commonly defend high prices in the United States compared to other countries by arguing that higher prices are necessary to recoup research and development costs,” yet “a 2017 study of revenues from the top 20 selling drugs found that the difference in price (non–United States vs United States) for these drugs alone would allow companies to recoup all their research & development costs with $40 billion leftover for profit.” Illustrative price points include Daraprim being raised “from $13.50 to $750 per pill,” sofosbuvir “priced at $1,000 a pill, with a course of treatment costing $84,000,” and an international comparison where “the list price for 12 weeks of treatment in India was only $539.” Development risk is highlighted by “Only 1 in 10 drugs entering phase I trials will ultimately win approval.”

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Intervention costs—given pricing complexity, high-quality economic evaluations “should incorporate an estimate of net price to the payer after discounts or rebates in their base-case analysis,” ideally reflecting “the net price to the payer or payers for the entire or majority of the treatment-eligible population being evaluated, rather than a specific subpopulation.”

### Cost-effectiveness analysis for clinicians [^6438d463]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The current economic news is bad. Expenditure on health care is under scrutiny in every country and with predictions of another economic crash comes pressure on the funding of health care systems - systems that, according to the World Health Organizationare meant to deliver quality service to all people, when and where they need them.

At the same time, new products - pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tests, new technologies - continue to be developed and launched. Health care systems are under pressure to pay for all of the potential hope that these provide, sometimes with good reason, sometimes without. This is where cost-effectiveness analysis comes in.

### Projected effects of proposed cuts in federal medicaid expenditures on medicaid enrollment, uninsurance, health care, and health [^e22afd18]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In January 2025, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives' Budget Committee offered a list of possible spending reductions to offset revenue losses from proposed tax cuts. In May, the Committee advanced a bill incorporating several reductions on the list. The Committee estimated that the 6 largest potential Medicaid cuts (for example, work requirements for some Medicaid enrollees) would each reduce the federal government's Medicaid outlays by at least $100 billion over 10 years. On the basis of the Committee's estimates of savings; Congressional Budget Office analyses; and peer-reviewed studies of the coverage, financial, and health impacts of past Medicaid expansions and contractions, the authors project the likely effects of each option and of the House bill advanced by the Budget Committee in May.

Each option individually would reduce federal Medicaid outlays by between $100 billion and $900 billion over a decade, increase the ranks of the uninsured by between 600000 and 3900000 and the annual number of persons forgoing needed medical care by 129060 to 838890, and result in 651 to 12626 medically preventable deaths annually. Enactment of the House bill advanced in May would increase the number of uninsured persons by 7.6 million and the number of deaths by 16642 annually, according to a mid-range estimate. These figures exclude harms from lowering provider payments and shrinking benefits, as well as possible repercussions from states increasing taxes or shifting expenditures from other needs to make up for shortfalls in federal Medicaid funding.

Policy makers should weigh the likely health and financial harms to patients and providers of reducing Medicaid expenditures against the desirability of tax reductions, which would accrue mostly to wealthy Americans.

### National spending on health by source for 184 countries between 2013 and 2040 [^f4896a77]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

A general consensus exists that as a country develops economically, health spending per capita rises and the share of that spending that is prepaid through government or private mechanisms also rises. However, the speed and magnitude of these changes vary substantially across countries, even at similar levels of development. In this study, we use past trends and relationships to estimate future health spending, disaggregated by the source of those funds, to identify the financing trajectories that are likely to occur if current policies and trajectories evolve as expected.

Methods

We extracted data from WHO's Health Spending Observatory and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Financing Global Health 2015 report. We converted these data to a common purchasing power-adjusted and inflation-adjusted currency. We used a series of ensemble models and observed empirical norms to estimate future government out-of-pocket private prepaid health spending and development assistance for health. We aggregated each country's estimates to generate total health spending from 2013 to 2040 for 184 countries. We compared these estimates with each other and internationally recognised benchmarks.

Findings

Global spending on health is expected to increase from US$7·83 trillion in 2013 to $18·28 (uncertainty interval 14·42-22·24) trillion in 2040 (in 2010 purchasing power parity-adjusted dollars). We expect per-capita health spending to increase annually by 2·7% (1·9-3·4) in high-income countries, 3·4% (2·4-4·2) in upper-middle-income countries, 3·0% (2·3-3·6) in lower-middle-income countries, and 2·4% (1·6-3·1) in low-income countries. Given the gaps in current health spending, these rates provide no evidence of increasing parity in health spending. In 1995 and 2015, low-income countries spent $0·03 for every dollar spent in high-income countries, even after adjusting for purchasing power, and the same is projected for 2040. Most importantly, health spending in many low-income countries is expected to remain low. Estimates suggest that, by 2040, only one (3%) of 34 low-income countries and 36 (37%) of 98 middle-income countries will reach the Chatham House goal of 5% of gross domestic product consisting of government health spending.

Interpretation

Despite remarkable health gains, past health financing trends and relationships suggest that many low-income and lower-middle-income countries will not meet internationally set health spending targets and that spending gaps between low-income and high-income countries are unlikely to narrow unless substantive policy interventions occur. Although gains in health system efficiency can be used to make progress, current trends suggest that meaningful increases in health system resources will require concerted action.

### Choosing wisely® in preventive medicine: the American College of Preventive Medicine's top 5 list of recommendations [^9b3533e3]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation #4—Don’t Use Expensive Medications When an Equally Effective and Lower-Cost Medication Is Available highlights that, on average, the cost of a generic drug is 80%—85% lower than the brand name product while having the same active ingredients, strength, and similar effectiveness. Physicians’ cost accuracy is low, with less than 50% of estimates accurate by any definition of cost accuracy, and patient preference for generics is limited, with only 37.6% preferring generics for their own health. Increasing generic utilization can yield large savings; for every 10% increase in the use of generic cholesterol drugs, Medicare costs could be reduced by $1 billion annually. Adherence data from more than 90,000 Medicare beneficiaries showed higher adherence to generic statins compared with brand name statins and a lower composite outcome of hospitalization and death.

### The economic value of targeting aging [^0a90989e]. Nature Aging (2021). High credibility.

Developments in life expectancy and the growing emphasis on biological and ‘healthy’ aging raise a number of important questions for health scientists and economists alike. Is it preferable to make lives healthier by compressing morbidity, or longer by extending life? What are the gains from targeting aging itself compared to efforts to eradicate specific diseases? Here we analyze existing data to evaluate the economic value of increases in life expectancy, improvements in health and treatments that target aging. We show that a compression of morbidity that improves health is more valuable than further increases in life expectancy, and that targeting aging offers potentially larger economic gains than eradicating individual diseases. We show that a slowdown in aging that increases life expectancy by 1 year is worth US$38 trillion, and by 10 years, US$367 trillion. Ultimately, the more progress that is made in improving how we age, the greater the value of further improvements.

### Cost effectiveness of a government supported policy strategy to decrease sodium intake: global analysis across 183 nations [^750f7056]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Intervention costs

Country specific resource needs and costs were derived using the WHO-CHOICE database,which includes detailed component specific estimates of inputs (ingredients) required for each intervention stage for each country’s government and the estimated unit price for each input in that country including for example costs of human resources, training, meetings, supplies, equipment, and mass media (see supplementary eMethods). To facilitate comparisons between countries, we converted all costs to international dollars (I$) (see supplementary eMethods), which account for each nation’s currency as well as purchasing power parity.One I$ in any given country can be interpreted as the funds needed to purchase the same amounts of goods or services in that country as one US$ would purchase in the US. For countries with lower incomes than the US, conversion of our findings from I$ to US$ would substantially increase the apparent cost effectiveness (ie, the cost in US$ per disability adjusted life year (DALY) saved would be much lower). We summed costs by year to calculate the total cost of the 10 year intervention for each country, with 3% annual discounting.

We modeled only governmental intervention costs, for several reasons. First, this cost is most relevant to budget constrained governments, since the program cost must be borne directly and immediately. Second, net industry sector costs for product reformulation in each country would be difficult to determine because once the relevant reformulation has been undertaken in any single country, the knowledge of that reformulation can be extended with much less additional cost to other countries. For example, multinational companies transfer improved recipes and reformulation strategies across borders with no cost, as do food scientists moving between firms, and so on. Third, in contrast to recent US models,we did not include estimated healthcare savings or increased productivity from prevented cardiovascular disease events because such savings could, in theory, be partly offset by new downstream health events resulting from enhanced survivaland because comparable healthcare and productivity costing data are available for a minority of countries globally. Because including such cost savings would be optimal according to many cost effectiveness guidelines, our results for overall cost effectiveness should be considered a conservative estimate.

### ACMT position statement: addressing the rising cost of prescription antidotes [^fb8d36b8]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2018). Medium credibility.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) position on rising prescription antidote costs—antidotal therapy is an essential component of poisoning management, yet there have been unprecedented increases in the costs of antidotes, and ACMT calls upon providers, hospitals, formularies, the pharmaceutical industry, government, insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to adopt practices to ensure that antidotes are available to our patients and priced based on value and cost. Background framing notes that per capita prescription drug spending accounts for 17% of healthcare costs and that there have been unprecedented and profound increases in the costs of antidotes and other prescription drugs in the U.S. The largest driver cited is market exclusivity, defined as restrictive marketing rights granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) independent of a drug’s patent; exclusivity can be extended for reasons such as pediatric studies by the sponsor or development of orphan indications, and this allows recovery of research and development costs that were estimated to be $2.6 billion in 2014. In the U.S., brand name drugs comprise approximately 10% of approved pharmaceutical products but account for 72% of pharmaceutical spending, with brand name drug prices increasing 164% overall from 2008 to 2015 while wages increased approximately 8%. Additional U.S. system features contributing to higher prices include the more rapid acceptance of new products, especially in small market share medications, and greater difficulty for payers to negotiate price with more stringent coverage requirements.

Health care costs—Health care costs refer to the resources consumed in the production of health care that are then no longer available for other uses and include costs of drugs, devices, durable medical equipment, clinician and nonclinician time, inpatient hospitalization, emergency room visits, outpatient services, long-term care, and home-based services. There are 2 approaches to evaluating health care costs: micro-costing, which is a bottom-up approach that relies on direct enumeration and costing of all resources consumed or saved, and gross-costing, which is a top-down approach that assigns each episode of care an average aggregate cost based on known national reimbursement rates (eg, Medicare reimbursement for a Diagnosis-Related Group). The choice of approach used to estimate costs depends on the specific types of resources to be valued.

### Changes in cost of guideline-concordant cancer treatment: observations and implications [^9e86fc7e]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cost of cancer care in the United States is substantial. Previous studies have explored pricing comparisons at the level of individual cancer drugs but not that of clinical indications. This study evaluates cost patterns for providing the best guideline-concordant therapy for solid tumor treatment indications.

Methods

We identified all National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-concordant treatment indications for the 17 most common solid tumor malignancies in 2017 and 2021. Best-available treatments were determined for each indication using National Comprehensive Cancer Network Evidence Block scores. We grouped treatments by (1) those administered on an ongoing basis (priced per month) and (2) those administered for a prespecified duration (priced per course of therapy). Costs were calculated using Medicare reimbursement rates and analyzed across both time points.

Results

Across all indications, median cost of the best-available cancer treatment changed from $10,784 in US dollars (USD) (IQR, $691-$16,489 [USD]) in 2017 to $17,936 (USD) (IQR, $2,640-$19,209 [USD]) in 2021 for regimens administered on an ongoing basis, and from $10,501 (USD) (IQR, $6,068-$51,365 [USD]) in 2017 to $9,038 (USD) (IQR, $5,045-$79,386 [USD]) in 2021 for regimens administered for a set duration. Among the subset of indications newly present in 2021, median costs were higher at $21,524 (USD) (IQR, $5,639-$22,369 [USD]) per month for ongoing regimens and $17,005 (USD) (IQR, $6,178-$258,284 [USD]) per course for prespecified regimens. Among the subset of indications present in both 2017 and 2021, relative change in cost of the best-available treatment was -2% (IQR, -39% to +9%). Indications for which the best-available treatment had a new generic or biosimilar entrant (N = 16), median cost decrease was substantially larger at -57% (IQR, -78% to -44%).

Conclusion

This study observed an increase in absolute median cost of cancer therapy on a treatment indications level, largely driven by new biomarker-driven indications and therapies.

Importance of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) in cardiovascular care: Over the next 30 years, cardiovascular disease health care costs in the United States are expected to quadruple, from $338 billion in 2020 to $1.4 trillion in 2050, increasing from 2.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 4.6% of projected GDP in 2050. CEAs can help promote efficient allocation of finite societal resources by weighing intervention effectiveness against incremental resource use; they are not simply about minimizing costs but about evaluating the incremental cost-effectiveness of an intervention relative to the next best alternative to maximize population health benefits, and they provide efficiency estimates to inform decision-making at the policy and system level.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^8cdf2826]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Virtually, nothing about healthcare is affordable without private or public insurance. In countries like the USA, prices that some patients pay for treatments are set by their insurance plans. When an insured patient cannot afford a medicine that is medically or clinically appropriate for them, it may be because their insurance has rendered it unaffordable by charging excessive out-of-pocket costs. Affordability for these patients would be best solved by lowering out-of-pocket costs. In that case, society would be spreading the cost of medicines for patients across premiums paid by everyone. This is the case in many European countries where patients have to spend very little out of pocket on treatments their governments have decided merit coverage.

It is reasonable for society to want to be sure that it is getting value for its money. Just by (a) recognizing that most medicines will go generic, (b) can help not only the patient but also caregivers, (c) can restore productivity, and (d) offer system-wide scientific spillovers, we can appreciate that medicines can be worth more than traditional CEA would have us believe. Adding just a few of the commonly overlooked values of medicines to a CEA reveals that many countries have long been negotiating the prices of branded medicines not down to an upper limit of cost-effectiveness but well below their societal value. That only further underscores that the way to make cost-effective medicines affordable to US patients is through insurance reform that lowers out-of-pocket costs.

Central planners—inside and outside the USA—would be wise to subject more than just medicines to generalized, comprehensive CEA. Were they to do that, they would see that the rising cost of healthcare services means that managing the ravages of Alzheimer’s disease in hospitals and nursing homes for an increasing number of aging citizens represents a tsunami of cost and suffering, not just for patients but for caregivers and the taxpaying public. Then, just as many countries have realized the long-term benefits of investing more in clean energy by paying more for those technologies, they might recognize the benefits of investing in incentives for biomedical R&D to avert Alzheimer’s and other diseases, by paying more of what today’s medicines are worth. The larger the perceived market for cost-effective products, the more the private sector will strive to serve that market with more such cost-effective solutions, in the USA and globally.

Table 1—cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives delineate cost components by perspective: Health care costs paid by third-party payers and costs paid out-of-pocket by patients are included across Health Care Sector, “Modified Societal,” and Full Societal; patient-time costs, unpaid caregiver-time costs, transportation costs, and productivity are included under “Modified Societal” and “Full Societal”; and cross-sector items such as social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental are included only under Full Societal. The footnote adds that analysts “should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective,” that a “‘modified’ societal perspective includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy,” and that “An Impact Inventory can aid in communicating and discussing these limitations.”

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs)—importance and projected cardiovascular disease costs are outlined: Over the next 30 years, health care costs attributable to cardiovascular disease in the United States are expected to quadruple, even after accounting for inflation—from $338 billion in 2020 to $1.4 trillion in 2050, an increase from 2.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 4.6% of the projected GDP in 2050. CEAs can help promote efficient allocation of finite societal resources by weighing the effectiveness of an intervention against the incremental use of resources, and it is important to note that CEAs are not simply about minimizing costs: they systematically evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of an intervention relative to the best alternative to maximize the population health benefits, given finite available resources.

Person-centered care in older adults—the article critiques disease-specific management and the healthcare system’s limited view outside clinical encounters, noting that “he or she disappears from the medical system’s view, but the need to address daily well-being is ongoing.” For “frail older adults,” needs span medical, functional, environmental, and social domains. It states that “disease management focuses on discrete problems associated with a single condition” and concludes that it “has not provided substantial improvement in health outcomes or dramatic savings.” As a policy response, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted the “triple aim” framework of “better population health, better care for individuals, and lower per capita costs through system improvement.” Key words emphasize “person-centered care” and “older adults.”

Table 2. Reference case for high-quality CEAs—costs and outcomes—states that costs should be based in the same jurisdiction as the target population, and health care cost estimates should reflect actual amounts paid, including out-of-pocket costs. Micro-costing can produce reliable cost estimates but is not always feasible; when micro-costing is not available or feasible, gross-costing is an acceptable alternative. Cost of drugs should reflect price after discounts or rebates in the base-case analysis, preferably the price available to the entity or majority of the treatment-eligible population. Costs of medical devices should be the price net of discounts when available or the list price when the net price is not available, and a wide range of costs should be examined in sensitivity analyses. Cost estimates should be adjusted for nonadherence, and the currency and year of evaluation should be clearly identified. For health outcomes, the reference case should report outcomes in terms of life years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, report alternative metrics when available, report intermediate outcomes, and may include disutility related to taking the treatment in sensitivity analyses.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Economic evaluation methods—cost identification, costing approach, inflation adjustment, and pricing guidance are specified as follows: Micro-costing is necessary to capture resource differences when average reimbursements would obscure them, whereas when the gross-costing approach is used, estimates should reflect actual amounts paid, including out-of-pocket costs. Hospital list prices (“charges”) should be adjusted using appropriate cost-to-charge ratios, and statistical analyses should account for positively skewed, heteroskedastic cost data. For sourcing cost inputs, use of Medicare reimbursement rates is reasonable for individuals who are 65 years or older, whereas commercial and Medicaid reimbursement rates are preferred for individuals younger than 65 years. When condition-related costs are easily identifiable and survival is unaffected, it is acceptable to only focus on costs related to the condition for estimating incremental health care costs; however, when costs cannot be clearly separated or survival differs between strategies, the preferred approach is to consider all health care costs, including those unrelated to the condition being evaluated. Health care cost inputs from older studies should be inflated using the Personal Health Care Expenditure deflator or the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index developed by the US Bureau for Economic Analysis, the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index is unsuitable for use in CEAs, and high-quality economic evaluations should incorporate an estimate of net price to the payer after discounts or rebates in the base-case analysis, ideally reflecting the net price for the entire or majority of the treatment-eligible population rather than a specific subpopulation.

Cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives—Table 1 delineates cost components and examples by perspective (Health Care Sector, “Modified Societal,” Full Societal). Components and examples include health care costs paid by third-party payers (drug/device costs, hospital services, physician services, home care services, allied health), costs paid out-of-pocket by patients (drug copayment/coinsurance and user fees), patient-time costs (time spent seeking care), unpaid caregiver-time costs (time spent in caregiving), and productivity losses (formal/informal labor earnings lost, cost of unpaid lost productivity due to illness, cost of uncompensated household production). Broader sectors listed include social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental. Footnotes instruct that analysts should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective and describe a “modified” societal perspective that includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds—framework and updates explain that the 2014 ACC/AHA statement provided per–capita GDP–based thresholds such that an intervention with an ICER <$50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to <$150 000 (1-3x per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥$150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. The World Health Organization’s program suggested that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective, whereas costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective; however, experts have argued this approach lacks theoretical justification, and World Health Organization experts now also advise against the use of per capita GDP-based cost effectiveness thresholds and instead suggest considering cost-effectiveness information alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicriterion decision process. The writing committee reviewed alternative approaches, including relying on US-based studies; for example, a health opportunity cost analysis estimated that at 2019 prices, for every $1000000 increase in health care expenditures 1860 persons were projected to become uninsured with 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars, and in the probabilistic analysis 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### Costs of hand hygiene for all in household settings: estimating the price tag for the 46 least developed countries [^58966e48]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Different cost categories change in relative importance over time, as the intervention is scaled up over 10 years (figure 3). Capital costs, specifically the initial promotion and HWF, are consistent over the years as each of the 10 cohorts receives the initial intervention—the slight annual decrease is due to discounting. Total recurrent costs increase every year, which is due to new cohorts receiving top-up promotion and spending on soap and water. Overall, capital costs comprise 37% of the 10-year total and recurrent costs 63%, recalling that top-up promotion is a recurrent cost (table 1). In the alternative scenario where one-to-one promotion was excluded from the intervention, total cost decreased to US$ 11.0 billion (95% CI 10.0 to 12.2) and promotion cost to US$3.0 billion (95% CI 2.7 to 3.5), or US$0.25 annually per head of LDC population— figures in online supplemental material D.

Figure 3 
Distribution of costs over the 10-year time horizon, for the 46 least developed countries.

Considering the first of the additional results, the annual cost of soap and water enabling households with a ‘limited’ service to reach ‘basic’ would be US$1.4 billion, of which 86% is for soap. Second, if all households in LDCs were targeted with hygiene promotion instead of only those with no HWF, the promotion cost almost quadruples to US$20.5 billion (from US$5.7 billion) including one-to-one activities, and to US$10.4 billion excluding them (from US$3.0 billion). These amounts are not included in the headline totals.

In deterministic sensitivity analysis, the scenario which saw the biggest difference in total cost was when the promotion price was varied according to its 95% CI. This saw total cost fall to US$10.5 billion or rise to US$16.8 billion (figure 4). Incorporating assumptions about economies of scale saw total cost falling to US$10.5 billion (figure 4). In this scenario, the prices of promotion, HWFs and soap experience annual decreases starting with 10% in year 2 then in 2% decrements (8% in year 3, etc). All scenarios are described in online supplemental material D, as are results for sensitivity analysis for promotion costs only.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs)—scope and caveats emphasize that the intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making, and systematically applying CEAs at the level of the health system can promote efficient use of resources and improve population health outcomes; they would ideally be performed across the entire set of options available to generate health, rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo, which can be challenging in the United States given the fragmented nature of our health care system. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, thus improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies, while resource allocation is a complex process based on several considerations in addition to the efficient use of resources, including political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; these considerations are particularly important for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease given the large number of individuals affected—1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020—and the substantial economic burden of cardiovascular disease. CEAs have to be updated over the intervention’s life cycle as more cost and effectiveness data become available, and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs already in place, because adding more programs and interventions that are “cost-effective” without removing interventions that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency.

Rare disease drugs and gene therapies—recent scientific advances have led to the approval of first-in-class treatments for several rare cardiovascular diseases (defined in the United States as affecting fewer than 200 000 individuals), and some therapies, such as tafamidis for transthyretin amyloidosis ($250 000 per year), invariably result in unfavorable cost-effectiveness determinations when using traditional $100 000 to $150 000/QALY thresholds. Some bodies have proposed the use of broader ranges for cost-effectiveness thresholds for rare diseases, while others have noted that US policy already provides substantial financial incentives for rare disease therapies, which should be counterbalanced with value-based pricing to ensure access to newly approved therapies, and similar arguments have been made for one-and-done gene therapies. The writing committee recognizes the trade-off between incentivizing innovation and ensuring access, and therefore states, we propose that rare disease drugs and gene therapies be evaluated using the standard cost-effectiveness threshold ($120 000 per QALY gained) for the base-case scenario but with heightened consideration of contextual factors around severity of disease, unmet need, health equity, and access to care. Economic evaluations of gene therapies should report the results of sensitivity analyses that vary the durability of effectiveness and incorporate delayed onset of adverse events, and where available, results of distributional CEAs may provide additional insight into the cost effectiveness of treatments for rare diseases.

### Affordability of the EAT-Lancet reference diet: a global analysis [^12fce3b0]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Summary

Background

The EAT– Lancet Commission drew on all available nutritional and environmental evidence to construct the first global benchmark diet capable of sustaining health and protecting the planet, but it did not assess dietary affordability. We used food price and household income data to estimate affordability of EAT– Lancet benchmark diets, as a first step to guiding interventions to improve diets around the world.

Methods

We obtained retail prices from 2011 for 744 foods in 159 countries, collected under the International Comparison Program. We used these data to identify the most affordable foods to meet EAT– Lancet targets. We compared total diet cost per day to each country's mean per capita household income, calculated the proportion of people for whom the most affordable EAT– Lancet diet exceeds total income, and also measured affordability relative to a least-cost diet that meets essential nutrient requirements.

Findings

The most affordable EAT– Lancet diets cost a global median of US$2·84 per day (IQR 2·41–3·16) in 2011, of which the largest share was the cost of fruits and vegetables (31·2%), followed by legumes and nuts (18·7%), meat, eggs, and fish (15·2%), and dairy (13·2%). This diet costs a small fraction of average incomes in high-income countries but is not affordable for the world's poor. We estimated that the cost of an EAT– Lancet diet exceeded household per capita income for at least 1·58 billion people. The EAT– Lancet diet is also more expensive than the minimum cost of nutrient adequacy, on average, by a mean factor of 1·60 (IQR 1·41–1·78).

Interpretation

Current diets differ greatly from EAT– Lancet targets. Improving diets is affordable in many countries but for many people would require some combination of higher income, nutritional assistance, and lower prices. Data and analysis for the cost of healthier foods are needed to inform both local interventions and systemic changes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds for cardiovascular cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs)—The 2014 ACC/AHA cost-value methodology statement provided thresholds to identify high-, intermediate-, and low-value care based on U.S. per capita gross domestic product, and the writing committee determined that an intervention with an ICER <$50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to <$150 000 (1-3× per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥$150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. WHO-origin GDP benchmarks suggested an intervention that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective and that costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective, but critics note they “set such a low bar for cost effectiveness that very few interventions with evidence of efficacy can be ruled out”; WHO experts now also advise against per capita GDP-based thresholds and suggest considering cost-effectiveness alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicomponent decision process. Reflecting these concerns, the writing committee reviewed alternative approaches to incorporating CEA results into guidelines, including relying on US-based studies for identifying a cost-effectiveness threshold or thresholds for cardiovascular CEAs, and Vanness et al used a health opportunity cost approach estimating that for every $1 000 000 increase in health care expenditures, 1869 persons become uninsured, resulting in 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars; in the probabilistic analysis, 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

The field of radiology has witnessed a burst of technological advances that improve diagnostic quality, reduce harm to patients, support clinical needs, and better serve larger more diverse patient populations. One of the critical challenges with these advances is proving that value outweighs the cost. The use of cutting-edge technology is often expensive, and the reality is that our society cannot afford all the screening and diagnostic tests that are being developed. At the societal level, we need tools to help us decide which health programs should be funded. Therefore, decision makers are increasingly looking toward scientific methods to compare health technologies in order to improve allocation of resources. One of such methods is cost-effectiveness analysis. In this article, we review key features of cost-effectiveness analysis and its specific issues as they relate to radiology.

Appropriate scope and caveats for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs): The intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making; instead, systematically applying CEAs at the health system level can promote efficient resource use and improve population health outcomes and would ideally be performed across the entire set of options rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies. Resource allocation is a complex process that, beyond efficiency, depends on political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; this is particularly important in cardiovascular disease given that 1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020. To improve health care efficiency, CEAs have to be updated over the intervention’s life cycle and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs; adding programs that are “cost-effective” without removing those that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency. This statement uses the term CEA for analytic frameworks with effectiveness outcomes that reflect patient or community preferences over health states (eg, quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]).

### Progress on impoverishing health spending in 122 countries: a retrospective observational study [^1e5573c4]. The Lancet: Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The goal of universal health coverage (UHC) requires that families who get needed health care do not suffer financial hardship as a result. This can be measured by instances of impoverishment, when a household's consumption including out-of-pocket spending on health is more than the poverty line but its consumption, excluding out-of-pocket spending, is less than the poverty line. This links UHC directly to the policy goal of reducing poverty.

Methods

We measure the incidence and depth of impoverishment as the difference in the poverty head count and poverty gap with and without out-of-pocket spending included in household total consumption. We use three poverty lines: the US$1·90 per day and $3·10 per day international poverty lines and a relative poverty line of 50% of median consumption per capita. We estimate impoverishment in 122 countries using 516 surveys between 1984 and 2015. We estimate the global incidence of impoverishment due to out-of-pocket payments by aggregating up from each country, using a survey for the year in question when available, and interpolation and model-based estimates otherwise. We do not derive global estimates to measure the depth of impoverishment but focus on the median depth for the 122 countries in our sample, accounting for 90% of the world's population.

Findings

We find impoverishment due to out-of-pocket spending even in countries where the entire population is officially covered by a health insurance scheme or by national or subnational health services. Incidence is negatively correlated with the share of total health spending channelled through social security funds and other government agencies. Across countries, the population-weighted median annual rate of change of impoverishment is negative at the $1·90 per day poverty line but positive at the $3·10 per day and relative poverty lines. We estimate that at the $1·90 per day poverty line, the worldwide incidence of impoverishment decreased between 2000 and 2010, from 131 million people (2·1% of the world's population) to 97 million people (1·4%). The population-weighted median of the poverty gap increase attributable to out-of-pocket health expenditures among the 122 countries in our sample are ¢1·22 per capita at the $1·90 per day poverty line and ¢3·74 per capita at the $3·10 per day poverty line. In all countries, out-of-pocket spending can be both catastrophic and impoverishing at all income levels, but this partly depends on the choice of the poverty line.

Interpretation

Out-of-pocket spending on health can add to the poverty head count and the depth of poverty by diverting household spending from non-health budget items. The scale of such impoverishment varies between countries and depends on the poverty line but might in some low-income countries account for as much as four percentage points of the poverty head count. Increasing the share of total health expenditure that is prepaid, especially through taxes and mandatory contributions, can help reduce impoverishment.

Ticagrelor 90 mg daily for peripheral artery disease, as monotherapy or in addition to aspirin, was compared with clopidogrel and did not significantly reduce a composite of adjudicated cardiovascular death, MI, or ischemic stroke (10.8% with ticagrelor, 10.6% with clopidogrel; HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.92-1.13; P = .65), nor hospitalization for acute limb ischemia (ALI) (0.7% vs 1.7%; P = .85), lower limb revascularization (12.2% vs 12.8%; P = .30), or combined rates of coronary, limb mesenteric, renal, carotid, and other revascularizations (17.5% vs 18.0%; P = .46), and there was no significant increase in thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major bleeding (1.6% in both groups). Ticagrelor may consistently reduce platelet reactivity but did not result in less neointimal hyperplasia after femoropopliteal stent placement than clopidogrel, and findings are from one large (13,885 patients) multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial and one small (40 patient) single-center RCT. Resource considerations note a current retail price of ticagrelor of $471 per month and that clopidogrel as a generic is significantly lower ($4-15/month), with cost-utility described as “Dominated” (higher cost, no difference in clinical outcomes). Alternative strategy options are stated as clopidogrel monotherapy and dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel + aspirin.

### Understanding cost-effectiveness [^c4211f8f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Healthcare delivery in the USA and abroad has changed dramatically over the last several decades. Along with the growth in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the costs of healthcare have escalated out of proportion relative to other aspects of the economy. This growth has fostered careful scrutiny of both the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare delivery. Because of this emphasis on the economics of healthcare, physicians require an understanding not only of the efficacy and clinical utility of their interventions, but also of the relative value in an economic sense of their efforts. In other words, physicians in the modern era must now appreciate the concept of cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses are critical evaluative tools. Explicit data on comparative cost-effectiveness are useful for allocating the increasingly stretched healthcare resources. This article provides a primer for understanding the methods and applications of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses.

### Comparison of sales income and research and development costs for FDA-approved cancer drugs sold by originator drug companies [^320919b5]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

High costs and risks of research and development (R&D) have been used to justify the high prices of cancer drugs. However, what the return on R&D investment is, and by extension what a justifiable price might be, is unclear.

Objective

To compare incomes from the sales of cancer drugs with the estimated R&D costs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This observational study used global pharmaceutical industry sales data to quantify the cumulative incomes generated from the sales of cancer drugs for companies that have held patents or marketing rights (originator companies). All cancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration from 1989 to 2017 were identified from the United States Food and Drug Administration's website and literature. Itemized product sales data were extracted from the originator companies' consolidated financial reports. For drugs with data missing in specific years, additional data was sought from other public sources, or where necessary, estimated values from known reported values. Drugs were excluded if there were missing data for half or more of the years since approval. Data analysis was conducted from May 2018 to October 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sales data were expressed in 2017 US dollars with adjustments for inflation. Cumulative incomes from the sales of these drugs were compared against the R&D costs estimated in the literature, which had been adjusted for the costs of capital and trial failure (risk adjusted).

Results

Of the 156 US Food and Drug Administration-approved cancer drugs identified, 99 drugs (63.5%) had data for more than half of the years since approval and were included in the analysis. There was a median of 10 years (range, 1-28 years) of sales data with 1040 data points, 79 (7.6%) of which were estimated. Compared with the total risk-adjusted R&D cost of $794 million (range, $2827-$219 million) per medicine estimated in the literature, by the end of 2017, the median cumulative sales income was $14.50 (range, $3.30-$55.10) per dollar invested for R&D. Median time to fully recover the maximum possible risk-adjusted cost of R&D ($2827 million) was 5 years (range, 2-10 years; n=56). Cancer drugs continued to generate billion-dollar returns for the originator companies after the end-of-market exclusivity, particularly for biologics.

Conclusions and Relevance

Cancer drugs, through high prices, have generated returns for the originator companies far in excess of possible R&D costs. Lowering prices of cancer drugs and facilitating greater competition are essential for improving patient access, health system's financial sustainability, and future innovation.

Conversion of currency

For economic studies, costs are adjusted for inflation and reported in US dollars or international dollars (I$).The I$ is a hypothetical unit of currency designed to account for differences in relative prices across various contexts. For example, I$1 would purchase a comparable amount of goods and services in the country of interest as US$1 would in the USA.The current study used the following formula for conversion of the local currency, I$:

We reported costs in international dollars (I$) to allow better comparison across countries with different price levels. This method follows economic evaluation guidelines, which recommend using I$ or 2015 USD as standard reporting currencies in multi-country studies.We chose I$ because it reflects local purchasing power and provides more stable estimates over time than market-based exchange rates. This approach is especially helpful when comparing costs across LMICs as the purchasing power parity (PPP) is more stable than the market-based USD.The PPP in 2022 for the study sites is presented in online supplemental table S1 and S2.

Device cost inputs in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs)—methodological guidance emphasizes transparency, pricing sources, sensitivity analyses, and handling price opacity. High-quality CEAs should be transparent about the source of effectiveness and safety parameters (and, if substantial changes have occurred over time, the version of the device that these inputs refer to), and they should also evaluate how sensitive their conclusions are to uncertainty in these parameters. Because device prices can vary widely across health systems, CEAs should use the price net of discounts where available or the list prices when the net price is not available, and device costs should be varied widely in 1-way sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect on the ICER. In situations where device costs are truly opaque, the economic value statement should report the threshold prices at which the device would be expected to be cost-effective. The costs of drugs or devices can also change substantially over time, baseline risk may change over time, and collectively these changes can markedly alter the economic value of an intervention.

### Affordability of the EAT-Lancet reference diet: a global analysis [^faa99a12]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Results

The median daily cost in international dollars of an EAT– Lancet reference diet was estimated to be $2·84 (IQR 2·41–3·16) in 2011. The cost was larger in high-income countries ($2·66, 2·39–3·02) than in low-income countries ($2·42, 2·07–2·72), and among geographical regions, the median cost was highest in the Latin America and Caribbean region ($3·42, 3·03–3·87) and lowest in sub-Saharan Africa ($2·45, 2·17–2·84), with considerable variation within regions and income groups (figure 1).

Figure 1 
Cost of the EAT– Lancet reference diet in 2011 international dollars, by country income levels and major regions

We used price data from the International Comparison Program to estimate the cost of the EAT– Lancet reference diet in 159 countries. Cost estimates are reported in 2011 international dollars, adjusting for inflation using purchasing power parity price levels for household consumption. The size of the box indicates the IQR. The bottom and top rule marks the bottom 5th and top 5th percentiles, respectively. The vertical bar rule inside the box shows the median value for the income group or geographical region.

The food group whose quantities and prices accounted for the largest share of total cost (31·2%) was fruits and vegetables (table 2). In high-income countries, this share was on average 35·1%, in upper-middle-income countries 30·3%, in lower-middle-income countries 29·7%, and in low-income countries 26·7%. Globally the next largest cost is from legumes and nuts (18·7%), meat, eggs, and fish (15·2%), and dairy (13·2%). Adding together all animal sourced food groups (dairy, plus meat, eggs, and fish), their share of total cost was largest in low-income countries (32·8%) and smallest in upper middle-income countries (26·2%).

### Disease-related malnutrition and enteral nutrition therapy: a significant problem with a cost-effective solution [^f5804a0a]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2010). Medium credibility.

Disease-related malnutrition—pneumonia and pressure ulcer burden and costs. Malnourished patients are at an increased risk for developing pneumonia, and the average cost to treat pneumonia in a nursing home resident who receives some treatment in the emergency department is $1486. For elderly individuals with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia, the mean length of hospital stay was 8 days with a median cost of $5100; for a secondary diagnosis, the median length of stay was 12 days at a median cost of $10,100. For pressure ulcers, the mean length of hospital stay in 2003 was approximately 13 days and the average charge was approximately $37,800 per patient, and malnutrition was a concomitant condition in 17.8% of hospital stays primarily for pressure ulcers.
