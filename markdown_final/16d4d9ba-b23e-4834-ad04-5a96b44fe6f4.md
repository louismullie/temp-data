## Question

Treatment management of asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment management of asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and phenotyping. Then, I should assess current control and future risk to set a baseline. Next, I will align goals with patient preferences and context. After that, I will select an initial pharmacologic regimen and define the review cadence. I will then build self-management and an action plan, and I need to ensure a plan for stepping up if uncontrolled and stepping down if controlled. I will also consider special populations, nonpharmacologic strategies, and implementation considerations, and finally, I will verify adherence and inhaler technique at every visit and address severe asthma pathways, while checking that my approach remains aligned with current GINA guidance and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and phenotype because I need to ensure we are treating true asthma and not a mimic, and I should document variability in airflow obstruction and atopy, eosinophils, and comorbidities such as rhinitis, obesity, and smoking, since these influence risk and response. GINA 2024 emphasizes that diagnostic uncertainty is common and that misdiagnosis leads to harm, so I should double-check history, spirometry with bronchodilator response, and, where appropriate, FeNO or blood eosinophils, while also distinguishing asthma from COPD and asthma–COPD overlap when features are mixed, since this affects the safety of LABA/LAMA use without ICS [^11621yUJ] [^1117GnnP] [^111MY3VB].

> Wait, let me verify control and risk domains separately because symptom control and future risk can be discordant. I should quantify symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, reliever use, and activity limitation, and also screen for risk factors such as prior exacerbations, ICU admission, low FEV1, smoking, and high SABA use, and I must remember that even "mild" symptom frequency does not guarantee low risk of severe events, so I should explicitly score both domains to guide treatment intensity [^114Ex3pw] [^1172Fwwz] [^114DDMqv].

> I need to ensure patient-centered goals are elicited and documented, because treatment success includes both medical endpoints and what the patient values. This means asking about desired activity, fears about medications, cost constraints, and device preferences, and then aligning the regimen with those preferences to improve adherence and outcomes, while explaining that control targets encompass symptom control and risk minimization over the long term [^114nKFiG] [^116BDgYK] [^1177LqWS].

> Next, I should review initial pharmacotherapy choices by step and by age. For adults and adolescents, Track 1 with ICS–formoterol used as both controller and reliever (SMART/MART) is preferred across Steps 1–5, given reductions in severe exacerbations versus SABA-only or daily ICS plus SABA, while Track 2 uses daily ICS with as-needed SABA or ICS–SABA and is reasonable if Track 1 is unavailable or declined. For children 6–11 years, I should confirm that preferred controllers include daily low-dose ICS or low-dose ICS–LABA, reserving higher-intensity steps for specialists. For preschool children, low-dose ICS is foundational and I need to consider device choice and technique carefully. I should double-check that GINA explicitly discourages SABA-only treatment because of increased exacerbation risk even in so-called mild asthma [^112uwgAT] [^115MkVWQ] [^113yA9Y8] [^113pQ9XK] [^111MY3VB].

> Hold on, I should verify the review cadence and follow-up plan. After starting or changing therapy, I will arrange a visit in 1–3 months to reassess symptom control, exacerbations, adherence, inhaler technique, lung function, and side effects, then space reviews every 3–12 months once stable, and after any exacerbation I will schedule a semi-urgent review within 1–2 weeks to restore pre-exacerbation treatment and correct modifiable factors, since this reduces relapse risk and improves trajectory [^115AemWM] [^111dzYpc] [^116aFjD9].

> I will now examine self-management as a core treatment, not an add-on. I need to ensure a written, personalized action plan covering green/yellow/red zones, correct inhaler technique taught with teach-back and rechecked each visit, and adherence strategies including simplified regimens, reminders, and shared decision-making, because these components reduce hospitalizations and ED visits by roughly one-third to two-thirds and are among the highest-yield interventions in asthma care [^115fuFkh] [^112RgzNF] [^116GWX3b].

> Let me consider when and how to step up if control is suboptimal. Before escalating pharmacotherapy, I should double-check inhaler technique, adherence, persistent exposures, and comorbidities such as rhinitis, obesity, GERD, and anxiety, and only then move up a step, choosing options like higher-dose ICS–LABA, adding LAMA, or considering LTRA based on phenotype and availability. I need to ensure that I am not mistaking poor implementation for treatment failure, as that is a common and preventable cause of apparent nonresponse [^115AuZ1K] [^116eivKt].

> But wait, what if control is good for 2–3 months? I should then step down gradually, typically reducing ICS dose by 25–50% at 3-month intervals, timing the reduction when the patient is stable, not during travel or pregnancy, and treating it as a therapeutic trial with a written action plan and close follow-up, and I must avoid stopping ICS entirely unless temporarily to confirm diagnosis. If symptoms flare during step-down, that pattern supports severe asthma and should prompt specialist referral and restoration of the prior dose [^117XBK4A] [^112qJMtP] [^116KkvJV].

> I need to check special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, I should maintain ICS as safe and effective and avoid SABA-only regimens, in children I should reassess frequently given growth and phenotype shifts, in low-resource settings I should prioritize access to low-dose ICS or ICS–formoterol and address affordability barriers, and in older adults I should consider osteoporosis risk with repeated OCS bursts and minimize OCS exposure whenever possible [^113pQ9XK] [^11722xYp] [^115ossQa].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic strategies that meaningfully augment control. Smoking cessation, weight reduction, exercise, vaccination, and trigger mitigation including allergen avoidance for sensitized patients are important, and I should tailor these to feasibility and patient preferences, integrating them into the action plan and reviewing progress regularly [^115HfkWP] [^112RgzNF].

> I will now examine implementation and systems issues because guideline-concordant care improves outcomes. I should align with local formularies and resources, embed standardized assessment tools, and participate in multidisciplinary quality improvement, recognizing that GINA provides a global strategy that must be adapted locally and that cost-effectiveness and access constraints often drive real-world choices [^1145JhZb] [^113dGUfW] [^111eRZXy].

> Hold on, I should verify adherence and inhaler technique at every single visit because these are the most common, modifiable drivers of poor control. I will use teach-back, device demos, and, when needed, switch devices to match ability and preference, and I will screen for intentional and unintentional nonadherence to guide supportive interventions rather than reflexively escalating therapy [^115AemWM] [^112RgzNF].

> Finally, I need to ensure a clear pathway for severe asthma. If symptoms persist despite optimized high-dose ICS–LABA, correct technique, and good adherence, I should refer for specialist assessment, phenotype evaluation, and consideration of add-on therapies such as LAMA, azithromycin, or biologics for Type 2 inflammation, while minimizing maintenance OCS to the greatest extent possible and reassessing response every 3–6 months to de-escalate ineffective treatments [^116eivKt] [^111dBNQY].

Asthma management centers on a **stepwise, control-based approach** [^115AuZ1K] that escalates or de-escalates therapy to achieve good symptom control and minimize future risk [^1177LqWS], with **ICS-containing therapy as the cornerstone** [^113da49b] across all severities. For adults and adolescents, **Track 1 (ICS-formoterol)** [^112uwgAT] is preferred at all steps; for children 6–11 years, use ICS or ICS-LABA with SABA as needed [^113yA9Y8]. Key elements include **regular assessment of control and risk** [^114Ex3pw], inhaler technique and adherence checks [^115AemWM], written action plans [^115fuFkh], and step-down after 2–3 months of control [^117XBK4A]. Severe asthma requires specialist referral, phenotype assessment, and add-on biologics or other therapies [^116eivKt]; avoid SABA-only treatment due to exacerbation risk [^112uwgAT].

---

## Goals of asthma management

The primary goals are to achieve **good symptom control** — minimal symptoms, no sleep disturbance, and unimpaired activity [^114Ex3pw] — and to **minimize future risk** of exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation, and medication side effects [^114nKFiG]. Management should be **personalized** [^1177LqWS], incorporating patient preferences, comorbidities, and practical considerations [^114Ex3pw].

---

## Stepwise pharmacological treatment

GINA recommends a **stepwise approach** [^115AuZ1K] that adjusts treatment intensity to control and risk, with two tracks for adults/adolescents: Track 1 (preferred) uses ICS-formoterol as both maintenance and reliever (MART) [^112uwgAT]; Track 2 (alternative) uses daily ICS or ICS-LABA with SABA as reliever [^112uwgAT].

| **Step** | **Track 1 (preferred)** | **Track 2 (alternative)** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed | Low-dose ICS as needed + SABA |
| 2 | Low-dose ICS-formoterol daily | Daily low-dose ICS + SABA |
| 3 | MART (low-dose ICS-formoterol) | ICS-LABA daily + SABA |
| 4 | MART (medium-dose ICS-formoterol) | Medium-dose ICS-LABA + SABA |
| 5 | Add LAMA, biologic, or low-dose OCS | Add LAMA, biologic, or low-dose OCS |

---

For children 6–11 years, use **ICS or ICS-LABA with SABA as needed** [^113yA9Y8]; for children ≤ 5 years, use low-dose ICS with reassessment every 3–6 months [^113pQ9XK].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

- **Education and self-management**: Structured education, inhaler technique training, and written action plans reduce morbidity [^115fuFkh] [^112RgzNF].
- **Environmental control**: Allergen avoidance, smoking cessation, and pollution reduction [^115AuZ1K].
- **Vaccinations**: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines [^115HfkWP].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight management, exercise, and diet [^115HfkWP].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up every 3–12 months should assess **control, adherence, inhaler technique, and side effects** [^115AemWM]. Step-down is appropriate after 2–3 months of good control [^117XBK4A], whereas **step-up** is indicated for poor control despite adherence and correct technique [^115AuZ1K].

---

## Management of severe asthma

- **Specialist referral**: For persistent symptoms despite Step 4 therapy [^112CS7sT].
- **Phenotype assessment**: Type 2 vs non-Type 2 inflammation [^112mHdrC].
- **Add-on therapies**: Biologics (anti-IgE, anti-IL5, anti-IL4R), LAMA, or low-dose OCS [^113yA9Y8].
- **Minimize OCS**: Use only when necessary due to adverse effects [^115ossQa].

---

## Addressing treatment challenges

- **Adherence**: Simplify regimens, use reminders, and address beliefs [^114HRona].
- **Inhaler technique**: Regular training and device selection [^112RgzNF].
- **Comorbidities**: Manage rhinitis, obesity, anxiety, and GERD [^notfound].
- **Healthcare disparities**: Ensure equitable access and culturally tailored care [^1145JhZb].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Biologics targeting **type 2 inflammation** [^114G2bgW] are expanding options for severe asthma, and **digital health** tools (apps, telemedicine) are improving self-management and adherence. Efforts also focus on **personalized medicine** [^114G2bgW] using biomarkers and phenotypes to tailor therapy.

---

Asthma management is a **stepwise, control-based strategy** [^115AuZ1K] that balances pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic care, with regular monitoring, patient education, and individualized adjustments to achieve optimal outcomes [^1177LqWS].

### New insights into asthma pathogenesis and treatment [^111Wjn2y]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Although national asthma guidelines help organize standards for asthma care, current asthma management is still primarily symptom based. Recent reports provide insights on how to improve asthma management through steps to better understand the natural history of asthma, individualize asthma care, reduce asthma exacerbations, manage inner city asthma, and some potential new ways to use available medications to improve asthma control. Despite many significant gains in managing asthma, we must now find improved strategies to prevent asthma exacerbations, alter the natural history of the disease, and to reduce health disparities in asthma care. Perhaps new directions in personalized medicine including a systems biology approach, along with improved health care access and communication will lead to better methods to alleviate the burden of asthma. This review will discuss the benefits and limitations of the current approach to asthma management, new studies that could impact new directions in asthma management, and new insights related to mechanisms of asthma and allergic airways inflammation that could eventually lead to improved asthma control.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111437LB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

### Does self-management prevent severe exacerbations? [^116UhykY]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite effective therapies, asthma outcomes remain suboptimal. Education in self-management is crucial to maintaining control in a variable condition such as asthma and reducing the risk of severe asthma exacerbations, hospitalizations and deaths. This review considers the evidence for supported self-management.

Recent Findings

Recent systematic reviews have clarified and confirmed the major benefits from effective self-management education, but have also shown that implementation is rare in routine practice, with consequent avoidable morbidity and mortality. Recent research has focused on the most effective ways of delivering and supporting self-management in different patient groups and has clarified the relative effectiveness of the different components. Self-management support using new digital technologies has been investigated.

Summary

All clinicians treating patients with asthma should be supporting their patients to understand and manage their own condition. Optimal self-management incorporates education, provision of a personalized asthma action plan and is supported by regular professional review. Action plans in a written or digital format should advise on recognizing deterioration and the actions to take, including when to seek professional help, appropriate changes in medication dose or commencing rescue oral steroids. Action plans should be personalized and agreed by the patient, and provided in a culturally tailored form.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115fuFkh]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Training in guided asthma self-management — essential components of effective education are self-monitoring of symptoms and/or peak expiratory flow (PEF), a written asthma action plan to show how to recognize and respond to worsening asthma, and regular review of asthma control, treatment and skills by a healthcare provider. Self-management education that includes these components dramatically reduces asthma morbidity in adults and children, with benefits including reduction of one-third to two-thirds in asthma-related hospitalizations, emergency department visits and unscheduled doctor or clinic visits, missed work/school days, and nocturnal awakenings, and it has been estimated that the implementation of a self-management program in 20 patients prevents one hospitalization, and successful completion by 8 patients prevents one emergency department visit. Less intensive interventions without a written action plan are less effective and information alone is ineffective, and a systematic meta-review of 270 RCTs on supported self-management confirmed reduced unscheduled health care use, improved asthma control, applicability to a wide range of target groups and clinical settings, and no increase in healthcare costs (Evidence A).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116BDgYK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Goals of asthma management — The GINA goal of asthma management is to achieve the best possible long-term outcomes for the individual patient, including good long-term symptom control (few/no asthma symptoms, no sleep disturbance due to asthma, and unimpaired physical activity) and minimized long-term risk of asthma-related mortality, exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation and side-effects of treatment; the patient's own goals should also be identified.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112uwgAT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β₂-agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β₂-agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1117GnnP]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma with COPD features — initial therapy and combinations: Start treatment as for asthma until further investigations have been performed; inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are essential in preventing morbidity and even death in patients with uncontrolled asthma symptoms; for patients with asthma+COPD, ICS should be used initially in a low or medium dose, and patients with features or diagnosis of both asthma and COPD will usually also require add-on LABA and/or LAMA to provide adequate symptom control; patients with any features of asthma should not be treated with LABA and/or LAMA alone, without ICS; observational evidence cited includes a large case-control study showing lower risk of COPD hospitalizations and death with combination ICS-LABA than with LABA alone in community patients with newly diagnosed COPD who also had a diagnosis of asthma, and a large cohort of patients aged ≥ 66 years in which those recorded as having asthma with COPD had lower morbidity and hospitalizations if they received ICS treatment.

### Barriers and facilitators of effective self-management in asthma: systematic review and thematic synthesis of patient and healthcare professional views [^114HRona]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Self-management is an established, effective and guideline-recommended approach to controlling asthma. It has been defined by the US Institute of Medicine as "the tasks that individuals must undertake to live with one or more chronic conditions. These tasks include having the confidence to deal with medical management, role management and emotional management of their conditions". With regard to asthma control, this encompasses adherence to treatment. Adherence enables individuals to self-manage their condition and is essential to the success of self-management interventions. Effective self-management has resulted in improved quality of life and reduced healthcare utilisation, days absent from work or school, and nocturnal asthma. However, despite effective medication being available, asthma is poorly controlled in over 50% of cases, and the promotion, uptake and use of self-management among people with asthma, carers of children with asthma, and healthcare professionals remain low. – To maximise the benefits of self-management, barriers and facilitators to effective self-management (which may be encountered by the individual with asthma (or carer), the healthcare professional, or at the organisational level) – need to be identified. Further, more effective treatment and management strategies are needed. Identification of the needs, beliefs, and behaviours of these individuals and organisational featurescan indicate where improvements should be focused to help groups of people least likely to benefit from existing self-management interventions, and potentially inform the design and implementation of future interventions.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115HfkWP]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — review and optimize management: "Review and optimize treatment for asthma, and for comorbidities and risk factors identified at Stage 2". Actions include education and planning — "Provide asthma self-management education, and confirm that patient has (and knows how to use) a personalized written or electronic asthma action plan" — and medication optimization: "confirm that the inhaler is suitable for the patient; check and correct inhaler technique with a physical demonstration and teach-back method, check inhaler technique again at each visit. Address suboptimal adherence, both intentional and unintentional. Switch to ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy if available, to reduce the risk of exacerbations". Non-pharmacologic approaches are also advised: "Consider non-pharmacologic add-on therapy, e.g., smoking cessation, physical exercise, healthy diet, weight loss, mucus clearance strategies, influenza vaccination, breathing exercises, allergen avoidance, if feasible, for patients who are sensitized and exposed".

### Asthma: updated diagnosis and management… [^113yA9Y8]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma. STEP 1 Step 1 options are for those with symptoms less than twice per month and no risk factors for exacerbations. An inhaled low-dose ICS/formoterol combination used as needed is the preferred treatment in adults and adolescents. The guideline also strongly discourages the use of long-acting bronchodilators without an ICS because of increased risk of exacerbation. If the ICS/formoterol combination is not available or affordable, a low-dose ICS as needed for symptoms with a SABA is recommended.

STEP 3 Options in adults and adolescents include low-dose ICS/long-acting beta 2-agonist as daily treatment with a SABA as needed, or low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily treatment and as needed. In children six to 11 years of age, either a medium-dose ICS or a low-dose ICS/LABA combination should be used as a controller, with a SABA as needed. STEP 4 Preferred options for adults and adolescents include a low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily and as-needed treatment or a medium-dose ICS/LABA as daily maintenance treatment with a SABA as needed. The addition of sublingual allergen immunotherapy may be considered in adults with allergic rhinitis and suboptimally controlled asthma despite ICS therapy. Referral is recommended for children six to 11 years of age if asthma is not controlled with a medium-dose ICS.

STEP 5 Patients with persistent and severe symptoms despite optimal use of step 4 treatments should be referred for allergist evaluation and consideration of add-on treatments. These additional treatments include high-dose ICS/LABA, tiotropium, azithromycin, anti-immunoglobulin E, anti-interleukin-5/5R, anti-interleukin-4R alpha, sputum-guided treatment, bronchial thermoplasty, and low-dose oral corticosteroids. Adverse effects and the risk of antibiotic resistance should be taken into account when considering these treatments.

### A proposed revision of the stepwise treatment algorithm in asthma [^111sZBzt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The stepwise approach to the pharmacologic treatment of asthma is a core foundation of asthma guidelines. Through this approach, treatment intensity is increased in discrete steps to obtain symptom control and reduce exacerbation risk and is decreased after a period of prolonged control. The stepwise approach is usually shown by an algorithm, as illustrated in the 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) strategy update (Figure 1). Here, we review the 2020 GINA stepwise algorithm and suggest alternative evidence-based algorithms that address potential problems with the currently recommended approach.

### Defining and managing risk in asthma [^112BeV4Y]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma attacks are a major global source of morbidity and cost. The incidence and impact of asthma attacks have not improved despite widespread adoption of effective universal treatment guidelines. Consequently, there is increasing interest in managing asthma based on specific assessments of both current symptoms and future risk. In this review, we consider 'risk' in asthma, and how it might be assessed from the patient's history and objective measurements. We also discuss the potential for encouraging shared decision-making and improving medical consensus through explicit communication of risk and highlight the potential opportunities and challenges in risk assessment to improve asthma management through individualised treatment strategies.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^1177LqWS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

General Principles of Asthma Management

The goals of asthma management are to achieve good symptom control, relieve symptoms when they occur, and minimize the risk of exacerbations and asthma-related death, persistent airflow limitation, and side effects of treatment. The patient's own treatment goals should be identified because they may be different. Effective asthma management requires a partnership between the patient (or parent/caregiver) and healthcare providers, with shared decision-making and good communication.

Asthma management is not "one-size-fits-all" but instead should be personalized and adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment adjustment, and review (Figure 2).

Figure 2.
Personalized asthma management cycle of care. Reproduced by permission from Reference(Box 3–2).

Assessment

Assess not only symptom control and lung function but also the individual's modifiable risk factors and comorbidities (also called "treatable traits") and patient/parent goals and preferences. Check adherence and inhaler technique frequently. Poor symptom control is associated with a much higher risk of exacerbations, but patients with apparently mild asthma or with good symptom control can still have severe or life-threatening exacerbations.

Treatment Adjustment

Treatment adjustment includes not only changes in the asthma medication dose or type but also multidisciplinary management of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities (Section 3D in Reference) and nonpharmacological strategies such as smoking cessation and avoidance of indoor/outdoor air pollution (Box 3–9 in Reference).

For all patients, provide regular training in inhaler techniques and asthma self-management, including self-monitoring of symptoms and/or PEF, and a written asthma action plan (Section 3C in Reference). Encourage adherence with controller medication, even when symptoms are infrequent. Consider stepping down treatment when good control has been maintained for 2–3 months (Box 3–7 in Reference).

Adults and adolescents — referral and assessment for persistent symptoms: Patients of any age with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite correct inhaler technique and good adherence with Step 4 treatment should be referred to a specialist with expertise in investigation and management of severe asthma, if available (Evidence D), and the section heading specifies to refer for expert assessment, phenotyping, and add-on therapy. In severe asthma, randomized controlled trial populations may not reflect clinical practice, with a registry study finding that over 80% of patients with severe asthma would have been excluded from major regulatory studies evaluating biologic therapy. If symptoms and/or exacerbations persist, additional treatment options may be considered, with a note to always check local eligibility and payer criteria.

### Asthma exacerbations: pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment [^115WE8dQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma focuses on disease severity and choosing the appropriate medical therapy to control symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, irrespective of asthma severity and often despite optimal medical therapy, patients may experience acute exacerbations of symptoms and a loss of disease control. Asthma exacerbations are most commonly triggered by viral respiratory infections, particularly with human rhinovirus. Given the importance of these events to asthma morbidity and health care costs, we will review common inciting factors for asthma exacerbations and approaches to prevent and treat these events.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114mYYYb]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Children 5 years and younger — stepwise management and prerequisites before stepping up therapy: Treatment follows a stepwise approach with medication adjusted up or down to achieve good symptom control and minimize future risk, and the need for controller treatment should be re-assessed regularly. If symptom control is poor and/or exacerbations persist despite 3 months of adequate controller therapy, confirm that symptoms are due to asthma rather than another condition (and refer for expert assessment if in doubt), check and correct inhaler technique, confirm good adherence with the prescribed dose, consider a trial of another treatment option for that step, and enquire about risk factors such as allergen or tobacco smoke exposure before stepping up.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1164RQb6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — terminology and written asthma action plans emphasize that exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function, and that the term 'flare-up' is preferable for most patients; patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and flagged for more frequent review. All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115AuZ1K]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Adjusting ongoing asthma treatment in adults, adolescents, and children aged 6–11 years — once asthma treatment has begun, ongoing treatment decisions are based on a personalized cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment, and review of the response, and for each patient asthma medication can be adjusted up or down in a stepwise approach to achieve good symptom control and minimize future risk of exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation and medication side-effects; when good asthma control has been maintained for 2–3 months, treatment may be stepped down to find the patient's minimum effective treatment. People's ethnic and racial backgrounds may be associated with different responses to treatment and these are not necessarily associated with genetic differences. If a patient has persisting uncontrolled symptoms and/or exacerbations despite 2–3 months of ICS-containing treatment, assess and correct the following common problems before considering any step up in treatment: incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, persistent exposure at home/work to agents such as allergens, tobacco smoke, indoor or outdoor air pollution, or to medications such as beta-blockers or (in some patients) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), comorbidities that may contribute to respiratory symptoms and poor quality of life, and incorrect diagnosis.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111MY3VB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial treatment for safety and clinical efficacy — For asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are essential, either alone or in combination with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not treat with LABA and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without ICS. For patients with features of both asthma and COPD, treat as asthma; ICS-containing therapy is important to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not give LABA and/or LAMA alone without ICS. For COPD, treat according to current recommendations from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), i.e., initial treatment with LAMA and LABA, plus as-needed SABA.

### Severity, control, and responsiveness in asthma [^117HV3Vm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Guidelines for asthma management have proposed that initial treatment should be based on assessment of asthma severity. The treatments proposed for different degrees of asthma severity are essentially estimates of the intensity of treatment needed to achieve asthma control. Responsiveness to treatment is heterogeneous, however, even among asthmatic patients with asthma of similar severity. This heterogeneity calls attention to the importance of assessing asthma control and adjusting treatment accordingly. Application of a guidelines-based approach to asthma management thus requires general agreement on what is meant by severity, control, and responsiveness and requires further an awareness of asthma as causing symptoms and functional impairment in the present and also as causing risk of adverse events in the future.

### Promoting prevention and targeting remission of asthma: a EUFOREA consensus statement on raising the bar in asthma care [^112Us43S]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common, multifaceted respiratory disease with a major impact on quality of life. Despite increased insights into mechanisms underlying various asthma phenotypes and endotypes and the availability of targeted biologic treatment options, the disease remains uncontrolled in a substantial proportion of patients with risk of exacerbations, requiring systemic corticosteroids, and with progressive disease. Current international guidelines advocate for a personalized management approach to patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. The European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA) asthma expert panel was convened to discuss strategies to optimize asthma care and to prevent systemic corticosteroid overuse and disease progression. In this meeting report, we summarize current concepts and recommendations and provide a rationale to implement personalized asthma management at earlier stages of the disease. The ultimate goal is to move away from the current one-size-fits-most concept, which focuses on a symptom-driven treatment strategy, and shift toward a phenotype- and endotype-targeted approach aimed at curbing the disease course by improving clinical outcomes and preserving health-related quality of life. Herein, we provide a consensus view on asthma care that advocates a holistic approach and highlight some unmet needs to be addressed in future clinical trials and population studies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111M2Lvq]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Remission of asthma — Remission of asthma can be identified in children and in adults, either clinical remission or complete remission, and either off-treatment or on-treatment, and definitions and criteria vary; the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for each patient. Research among patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off-treatment or on-treatment, provides important opportunities for understanding underlying mechanisms of asthma and to develop new approaches to asthma prevention and management, facilitated by standardized criteria and assessment tools. Take care if using the term 'remission' with patients or parents/caregivers, explain what you mean, and that if asthma symptoms have gone quiet for a while, they may recur.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — decision point: Does asthma become uncontrolled when treatment is stepped down? YES: if asthma symptoms become uncontrolled or an exacerbation occurs when high-dose treatment is stepped down, the diagnosis of severe asthma has been confirmed; restore the patient's previous dose to regain good asthma control, and refer to a specialist or severe asthma clinic, if possible, if not done already. NO: if symptoms and exacerbations remain well controlled despite treatment being stepped down, the patient does not have severe asthma; continue optimizing management.

New therapies and indications — GINA frames recommendations within a global regulatory context, noting that some recommendations may be off-label in some countries and that this is a particular issue for pediatrics, including for preschool children and for children aged 6–11 years. For new therapies, GINA's aim is to provide clinicians with evidence-based guidance about new therapies and their positioning in the overall asthma treatment strategy as soon as possible; however, for therapies with sufficient good-quality evidence in relevant asthma populations, recommendations may be held until after approval for asthma by at least one major regulatory agency (e.g. European Medicines Agency or US Food and Drug Administration).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1122GNtY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma remission — definitions and clinical context: Remission of asthma has been investigated extensively, and definitions and criteria vary, but they commonly refer to either clinical remission (e.g., no asthma symptoms or exacerbations for a specific period) or complete (or pathophysiological) remission (e.g., also including normal lung function, airway responsiveness and/or inflammatory markers). There has been interest in remission off treatment, for example with biologic therapy for severe asthma, and the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA, which is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient. When discussing the best possible outcomes with a patient, consider their own asthma goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Research in patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off treatment or on treatment, provides opportunities for understanding mechanisms and developing new approaches to prevention and management, which will be facilitated by using standardized criteria and tools.

Asthma review frequency — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — states that each patient's asthma should be reviewed regularly to monitor control, risk factors and exacerbations and to document response to treatment changes; for most controller medications improvement begins within days but the full benefit may only be reached after 3–4 months; all healthcare providers should be encouraged to assess asthma control, adherence and inhaler technique at every visit; and ideally patients should be seen 1–3 months after starting treatment and every 3–12 months thereafter, with a review visit within 1 week scheduled after an exacerbation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111MJy57]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma treatment step-down — pre-step-down assessment should account for current treatment, risk factors and preferences, with few data on optimal timing, sequence and magnitude of reductions. Factors associated with greater risk after step-down include a history of exacerbations and/or emergency department visit for asthma in the previous 12 months, and a low baseline FEV1; other predictors include airway hyperresponsiveness and sputum eosinophilia, but these tests are not readily available in primary care. Any treatment step-down should be considered as a therapeutic trial, evaluating symptom control and exacerbation frequency, and before stepping down, the patient should be given a written asthma action plan and instructions for how and when to re-start their previous treatment if their symptoms worsen.

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: where next for adult asthma guidelines? [^114uR6NB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^11722xYp]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

While the GINA strategy report is intended to have global relevance, there are particular considerations for asthma management in low- and middle-income countries. Of particular concern is the widespread lack of access to affordable diagnostic tools and inhaled medications, which contributes substantially to the heavy burden of asthma mortality and morbidity seen in these countries.

At the most fundamental level, patients in many areas do not have access even to low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), which are the cornerstone of care for asthma patients of all severity.

GINA collaborates with and strongly supports the call by the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases for a World Health Assembly Resolution on universal access to affordable and effective asthma care, as a step towards addressing these needs.

GINA is also a partner organization in a program launched in March 2006 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD). Through the work of GINA, and in co-operation with GARD and with the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, substantial progress toward better care for all patients with asthma globally should be achieved in the next decade.

To achieve this, GINA believes that the safest and most effective approach to asthma treatment in adolescents and adults, which also avoids the consequences of starting treatment with short-acting beta 2 agonists (SABA) alone, depends on access to ICS–formoterol across all asthma severity levels. With budesonide-formoterol now on the WHO essential medicines list, the fundamental changes to treatment of mild asthma first included in the ground-breaking 2019 GINA reportmay provide a feasible solution to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations with very low dose treatment.

In this review we discuss four key concepts for asthma management in primary care: diagnosis, long-term treatment, assessment of control, and management of severe asthma. We provide the background to the latest (May 2022) update of the GINA strategy report, with a focus on changes (Table 1) and selected recommendations that are particularly pertinent to primary care practitioners, and their rationale. The full strategy documents, podcasts, educational materials, and summary booklets are available on the GINA website.

Difficult-to-Treat and Severe Asthma in Adults and Adolescents

Detailed information is provided in the GINA 2021 pocket guide on difficult-to-treat and severe asthma, including an integrated decision tree for diagnosis and management across primary and specialist care. A brief summary is included below.

Assessment and Optimization of Therapy

Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA treatment or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations.

Severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite good adherence with optimized high-dose ICS–LABA therapy and management of contributory factors or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma.

Assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and to identify and manage factors that commonly contribute to symptoms, poor quality of life, and/or exacerbations. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS–LABA, assess the clinical and inflammatory phenotype, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Refer for expert advice if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing Step 4 or 5 treatment (or earlier, if needed).

Assessment of asthma in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — The level of asthma control is the extent to which the features of asthma can be observed in the patient, or have been reduced or removed by treatment, and asthma control is assessed in two domains: symptom control and risk of adverse outcomes; poor symptom control is burdensome to patients and increases the risk of exacerbations, but patients with good symptom control can still have severe exacerbations.

### Asthma [^1142YqeW]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic non-communicable diseases worldwide and is characterised by variable airflow obstruction, causing dyspnoea and wheezing. Highly effective therapies are available; asthma morbidity and mortality have vastly improved in the past 15 years, and most patients can attain good asthma control. However, undertreatment is still common, and improving patient and health-care provider understanding of when and how to adjust treatment is crucial. Asthma management consists of a cycle of assessment of asthma control and risk factors and adjustment of medications accordingly. With the introduction of biological therapies, management of severe asthma has entered the precision medicine era-a shift that is driving clinical ambitions towards disease remission. Patients with severe asthma often have co-existing conditions contributing to their symptoms, mandating a multidimensional management approach. In this Seminar, we provide a clinically focused overview of asthma; epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management in children and adults.

### The burden of corticosteroid overload in severe and difficult to treat asthma: how to reduce this? [^115ossQa]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Severe asthma is a serious condition that requires an individualized approach combining several treatment agents administered simultaneously in order to reach adequate control. Glucocorticosteroid treatment, as the cornerstone of asthma pharmacotherapy, has great disease-controlling capability, although it may induce a vast amount of severe adverse effects. This review describes our current knowledge of the monitoring and managing options of these adverse effects and possibilities to prevent them, including new therapeutic options.

Recent Findings

A large amount of new drugs is emerging, which may offer a better control of glucocorticosteroid-induced adverse effects. At the same time, major achievements in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in severe asthma and in the field of biologic agents may help to substantially reduce the need of glucocorticosteroids in the first-line treatment.

Summary

We discuss new insights and approaches to treatment strategy of severe asthma allowing less oral glucocorticosteroid use and hence, substantial less severe adverse effects of the treatment.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^115Qbc6X]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

6. Expanded indications for starting regular controller (preventer) treatment

The GINA report now includes a new table with evidence-based recommendations for initiating controller treatment. The most important change is a recommendation for earlier initiation of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids; for example, in patients with symptoms twice or more a month and/or risk factors for exacerbations, such as a need for oral corticosteroids in the last year. The aim is to reduce asthma risk, even if day-to-day symptoms are not frequent enough to be burdensome.

7. Tailoring asthma treatment for individual patients

The GINA report now describes a framework for personalised asthma management. While national guidelines provide recommendations about the treatment that may be most cost-effective across the whole population, patient-level decisions should also take into account any characteristics or phenotypes that predict the patient's risk or likely treatment response (e.g. smoking status, blood eosinophilia, admission to hospital for asthma in the previous year) together with patient goals and concerns and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence and cost to the patient.

8. Patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

A new feature in GINA relates to the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome. Past guidelines for asthma and COPD have been separate, and most regulatory studies have excluded patients with both conditions. However, many patients have features of both asthma and COPD, including symptomatic smokers with a history of childhood asthma, and patients with asthma and fixed airflow limitation. In collaboration with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA 2014 included a new chapter outlining a syndromic approach to diagnosis in primary care, with pragmatic advice about safety considerations in choice of initial treatment (avoidance of long-acting β₂-agonist alone if the features suggest asthma, and avoiding inhaled corticosteroid-only treatment if the features suggest COPD). Therefore, it is important that asthma (or asthma–COPD overlap syndrome) should remain in the patient's list of diagnoses, even if they develop fixed airflow limitation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116eivKt]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Severe asthma assessment and management in adults and adolescents — assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, and to identify and manage factors that may be contributing to symptoms, poor quality of life, or exacerbations, and refer for expert advice at any stage, or if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing treatment. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS-LABA treatment (with good adherence and correct inhaler technique), the clinical or inflammatory phenotype should be assessed, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Depending on the inflammatory phenotype and other clinical features, add-on treatments for severe asthma include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), low-dose azithromycin (adults), and biologic agents for severe asthma, while low-dose maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) should be considered only as a last resort if no other options are available, because of their serious cumulative long-term side-effects. After initiating add-on therapy, assess the response to any add-on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options; utilize specialist multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available; continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with the primary care clinician and considering the patient's social and emotional needs; and invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidence gaps.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114N84ew]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The methodology framework used for this update, GRADE, is the internationally recommended approach for developing recommendations that clinicians can trust. This framework endorses a systematic and transparent approach to decision making, uses established criteria to rate the certainty of evidence, and determines the strength of the recommendations. Recommendations developed using GRADE combine certainty of evidence with patient values and preferences and weigh the benefits and harms of making treatment recommendations. Importantly, the recommendations are based on the key questions that clinicians, both generalists and specialists, wanted to be answered.

Users of these recommendations may be disappointed by the absence of many strong recommendations — that is, recommendations that clinicians should adhere to for almost all individuals with asthma as the standard of care. This is not, however, surprising given the variations in asthma phenotypes and endotypes and in the outcomes used in the studies reviewed to develop the recommendations. When the GRADE framework is used, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are initially rated as offering a high certainty of evidence, but issues with study designs (eg, lack of blinding or of a placebo control), heterogeneity of study results, or small numbers of events may result in downgrading the certainty of evidence. For most of the asthma recommendations, the overall certainty of the evidence was downgraded because of inconsistencies in study results, risk of bias, or absence of critical standardized outcome measures. The need to downgrade the evidence should be a clarion call to investigators to use standardized and validated outcome measures that were outlined in the Asthma Outcomes Workshop (2012). This single activity will create more robust evidence to support recommendations in the future.

### Mechanisms and management of asthma exacerbations [^116BXVwX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute asthma remains an important medical emergency, the most frequent cause of acute admissions in children and a major source of morbidity for adults with asthma. In all ages with asthma, the presence of exacerbations is an important defining characteristic of asthma severity. In this review, we assess the epidemiology of acute asthma, the triggers of acute exacerbations, and the mechanisms that underlie these exacerbations. We also assess current treatments that prevent exacerbations, with an emphasis on the role of type 2 airway inflammation in the context of acute exacerbations and the novel treatments that effectively target this. Finally we review current management strategies of the exacerbations themselves.

The third step is to optimize management. Patients should be educated on self-assessment of asthma control, understanding asthma medications, proper inhaler technique, and creating a home action plan. Asthma therapy should include a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting beta agonist and rescue therapy. Nonbiologic add-on therapies, such as a long-acting muscarinic agent or leukotriene receptor antagonist, should be considered. Nonpharmacologic interventions, such as exercise, healthy diet, weight loss, allergen avoidance, influenza vaccination, and breathing exercises, should also be implemented. Referral to an asthma specialist or clinic may be considered. 14) and should be reserved for people with severe asthma. Mepolizumab, dupilumab, and benralizumab are approved for patients 12 years and older, omalizumab for patients six years and older, and reslizumab for patients 18 years and older.

A 2014 Cochrane review showed that omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, is effective in reducing exacerbations, hospitalizations, and inhaled corticosteroid dosage in patients with allergic asthma or high IgE concentrations. 15 Omalizumab is appropriate only for patients with evidence of allergic asthma on skin testing or elevated IgE on a respiratory allergen panel. Mepolizumab and reslizumab are monoclonal antibodies directed against interleukin-5. In studies of patients with severe asthma and elevated eosinophil concentrations, these anti–IL-5 drugs modestly reduce severe asthma exacerbations and improve asthma-related quality of life; mepolizumab additionally reduces the need for oral corticosteroids. Both agents are approved as add-on maintenance therapy for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. 16 Benralizumab targets eosinophils using the IL-5 alpha receptor.

In patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, benralizumab modestly reduces exacerbations and oral corticosteroid use. Benralizumab is approved as add-on maintenance therapy for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. 17 Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-4 alpha receptor. In a study of patients with moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma, those taking dupilumab had lower rates of severe exacerbations than those taking placebo.

How Does the NAEPP 2020 Asthma Guideline Update Compare with Recommendations by the 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma?

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and the NHLBI to promote a coordinated worldwide effort in asthma prevention and management. Although the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention 2020 Update (GINA 2020 report) is not a guideline, many readers of the NAEPP update are likely to ask whether the recommendations in the two documents are similar or different. The answer is yes and yes. For example, note the similarities and differences in pharmacologic step therapy recommendations for individuals age 12 years or older (Table 1).

Table 1.
Preferred Controller and Reliever Pharmacotherapy Recommendations for Individuals ≥ 12 Years with Asthma in the NAEPP 2020 Guideline Update and GINA 2020 Report

We believe the differences are largely the result of different objectives, methods used to review evidence, and definitions. The GINA report is intended to inform a comprehensive global strategy for various aspects of diagnosis and management of mild to severe asthma, including in low- and middle-income countries. The NAEPP update offers recommendations for six priority topics. GINA updates its report annually based on a twice-yearly review of the recently published literature by asthma clinicians and researchers from diverse geographic regions in the world. The GINA report is not a guideline, so it does not adhere to methodologies recommended for guidelines. GINA advises healthcare professionals "to use their own professional judgement, and to take into account local and national regulations and guidelines".

The GINA report includes five levels of progressive treatment intensification ("steps"), with step 1 therapy reserved for individuals with symptoms less than 2 times/mo. The NAEPP 2020 guideline update "pulled-through" the six-step pharmacotherapy framework used in the NAEPP 2007 asthma guidelines but only made changes to some of the pharmacotherapy recommendations in the six steps in each age group. For example, in individuals 12 years or older, the Expert Panel's pharmacotherapy recommendations for the preferred controller only address steps 2–5 (Table 1). The NAEPP 2007 asthma guideline pharmacotherapy recommendations for step 1, reserved for "intermittent asthma", was not reviewed by the Expert Panel for 2020 update. GINA does not include the construct of intermittent asthma because all patients with asthma are at risk for severe exacerbations.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^112R9cdG]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma

Asthma is a major burden worldwide, for governments, health-care providers, patients and their carers, and there is considerable variation in asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality. Asthma remains a common cause of death in many countries, and many asthma deaths are preventable, so there is a need for a different approach.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in 1993 to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. The GINA report is not a guideline, but a global strategy that can be adapted to local conditions; over the years, the reports have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. The GINA strategy report, prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, is annually updated following a review of evidence, and is now independently funded by the sale of GINA documents and resources.

Over recent years, research has led to considerable advances not only in our knowledge about asthma and treatment optionsbut also in our understanding of how to implement evidence-based recommendations within clinical practice. This evidence is reflected in a major revision of GINA's landmark Global Strategy Report (published in May 2014, with further minor updates in 2015). The report not only provides up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk but also presents these in a radically different style to improve their utility for busy frontline clinicians.

This paper summarises the key changes in the GINA strategy report that are most relevant to health professionals working in primary care.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111gtgbT]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma risk — managing other modifiable risk factors — Some patients continue to experience exacerbations even with maximal doses of current treatment, and having even one exacerbation increases the risk that a patient will have another within the next 12 months. In clinical practice, exacerbation risk can be reduced both by optimizing asthma medications, and by identifying and treating modifiable risk factors, and not all risk factors require or respond to a step up in controller treatment.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111E4h1y]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The new GINA strategy report and supporting resources provide a substantial array of new, practical, evidence-based materials that supplement current national asthma guidelines, or can be adapted for local use, in both high- and low-resource countries. In the 2014 revision and 2015 update, GINA has moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk in a practical, practice-centred format. The aim is to reduce the burden of asthma, both for patients who suffer from this disease and for health-care systems.

### Targeting asthma remission as the next therapeutic step toward improving disease control [^114R57WP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

The long-term goal of asthma management is to achieve disease control, comprising the assessment of 2 main domains: (1) symptom control and (2) future risk of adverse outcomes. Decades of progress in asthma management have correlated with increasingly ambitious disease control targets. Moreover, the introduction of precision medicines, such as biologics, has further expanded the limits of what can be achieved in terms of disease control. It is now believed that clinical remission, a term rarely associated with asthma, may be an achievable treatment goal. An expert framework published in 2020 took the first step toward developing a commonly accepted definition of clinical remission in asthma. However, there remains a widespread discussion about the clinical parameters and thresholds that should be included in a standardized definition of clinical remission. This review aims to discuss on-treatment clinical remission as an aspirational outcome in asthma management, drawing on experiences from other chronic diseases where remission has long been a goal. We also highlight the integral role of shared decision-making between patients and health care professionals and the need for a common understanding of the individual patient journey to remission as foundational elements in reducing disease burden and improving outcomes for patients with asthma.

### The revised 2014 GINA strategy report: opportunities for change [^111NU66J]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This document reviews a major revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention that was published in 2014. The report aimed not only to update evidence-based recommendations for asthma diagnosis and management but also to innovate through a new format and layout to make its recommendations more clinically relevant and easier to implement.

Recent Findings

The GINA 2014 report includes a new definition of asthma that recognizes the heterogeneity of the disease and its phenotypes, and a new chapter about the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome. Among key messages, the report stresses that therapeutic decisions should be based not only on assessment of symptoms but also on risk factors for exacerbations, side effects of therapy and development of fixed airflow limitation. Asthma management includes not only medications but also nonpharmacological therapies and strategies, in a coordinated and personalized approach to individual patient care. On the basis of evidence about how to achieve behaviour change by health professionals, the recommendations are presented in a user-friendly format, with numerous tables, algorithms and flow-charts facilitating implementation. Background supporting material has been gathered online.

Summary

The GINA 2014 report provides updated and more easily implementable recommendations on optimal asthma management.

### The disease management approach to controlling asthma [^114XYDe7]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma has become an important public health issue worldwide and certain groups, such as children, are at particular risk of the disease. Often asthma remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Despite these worrying trends, the disease management approach to asthma control can help most asthma patients achieve a 'normal' way of life. The increased prevalence and greater diagnostic awareness of asthma have placed increased demands on healthcare resources, but effective asthma control can minimize the personal, social and economic burdens of asthma. Early diagnosis and immediate anti-inflammatory treatment is the first step in gaining control of symptoms. A stepwise approach is then used to classify asthma severity and treatment, with the number and frequency of medications increasing (step up) as asthma severity increases and decreasing (step down) when asthma is under control. This stepwise approach to asthma management necessitates regular review of treatment once asthma is under control. However, effective asthma management is dependent on successful patient education, adherence to prescribed medication and good doctor patient partnerships. Current treatment guidelines recommend the use of a written asthma management plan that should be agreed between the doctor and patient. These plans should cover all aspects of asthma treatment, including prevention steps for long-term control and action steps to stop attacks once a worsening in asthma has been recognized. This comprehensive approach to asthma management increases the likelihood of achieving asthma control, which in turn reduces the need for emergency visits to the hospital or clinic and reduces the limitations on physical activity previously imposed by the condition.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^1168dN8q]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a serious global health problem affecting all age groups. Its prevalence has increased in many countries, especially among children. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) aims to improve the diagnosis, management, and prevention of asthma by providing an up-to-date evidence-based strategy and tools and practical resources for clinicians worldwide.

GINA was established through a 1993 collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. NHLBI to develop a strategy for the diagnosis and management of asthma. The Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (GINA strategy report) has been updated annually since 2002 to provide clinicians with up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations as new evidence emerges and new therapies are approved. The GINA strategy report is under continual review by the Science Committee. GINA methodology involves evaluation of new evidence identified from a twice-yearly rolling review of original research and systematic reviews (not limited to specific population/intervention/comparison/outcomes questions), assessment of its impact on existing or new recommendations, and consideration of whether and how it should be integrated into the overall asthma management strategy. GINA is independent of industry.

This article summarizes key recommendations from the 2021 GINA strategy report, published in April 2021, and briefly summarizes the evidence and rationale for recent important changes.

Asthma continues to be recognized as a well-known respiratory disease requiring complex management. Asthma is assessed and treated by clinicians across the continuum. The interest in evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management is ongoing and essential for aligning clinical practice with its changes. The purpose of this review is to provide updates from recent literature on asthma for clinicians.

### Asthma yardstick: practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for poorly controlled asthma [^113CdJX3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Current asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management that involves assessment of impairment and risk followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. The fact that many patients still experience severe symptoms that negatively affect quality of life suggests that asthma control remains an objective to be achieved. Tools are available to help patients (and families) manage the day-to-day and short-term variability in asthma symptoms; however, when and how to implement a sustained step-up in therapy is less clear. The Asthma Yardstick is a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for the patient with not well-controlled or poorly controlled asthma. Patient profiles and step-up strategies are based on current guidelines, newer data, and the authors' combined clinical experience and are intended to provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide toward the goal of well-controlled asthma for every patient. The development of this tool comes in response to the continued need to proactively address the sustained loss of asthma control at all levels of severity.

Stepping up and down across tracks: Treatment can be stepped up or down along one track using the same reliever at each step or switched between tracks according to the individual patient's needs and preferences; before stepping up, check for common problems such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, and environmental exposures, and confirm that symptoms are due to asthma.

Implementing asthma management strategies — methodology and adaptation note that when asthma care is consistent with evidence-based recommendations, outcomes improve; rigorous methodologies such as GRADE for developing recommendations and ADAPTE for adapting them have assisted in reducing biased opinion in asthma programs; adaptation of recommendations to local conditions using the GRADE method is costly and often requires expertise not available locally, with regular revision required; the GINA annual report is not a formal guideline but an evidence-based strategy, updated yearly from a review of the evidence published in the last 18 months; and, as with other evidence-based clinical recommendations, the GINA strategy must be adapted to the local context for implementation in clinical practice.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117XBK4A]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma step-down to minimum effective treatment: Once good asthma control has been maintained for 2–3 months, consider stepping down gradually to find the lowest treatment that controls symptoms and exacerbations, provide a written asthma action plan, monitor closely with a follow-up visit, and do not completely withdraw ICS unless needed temporarily to confirm the diagnosis of asthma.

Adapting and implementing asthma clinical practice guidelines — implementation of asthma management strategies may be carried out at a national, regional or local level, and ideally should be a multidisciplinary effort involving many stakeholders, using cost-effective methods of knowledge translation; each implementation initiative needs to consider the nature of the local health system and its resources, including human resources, infrastructure, and available treatments, with goals and strategies varying between and within countries based on economics, culture, and the physical and social environment; priority should be given to high-impact interventions, and specific steps need to be followed before clinical practice recommendations can be embedded into local clinical practice and become the standard of care, with the individual steps summarized in Box 14–2.

Implementation of Asthma Management Strategies into Health Systems

To improve asthma care and patient outcomes, evidence-based recommendations must be disseminated and implemented nationally and locally and integrated into health systems and clinical practice. Implementation requires an evidence-based strategy involving professional groups and stakeholders and considering local cultural and socioeconomic conditions. The cost-effectiveness of implementation programs should be assessed so a decision can be made to pursue or modify them. Local adaptation and implementation of asthma care strategies are aided by purpose-developed tools.

Asthma treatment goals — GINA emphasizes achieving the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the individual patient, including both long-term symptom control and minimization of risks such as exacerbations, lung function decline, and medication adverse effects (including long-term adverse effects of OCS), and highlights the importance of eliciting the patient or caregiver's treatment goals, which may differ from medical goals.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114DDMqv]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — interim advice on severity descriptors for clinical practice and education: The document states that GINA "continues to support the current definition of severe asthma as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS-LABA, or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA or biologic therapy to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled". It adds, "We suggest that in clinical practice, the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided if possible", and advises explaining that patients with infrequent or mild symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations if treated with SABA alone and that "this risk is reduced by half to two-thirds with low-dose ICS or with as-needed low-dose ICS formoterol". It further directs, "Ensure that you prescribe ICS-containing therapy to reduce the patient's risk of severe exacerbations", clarifies that "'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which treatment patients should receive", and notes that guidance about low-intensity treatment suitability is in "Step 1 and 2". For education, it states that "'apparently mild asthma' may be useful to highlight the discordance between symptoms and risk".

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^1152timh]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

Childhood asthma remission — research needs note that clinical questions about remission off treatment in children focus on risk factors for asthma persistence and recurrence (including clinical, pathological, and genetic factors), the effect of risk reduction strategies on the likelihood of remission, whether monitoring after remission to allow early identification of asthma recurrence improves outcomes, and whether progression to persistent airflow limitation can be prevented. Clinical questions about remission on treatment (e.g., in children with severe asthma treated with biologic therapy) include whether inhaled anti-inflammatory therapy can be down-titrated.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115MkVWQ]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma management cycle for personalized asthma care involves a continual cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment and review. Assess the patient's symptom control and their risk factors for exacerbations, for decline in lung function and for medication adverse effects, with particular attention to inhaler technique and adherence; assess comorbidities and the patient's goals and preferences, and confirm the diagnosis of asthma if not yet done. Adjust the patient's management based on these assessments, including treatment of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities, relevant non-pharmacologic strategies, education and skills training, and adjustment of medication as required; for adults and adolescents, the preferred controller and reliever treatment across all steps is with combination ICS-formoterol, as shown in GINA Track 1. Review the patient in line with the goals of treatment, reassess factors affecting symptoms, risk of adverse outcomes and patient satisfaction, arrange further investigations if needed, and readjust treatment if needed.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1143Ayc3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Stepwise approach for managing asthma.

In preparing the step diagrams (Figs 2–4), the Expert Panel used some of the definitions and assumptions from EPR-3. The step diagrams that follow this section retain the EPR-3 recommendations that the Expert Panel did not address in the current report. The Expert Panel encourages readers to review the footnotes in the step diagrams because they offer important information about the use of these diagrams.

The following conventions apply to Figs 2 to 4:
Each figure applies to the care of individuals with asthma in one age group. Fig 2 applies only to ages 0 to 4 years. Fig 3 applies only to ages 5 to 11 years. Fig 4 applies only to ages 12 years and older.
Clinicians decide which step of care is appropriate depending on whether the individual is newly diagnosed (ie, is treatment naive) or whether the clinician is adjusting the individual's therapy to achieve asthma control. For newly diagnosed or treatment-naive individuals, clinicians should first choose the appropriate step diagram for the person's age and then consider both the individual's level of asthma impairment and risk when selecting the initial step and treatment. Within a given step, the preferred options are the best management choices supported by the evidence that the Expert Panel reviewed. When the available evidence is insufficient or does not change a previous recommendation, the step diagrams list preferred options from the EPR-3 step diagrams. Within a given step, an alternative option(s) is management strategies that are less effective or have more limited evidence than the preferred options. Clinicians and patients may choose the alternative treatments if individuals with asthma are currently receiving this therapy and their asthma is under control, if the preferred treatments are not available or too costly, or if the individuals with asthma prefer an alternative treatment. Preferred and alternative treatments within a step category are listed alphabetically unless the Expert Panel has established a rank order of preference for the preferred or alternative treatments. A lack of rank order is indicated by "or" between treatment options.
In the stepwise approach to therapy for asthma, the clinician escalates treatment as needed (by moving to a higher step) or, if possible, deescalates treatment (by moving to a lower step) once the individual's asthma is well controlled for at least three consecutive months. For individuals with persistent asthma (ie, who require treatment at Step 2 or above), clinicians should be guided by the current step of treatment and the individual's response to therapy (in terms of both asthma control and adverse effects) both currently and in the past to decide whether to step up, step down, or continue the current therapy. For individuals with persistent asthma who are using an alternative treatment and have an unsatisfactory or inadequate response to that therapy, the Expert Panel suggests replacing the alternative treatment with the preferred treatment within the same step before stepping up therapy.
The Expert Panel did not add management options that the panel recommends against, or for which the evidence is insufficient to determine harms and benefits, to the step diagrams. Instead, these options are listed in Table IF.
The guidance provided in the step diagrams is meant to assist and not replace the clinical decision making required for individual patient managementand the input from individuals with asthma about their preferences.

### Can asthma control be improved by understanding the patient's perspective? [^116o8XLk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Severity vs. control

Management guidelines for asthma, as with many other diseases, include treatment algorithms based on severity of disease, as defined by the clinical features before treatment or by the treatment given. Severity usually refers to the degree of underlying pathology. Deciding the severity of asthma is not always easy. When respiratory specialists were shown a number of case studies and asked to assign the severity of the asthma for each case, there was considerable disagreement. The inherent variability of asthma also presents problems for classification of severity. Severe asthma, defined as persisting symptoms despite high levels of treatment, is likely to have a number of underlying reasons, including psychological and adherence factors.

Although the factors indicating control may be the same as those indicating severity (e.g. persistent symptoms, impaired lung function, high bronchodilator use, oral steroid use, unscheduled consultations, hospitalisations, life-threatening attacks), there is a difference in the two concepts. Patients with severe asthma can be well-controlled, while those with mild underlying disease can show signs of poorly controlled disease. Changing the management plan to one based on control and the goals of patients may show improved outcomes compared to a plan based on severity.

Hospital-based studies have suggested that outcomes may be better with treatment algorithms based on parameters that are more closely linked to control than usual symptom-based management protocols. There is a reduction in exacerbation rate, although a higher inhaled corticosteroid load received, in patients given treatments that optimise reduction in bronchial hyperreactivity, rather than treatment on the basis of symptoms. Likewise, a treatment strategy based on normalisation of sputum eosinophil levels resulted in reduced exacerbations compared to standard management protocols, without increasing steroid exposure. A randomised controlled trial conducted in New Zealand used a management strategy incorporating exhaled nitric oxide (NO) readings and achieved control that was at least as good as that obtained with a guideline-based approach but using a lower inhaled steroid dosage. The GOAL study used a strategy based on the combined aims of treatment given in the GINA guidelines, and showed that the majority of patients treated with individually titrated doses of inhaled corticosteroids, either alone or in combination with long-acting beta 2 -agonist, could achieve and maintain control.

### Update on the NAEPPCC asthma guidelines: the wait is over, or is it? [^113G5DCD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

As an asthma specialist, one is often asked to discuss the asthma guidelines. The challenge that one faces is deciding which guidelines to use as a resource for discussion or presentation. It often comes down to the following questions: What is the question? What message does one want to deliver? Where is the most current information? and Who is the target audience? This commentary will help answer those questions as it guides the reader through the new update of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines and then outlines differences between 2 widely used strategies for the management of asthma: the Global Initiative for Asthma and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111Nd8o9]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Difficult-to-treat and severe asthma in adults and adolescents — difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite prescribing of medium or high-dose treatment with the combination of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations; severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence with optimized high-dose ICS-LABA therapy and treatment of contributory factors, or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma. Severe asthma places a large physical, mental, emotional, social and economic burden on patients and is often associated with multimorbidity.

Box 3–4. Population-level versus patient-level decisions about asthma treatment — population-level selection states that when choosing between treatment options at a population level (e.g., national formularies, health maintenance organizations, national guidelines), the 'preferred' medication at each step is the best treatment for most patients, based on efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and availability and cost at the population level, mainly based on evidence about symptoms and exacerbations (from randomized controlled trials, pragmatic studies and strong observational data). For Steps 1–5, there are different population-level recommendations by age-group (adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, children 5 years and younger), and in Step 5, there are also different population-level recommendations depending on the inflammatory phenotype, Type 2 or non-Type 2.

Guided asthma self-management education and skills training — people with asthma need education and skills training to manage it well, most effectively achieved through a partnership between the patient/carer and their healthcare providers; essential components include choosing the most appropriate inhaler for the patient's asthma treatment (consider available devices, cost, the ability of the patient to use the inhaler after training, environmental impact, and patient satisfaction), skills training to use inhaler devices effectively, encouraging adherence with medications, appointments and other advice within an agreed management strategy, asthma information, and training in guided self-management with self-monitoring of symptoms or peak expiratory flow (PEF), a written asthma action plan, and regular review by a healthcare provider or trained healthcare worker. In developing, customizing and evaluating self-management interventions for different cultures, sociocultural factors should be considered.

Asthma terminology and reporting — The page advises to explain that 'asthma control' tools such as ACQ and ACT assess only one domain of asthma control, and only over a short period of time, and to "Always emphasize the need for and benefit from ICS-containing treatment in patients with asthma, regardless of their symptom frequency or severity, and even if they have no obvious additional risk factors". For epidemiologic studies, it directs to "describe the prescribed (or dispensed) treatment, without imputing severity" and to "state the actual treatment class, rather than a treatment Step". For clinical trials, it instructs: "Describe the patient population by their level of asthma control and treatment, e.g., 'patients with uncontrolled asthma despite medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA' rather than 'moderate asthma'". It also notes that, pending ongoing discussions, "no change has been made to use of the term 'mild asthma' elsewhere in this GINA Strategy Report".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114Ex3pw]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma management — long-term goals: The goal of asthma management is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient, encompassing long-term asthma symptom control that may include few/no asthma symptoms, no sleep disturbance due to asthma, and unimpaired physical activity, and long-term asthma risk minimization that may include no exacerbations, improved or stable personal best lung function, no requirement for maintenance systemic corticosteroids, and no medication side-effects. The patient's goals for their asthma may be different from these medical goals; ask the patient what they want from their asthma treatment, and when discussing the best possible asthma outcomes with a patient, consider their goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Assessing symptom control is NOT enough: the patient's risk factors, including history of exacerbations, should always also be assessed, and symptom control and risk may be discordant because patients with few or no symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, including from external triggers such as viral infections, allergen exposure (if sensitized) or pollution.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1172Fwwz]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Personalized control-based asthma management — Asthma control has two domains: symptom control and risk reduction, and in control-based asthma management treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle that involves assessment of symptom control and risk factors, treatment and review by appropriately trained personnel to achieve the goals of asthma treatment; asthma outcomes have been shown to improve after the introduction of control-based guidelines or practical tools; since 2014, GINA has emphasized personalized management of modifiable risk factors and patient preferences while non‑modifiable risk factors such as a history of past ICU admission should also be documented; for many patients in primary care, achieving good symptom control is a good guide to a reduced risk of exacerbations, and when ICSs were introduced into asthma management, large improvements were observed in symptom control and lung function with decreases in exacerbations and asthma-related mortality; however, patients with few or intermittent symptoms may be still at risk of severe exacerbations, some continue to exacerbate despite well-controlled symptoms, and side-effects may be an issue if ICS doses are stepped up, therefore both domains of asthma control (symptom control and future risk) should be considered when choosing treatment and reviewing response.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111dBNQY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Severe asthma with good response to Type 2 targeted therapy — re-evaluate the need for each asthma medication every 3–6 months, and emphasize to patients and their primary care physician that they should not completely stop ICS-containing therapy; base the order of reduction or cessation of add-on treatments on potential adverse effects, the observed benefit when the medication was started, patient risk factors, cost, and patient satisfaction. Minimizing the use of OCS is a very high priority, and after reducing/ceasing any medication, confirm asthma stability before making any further treatment changes. If asthma remains well controlled, consider ceasing other therapies, based on the above considerations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116GWX3b]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma information (Box 5–4) — goal, approach and topics: The goal is to provide the person with asthma, their family and other carers with suitable information and training to manage their asthma in partnership with their healthcare providers. Approaches include focusing on the development of the partnership, accepting that this is a continuing process, sharing information, adapting the approach to the patient's level of health literacy, fully discussing expectations, fears and concerns, and developing shared goals. Topics to include are asthma diagnosis; rationale for treatment and differences between relievers and maintenance treatments (if prescribed); potential side-effects of medications; prevention of symptoms and flare-ups with emphasis on the importance of anti-inflammatory treatment; how to recognize worsening asthma and what actions to take, including how and when to seek medical attention; and management of comorbidities.

### Asthma: guidelines-based control and management [^113trePa]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines-based management of the patient with asthma allows maximal levels of function with few adverse effects. A flexible approach to therapy that emphasizes an ongoing partnership between the patient and physician allows optimal communication, facilitating treatment adherence and maximal levels of control. Through assessment of the patient's initial severity of disease and an evaluation of the patient's ongoing level of control, appropriate medical therapy can be initiated and level of therapy can be modified based on the patient's response. Patient education, environmental control strategies, and proper use of medications are vital in achieving maximal benefit in asthma management. Excellent asthma control is possible and should be a goal of both physicians and patients.

Acute asthma — Although there is a strong emphasis on minimizing oral corticosteroid (OCS) use to reduce long-term cumulative adverse effects, OCS are essential in management of acute severe asthma, and the occurrence of any severe exacerbation should be a prompt to assess the patient thoroughly, optimize their asthma treatment, and consider referral for expert advice to reduce the risk of another exacerbation occurring; evidence about use of dexamethasone has been updated based on the latest evidence.

Asthma — biomarker-guided adjustment research needs and current practice emphasize that further studies are needed to identify subpopulations most likely to benefit and to define optimal monitoring frequency, including for corticosteroid de-escalation strategies, and that until more definitive evidence is available to support a specific strategy, GINA continues to recommend a comprehensive clinical evaluation that includes patient-reported symptoms as well as modifiable risk factors, environmental exposures comorbidities and patient preferences, when making treatment decisions for individual patients.

Where Do We Go from Here?

The NHLBI Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma Network is conducting clinical trials to further refine a biomarker-driven approach to severe asthma. A biomarker-driven strategy may also be warranted in mild asthma, although confirmatory studies are needed. These observations suggest a future in which guidelines support a precision-medicine approach to asthma management that is based on endotype and not on age and presumed disease severity (current approach). Also, the pace of discovery is only getting faster; an update every 10–15 years is unacceptable. A more agile approach to developing guidelines that retains the benefits of rigor and trustworthiness is needed. We therefore advocate for a dynamic or "living" topic-driven guideline to respond more rapidly to a new body of evidence for an individual recommendation rather than the whole guideline. Such an approach would require a greater level of collaboration between those who develop new evidence (e.g. clinical trialists), experts in evidence synthesis (e.g. guideline methodologists), and funders who can support and plan for topic-specific updates. Importantly, an update to the NAEPP 2020 update that includes the management of severe asthma is urgently needed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113pQ9XK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma pharmacotherapy for children of 5 years of age or younger — good control of asthma can be achieved in the overwhelming majority of young children with a pharmacological intervention strategy, and a stepwise treatment approach is recommended based on symptom patterns, risk of exacerbations and side-effects, and response to initial treatment; generally, treatment includes the daily, long-term use of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to keep asthma well controlled and reliever medications for as-needed symptom relief, and the choice of inhaler device is also an important consideration. When recommending treatment for a young child, both general and individual questions apply, including identifying the 'preferred' medication option at each treatment step to control asthma symptoms and minimize future risk, with decisions based on data for efficacy, effectiveness and safety from clinical trials and on observational data, considering that studies suggest factors such as allergic sensitization and/or peripheral blood count may help to better identify which children are more likely to have a short-term response to ICS, and accounting for response to previous treatment, patient characteristics that contribute to symptoms or risk of flare-ups, preferences of the parent/caregiver, and practical issues.

### Asthma: versatile treatment for a variable disease [^116wYEY1]. The Journal of Asthma (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This review describes factors contributing to the variable nature of asthma and the versatile treatment strategies required for the clinical management of the disease.

Data Sources

A comprehensive review of the literature using MEDLINE was conducted.

Study Selection

Included articles were selected for their relevance to variability or severity of asthma. Bibliographies of selected articles served as additional sources of considered publications.

Results

Asthma severity can vary substantially among patients and within individual patients because of physiologic, environmental, or behavioral factors. Inhaled corticosteroids are an effective and versatile treatment option for special populations with asthma and for patients with varying degrees of asthma severity. Inhaled corticosteroids are now the preferred treatment for all three severity levels of persistent asthma, especially in young children and pregnant women. Treatment regimens may be adjusted up or adjusted down when appropriate to maintain optimal symptom control and limit potential adverse systemic effects.

Conclusions

The clinical management of asthma is challenging given the day-to-day variability of the disease. Variability in pulmonary function and asthma symptoms may be minimized through increased awareness of the factors contributing to asthma variability as well as the effective use of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Flexible treatment strategies that consider the different severities of asthma and account for variability within individual patients may be particularly useful in improving adherence and patient outcomes.

### Medication regimens for managing stable asthma [^116Q5po1]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma was developed as a means of standardizing asthma therapies and of improving outcomes. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines provide recommendations to care providers about the routine management of asthma. There has been rapid development of new therapies for asthma, specifically with the advent of new drug delivery devices and biologic therapies for severe asthma. We are increasingly recognizing that asthma is a heterogenous disease with a diverse underlying pathophysiology, and therefore, it is imperative for care providers to begin to understand asthma phenotypes and endotypes, and the implications of these classifications on management, especially of severe refractory asthma. This article serves as a review of guideline-based therapy for asthma and includes updates on alternative therapies, new approaches that use previously recognized therapies, and special populations with asthma.

### Assessment of asthma control and its impact on optimal treatment strategy [^114uXgzA]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Achieving and maintaining optimal asthma control is a major asthma management goal advocated by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Recent evidence suggests that while asthma control is clearly achievable in most asthmatics, not all asthmatics attain optimal asthma control. The difficulty is compounded further because patients, physicians and regulatory bodies have different perceptions of what is meant by asthma control. The challenge therefore remains as to how best to assess asthma control and define management strategies to ensure that this control is achieved and maintained. Despite the availability of several patient-based tools for assessing asthma control, these are mostly employed in a research setting or in selected specialist clinics. A symptom-based treatment approach also may have its limitations because patients can be poor judges of disease symptoms and severity and under-estimation may lead to inadequate treatment of airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) when treatment is administered as on-demand reliever therapy, since the effect of treatment on these underlying features occurs over a longer time course. The clinical benefits of sustained maintenance treatment for at least 3 months has been documented in recent studies of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination, which have demonstrated correlations between reduction in airway inflammation/AHR and reduction in exacerbation rates. In view of the putative limitations of a purely symptom-based asthma management plan, we suggest that treatment should be focussed on management of all aspects of the disease rather than management of symptoms alone, with a practical approach being treatment for a minimum of 3 months with an optimal dose to ensure maximal effects are seen on asthma control, airway inflammation, lung function, and remodelling.

### BTS / NICE / SIGN guideline for asthma 2024: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management. how does this compare to GINA 2024? [^111xSVQC]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methodology and scope

The GINA Strategy report was first produced in 1995, updated annually since 2002 and provides a comprehensive review of acute and chronic asthma across a range of severities. The 2024 NICE/BTS/SIGN Guideline, principally, as the title suggests, focuses on diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management. It is important to note that management of acute and chronic severe asthma is excluded.

Updated relevant clinical evidence is reviewed by the GINA scientific committee (composed of respiratory interested physicians) based on criteriadeveloped by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in the USA. The BTS/NICE/SIGN Asthma Guideline Committee is composed of multidisciplinary members (such as primary and secondary care physicians, nurses and pharmacists) and includes patient members. Evidence is analysed and recommendations made using NICE methodologywhich significantly, in contrast to GINA, places additional emphasis on economic data, particularly cost-effectiveness. A critical value is the cost of an intervention expressed as the cost per Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) An intervention with a cost per-QALY of less than 20,000 pounds sterling (24,000 Euros) is considered as being cost-effective.

Asthma step-down — general principles: Consider stepping down when asthma symptoms have been well controlled and lung function has been stable for at least 3 months, choose an appropriate time (no respiratory infection, patient not travelling, not pregnant), approach each step as a therapeutic trial with documentation, action plan, monitoring and follow-up, and if risk factors such as a history of exacerbations or persistent airflow limitation are present, step down only with close supervision; stepping down inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) doses by 25–50% at 3-month intervals is feasible and safe for most patients.
