## Question

EULAR guidelines for crystal arthropathies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the EULAR guidelines for crystal arthropathies, specifically gout and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and which EULAR documents apply. Then, I should verify the diagnostic principles and classification criteria. Next, I will examine acute flare management, followed by long-term urate-lowering strategy and prophylaxis. After that, I need to check special populations and safety considerations. Finally, I will review CPPD-specific guidance and reconcile any discrepancies with other guidelines, before summarizing key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the scope and the guideline documents. EULAR's most authoritative, updated guidance for gout is the 2016 updated evidence-based recommendations published in 2017, which supersede the 2006 recommendations, while CPPD guidance is covered in the 2011 EULAR recommendations for calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease; I should explicitly anchor to these sources to avoid outdated or conflicting statements [^d6940733] [^25f55c58] [^7a89cff2].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic foundation is correct. Definitive diagnosis of gout rests on identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid or tophus material, whereas CPPD requires identification of calcium pyrophosphate crystals with characteristic rhomboid, weakly positively birefringent morphology; both entities can be supported by imaging, with ultrasound and dual-energy CT increasingly used for gout, and radiographs or ultrasound for chondrocalcinosis in CPPD, though I should confirm that imaging complements rather than replaces crystal analysis when feasible [^d6940733] [^ea1f1d1b] [^c39681d6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about classification. I initially thought the 2015 ACR/EULAR classification criteria could substitute for crystal proof, but wait, let me verify — those criteria were designed for research classification and epidemiology, not to replace synovial fluid analysis in clinical diagnosis; they perform reasonably well in acute settings but have lower sensitivity in early disease, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize crystal identification as the gold standard when available [^2372ace5] [^d6e5f3e8].

> Next, I should review acute gout flare management. EULAR recommends treating flares as early as possible, with first-line options including NSAIDs (with gastroprotection if indicated), colchicine using a low-dose regimen, or glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular, or intra-articular), chosen based on comorbidities and patient factors; I should double-check dosing details and safety caveats, including renal dosing for colchicine and drug–drug interactions, and note that low-dose colchicine improves the gastrointestinal tolerability profile without sacrificing efficacy [^d6940733] [^53f529f0] [^893983d0].

> I will now examine urate-lowering therapy indications and targets. EULAR supports a treat-to-target approach with lifelong maintenance of serum urate below 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L), and recommends initiating ULT in patients with recurrent flares, tophi, urate arthropathy, or renal stones, and to consider early ULT at first presentation in selected patients such as those younger than 40 years, with very high serum urate, or with comorbidities; for severe disease (tophi, chronic arthropathy, frequent attacks), a lower target of less than 5 mg/dL is advised to accelerate crystal dissolution, and I should confirm that this is framed as a stricter target rather than a routine target for all [^d44e3f77] [^ebce7886] [^839e9040] [^c3ed3875].

> Let me think about implementation details for ULT. EULAR recommends starting low and titrating every 2–5 weeks until the serum urate target is reached, with regular monitoring of serum urate; if the target is not achieved with appropriately dosed allopurinol, switching to febuxostat or adding a uricosuric (e.g., benzbromarone where available) is reasonable, with attention to renal function and contraindications; I should confirm that allopurinol dose adjustment to creatinine clearance is advised in renal impairment, and that febuxostat is an alternative when allopurinol is not tolerated or ineffective [^d44e3f77] [^4fd4f35a] [^306c2150] [^8189c911].

> But wait, what about prophylaxis during ULT initiation. I need to ensure I capture this correctly: EULAR recommends anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for at least 6 months when starting or uptitrating ULT, with colchicine 0.5–1 mg/day as first-line if not contraindicated, NSAIDs as an alternative when colchicine is unsuitable, and vigilance for toxicity, especially in renal impairment or with interacting drugs; this reduces the risk of ULT-induced flares while serum urate is changing [^6c900825] [^2f3fbfbd] [^947be412].

> I should confirm special populations and safety. In chronic kidney disease, allopurinol can be used with dose adjustment to creatinine clearance, and febuxostat is an alternative; for severe renal impairment, avoid colchicine and NSAIDs during acute flares and consider glucocorticoids or intra-articular steroids instead; I need to check for drug interactions with colchicine, particularly strong CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors like cyclosporine or clarithromycin, which are contraindicated with colchicine due to toxicity risk [^4fd4f35a] [^893983d0] [^2f3fbfbd].

> Next, I should review patient education and lifestyle. EULAR emphasizes explaining disease pathophysiology, the need for lifelong urate-lowering therapy, and the principles of acute flare management; dietary advice includes avoiding sugar-sweetened beverages, limiting purine-rich meats and seafood, moderating alcohol, and encouraging low-fat dairy, with weight loss in those with overweight or obesity; I should confirm that these measures are adjuncts to, not substitutes for, pharmacologic ULT [^8927cdec] [^7462cf4e] [^e2d28356] [^46bed03a].

> Now, I will examine CPPD-specific guidance. For acute CPP crystal arthritis, EULAR recommends NSAIDs with gastroprotection, low-dose colchicine, or intra-articular corticosteroids as first-line options, with consideration of short oral or parenteral glucocorticoids when local injection is not feasible; for chronic CPP inflammatory arthritis, options include NSAIDs, low-dose colchicine, low-dose systemic glucocorticoids, methotrexate, or hydroxychloroquine, chosen based on comorbidity and response; importantly, asymptomatic chondrocalcinosis should not be treated, and management of osteoarthritis with CPPD mirrors OA care principles [^739deeb1] [^404cac0f] [^007bc72d] [^44e8f2aa] [^80d7a36e].

> Hold on, I should verify imaging nuances for CPPD. EULAR advises that when imaging is pursued for suspected CPPD, include both symptomatic sites and the knees and wrists to improve detection of chondrocalcinosis; this helps with diagnosis and phenotyping even when patients present with symptoms elsewhere, and I need to ensure I don't overinterpret imaging in the absence of compatible clinical features [^c39681d6].

> I need to reconcile EULAR positions with other major guidelines. Compared with ACR 2020, both endorse treat-to-target ULT with serum urate less than 6 mg/dL, allopurinol as first-line ULT including in CKD with low starting doses, and anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for 3–6 months when initiating ULT; ACR is more permissive about starting ULT during a flare and places stronger emphasis on allopurinol over febuxostat due to cardiovascular safety concerns, whereas EULAR allows either xanthine oxidase inhibitor and prioritizes treat-to-target titration; ACP 2017 diverges by recommending against routine ULT after a first flare or in infrequent flares, which conflicts with EULAR's broader indications and treat-to-target stance, a discrepancy highlighted by international consensus statements favoring treat-to-target strategies [^647133e7] [^4f057803] [^cbb6c3f8] [^af19a095].

> Let me reconsider any lingering points. I should confirm that pegloticase is reserved for severe, refractory, tophaceous gout when serum urate targets cannot be achieved with maximally dosed oral therapy, and that IL-1 inhibitors are a conditional option for flares in patients with contraindications to standard anti-inflammatories; I also need to ensure I note that EULAR does not recommend maintaining serum urate below 3 mg/dL long term, to avoid overly aggressive lowering that lacks evidence of added benefit [^f8562c12] [^3d0ffebe] [^d1733b1f].

> In summary, EULAR's crystal arthropathy guidance centers on definitive crystal-based diagnosis when possible, rapid and individualized treatment of acute flares, and a treat-to-target ULT strategy with lifelong serum urate control below 6 mg/dL (and less than 5 mg/dL in severe disease), supported by prophylaxis, patient education, and comorbidity-aware dosing; CPPD management parallels this structured approach, emphasizing phenotype-guided therapy and restraint in asymptomatic cases, with imaging adjuncts to support diagnosis and phenotyping [^d6940733] [^7a89cff2] [^c39681d6].

---

EULAR guidelines for crystal arthropathies emphasize **early, individualized management** of acute flares using NSAIDs, colchicine, or glucocorticoids, with selection tailored to comorbidities and contraindications [^d6940733] [^53f529f0]. For gout, **urate-lowering therapy (ULT)** is indicated for recurrent flares, tophi, or radiographic damage, with a treat-to-target serum urate < 6 mg/dL (< 5 mg/dL in severe disease) and prophylaxis during initiation [^ebce7886] [^c3ed3875] [^6c900825]. For CPPD, management is symptom-driven, with NSAIDs, colchicine, or intra-articular steroids for flares, and no treatment for asymptomatic chondrocalcinosis [^739deeb1] [^404cac0f] [^44e8f2aa]. Both conditions require patient education, lifestyle modification, and regular monitoring to optimize outcomes [^8927cdec] [^e2d28356] [^01082296].

## Diagnostic principles

### Gout

- **Definitive diagnosis**: Identification of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in synovial fluid or tophus material [^d6940733].
- **Classification criteria**: 2015 ACR/EULAR criteria facilitate diagnosis when crystal analysis is unavailable [^2372ace5].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound and dual-energy CT (DECT) can detect MSU deposits, aiding diagnosis and monitoring [^72b79fa7].

---

### Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD)

- **Definitive diagnosis**: Identification of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in synovial fluid or tissue [^ea1f1d1b].
- **Clinical phenotypes**: Acute CPP crystal arthritis, chronic inflammatory arthritis, and osteoarthritis with CPPD [^03d6f747].
- **Imaging**: Radiographs may show chondrocalcinosis; ultrasound can detect CPP crystals [^notfound].

---

## Management of acute flares

### Gout

First-line options include **NSAIDs, colchicine, or glucocorticoids** (oral, intramuscular, or intra-articular), selected based on comorbidities and contraindications [^d6940733] [^53f529f0]. Colchicine should be started within 12 hours of flare onset, using a loading dose of 1 mg followed by 0.5 mg one hour later, with subsequent low-dose regimens [^53f529f0]. Glucocorticoids are preferred in patients with contraindications to NSAIDs or colchicine, or when these are ineffective [^notfound].

---

### CPPD

First-line options include **NSAIDs, colchicine, or intra-articular glucocorticoids**, chosen based on comorbidities and patient factors [^739deeb1] [^404cac0f]. For patients who cannot receive NSAIDs or colchicine, short oral or parenteral glucocorticoids are alternatives [^31db1e91]. Asymptomatic chondrocalcinosis should not be treated [^44e8f2aa].

---

## Long-term management and prevention

### Gout

- **Indications for ULT**: Recurrent flares, tophi, radiographic damage, or very high serum urate (> 8 mg/dL) [^ebce7886] [^7f996b19].
- **Treat-to-target**: Maintain serum urate < 6 mg/dL; < 5 mg/dL in severe disease (tophi, chronic arthropathy) [^c3ed3875] [^839e9040].
- **First-line ULT**: Allopurinol, with dose titration to target; febuxostat or uricosurics if allopurinol is contraindicated or ineffective [^d44e3f77] [^306c2150].
- **Prophylaxis**: Low-dose colchicine or NSAIDs during ULT initiation to prevent flares [^6c900825] [^2f3fbfbd].
- **Lifestyle**: Weight loss, limit alcohol, avoid sugar-sweetened drinks, limit purine intake, encourage low-fat dairy [^e2d28356] [^46bed03a].

---

### CPPD

Management is **symptom-driven**, with no ULT or chronic prophylaxis recommended. For chronic inflammatory CPPD, options include NSAIDs, colchicine, low-dose glucocorticoids, methotrexate, or hydroxychloroquine [^007bc72d]. Address metabolic comorbidities (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis) when present [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

### Comorbidities

In gout, **renal impairment** requires dose-adjusted allopurinol and caution with colchicine and NSAIDs; febuxostat is an alternative [^4fd4f35a] [^893983d0]. Cardiovascular disease warrants caution with NSAIDs and colchicine; glucocorticoids may be preferred [^notfound]. In CPPD, older adults have higher toxicity risk with NSAIDs and colchicine, so glucocorticoids may be preferred [^739deeb1].

---

### Patient education and monitoring

Patient education should cover **disease pathophysiology, treatment goals, and self-management of flares** [^8927cdec] [^7462cf4e]. Regular monitoring of serum urate, renal function, and adverse effects is essential [^01082296] [^6239eda6].

Gout is the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis worldwide, and reports show that despite availability of therapies, management is still suboptimal. The new EULAR 2016 recommendations for the treatment of gout highlight the huge development in gout therapies, and the number of drugs being trialled only continues to increase. A clinical review of the evidence that underlies the recommendations from EULAR can reveal possible gaps in the literature and avenues for future research into gout therapies.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: consensus statement of the gout, hyperuricemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) [^af19a095]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.

### An update on the management of gout [^98645b9a]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and its incidence in the UK has steadily increased from 1.5% in 1997 to 2.5% in 2012. 1,2 It is characterised by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues and usually presents with intermittent painful attacks followed by long periods of remission. 3 It has been suggested that the management of gout in the UK remains suboptimal. 1 In 2004, we concluded that there was a woeful lack of evidence to guide treatment or prophylaxis for gout, particularly with regard to choice of drug or doses. 4 The introduction of new drugs and new evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment options has led the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) to update their guidelines on the management of gout. 2,5 Nevertheless, there are differing views on target serum uric acid (SUA) levels and the role of urate lowering treatment (ULT). 2,5–7 Here, we review the latest guidance on the management of gout and consider the role of long-term ULT.

### Guidelines for management of osteoarthritis published by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism: why are they so different? [^c9bb29fc]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Because of different methodology the ACR and EULAR guidelines differ significantly in their recommendations despite an identical evidence base. Guidelines that use a strictly evidence-based approach are less likely to incur bias than those that rely more on expert consensus. Although expert consensus is useful in areas in which there are little trial data, clear delineation should be made between evidence-based statements and expert opinion. Following the dissemination of guidelines for the management of OA, emphasis should now be placed on discussion and implementation of the recommendations and subsequent revision of guidelines as new evidence comes to light.

Cross-sectional studies have shown that 17% to 86% of people with apparently asymptomatic hyperuricemia have ultrasound evidence of monosodium urate crystal deposition. These observations suggest that this deposition constitutes the first stage of the clinical gout syndrome, which has led to a revised model of disease progression and staging.

However, no longitudinal studies have been undertaken to determine whether such findings are needed for the development of gout, or to investigate pathological mechanisms responsible for the transition from asymptomatic crystalline deposit to gout. Only a prospective cohort study of people at risk who are carefully and regularly followed can answer such questions. Dual-energy computed tomography and ultrasound are the two imaging techniques that allow the visualization and quantification of MSU crystals. Ultrasound is the most widely used technique; it allows the identification of the deposit of crystals of on the surface of the cartilage and of the tophi. The DECT can detect the deposition of MSU crystals in soft tissues as long as the amount of crystals exceeds the spatial resolution of the machine.
- **Hyperuricemia Other**: Dual-energy CT and ultrasound
- DECT and ultrasound will be performed to clarify the pathological mechanisms responsible for the transition from asymptomatic crystalline deposition to gout, and the mechanisms involved in the transition from hyperuricemia to de novo crystalline deposition. Experimental: Patient at high risk for gout due to elevated serum urate concentrations. Exclusion Criteria:

- GFR < 30 mL / min / 1. 73 m² or dialysis,
- Serious illness with a poor prognosis of less than 5 years,

### Therapeutic advances in gout [^e91f3925]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent developments in the management of gout.

Recent Findings

Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gout from EULAR, quality of care indicators, and outcome measures for clinical trials have been published. The standards of gout diagnosis and management are very low. Allopurinol remains the mainstay for serum uric acid lowering therapy. In an important percentage of patients receiving allopurinol, serum uric acid levels are insufficient to promote crystal dissolution. Febuxostat, a new serum uric acid lowering drug, has shown good results. Information on uricase continues to appear. For treatment of gouty inflammation, etoricoxib (a new cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor) has been shown to be as effective as indomethacin. Finally, the association of gout with the metabolic syndrome and its comorbidities, and the newly described association of gout with myocardial infarction, bring lifestyle and dietary modifications to the front in the management of gout.

Summary

Proper gout management requires changes to the physician's attitude towards the disease; essentially: (1) an unequivocal diagnosis based in urate crystal identification, (2) a clearly settled aim of the treatment: crystal elimination from the joints and elsewhere, and (3) proper use of the available therapeutic alternatives. Promoting a proper lifestyle appears to be especially important.

Description: Objective: To develop initial American College of Rheumatology guidelines on the use of exercise, rehabilitation, diet, and additional integrative interventions in conjunction with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs as part of an integrative management approach for people with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: An interprofessional guideline development group constructed clinically relevant Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome questions.

A literature review team then completed a systematic literature review and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to rate the certainty of evidence. An interprofessional voting panel that included 3 persons with RA achieved consensus on the direction and strength of recommendations. Results: The voting panel achieved consensus on 28 recommendations for the use of integrative interventions in conjunction with DMARDs for the management of RA. Consistent engagement in exercise received a strong recommendation. Of 27 conditional recommendations, 4 pertained to exercise, 13 to rehabilitation, 3 to diet, and 7 to additional integrative interventions. These recommendations are specific to RA management, recognizing that other medical indications and general health benefits may exist for many of these interventions.

Discussion: This guideline provides initial ACR recommendations on integrative interventions for the management of RA to accompany DMARD treatments. The broad range of interventions included in these recommendations illustrates the importance of an interprofessional team-based approach to RA management. The conditional nature of most recommendations requires clinicians to engage patients in shared decision making when applying these recommendations.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^c1ebc32e]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

Recent Findings

Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade including those from the British Rheumatism Society; the European League Against Rheumatism; the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative; the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism; the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the extant guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow and initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate is infrequent. Greater education in proper management as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

Summary

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### Limitations of the current standards of care for treating gout and crystal deposition in the primary care setting: a review [^3de76f6c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article outlines several important issues regarding the management of patients with gout. The topics discussed include best practices for gout based on the most current guidelines, opportunities for improving gout management, and current and emerging therapies for gout.

Methods

[PubMed and Google Scholar databases] were search for all articles and trials published before 2016, using the key terms [hyperuricemia, gout, tophi, joint erosion, joint damage, treatment guidelines, American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), flare, comorbidity, epidemiology, adherence, serum uric acid (sUA), monosodium urate (MSU), < 6 mg/dL, MSU crystal formation, as well as individual drug names and classes of treatments of interest (allopurinol, febuxostat, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Studies were selected that presented data on gout treatment, including drugs under development, and on the management of gout from both the physician and patient perspectives. The reference lists of identified articles were searched manually for additional publications.

Findings

Gout, a progressive debilitating form of inflammatory arthritis, is caused by factors that elevate serum uric acid (sUA) levels, leading to hyperuricemia. Continued elevated sUA can result in monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. Crystal deposition can lead to chronic gout, with an increased number of flares, tophi development, and structural joint damage. The aims of gout treatment are to reduce the sUA level to < 6 mg/dL, to inhibit the formation of new crystals, and to promote the dissolution of existing crystals. Gout is often poorly managed for several reasons, including a lack of adherence to treatment guidelines by health care providers, patients' poor adherence to therapy, and differences between a provider's and patient's perspectives regarding treatment.

Implications

Patients need to be educated about their diagnosis and management of the disease, such as the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Gout treatment may also confounded by contraindications to current standards of therapy and the limitations of current treatment paradigms. Recently approved medications, as well as drugs under development, may provide new ways for reaching the sUA target and also "curing" the disease.

INTRODUCTION

Treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have largely expanded and treatment strategies have improved over the past decades. Nowadays, many patients reach remission or low disease activity when following the current EULAR recommendations and/or American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the management of RA. However, there is still a substantial proportion of RA patients that remains symptomatic even though they have been treated according to these recommendations. This patient group is referred to as having 'difficult-to-treat (D2T) RA'. This disease state is expected to affect 5%–20% of all patients with RA, depending on the specific definition used.D2T RA has recently been defined as patients who failed at least two biological/targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) with different mechanisms of action after failing conventional synthetic (cs)DMARD therapy. Additionally, patients should have signs and/or symptoms suggestive of active disease, which is perceived as problematic by the patient and/or rheumatologist. The unmet need for these patients was previously underlined by an international survey that was conducted among rheumatologists. Consequently, the importance has been acknowledged by EULAR with the approval of a Task Force on the development of management recommendations for D2T RA.

In D2T RA patients, DMARD therapy is frequently changed in routine daily practice in case of signs and/or symptoms suggestive of active disease. However, D2T RA is a heterogeneous disease state and various factors could contribute to the persistence of these signs and/or symptoms: factors related to inflammation (eg, having underlying immunological disease mechanisms driving 'true' refractory disease or treatment non-adherence), factors of non-inflammatory origin (eg, concomitant fibromyalgia) or both. All these contributing factors may require different pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies, which are reviewed in a separate systematic literature review (SLR).

Importantly, intensification or other changes in DMARD therapy to reduce inflammation may only be appropriate in patients with insufficient response to therapy due to inflammatory RA activity. Symptoms of other diseases, for example, psoriatic arthritis and polyarticular gouty arthritis, may mimic RA possibly leading to misdiagnosis of the disease. Additionally, coexistence of certain circumstances, for example, obesity, pain syndromes and osteoarthritis, may hamper proper grading of disease activity by influencing diagnostic measures. Therefore, in D2T RA, it will be important to ascertain the diagnosis of RA and the presence of inflammatory RA activity before adjusting therapeutic strategies.

Differential diagnosis for patients referred with undifferentiated EA

Previous SLR

On the basis of expert opinion, the previous 2007 EULAR recommendations advised excluding diseases other than RA before giving a definite diagnosis. These other diseases included (but were not limited to) infectious arthritis, connective tissue disease, reactive arthritis and other spondyloarthritides and crystal arthropathies.

Current SLR

In five of the six studies retrieved, RA appeared to be the diagnostic category with highest frequency, between 20% and 45% of all patients (table 2). Other diagnoses frequently noted for patients with EA in these studies were psoriatic arthritis, peripheral spondyloarthritis, crystal-induced arthritis, connective tissue disease and reactive arthritis.

Table 2
Differential diagnosis for patients referred with undifferentiated EA

Performance of current EA classification criteria

Previous SLR

Previous EULAR SLRs had not addressed this topic. Most of the current classification criteria were established < 10 years ago and the frequency of articles in this field is increasing, in particular for the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for RA.

Current SLR

The aim of the search was to retrieve studies evaluating the prognostic value (in terms of radiographic progression or persistent disease) of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for RA, ClASsification criteria for Psoratic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria and 2009 Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) criteria, for early RA, early psoriatic arthritis and early peripheral spondyloarthritis, respectively (table 3).

Table 3
Predictive performance of the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria

We decided to include in our SLR studies using 'prescription of methotrexate or (an)other DMARD(s)' as a 'proxy' for an RA diagnosis by rheumatologists, just as for the development of the criteria. We also included studies using structural damage as an external standard for evaluating 2010 ACR/EULAR performance.

We found 13 studies related to 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria. The PPVs of these criteria to predict the persistent use of DMARDs was high, around 80% in all included studies. NPVs were lower but still over 60% in all studies. Only three studies evaluated the prediction of erosive disease: 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria had high NPVs (between 70% and 100%) but low PPVs.

Studies about CASPAR or ASAS 2009 criteria were not found.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^fa894f3f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction — gout epidemiology and care gaps are highlighted, noting that gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting ∼9.2 million adults (3.9%) in the US. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines and other international specialty society guidelines recommend treat-to-target strategies with use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), yet over the past 2 decades there has been no increase in ULT utilization and adherence to ULT remains poor and is the lowest adherence among treatments for 7 common chronic medical conditions. Prior 2012 ACR Guidelines have been criticized due to low quality of evidence supporting treat-to-target recommendations, and several clinical trials since then provided additional evidence leading the ACR Guidelines Subcommittee to determine that new guidelines with updated recommendations were warranted.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^647133e7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome in gout randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the drug approval of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) by the regulatory authorities. Since there is no way to achieve the sUA target without monitoring or reassessing sUA, rheumatologists monitor sUA and aim for an sUA target level of less than 6 mg/dL. Therapeutic doses of allopurinol (100–800 mg/day) or febuxostat (40–80 mg/day) or a combination with uricosurics is often needed to achieve target sUA. Allopurinol maximum dose need not be reduced, even in the presence of renal failure, since adverse events are related to initial, and not final, allopurinol dose; pegloticase is another option. Appropriately titrated ULT doses can help achieve a near cure for gout by resolving all urate crystals.

Management

Treatment of a gout flare should be commenced as soon as possible, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine or glucocorticoids being first-line options for treatment. An open-label randomised trial comparing low-dose colchicine 500 mg three times per day for 4 days with naproxen 750 mg immediately, then 250 mg every 8 hours for 7 days found that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of pain intensity over 7 days although side effects were more common in the colchicine group, mainly diarrhoea and headache. Another randomised trial comparing oral prednisone and naproxen for monoarticular gout found that either prednisolone 35 mg once a day or naproxen 500 mg two times a day for 5 days were equally effective, and adverse effects were similar between groups. Symptomatic treatment for a gout flare includes immobilisation of the joint and use of cold packs. Anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibodies have also been found to be effective for relief of gout flaresand are generally recommended for patients experiencing gout flares where other drugs have caused side effects or were ineffective.

Long-term use of urate-lowering therapy leads to crystal dissolution, resulting in suppression of gout flares, regression of tophiand prevention of progressive joint damage. Rheumatology societies strongly recommend urate-lowering therapy for patients with tophi, evidence of radiographic damage attributable to gout or frequent gout flares. Urate-lowering therapy may also have benefit earlier in the disease course. Allopurinol is the preferred and most commonly prescribed first-line urate-lowering therapy. Second-line treatments include febuxostat, another xanthine oxidase inhibitor, probenecid, a uricosuric agent and pegloticase, a recombinant uricase administered intravenously.

A treat-to-target serum urate approach is recommended by the ACR guidelinesand EULAR recommendations. Serum urate monitoring allows the dose of medication to be titrated to a target serum urate of below 6 mg/dL (360 µmol/L) in those with symptomatic gout and often below 5 mg/dL (300 µmol/L) in those with features of severe gout such as tophi.

### Update on gout management: what is old and what is new [^bd33696f]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The global burden of gout is rising, as are the prevalence of associated comorbidities, all-cause mortality and societal costs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in epidemiology and treatment strategies for gout.

Recent Findings

Genetic factors and obesity are prominent contributors to hyperuricemia and gout, while dietary factors contribute to less variance in serum urate, though can still have some contribution to population attributable risk. A consensus statement by the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network outlined appropriate terminology regarding gout, which will aid in communication about various aspects of the disease. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology gout guideline offers comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia using urate-lowering therapy, prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy, treatment of gout flare and adjunctive management strategies. There is improved understanding of risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and well tolerated use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease. Trial data have provided new insights regarding cardiovascular risk with febuxostat. Several new drug therapies are being tested for both urate-lowering efficacy and gout flare management.

Summary

Although there have been significant advances in understanding of risk factors and treatment approaches, gout remains suboptimally managed. There is substantial need for improving gout management efforts and gout education among patients and clinicians.

Accurate classification of gout without crystal documentation for recruitment into studies is also needed, since the majority of cases of gout are managed in primary or acute care settings 17, 18, where synovial fluid aspiration and polarizing microscopy are not commonly performed. Additionally, the existing published criteria were developed at a time when advanced imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography or dual‐energy computed tomography (DECT), had not been studied; their utility for gout classification in the context of other clinical and laboratory parameters is not known.

To address these issues, an international collaborative working group to develop new classification criteria for gout was convened with the support of the ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 19. The final results are reported here.

### EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis: report of a task force of the European standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^ab2c8c16]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To formulate EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis.

Methods

In accordance with EULAR's "standardised operating procedures", the task force pursued an evidence based approach and an approach based on expert opinion. A steering group comprised of 14 rheumatologists representing 10 European countries. The group defined the focus of the process, the target population, and formulated an operational definition of "management". Each participant was invited to propose issues of interest regarding the management of early arthritis or early rheumatoid arthritis. Fifteen issues for further research were selected by use of a modified Delphi technique. A systematic literature search was carried out. Evidence was categorised according to usual guidelines. A set of draft recommendations was proposed on the basis of the research questions and the results of the literature search. The strength of the recommendations was based on the category of evidence and expert opinion.

Results

15 research questions, covering the entire spectrum of "management of early arthritis", were formulated for further research; and 284 studies were identified and evaluated. Twelve recommendations for the management of early arthritis were selected and presented with short sentences. The selected statements included recognition of arthritis, referral, diagnosis, prognosis, classification, and treatment of early arthritis (information, education, non-pharmacological interventions, pharmacological treatments, and monitoring of the disease process). On the basis of expert opinion, 11 items were identified as being important for future research.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for the management of early arthritis or early rheumatoid arthritis were developed, based on evidence in the literature and expert consensus.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^d95935e3]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the USA between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100 000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100 000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100 000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an ageing population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics and inpatient settings, and only a minority of patients achieve the SU levels required to prevent flares.

Hospital admissions provide a unique opportunity to engage patients in shared decision-making and begin the process of establishing optimal ULT. What is not known is how best to implement evidence-based treatments during hospitalizations for gout. Such strategies are essential if the rising number of gout admissions is to be countered. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in patients hospitalized with gout.

### Concordance of the management of chronic gout in a UK primary-care population with the EULAR gout recommendations [^09239d53]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess concordance of the management of chronic gout in UK primary care with the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) gout recommendations.

Methods

A postal questionnaire was sent to all adults aged > 30 years registered with two general practices. Patients with possible gout attended for clinical assessment, at which the diagnosis was verified clinically. Aspects of chronic gout management, including provision of lifestyle modification advice, use of urate-lowering therapies (ULT) including dose titration to serum urate (SUA) level, prophylaxis against acute attacks, and diuretic cessation were assessed in accordance with the EULAR recommendations.

Results

Of 4249 (32%) completed questionnaires returned, 488 reported gout or acute attacks and were invited for clinical assessment. Of 359 attendees, 164 clinically confirmed cases of gout were identified. Advice regarding alcohol consumption was recalled by 59 (41%), weight loss by 36 (25%) and diet by 42 (29%). Allopurinol was the only ULT used and was taken by 44 (30%); 31 (70%) were taking 300 mg daily. Mean SUA was lower in allopurinol users than non-users (318 vs 434 micromol/l) and was less often > 360 micromol/l in allopurinol users (23% vs 75%). Eight patients had recently commenced allopurinol; two of these also were taking prophylactic colchicine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Of 25 patients with diuretic-induced gout, 16 (64%) were still taking a diuretic.

Conclusion

Treatment of chronic gout is often suboptimal and poorly concordant with EULAR recommendations. Lifestyle advice is infrequently offered, and allopurinol is restricted to a minority. Persistent hyperuricaemia was often seen in allopurinol non-users, but was also in allopurinol users, suggesting that doses > 300 mg are often necessary.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^f69a78ca]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — evidence synthesis and recommendation rules: Systematic literature reviews, including 2 network meta-analyses (NMAs), informed PICO questions; for ULT-specific PICO questions, when there was moderate or high certainty of evidence demonstrating improvement in any 1 of serum urate (SU), gout flare, or tophi, this was sufficient to support a strong recommendation, and the strength of each recommendation was rated as strong or conditional. To become a recommendation in this guideline, at least 70% consensus of the Voting Panel was required, and applying conservative rules using the lowest level of evidence would result in a lower strength of recommendation for 2 recommendations (PICO question 2: ULT indication for patients with erosions, and PICO question 27: switching to pegloticase for ULT failure).

### An appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of gout [^c87d10a9]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the Management of Gout.

Recent Findings

The ACRs first clinical practice guidelines for the management of gout focus on recommendations for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to hyperuricaemia and the treatment and prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology employed assessed risks and benefits of alternative treatments for efficacy, safety and quality but not for cost-effectiveness. Novel recommendations include the use of either allopurinol or febuxostat for first-line urate-lowering drug therapy (ULT), screening for HLA-B✱5801 prior to initiation of allopurinol in Asians at relatively high risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity, and the use of pegloticase for patients with severe, symptomatic, tophaceous gout refractory to, or intolerant of, appropriately dosed ULTs. Appraisal and comparison with other guidelines using Guidelines International Network and Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) criteria showed good scores for scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, editorial independence and, overall quality, but not for applicability.

Summary

The ACR guidelines provide comprehensive, up-to-date, good-quality, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of gout in clinical practice but score poorly for applicability. To improve the management of gout in the community a summary of key recommendations, criteria for audit and standards of care are now required.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cbb6c3f8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Management of gout by UK rheumatologists: a British Society for Rheumatology national audit [^f60da2c2]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the concordance of gout management by UK rheumatologists with evidence-based best-practice recommendations.

Methods

Data were collected on patients newly referred to UK rheumatology out-patient departments over an 8-week period. Baseline data included demographics, method of diagnosis, clinical features, comorbidities, urate-lowering therapy (ULT), prophylaxis and blood tests. Twelve months later, the most recent serum uric acid level was collected. Management was compared with audit standards derived from the 2006 EULAR recommendations, 2007 British Society for Rheumatology/British Health Professionals in Rheumatology guideline and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence febuxostat technology appraisal.

Results

Data were collected for 434 patients from 91 rheumatology departments (mean age 59.8 years, 82% male). Diagnosis was crystal-proven in 13%. Of 106 taking a diuretic, this was reduced/stopped in 29%. ULT was continued/initiated in 76% of those with one or more indication for ULT. One hundred and fifty-eight patients started allopurinol: the starting dose was most commonly 100 mg daily (82%); in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min the highest starting dose was 100 mg daily. Of 199 who started ULT, prophylaxis was co-prescribed for 94%. Fifty patients started a uricosuric or febuxostat: 84% had taken allopurinol previously. Of 44 commenced on febuxostat, 18% had a history of heart disease. By 12 months, serum uric acid levels ≤ 360 and < 300 μmol/l were achieved by 45 and 25%, respectively.

Conclusion

Gout management by UK rheumatologists concords well with guidelines for most audit standards. However, fewer than half of patients achieved a target serum uric level over 12 months. Rheumatologists should help ensure that ULT is optimized to achieve target serum uric acid levels to benefit patients.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^aafbf4ae]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory arthritis with immune checkpoint inhibitors — frequency, presentation, differential diagnosis, and management are summarized: musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia and myalgia are common in patients receiving ICI therapy, as reported in up to 40% of those treated in clinical trials, and the most common musculoskeletal and rheumatic irAEs are arthritis, polymyalgia-like syndromes, and myositis, which seem to be more frequent with PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists and when agents are used in combination. Clinical presentations vary from involvement of large and/or small joints to oligoarthritis of large joints, features of reactive arthritis, or symmetrical polyarthritis with autoantibodies; differentials include degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis, soft tissue rheumatic disorders, crystal arthropathies, and septic arthritis, and inflammatory markers are usually very elevated. NSAIDs alone are usually not sufficient to control symptoms, and corticosteroids and synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs might be required, with intra-articular corticosteroid injections an option if only one or two joints are affected.

Methods

Research questions

This SLR was conducted following the EULAR standardised operating procedures. Three clinical questions on diagnostic issues in D2T RA patients were proposed by the fellow (NMTR), comethodologist (PMJW) and postdoctoral fellow (AH) and then approved by the steering committee (GN (convenor), JMvL (coconvenor), DvdH (methodologist) and MK (fellow)). At the first Task Force meeting, which was held in August 2018, the questions were discussed, amended and then approved by the whole Task Force.

The clinical questions were focused on diagnostic techniques for (1) the confirmation of the diagnosis of RA or a relevant differential diagnoses (either as alternative or coexisting mimicking disease), (2a) the assessment of inflammatory activity in RA patients and (2b) the assessment of inflammatory activity in patients with RA with comorbidities that might influence the assessment of inflammatory activity. Mimicking diseases deemed of interest were gouty arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, systemic lupus erythematosus, reactive arthritis, paraneoplastic syndromes, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia. Comorbidities of interest that might influence the assessment of inflammatory activity were infections, malignancies, obesity, pain syndromes (including fibromyalgia), osteoarthritis, subluxations and joint dislocations. The clinical questions were transformed into epidemiological questions using the 'Patients, Indicator test, Comparison test (ie, reference standard), Outcome format' (online supplemental file).

### Evolution of management of gout: a comparison of recent guidelines [^815e9aaa]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

Recent Findings

For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using low dose. Intra-articular, oral or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective. For management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favour with most guidelines favouring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to target of serum urate (sUA) less than 6mg/dl, and less than 5mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

Summary

Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for management of gout and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^e43ae695]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis that is characterised by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues. The natural history of articular gout is generally characterised by three periods: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, episodes of acute gout and chronic gouty arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. Published guidelines recommend their use to treat acute attacks, using maximum recommended doses for a short time.

Objectives

To assess the benefit and safety of NSAIDs (including COXIBs) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies to 7 October 2013, the 2010 and 2011 ACR and EULAR abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trial register and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy (including non-pharmacological therapies) for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain (proportion with 50% or more reduction in pain or mean pain when the dichotomous outcome was unavailable), inflammation (e.g. measured by joint swelling/erythema/tenderness), function of target joint, participant's global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (2200 participants). One trial (30 participants) of low-quality evidence compared an NSAID (tenoxicam) with placebo. It found that significantly more participants had more than 50% reduction in pain after 24 hours (11/15 participants) compared with those taking placebo (4/15 participants) (risk ratio (RR) 2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 6.72). A similar outcome was seen for more than 50% improvement in joint swelling after 24 hours (5/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 2/15 participants taking placebo; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.93). The trial did not measure function, participant global assessment of treatment success and health-related quality of life. There were no adverse events reported with the use of tenoxicam; two adverse events (nausea and polypuria) were reported in the placebo group. No between-group differences in outcome were observed after four days. Moderate-quality evidence based upon four trials (974 participants) indicated that NSAIDs and COXIBs produced similar benefits in terms of pain, swelling and global improvement, but COXIBs were associated with fewer adverse events. Pain reduction was 1.9 points on a 0- to 10-point scale with COXIBs (0 was no pain) while pain reduction with NSAIDs was 0.03 points lower or better (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.13). Joint swelling in the COXIB group was 1.64 points on a 0- to 3-point scale (0 is no swelling) and 0.13 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.34). Function was not reported. Participant-reported global assessment was 1.56 points on a 0- to 4-point scale with COXIBs (0 was the best score) and was 0.04 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.20). Health-related quality of life assessed using the 36-item Short Form showed no evidence of a statistically significant between-group difference (MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.61 to 2.60 for the physical component). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (3%) compared with NSAIDs (8%) (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.28). There was a significantly lower number of total adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (38%) compared with NSAIDs (60%) (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86). There was moderate-quality evidence based on two trials (210 participants) that oral glucocorticoids did not differ in pain reduction, function or adverse events when compared with NSAIDs. Pain reduction was 9.5 on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, pain reduction with NSAIDs was 1.74 higher or worse (MD 1.74, 95% CI -1.44 to 4.92). The trials did not assess inflammation. Function measured as walking disability was 17.4 points on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, function with NSAIDs was 0.1 lower or better (MD -0.10, 95% CI -4.72 to 4.52). The trials did not measure participant-reported global assessment and health-related quality of life. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events. There was no evidence of a difference in total number of adverse events with glucocorticoids (31%) versus NSAIDs (49%) (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.28).

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supported the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute gout. One placebo-controlled trial provided evidence of benefit at 24 hours and little or no harm. We downgraded the evidence due to potential selection and reporting biases, and imprecision. While these data were insufficient to draw firm conclusions, they did not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, other inflammatory arthritis and expert consensus, which support the use of NSAIDs in acute gout. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial although COX-2 inhibitors are likely to be associated with significantly fewer total and gastrointestinal adverse events. We downgraded the evidence due to an unclear risk of selection and reporting biases. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs were also equally beneficial in terms of pain relief. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events were similar between groups. We downgraded the evidence due to unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. There was low-quality evidence that there was no difference in function. We downgraded the quality due to unclear risk of selection bias and imprecision.

### Systematic literature review on calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) nomenclature: condition elements and clinical States – A gout, hyperuricaemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) consensus project [^a1bcbe8f]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Future analysis will be performed to evaluate the impact of the 2011 EULAR recommendations for CPPD terminology and diagnosis on the variability of the terminology.

Based on the findings from this SLR, experts in CPPD from the G-CAN membership will be invited to participate in Delphi exercises, to reach agreement on condition's state labels and definitions for use in technical and scientific communications. Subsequently, this group will develop an easily understandable statement describing CPPD in a language that can be used in conversations with the lay public, media, non-governmental organisations, funders, healthcare providers and other stakeholders (common language definition).

To conclude, contemporary CPPD nomenclature is characterised by large heterogeneity and a lack of precision in the labels used to describe all aspects of the condition. The development of agreed nomenclature would positively impact both research quality and clinical practice. The current work provides the basis for agreement regarding the labels and definitions of this condition.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^44adb76c]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout flare management — For patients experiencing a gout flare, the guideline states "we strongly recommend using oral colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular, or intraarticular) as appropriate first-line therapy for gout flares over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH", and "when colchicine is the chosen agent, we strongly recommend low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine given its similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects". For patients who are unable to take oral medications, "we strongly recommend glucocorticoids (intramuscular, intravenous, or intraarticular) over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH". If other antiinflammatory therapies are poorly tolerated or contraindicated, "we conditionally recommend using IL-1 inhibition over no therapy (beyond supportive/analgesic treatment)". As adjunctive care for a flare, "we conditionally recommend using topical ice as an adjuvant treatment over no adjuvant treatment". For colchicine dosing during flares, the guideline notes "the FDA-approved dosing should be followed (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing antiinflammatory therapy until the flare resolves)".

### Impact of disease duration and gender on the sensitivity and specificity of 2015 ACR / EULAR classification criteria for gout. cross-sectional results from an Italian multicentric study on the management of crystal-induced arthritis (ATTACk) [^d6e5f3e8]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the performance of the 2015 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) gout classification criteria in an Italian cohort of patients with crystal-induced arthritis stratified by disease duration and gender in a real-life setting.

Methods

Consecutive patients referred to Rheumatology Units for suspected acute crystal-induced arthritis were enrolled in a multicentre cohort study by the Italian Society of Rheumatology which was designed to improve the management of crystal-induced arthritis (ATTACk). To test the performance of the criteria (sensitivity and specificity), the presence of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in synovial fluid (SF) was used as gold standard. Subgroup analyses by gender and disease duration were performed.

Results

Two hundred and seventy-seven patients were enrolled. SF analysis was available in 137 (49%) patients. Complete SF analysis and ACR/EULAR scores were obtained in 44% of patients. MSU crystals were found in 66% of patients. The sensitivity and the specificity of all criteria sets were 78% (95%CI, 67–86) and 98% (95%CI, 87–100), respectively; only clinical criteria yielded 70% (95%CI, 59–80) sensitivity and 93% (95%CI, 80–98) specificity, respectively. In early-stage disease (< 2 years), the sensitivity dropped to 58% (95%CI, 39–75), while the specificity was 100% (95%CI, 85–100).

Conclusions

The ACR/EULAR criteria showed good performance in patients presenting with acute arthritis; changes were observed when a subset of criteria were used, especially in early-stage disease.

### Raising the quality of rheumatology management recommendations: lessons from the EULAR process 10 years after provision of standard operating procedures [^d7cae1af]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To increase understanding of how to raise the quality of rheumatology guidelines by reviewing European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) management recommendations, using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument, 10 years after publication of the EULAR standardized operating procedures (SOP) for the production of recommendations. It was hoped that this work could help inform improvements in guideline development by other societies and organizations.

Methods

The SOP were published in 2004 to ensure the quality of EULAR-endorsed recommendations. We reviewed 27 published EULAR recommendations for management using the AGREE II tool. This provides a framework to assess the quality of guidelines across six broad domains using 23 specific questions.

Results

Overall the EULAR recommendations reviewed have been performed to a high standard. There are particular strengths in the methodology and presentation of the guidelines; however, the results indicate areas for development in future recommendations: in particular, stakeholder involvement and applicability of the recommendations. Improvements in quality were evident in recent years, with patient representation in 9 of 15 (60.0%) recommendations published 2010–14 compared with 4 of 12 (33.3%) published 2000–09.

Conclusion

In the last 10 years the overall quality of recommendations was good, with standards improving over the decade following publication of the SOP. However, this review process has identified potential areas for improvement, especially in patient representation and provision of implementation tools. The lessons from this work can be applied to the development of rheumatology guidelines by other societies and organizations.

### Gout: update on some pathogenic and clinical aspects [^1a944d0a]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Pathogenesis of gout inflammation remains unknown, but recent advances have been made with respect to initiation, amplification, and self-limitation. Direct crystal-cell membrane contact leads to cell activation, involving membrane-associated molecules. Resolution of acute gout inflammation is a mechanism that is controlled by monocyte-macrophage switch, which results in the loss of cytokine production capability and, conversely, the ability to produce anti-inflammatory molecules. MRI and ultrasound findings provide preliminary data that are not yet used in clinical trials. Diagnosis and management recommendations are missing, but this gap will be filled soon with the upcoming European League Against Rheumatism Task Force's recommendations on gout.
