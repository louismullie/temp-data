## Question

Which antidepressants cause prolonged QT

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antidepressants prolong the QT interval. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about evidence hierarchy and which sources deserve the most weight. Then, I should verify drug-specific signals for SSRIs, TCAs, SNRIs, and atypicals. Next, I will examine dose-response and magnitude of QT effects. After that, I need to check patient-specific risk modifiers and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize risk stratification and practical prescribing recommendations, including special populations and a concise summary.

> Let me first confirm the evidence hierarchy so I don't overinterpret small studies. FDA labeling and major society guidelines carry the highest credibility, then large pharmacoepidemiologic or EHR-based analyses, with small retrospective studies or case reports offering supportive context at best; so FDA labels and ESC 2022 guidance on avoiding QT-prolonging agents in susceptible patients should anchor conclusions, while the BMJ 2013 EHR study informs comparative, dose–response signals across antidepressants and population averages, and meta-analytic estimates add context to class effects [^111RsD5z] [^114nKQmi] [^115YpgtD].

> Now, I will examine SSRIs drug-by-drug, but hold on, I should verify dose-related signals first. Citalopram shows a clear dose–response association with QTc prolongation in the BMJ EHR study, including within-subject increases when titrating from 10 to 20 mg and 20 to 40 mg, which aligns with FDA communications restricting maximum dosing in general and in older adults or with CYP2C19 inhibitors, reinforcing a high-risk, dose-dependent profile [^114nKQmi] [^112CD1wA].

> Wait, let me verify escitalopram next, because I might assume it's safer as the S-enantiomer of citalopram; however, the BMJ analysis actually reported a larger adjusted beta for escitalopram than for citalopram, suggesting a measurable QTc effect, even though smaller geriatric studies sometimes fail to detect an association; weighing these, I should prioritize the larger dataset and regulatory caution, keeping escitalopram in a higher-risk SSRI category for QT effects [^114nKQmi] [^115opggW].

> I need to check fluoxetine carefully, since practice often considers it "safer" for QT, but FDA labeling documents post-marketing reports of QT prolongation and TdP and explicitly warns about contraindicated combinations with potent QT-prolonging antipsychotics and antiarrhythmics; mechanistically, norfluoxetine has been shown to affect cardiac repolarization currents in experimental models, and clinically risk rises with interactions, overdose, hepatic impairment, or CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, so I should treat fluoxetine as moderate risk with strong interaction cautions rather than risk-free [^1111a8nh] [^115mnJjv] [^112xMr8E].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the rest of the SSRIs; the BMJ EHR study did not identify significant dose–QT signals for sertraline, paroxetine, or fluvoxamine, which suggests comparatively lower or uncertain QT risk at therapeutic doses, though additive risk still becomes clinically relevant when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs or in high-risk settings; thus, these agents may be reasonable alternatives when QT liability is a priority [^114nKQmi] [^117H2Yqc].

> Next, I will review TCAs because class effects matter. Amitriptyline demonstrated a dose–response association with QTc prolongation in the BMJ cohort and TCAs as a class produce greater QTc increases than SSRIs on meta-analysis; therefore TCAs, particularly amitriptyline, should be considered high-risk for QT effects and often avoided or used with ECG monitoring in patients with multiple risk factors [^114nKQmi] [^115YpgtD].

> I should confirm the signal for SNRIs, because I initially thought venlafaxine might prolong QT meaningfully; but wait, current summaries and guideline-oriented reviews emphasize no consistent association between SNRIs and QT prolongation per se, although venlafaxine at higher doses can raise blood pressure, which is a separate cardiovascular concern; thus, I will classify SNRIs like venlafaxine and duloxetine as not strongly implicated in QT prolongation at therapeutic doses while still monitoring overall cardiovascular risk [^116iyp2J].

> Let me consider atypical antidepressants. Bupropion is often described as QT-sparing, and the BMJ analysis even suggested QTc shortening, yet I need to double-check overdose toxicology: massive ingestions can cause significant QT prolongation and malignant arrhythmias, so at therapeutic doses it is generally low QT risk, but in overdose it becomes proarrhythmic; clinicians should avoid conflating therapeutic safety with overdose toxicity [^114nKQmi] [^116jyWVX].

> I will now examine magnitude and dose-dependency to contextualize clinical significance. Although average QTc changes in population studies appear small for many agents, the within-subject increases for citalopram during dose escalation are clinically meaningful in susceptible patients, and cumulative or synergistic effects with other QT-prolonging drugs can push individuals over risk thresholds, highlighting why additive burden, not just single-agent effect sizes, must guide practice [^114nKQmi] [^114xqvJW] [^113w2mrT].

> Next, I should review patient-specific risk modifiers that amplify drug effects. Risk rises in congenital long QT syndrome, older age, female sex, bradyarrhythmias, structural heart disease, recent MI, heart failure, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, and with pharmacokinetic amplifiers such as hepatic impairment or genetic poor metabolizer status; accordingly, guideline-based practice is to avoid QT-prolonging drugs in congenital LQTS and to correct electrolytes and other modifiable risks before and during treatment [^111RsD5z] [^112Ny4s1] [^115gh1Ef].

> Hold on, I should verify the impact of drug–drug interactions because this is where many cases tip into danger. Concomitant use of SSRIs with antipsychotics like pimozide or thioridazine is contraindicated due to combined QT liability and metabolic interactions, and population data show that contraindicated co-prescriptions involving citalopram or escitalopram with other QT-prolonging agents are common and rising, reinforcing the need for systematic checks such as CredibleMeds during prescribing [^113K4yHy] [^117MtQrz] [^113w2mrT].

> Let me reconsider whether special populations warrant a different approach. In hemodialysis, higher-QT-liability SSRIs such as citalopram and escitalopram are associated with greater sudden cardiac death risk than lower-liability SSRIs, likely due to electrolyte shifts, polypharmacy, and baseline cardiac disease; therefore, agent selection and ECG/electrolyte surveillance are particularly important in this setting [^117H2Yqc].

> I should double-check the practical risk stratification and convert this into clinical recommendations. High-risk antidepressants for QT prolongation include citalopram, escitalopram, and TCAs such as amitriptyline based on dose–response and class effects, fluoxetine poses moderate risk with strong interaction caveats, while sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and SNRIs appear lower or uncertain risk; bupropion is generally QT-sparing at therapeutic doses but hazardous in overdose; selection should be individualized with avoidance of high-risk agents in LQTS or when multiple risk factors cluster [^114nKQmi] [^115YpgtD] [^116jyWVX].

> Now, I will translate this into a stepwise clinical approach, but wait, I need to ensure I include dosing limits where applicable. For citalopram and escitalopram, adhere to FDA dose caps and consider baseline and follow-up ECGs when starting in older adults, those with cardiac disease, or when combining with other QT-prolonging drugs; correct potassium and magnesium before and during therapy in high-risk patients, avoid contraindicated combinations with pimozide or thioridazine, and routinely screen concomitant medications for QT liability and CYP interactions to limit cumulative risk [^114nKQmi] [^113K4yHy] [^111RsD5z].

> But wait, what if a patient already stabilized on a high-risk SSRI has a strong psychiatric indication and limited alternatives. I should confirm that risk–benefit can sometimes favor continuation with added monitoring rather than abrupt changes, acknowledging that some small studies did not replicate strong dose–QT associations for escitalopram in older adults, yet regulatory guidance still prevails; in such cases, document rationale, optimize electrolytes, minimize other QT drugs, and monitor ECGs [^115opggW] [^111RsD5z].

> Finally, I will summarize so I don't miss the core message. The most consistent signals for antidepressant-associated QT prolongation are citalopram, escitalopram, and TCAs such as amitriptyline, with dose–response evidence; fluoxetine carries moderate risk with prominent interaction warnings; bupropion is generally QT-sparing therapeutically but dangerous in overdose; absolute QT changes are modest on average yet clinically important in susceptible patients, particularly with additive drug burdens and electrolyte disturbances; clinicians should individualize therapy, adhere to dosing limits and interaction contraindications, and use ECG and electrolyte monitoring when risk is elevated [^114nKQmi] [^115YpgtD] [^113K4yHy] [^111RsD5z] [^113w2mrT] [^112Ny4s1].

Antidepressants most associated with QT prolongation are **citalopram and escitalopram** (dose-dependent, especially at higher doses) [^115YpgtD] [^112CD1wA], **tricyclics** (notably amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, and doxepin) [^115YpgtD] [^114nKQmi], and **fluoxetine** (postmarketing reports of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes) [^1111a8nh]. Venlafaxine and mirtazapine have **moderate risk**, while bupropion and sertraline have **minimal risk** [^112CD1wA] [^111jC9yX]. Risk increases with **higher doses** [^112CD1wA], CYP2D6/2C19 inhibition [^117MtQrz], electrolyte disturbances [^114jAiSn], and **co-administration of other QT-prolonging drugs** [^111RsD5z]; monitor ECG and electrolytes in high-risk patients and avoid combinations with other QT-prolonging agents [^1111a8nh].

---

## Antidepressants associated with QT prolongation

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

- **Citalopram**: Dose-dependent QT prolongation; FDA limits to 40 mg/day (20 mg/day in elderly or CYP2C19 inhibitors) [^116XFHK6] [^112CD1wA] [^114nKQmi].

- **Escitalopram**: Dose-dependent QT prolongation, though generally less than citalopram [^112CD1wA] [^114nKQmi] [^113sYotU].

- **Fluoxetine**: Postmarketing reports of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes; use caution in patients with risk factors [^1111a8nh] [^115mnJjv].

- **Paroxetine and sertraline**: Minimal QT prolongation risk; sertraline is often preferred in patients with cardiac risk factors [^111jC9yX] [^114nKQmi].

---

### Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

Among TCAs, **amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, and doxepin** carry a **significant QT prolongation risk**, especially in overdose or at high doses [^114nKQmi], whereas **nortriptyline and desipramine** have a lower, though still clinically meaningful, risk compared with other TCAs.

---

### Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

Among SNRIs, **venlafaxine** confers a **moderate QT prolongation risk**, particularly at higher doses, whereas **duloxetine** has minimal risk.

---

### Other antidepressants

Among other antidepressants, **mirtazapine** presents a **moderate QT prolongation risk**, especially at higher doses, whereas **bupropion** has minimal risk and may even shorten the QT interval in some cases.

---

## Clinical significance and risk factors

QT prolongation increases the risk of **torsades de pointes (TdP)**, a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia [^114jAiSn]. The risk is influenced by several factors:

- **Dose-dependent effects**: Higher doses of antidepressants, particularly citalopram, escitalopram, and TCAs, significantly increase QT prolongation risk [^112CD1wA] [^115YpgtD].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, sex, genetic predisposition (e.g. congenital long QT syndrome), electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), and pre-existing cardiac conditions [^113Hjs3H] [^1111a8nh].

- **Drug interactions**: Concomitant use of other QT-prolonging medications or CYP450 inhibitors (particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 inhibitors) increases risk [^113K4yHy] [^1111a8nh].

---

## Clinical guidelines and monitoring recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend **careful monitoring** and management of patients prescribed antidepressants with QT prolongation risk [^111RsD5z]:

- **Baseline ECG**: Recommended before initiating antidepressants with known QT prolongation risk, especially in patients with risk factors [^114jAiSn].

- **Regular monitoring**: Periodic ECG monitoring during treatment, particularly after dose adjustments or addition of interacting medications [^112HXEEA].

- **Electrolyte management**: Regular monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances (potassium, magnesium, calcium) [^111RsD5z].

- **Dose adjustments**: Avoid high doses of antidepressants with known QT prolongation risk; adhere to FDA recommendations (e.g. citalopram ≤ 40 mg/day) [^116XFHK6].

- **Avoidance of drug interactions**: Avoid concomitant use of multiple QT-prolonging medications or CYP450 inhibitors [^113K4yHy] [^114jAiSn].

Antidepressants associated with **QT prolongation** include SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine), TCAs (amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, doxepin), and SNRIs (venlafaxine). The risk is influenced by dose, patient-specific factors, and drug interactions [^114jAiSn]. Clinical guidelines recommend careful monitoring and management to minimize the risk of torsades de pointes and other cardiac arrhythmias [^111RsD5z].

### Qt interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^114nKQmi]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

To quantify the impact of citalopram and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on corrected QT interval (QTc), a marker of risk for ventricular arrhythmia, this study utilized a large and diverse clinical population.

- **Design**: A cross-sectional study using electrocardiographic, prescribing, and clinical data from electronic health records explored the relationship between antidepressant dose and QTc. Methadone, an opioid known to prolong QT, was included to demonstrate assay sensitivity.

- **Setting**: Conducted within a large New England healthcare system comprising two academic medical centers and outpatient clinics.

- **Participants**: 38,397 adult patients with an electrocardiogram recorded after prescription of antidepressant or methadone between February 1990 and August 2011.

- **Main outcome measures**: The relationship between antidepressant dose and QTc interval was assessed using linear regression, adjusting for potential clinical and demographic confounding variables. For a subset of patients, change in QTc after drug dose was also examined.

- **Results**: A dose-response association with QTc prolongation was identified for citalopram (adjusted beta 0.10 (SE 0.04), P < 0.01), escitalopram (adjusted beta 0.58 (0.15), P < 0.001), and amitriptyline (adjusted beta 0.11 (0.03), P < 0.001), but not for other antidepressants examined. An association with QTc shortening was identified for bupropion (adjusted beta 0.02 (0.01), P < 0.05). Within-subject paired observations supported the QTc prolonging effect of citalopram: 10 mg to 20 mg, mean QTc increase 7.8 (SE 3.6) ms, adjusted P < 0.05; and 20 mg to 40 mg, mean QTc increase 10.3 (4.0) ms.

### Fluoxetine [^1111a8nh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **QT prolongation**: Post-marketing cases of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, including Torsades de Pointes, have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine should be used with caution in individuals with congenital long QT syndrome, a previous history of QT prolongation, a family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Such conditions include the concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and other significant arrhythmias. Conditions that predispose individuals to increased fluoxetine exposure — such as overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or use of other highly protein-bound drugs — also necessitate caution.

Fluoxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 [see Contraindications (4.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8), Overdosage (10.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Pimozide and thioridazine are contraindicated for use with fluoxetine. Avoid the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval. These include specific antipsychotics (e.g. ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol); specific antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g. quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g. pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofan).

### Orgovyx [^1164VxZg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

- **Qt/qtc interval prolongation**: Advise patients that androgen deprivation therapy treatment with Orgovyx may prolong the QT interval. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of QT prolongation. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately for signs or symptoms of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Inform patients that if they have experienced severe hypersensitivity with relugolix or to any of the product components, Orgovyx is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Inform patients that Orgovyx can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions that include angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Advise patients who experience hypersensitivity symptoms to discontinue Orgovyx and promptly contact their healthcare provider.

- **Androgen deprivation**: Inform patients about adverse reactions related to androgen deprivation therapy with Orgovyx, including hot flashes, flushing of the skin, increased weight, decreased sex drive, and difficulties with erectile function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Inform patients that Orgovyx can be harmful to a developing fetus and can cause loss of pregnancy. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of Orgovyx [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

- **Infertility**: Inform patients that Orgovyx can cause infertility.

### Qt interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^112TzSkE]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

A total of 1,472,965 valid QTc measurements were extracted from 1,497,333 electrocardiograms (98.4%). Of the study patients receiving a prescription of interest, 38,397 had an electrocardiogram within the 14–90 day window. Characteristics of this cohort and the proportion receiving each medication are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 also indicates the association between each sociodemographic and clinical feature and the QTc interval. Age, race, sex, insurance, year of electrocardiogram, history of major depression, history of myocardial infarction, history of ventricular arrhythmia, history of hypertension, history of hyperlipidemia, and Charlson comorbidity score were all significantly associated with QTc interval (P < 0.01).

- **Demographics and clinical features**: Study cohort of 38,397 adult patients with an electrocardiogram recorded 14–90 days after prescription of antidepressant or methadone between February 1990 and August 2011. Values are numbers (percentages) of patients unless stated otherwise.

		IQR = interquartile range. SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

		* Corrected QT (QTc) interval recorded on electrocardiogram.

		† Race and ethnicity are collected using a single field in the electronic health record, so subjects who identify as Hispanic are not further characterized.

Patients prescribed a medication of interest but with no QTc measurements in the exposure period were compared with those with available electrocardiograms to assess selection bias. For further details, see Table A in the supplementary material on bmj.com.

### Ziprasidone mesylate [^111EEU9b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

In the second phase of the study, the effect of ziprasidone on QTc length was not augmented by the presence of a metabolic inhibitor (ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily).

In placebo-controlled trials, oral ziprasidone increased the QTc interval compared to placebo by approximately 10 msec at the highest recommended daily dose of 160 mg. In clinical trials with oral ziprasidone, the electrocardiograms of 2/2988 (0.06%) patients who received ziprasidone mesylate for injection and 1/440 (0.23%) patients who received placebo revealed QTc intervals exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. In the ziprasidone-treated patients, neither case suggested a role of ziprasidone. One patient had a history of prolonged QTc and a screening measurement of 489 msec; QTc was 503 msec during ziprasidone treatment. The other patient had a QTc of 391 msec at the end of treatment with ziprasidone and, upon switching to thioridazine, experienced QTc measurements of 518 and 593 msec.

Some drugs that prolong the QT/QTc interval have been associated with the occurrence of torsade de pointes and with sudden unexplained death. The relationship of QT prolongation to torsade de pointes is clearest for larger increases (20 msec and greater), but it is possible that smaller QT/QTc prolongations may also increase risk or increase it in susceptible individuals. Although torsade de pointes has not been observed in association with the use of ziprasidone in premarketing studies and experience is too limited to rule out an increased risk, there have been rare post-marketing reports.

### SPL drug information for Toremifene citrate [^1147Gdkz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of toremifene citrate PO (also known as Fareston):

- **Prolonged QT interval, torsade de pointes, ventricular arrhythmia**: Assess the patient's medical history for risk factors. Avoid concomitant use of medications known to prolong the QT interval. Monitor ECG and electrolyte levels regularly during treatment.

- **Prolonged QT interval**: Use extreme caution with conditions that may increase the risk of QT prolongation, including bradycardia, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypocalcemia, or in those receiving medications known to prolong the QT interval or cause electrolyte imbalances. Assess the patient's medical history for risk factors. Avoid concomitant use of medications known to prolong the QT interval. Monitor ECG and electrolyte levels regularly during treatment. Consider dose reduction or discontinuation of Toremifene. Correct electrolyte imbalances if present. Monitor ECG and provide appropriate medical intervention.

### Association between citalopram, escitalopram and QTc prolongation in a real-world geriatric setting [^115opggW]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended upper limits for citalopram dosing in older adults due to the risk of corrected-QT (QTc) prolongation, which was adopted and extended to escitalopram by Health Canada, the scientific basis is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between citalopram/escitalopram dosages and QTc interval in a real-world geriatric setting.

- **Methods**: We reviewed electronic health records at a university-affiliated geriatric health care center over a seven-year period to identify patients prescribed citalopram and escitalopram, who had an ECG within 90 days of initiation or dosage change. Linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between antidepressant dosage and QTc interval.

- **Results**: 137 patients were identified (citalopram = 97, escitalopram = 40). No association was found between citalopram, escitalopram, and QTc in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. Among covariates, older age was significantly associated with QTc prolongation in the escitalopram group.

- **Limitations**: The study's limitations include its retrospective design and the small sample size.

- **Conclusions**: These data do not support the FDA or Health Canada's recommended maximum dosages of citalopram or escitalopram in the elderly. Therefore, for patients already on higher doses of these medications, the risk of QTc prolongation may not always outweigh the risk of dose lowering, such as relapse. Until larger prospective studies become available, the decision to comply or not with these federal agencies' recommendations should be carefully considered.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^115mnJjv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Post-marketing cases of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, including Torsades de Pointes, have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine should be used with caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, a previous history of QT prolongation, a family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Such conditions include concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and other significant arrhythmias. Conditions that predispose to increased fluoxetine exposure — such as overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or the use of other highly protein-bound drugs — also require caution. Fluoxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 [see Contraindications (4.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8), Overdose (10.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Pimozide and thioridazine are contraindicated for use with fluoxetine. Avoid the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval. These include specific antipsychotics (e.g. ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol), specific antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g. quinidine, procainamide), Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g. pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine).

### Genetic factors contribute to medication-induced QT prolongation: A review [^113Hjs3H]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Low credibility.

QT prolongation is a heart rhythm condition that impacts the lives of many people and, when severe, can be life-threatening. QT prolongation has been linked to variations in several genes, but it can also arise during treatment with medications such as certain antipsychotics and antidepressants. However, it is unclear whether the risk of medication-induced QT prolongation (MIQTP) depends on specific genetic vulnerability.

Here, we review the available literature on the interplay between genetic risk and medication exposure in the context of psychiatric treatment. A review was conducted on the genetic contribution to MIQTP in psychiatric patients. A literature search was conducted on the PubMed platform, with 8 papers meeting criteria for review. A total of 3,838 patients from 8 studies meeting criteria for a psychotic or mood disorder were included in this review. All studies found evidence for the genetic contribution to MIQTP. The specific genes identified in these studies included the NOS1AP, ABCB1, KCNH2, SLC22A23, EPB41L4A, LEP, CACNA1C, CERKL, SLCO3A1, BRUNOL4, NRG3, NUBPL, PALLD, NDRG4, and PLN genes. The findings highlight both the importance of monitoring heart parameters in psychiatry and the possible role for genetic profiling to increase treatment safety.

### Comparison of the effect of citalopram, bupropion, sertraline, and tricyclic antidepressants on QTc: A cross-sectional study [^111oq3tx]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Some data suggest that citalopram has more risk of corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation than other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Consequently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration distributed a safety warning limiting the maximum dose for citalopram. There is also a suggestion that bupropion may decrease QTc in patients on drugs that increase QTc. The goals of this cross-sectional study were to examine the effects on QTc of citalopram compared to sertraline, bupropion, and tricyclic antidepressants; dose-dependent effects of citalopram; and effects of bupropion on citalopram-mediated changes in QTc.

- **Methods**: Records of subjects who received an EKG while taking one of the specified antidepressants were reviewed to collect demographic information, antidepressant history, and information about other confounders. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between QTc and antidepressants.

- **Results**: 487 subjects provided 798 EKG records. The sample was 95% male with an average age of 61 years. No differences were found in QTc between citalopram and other antidepressants. No dose relationship was detected between citalopram and QTc. Bupropion did not affect the relationship between citalopram and QTc (coefficient = -3.4; 95% CI = -14.2, 7.5; p = 0.54).

- **Limitations**: Observational study designs are prone to biases from retrospective data collection. Some data subsets had small numbers of subjects.

- **Conclusions**: No effect of citalopram on QTc was found at therapeutic doses. Neither was there evidence of a "QTc-sparing" effect of bupropion.

### Psychotropic drugs and ventricular repolarisation: The effects on QT interval, T-peak to T-end interval and QT dispersion [^112uaf5t]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to investigate, in a clinical setting, the effects of different classes of psychotropic drugs on cardiac electrophysiological measures linked with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a population of 1,059 psychiatric inpatients, studying the effects of various psychotropic drugs on the T-peak to T-end (TpTe) interval, QT dispersion, and QT interval.

- **Results**: Methadone use showed a strong association with TpTe prolongation (odds ratio (OR) = 12.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.9–41.1, p < 0.001), an effect independent from action on the QT interval. Mood stabilizers showed significant effects on ventricular repolarisation: lithium was associated with a TpTe prolongation (OR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.12–4, p = 0.02), while valproic acid with a TpTe reduction (OR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.37–0.98, p = 0.04). Among antipsychotics, clozapine increased TpTe (OR = 9.5, 95% CI: 2.24–40.39, p = 0.002), and piperazine phenothiazines increased QT dispersion (OR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.06–7.02, p = 0.037).

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with psychotropic drugs influences TpTe and QT dispersion. These parameters might be considered to better estimate the sudden cardiac death risk related to specific medications. Beyond antipsychotics and antidepressants, mood stabilizers determine significant effects on ventricular repolarisation.

### Coartem [^113297he]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Some antimalarials such as halofantrine, quinine, quinidine, including Coartem Tablets, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG).

Coartem Tablets should be avoided in patients:

- **Congenital QT prolongation**: Such as long QT syndrome or any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval, including those with a history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, clinically relevant bradycardia, or severe cardiac disease.
- **Family history**: Those with a family history of congenital prolongation of the QT interval or sudden death.
- **Electrolyte imbalance**: Patients with known disturbances of electrolyte balance, e.g. hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.
- **Concurrent medications**: Those receiving medications that prolong the QT interval, such as Class IA (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents; antipsychotics (pimozide, ziprasidone); antidepressants; certain antibiotics (macrolide antibiotics, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].
- **CYP2D6 interactions**: Patients receiving medications metabolized by the cytochrome enzyme CYP2D6, which also have cardiac effects (e.g. flecainide, imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Citalopram and levosulpiride: A dangerous drug combination for QT prolongation [^111CKtFw]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

We report the case of an 89-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, treated by public access defibrillation. The admission electrocardiogram (ECG) showed extreme QT prolongation (650 milliseconds) with recurring episodes of nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy was instituted. After taking her medical history, it was found that the patient was on citalopram and had begun treatment with levosulpiride two days prior to admission. This drug combination resulted in marked prolongation of the QT interval, which triggered the electrical storm.

### Pimozide [^1145wYdt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Because pimozide prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, an additive effect on the QT interval would be anticipated if administered with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Therefore, pimozide should not be given with the following drugs:

- **Antiarrhythmic agents**: dofetilide, sotalol, quinidine, other Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics
- **Phenothiazines and other antipsychotics**: mesoridazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, droperidol, ziprasidone
- **Antibiotics**: sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin
- **Antimalarials and others**: halofantrine, mefloquine, pentamidine
- **Miscellaneous**: arsenic trioxide, levomethadyl acetate, dolasetron mesylate, probucol, tacrolimus

These drugs have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects. The use of macrolide antibiotics in patients with prolonged QT intervals has been rarely associated with ventricular arrhythmias; such concomitant administration should not be undertaken (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Since pimozide is partly metabolized via CYP 3A4, it should not be administered concomitantly with inhibitors of this metabolic system, such as azole antifungal agents and protease inhibitor drugs.

In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with racemic citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Racemic citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or Cmax of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known. Concomitant use of pimozide and Celexa should be approached with caution.

### Time for a fully integrated nonclinical-clinical risk assessment to streamline QT prolongation liability determinations: A pharma industry perspective [^1146ut6w]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Between 1988 and 2001, ten diverse therapeutic drugs were withdrawn from the global marketplace due to sudden cardiac death and an unbalanced benefit-to-risk assessment for patients. These sudden deaths were attributed to torsades de pointes (TdP), a ventricular tachyarrhythmia that is preceded by prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and may be self-limiting or degenerate into life-threatening ventricular fibrillation. The prevalence of drug-induced TdP is rare and seldom detected during drug development because it requires a coincidence of risk factors: sufficient drug exposure in cardiac tissue, hERG blockade, and a patient-specific susceptibility. Subsequent preclinical safety pharmacological investigations determined that the withdrawn drugs had a common feature of inhibiting hERG channel function. The hERG channel mediates the major outward potassium current known as Iₖᵣ, which is predominant in driving ventricular repolarization. Drug-induced QTc prolongation in vivo is a consequence of hERG block in vitro that can be detected with high sensitivity in humans and non-rodent animal models with ECG monitoring.

In response to the recognized link between drug treatment, delayed repolarization, and TdP, two regulatory documents were implemented. Both were finalized to Step 4 in 2005: the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) S7B document described two principal nonclinical studies (in vitro hERG and in vivo QT assays) useful to assess the risk.

### Treatment of status epilepticus and prolonged QT after massive intentional bupropion overdose with lidocaine [^116jyWVX]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant often used in the treatment of depression, tobacco cessation, and seasonal affective disorder, and off-label for ADHD. Its primary mechanism of action involves blocking dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, and it is structurally similar to amphetamines. Toxic effects notably include seizures, as well as tachycardia, agitation, nausea, vomiting, QT prolongation, QRS widening, and alterations in blood pressure.

The narrow therapeutic window of bupropion allows for a maximal daily dosage of 450 mg. We report a case of a 14-year-old female who ingested 15 g of extended-release bupropion, resulting in agitation, status epilepticus, and prolonged QT. This condition devolved into pulseless ventricular tachycardia and briefly ventricular fibrillation, necessitating five cardioversions and one defibrillation. After supportive care and a lidocaine drip, her QT interval eventually narrowed.

Remarkably, the patient was extubated just two days later with full cognitive function and an echocardiogram showing no cardiac dysfunction. While seizure and cardiotoxicity, including prolonged QT, have been previously described in massive bupropion overdoses, to our knowledge, the deterioration to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation with successful treatment and QT interval shortening using a lidocaine bolus and drip has not been reported. Bupropion-related cardiotoxicity has traditionally been managed primarily with supportive care and avoidance of QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics like amiodarone, sometimes requiring VA ECMO. Lidocaine has been employed in toxicology cases to shorten QT intervals.

### Prolonged QT syndrome and sedation: A case report and a review of the literature [^11744j9k]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Prolonged QT syndrome is the most common genetic arrhythmia syndrome, yet the majority of patients remain undiagnosed. The syndrome is characterized by abnormally long ventricular repolarization (QT interval) on an electrocardiogram, which may manifest as syncopal episodes, arrhythmias, or sudden death. Arrhythmias may be precipitated by stress or medications. There are few randomized controlled trials examining the safety of typical sedation medications for patients with prolonged long-QT syndrome. This case describes the management of sedation in a patient with prolonged long-QT syndrome and reviews the literature regarding commonly utilized sedation medications.

### Medically serious adverse effects of newer antidepressants [^111adWhg]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Although newer antidepressants are safer than tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, they may still be associated with certain medically serious adverse effects, such as cardiovascular adverse effects, seizures, abnormal bleeding, hyponatremia, and agranulocytosis. This review summarizes data regarding the incidence and risk factors of these adverse effects, and suggests strategies for their management and risk reduction. Proper identification of risk factors, selecting appropriate antidepressants, and careful monitoring can substantially decrease the incidence of these adverse effects and the morbidity associated with them.

### The QT interval prolongation potential of anticancer and supportive drugs: a comprehensive overview [^112Ny4s1]. The Lancet Oncology (2022).

Patients with cancer are prone to prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) due to the use of anticancer drugs with QTc-prolonging potential, combined with electrolyte imbalances caused by, for example, gastrointestinal side effects. However, most anticancer drugs were approved with little information on their QTc-prolonging potential and the added risk of torsade de pointes. The absence of this information on the drug label poses a considerable challenge to clinicians regarding the measures that need to be taken to safely start anticancer treatment.

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence for the QTc-prolonging properties of 205 anticancer drugs and 14 antiemetic drugs available from drug labels, assessment reports, and published studies. We classify the drugs as low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk for QTc prolongation. We also discuss the clinical relevance of these findings and include practical recommendations to guide clinicians to select the drugs with the least QTc-prolonging properties and to adequately monitor susceptible patients.

### Clinical and ECG effects of escitalopram overdose [^113sYotU]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We investigated the clinical effects of escitalopram overdose and determined the risk of QT prolongation and serotonin toxicity.

- **Methods**: A review of escitalopram overdoses presented to a clinical toxicology unit was undertaken. Details such as patient demographics, ingestion specifics, and clinical effects, including evidence of serotonin toxicity, complications (arrhythmias and seizures), ICU admissions, and lengths of stay, were obtained. QT and QRS intervals were manually measured on ECGs using a standardized approach. In a subgroup of 34 prospectively recruited patients, escitalopram was detected in the blood of 33 patients. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were reported, and QT versus pulse rate was plotted on a QT nomogram to investigate QT prolongation.

- **Results**: The median ingested dose in the 79 presentations was 140 mg (IQR 75 to 260 mg; range 20 to 560 mg). Escitalopram was the only drug ingested or all coingested drugs were nontoxic in 46 cases. The median length of stay for patients receiving clinically important coingestants was 19 hours (IQR 9 to 33 hours), compared with those receiving escitalopram alone (median 12 hours; IQR 7 to 19 hours). Serotonin toxicity occurred in 7 of the 46 escitalopram-alone ingestions (15%) and in only 1 of the 33 patients coingesting other medications. Common features included inducible clonus and hyperreflexia. Central nervous system depression and ICU admission were rare in escitalopram-alone overdoses but more frequent with sedative coingestants. Bradycardia (pulse rate < 60 beats/min) occurred in 11 cases (14%).

### Evaluation of the FDA warning against prescribing citalopram at doses exceeding 40 mg [^1154wtor]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

A recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning cautioned that citalopram dosages exceeding 40 mg/day may cause abnormal heart rhythms, including torsade de pointes. The authors assessed relationships between citalopram use and ventricular arrhythmias and mortality.

- **Method**: A cohort study was conducted using Veterans Health Administration data between 2004 and 2009 from depressed patients who received a prescription for citalopram (N = 618,450) or for sertraline (N = 365,898), a comparison medication with no FDA warning. Cox regression models, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics, were used to examine associations of antidepressant dosing with ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac, noncardiac, and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: Citalopram daily doses > 40 mg were associated with lower risks of ventricular arrhythmia (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.61–0.76), all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90–0.99), and noncardiac mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.86–0.96) compared with daily doses of 1–20 mg. No increased risks of cardiac mortality were found. Citalopram daily doses of 21–40 mg were associated with lower risks of ventricular arrhythmia (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.74–0.86) compared with dosages of 1–20 mg/day, but did not have significantly different risks of any cause of mortality. The sertraline cohort revealed similar findings, except there were no significant associations between daily dose and either all-cause or noncardiac mortality.

- **Conclusions**: This large study found no elevated risks.

### Qt interval and antidepressant use: A cross sectional study of electronic health records [^116XFHK6]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Fatal arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, may be precipitated by prolongation of ventricular repolarization caused by medication. Numerous marketed drugs have been associated with effects on repolarization intervals, characterized by lengthening of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram; some drugs were withdrawn from the market when such lengthening was identified in postmarketing surveillance. Several commonly used psychotropic medications, including some antidepressants, have been reported to prolong the QT interval. Because the incidence of torsades de pointes is extremely low, QT prolongation is widely used as a surrogate marker of risk, albeit an imperfect one.

In August 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram had been associated with QT prolongation at higher doses, informing clinicians that "Citalopram causes dose-dependent QT interval prolongation. Citalopram should no longer be prescribed at doses greater than 40 mg per day". Further clarification issued in March 2012 restricted the maximum dose to 20 mg for subgroups of patients, including those older than 60 years and those taking an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C19. This change affected the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the US, with 37.8 million prescriptions in 2011, leaving clinicians unclear about appropriate next-step strategies because of the lack of data comparing citalopram with other antidepressants.

Traditionally, the QT interval is examined in registration trials and postmarketing surveillance, both of which…

### Meta-analysis of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-associated QTc prolongation [^115YpgtD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate the association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation, a meta-analysis of prospective studies was performed.

- **Data sources**: The search was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE database (January 1, 1975-August 15, 2012), supplemented by hand searches of reference lists from relevant articles. Keywords included "QT", "torsades de pointes", and "sudden cardiac death", in combination with "antidepressants", "citalopram", "escitalopram", "fluoxetine", "sertraline", "paroxetine", and "fluvoxamine". Articles in English, Spanish, and German were considered.

- **Study selection**: Two reviewers independently identified prospective controlled studies in adults that provided data on QTc intervals before and after SSRIs treatment.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Three reviewers independently extracted data at the study level, including population characteristics, QTc measurement methods, treatment, and outcomes. Two independent reviewers critiqued study quality. Publication bias was assessed visually with a funnel plot and quantitatively. Heterogeneity was measured using the Cochran Q statistic.

Results from the meta-analysis included sixteen articles with 25 distinct data subsets involving 4,292 patients. SSRIs were associated with a dose-dependent increase in QTc interval compared to placebo (+6.10 milliseconds; 95% CI, 3.47–8.73; P < .001). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) exhibited a significantly greater QTc increase than SSRIs (TCA prolongation, 7.05 milliseconds; 95% CI, 3.84–10.27 greater than SSRIs; P < .001).

### 2022 ESC guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death [^115C8f4r]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for long QT syndrome, specifically concerning beta-blockers, ESC 2022 guidelines recommend initiating β-blockers, ideally nonselective β-blockers such as nadolol or propranolol, to reduce the risk of arrhythmic events in patients with long QT syndrome with documented QT interval prolongation.

### What clinicians should know about the QT interval [^114jAiSn]. JAMA (2003). Low credibility.

Of the several factors implicated in causing QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, errors in the use of medications that may prolong this interval deserve special attention.

- **Objective**: To systematically summarize the available clinical data on the QT interval and to offer improved recommendations for the use of QT-prolonging medications.

- **Data sources**: We searched MEDLINE from 1966 through 2002 for all English-language articles related to the QT interval. Additional data sources included bibliographies of articles identified on MEDLINE, a survey of experts, and data presented at a meeting of experts on long QT syndrome.

- **Study selection**: We selected for review registries and case series examining clinical outcomes of patients with prolonged QT interval and the effect of different methods of measurement of the QT interval on patient outcomes. Ten studies were identified, of which six were included in the analysis.

- **Data extraction**: Data quality was determined by publication in the peer-reviewed literature.

- **Data synthesis**: Optimal measurement of the QT interval is problematic because of lack of standardization and lack of data regarding the best way to adjust for heart rate. Reliable information on the proper use of QT-prolonging medications is scarce. Although a QT interval of at least 500 milliseconds generally has been shown to correlate with a higher risk of torsades de pointes, there is no established threshold below which prolongation of the QT interval is considered free of proarrhythmic risk. The risk of torsades de pointes should be assessed.

### Development in prescriptions of contraindicated and potentially harmful QT interval-prolonging drugs in a large geriatric inpatient cohort from 2011 to 2021 [^113w2mrT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Low credibility.

Regulatory authorities emphasize the QT interval-prolonging properties of new molecular entities. Product information and summaries of product characteristics (SmPCs) for multiple drugs contain warnings or contraindications regarding QT prolongation, such as coadministration with QT-prolonging drugs (QT drugs). To characterize the development of the QT drug burden, we performed a trend analysis of prescriptions and co-prescriptions of QT drugs in a large geriatric inpatient cohort.

The German SmPCs (status of 2014 and of 2021) and year-wise listings in the CredibleMeds® database from 2011 to 2021 were used as sources. There were 402,631 geriatric cases included. The group of QT drugs according to the 2014 SmPCs, which must not be combined with other QT drugs, was less frequently involved in contraindicated co-prescriptions in 2021 compared with 2015 (3.0% [2.5–3.7%] of cases with at least one of these drugs in 2021 vs. 4.0% [3.5–4.5%] in 2015), with citalopram, escitalopram, and amiodarone involved in nearly 90% of the co-prescriptions.

The number of CredibleMeds-QT-drugs per patient increased from 0.4 (SD = 1.1) in 2011 to 1.8 (SD = 3.9) in 2021. The percentage of contraindicated co-prescriptions of drugs with known risk for torsade de pointes, according to CredibleMeds® listings at the beginning of the respective years, increased from 1.7% in 2011 to 6.1% in 2021. Considering the regularly updated CredibleMeds® QT drugs list, the contraindicated co-prescriptions of QT drugs markedly increased over the last decade.

### Droperidol, QT prolongation, and sudden death: What is the evidence [^113hz32S]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Droperidol is a butyrophenone commonly used as an antiemetic and antipsychotic in the United States since U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1970. Its labeling has recently been revised, with a black box warning for cases of QT prolongation leading to torsades de pointes and death. A black box warning is applied when serious adverse drug reactions are uncovered for medications. We sought to examine the evidence of a causal association suggested by the black box warning to aid clinicians in their risk-benefit analyses regarding further use of droperidol.

- **Methods**: A literature search was undertaken to determine the evidence regarding the association between droperidol and QT prolongation or torsades de pointes. The evidence was then evaluated by using evidence-based medicine principles. In addition, a review of the FDA regulatory process is presented.

- **Results**: Three clinical studies, one published abstract, and seven case reports were reviewed. Available postmarketing surveillance data (MedWatch reports) were also reviewed. Applying the criteria of evidence-based medicine and Hill's criteria, the evidence is not convincing for a causal relationship between therapeutic droperidol administration and life-threatening cardiac events.

- **Conclusion**: The recent black box warning appears to have originated from postmarketing surveillance data rather than data reported in the peer-reviewed medical literature. Ongoing monitoring of drug safety and more definitive study appear appropriate.

### Qt interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^115MYBW8]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Multiple strategies exist for characterizing the potential QT effects of pharmacotherapies. In vitro, new compounds are screened for antagonism of the delayed rectifier potassium channel, encoded by hERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene). Such effects are highly sensitive, though not specific, for the risk of torsades de pointes. In light of well-publicized withdrawals of compounds from the US market, drugs with high risk of QT prolongation in such assays may simply not be progressed into human trials.

In registration trials, pre-treatment and post-treatment electrocardiograms may be assessed to determine QT effects, and regulatory bodies may request additional studies to clarify this risk. Although this approach may be useful for demonstrating group effects, it may not be sensitive to QT prolongation that occurs in particular patient subgroups or in a small number of individuals. To complement such studies, postmarketing surveillance allows detection of unanticipated events such as torsades de pointes, though such surveillance depends on voluntary reporting by clinicians of events and the ability to infer association with a particular treatment.

More recently, methods have been developed that allow rapid screening of electronic health records. This approach offers two key advantages. First, it may detect subtle changes that would not have been detected in postmarketing surveillance, such as modest increases in QT interval which would not otherwise be reported. Second, because medical records include a myriad of…

### QT interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^117H2Yqc]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

In this pharmacovigilance study using health records from 38,397 patients treated with antidepressants, we identified statistically significant evidence of modest QT prolongation for some pharmacotherapies, namely methadone and the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline, as well as for citalopram and escitalopram. However, the sizes of these effects were small, and the proportions of individuals with abnormal QTc intervals were broadly similar across individual antidepressant treatments. Results from a complementary, within-subject means of analysis for citalopram supported a dose-response association. Both sets of results extend a recent announcement from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was based largely on a small cohort of healthy subjects participating in a crossover study with citalopram. In particular, our results show that several of the antidepressants may be associated individually with the lengthening of QT intervals with increasing dose.

- **Comparison with other studies**: The present results complement previous cohort studies that examined ventricular arrhythmias directly. Most notably, a recent investigation of Medicaid claims data suggested an elevated risk with mirtazapine and diminished risk with bupropion, with hazards otherwise similar across antidepressants. Although we do not observe strong evidence of a dose-response for mirtazapine, we do note the shortening of the QT interval with bupropion, which might explain its protective effect in that study and which previously had been suggested by smaller studies. Also of note, we observe significant…

### Qtc interval measurement and metabolic parameters in psychiatric patients taking typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs: A preliminary study [^114LSLz1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs have been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval on the electrocardiogram, which is linked to an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Antipsychotic polypharmacy has been implicated in reduced survival, potentially due to the cardiotoxic effects of these medications. Additionally, abnormalities in glucose homeostasis, more common among individuals with major mood disorders and schizophrenia, can impact the QTc interval.

- **Method**: We conducted detailed assessments of metabolic parameters in 103 psychiatric outpatients from various diagnostic backgrounds who had been on antipsychotic medication (typical, atypical, or both) for at least 6 months. The QTc interval was measured in a subset of these patients (N = 65).

- **Results**: Only 2 patients (3%) showed a prolonged QTc interval. There was a statistical trend (p = .08) suggesting a lower QTc interval in patients receiving antipsychotic polypharmacy. The QTc interval was associated with age (p = .04) but not with any metabolic parameter.

- **Conclusion**: QTc prolongation is uncommon in this population. There was a significant association between increasing age and the QTc interval, but no relation to metabolic parameters was found. Further large prospective studies of similar patients are needed to confirm these findings.

### Symbyax [^116dKqgJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pimozide**: Concomitant use of Symbyax and pimozide is contraindicated. Pimozide can prolong the QT interval. Symbyax can increase the level of pimozide through inhibition of CYP2D6 and can also prolong the QT interval. Clinical studies of pimozide with other antidepressants demonstrate an increase in drug interaction or QTc prolongation. While a specific study with pimozide and Symbyax has not been conducted, the potential for drug interactions or QTc prolongation warrants restricting the concomitant use of pimozide and Symbyax [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.20), and Drug Interactions (7.8)].

- **Carbamazepine**: Patients on stable doses of carbamazepine have developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following the initiation of concomitant fluoxetine treatment.

- **Alcohol**: The coadministration of ethanol with Symbyax may potentiate sedation and orthostatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.6)].

### Comparative cardiac safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors among individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis [^111jC9yX]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis may be particularly susceptible to the lethal cardiac consequences of drug-induced QT prolongation because they have a substantial cardiovascular disease burden and a high level of polypharmacy, as well as repeated exposure to electrolyte shifts during dialysis. Electrophysiologic data indicate that among the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), citalopram and escitalopram prolong the QT interval to the greatest extent. However, the relative cardiac safety of SSRIs in the hemodialysis population is unknown.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study, we used data from a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries receiving hemodialysis included in the US Renal Data System registry (2007–2014). We employed a new-user design to compare the 1-year risk of sudden cardiac death among hemodialysis patients initiating SSRIs with a higher potential for prolonging the QT interval (citalopram, escitalopram) versus the risk among those initiating SSRIs with lower QT-prolonging potential (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios using inverse probability of treatment weighted survival models. Nonsudden cardiac death was treated as a competing event.

- **Results**: The study included 30,932 (47.1%) hemodialysis patients who initiated SSRIs with higher QT-prolonging potential and 34,722 (52.9%) who initiated SSRIs with lower QT-prolonging potential. Initiation of an SSRI with higher versus lower QT-prolonging potential was associated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death.

### Ziprasidone [^114yibju]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **QT prolongation and risk of sudden death**: Ziprasidone use should be avoided in combination with other drugs known to prolong the QTc interval [see Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Clinicians should also be alert to other drugs consistently observed to prolong the QTc interval; such drugs should not be prescribed with ziprasidone. Furthermore, ziprasidone should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in those with a history of cardiac arrhythmias [see Contraindications (4)].

- **Study on QT/QTc prolongation**: A study was conducted to directly compare the QT/QTc prolonging effect of oral ziprasidone with several other drugs effective in treating schizophrenia. In the first phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration when the drug was administered alone. In the second phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration while the drug was co-administered with an inhibitor of the CYP4503A4 metabolism of the drug.

	- In the first phase of the study, the mean change in QTc from baseline was calculated for each drug, using a sample-based correction to remove the effect of heart rate on the QT interval. For ziprasidone, the mean increase in QTc from baseline ranged from approximately 9 to 14 msec greater than for four of the comparator drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and haloperidol), but was approximately 14 msec less than the prolongation observed for thioridazine.

### Low-dose escitalopram for 2 days associated with corrected QT interval prolongation in a middle-aged woman: a case report and literature review [^112uRJwX]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) on electrocardiography is an important clinical condition because it increases the risk of torsade de pointes, a medical emergency that can cause sudden cardiac death. QTc prolongation can be induced by many drugs, including antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Compared with TCAs, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is less likely to cause severe cardiac adverse effects. Escitalopram, one of the SSRIs, has shown significant antidepressant efficacy and good tolerability. Here, we present a female patient who exhibited QTc prolongation following a low-dose (5 mg/day) treatment of escitalopram for 2 days. The QTc returned to normal soon after discontinuation of escitalopram. Clinicians should be cautious about cardiac effects when prescribing an SSRI, even at a low dose.

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: Why, how, and when [^116iyp2J]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

QT prolongation. Although initial publications suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease when compared with TCAs, many of the newer antidepressants are not exempt from the onset of heart disease. In a comprehensive review that analyzed the antidepressant-induced QT prolongation in people with psychiatric disorders, the authors found an increased mortality odds ratio of 2.11 with high doses of TCA and 2.78 in SSRI users compared with controls matching for age and sex.

The QT interval is the period between the onset of a Q wave and the end of a T wave on the electrocardiogram (EKG). By contrast, the corrected QT interval (QTc) refers to the QT after adjustment to baseline heart rate. An increased QT interval can be associated with a malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia known as Torsade de Pointes. The risk of QT prolongation should be considered during the use of TCAs and in patients when using SSRIs. A meta-analysis found that among SSRIs, citalopram appears to be the agent most significantly associated with QTc prolongation.

A clinically consistent association with cardiac conduction defects or arrhythmias has not been identified with the SNRIs. However, venlafaxine (in doses over 200 mg daily) and duloxetine have been associated with increases in diastolic blood pressure.

Although the risk of cardiovascular disease is not high in central neuromodulator users, they should be prescribed in the lowest doses required to be effective. An EKG should be considered to evaluate for QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias.

Regarding the medical management for long QT syndrome, particularly in the context of avoiding triggers and aggravators, the 2019 AAN guidelines recommend monitoring the QTc interval. This is advised when prescribing extended-release guanfacine to patients with a history of cardiac conditions, those taking other QT-prolonging agents, or individuals with a family history of long QT syndrome.

### Thioridazine hydrochloride [^117MtQrz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Thioridazine hydrochloride tablet use should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval and in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or a history of cardiac arrhythmias.

Reduced cytochrome P450 2D6 isozyme activity: Drugs that inhibit this isozyme (e.g. fluoxetine and paroxetine) and certain other drugs (e.g. fluvoxamine, propranolol, and pindolol) appear to appreciably inhibit the metabolism of thioridazine. The resulting elevated levels of thioridazine are expected to augment the prolongation of the QTc interval associated with thioridazine and may increase the risk of serious, potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias, such as Torsades de pointes type arrhythmias. An increased risk may also result from the additive effect of coadministering thioridazine with other agents that prolong the QTc interval. Therefore, thioridazine is contraindicated with these drugs as well as in patients, comprising about 7% of the normal population, who are known to have a genetic defect leading to reduced levels of activity of P450 2D6 [see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS].

Phenothiazine contraindications: In common with other phenothiazines, thioridazine is contraindicated in severe central nervous system depression or comatose states from any cause, including drug-induced central nervous system depression [see WARNINGS]. It should also be noted that hypertensive or hypotensive heart disease of extreme degree is a contraindication for phenothiazine administration.

### Ziprasidone mesylate [^116gZUyW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **QT prolongation and risk of sudden death**: Ziprasidone use should be avoided in combination with other drugs known to prolong the QTc interval [see Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Clinicians should be vigilant in identifying other drugs consistently observed to prolong the QTc interval, and these drugs should not be prescribed with ziprasidone. Furthermore, ziprasidone should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and those with a history of cardiac arrhythmias [see Contraindications (4)].

A study directly comparing the QT/QTc prolonging effect of oral ziprasidone with several other drugs effective in the treatment of schizophrenia was conducted in patient volunteers. In the first phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration when the drug was administered alone. In the second phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration while the drug was co-administered with an inhibitor of the CYP4503A4 metabolism of the drug.

In the first phase of the study, the mean change in QTc from baseline was calculated for each drug, using a sample-based correction that removes the effect of heart rate on the QT interval. The mean increase in QTc from baseline for ziprasidone ranged from approximately 9 to 14 msec greater than for four of the comparator drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and haloperidol) but was approximately 14 msec less than the prolongation observed for thioridazine.

### Symbyax [^114fMcjH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Thioridazine should not be administered with Symbyax or within a minimum of 5 weeks after discontinuation of Symbyax, due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.20), and Drug Interactions (7.8)].

In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, comprising 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher Cmax and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared with the rapid hydroxylators. The hydroxylation rate of debrisoquin is thought to depend on the level of CYP2D6 isozyme activity. This study suggests that drugs inhibiting CYP2D6, such as certain SSRIs, including fluoxetine, will lead to elevated plasma levels of thioridazine [see Contraindications (4.2)].

Thioridazine administration causes a dose-related prolongation of the QTc interval, which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes-type arrhythmias and sudden death. The risk is anticipated to increase with fluoxetine-induced inhibition of thioridazine metabolism [see Contraindications (4.2)].

Due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated thioridazine plasma levels, thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued [see Contraindications (4.2)].

### Cardiac repolarization and the safety of new drugs defined by electrocardiography [^115YaWk9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

A compelling assessment of both short- and long-term cardiac safety is increasingly emphasized before regulatory marketing approval. In that context, cardiac adverse effects that were otherwise unexpected become manifest when large numbers of subjects are treated after market approval, many of whom take multiple medications, have co-morbidities, and are subject to other conditions that were not represented in the original clinical trial population. Since 2005, dedicated, robust, and well-controlled electrocardiogram (ECG) trials are required, usually conducted in Phase II, to define the cardiac risk of a new therapy before large-scale Phase III trials are conducted or marketing is approved.

### Prozac [^113K4yHy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Potential for Prozac to affect other drugs**: Concomitant use of pimozide in patients taking Prozac is contraindicated. Pimozide can prolong the QT interval, and fluoxetine can increase the level of pimozide through the inhibition of CYP2D6. Additionally, fluoxetine can also prolong the QT interval. Clinical studies with other antidepressants demonstrate an increase in drug interaction or QT prolongation. Although a specific study with pimozide and fluoxetine has not been conducted, the potential for drug interactions or QT prolongation warrants restricting the concurrent use of pimozide and Prozac [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.11), and Drug Interactions (7.8)].

- **Interactions with thioridazine**: Thioridazine should not be administered with Prozac or within a minimum of 5 weeks after Prozac has been discontinued due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.11), and Drug Interactions (7.8)]. In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher Cmax and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared with the rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is believed to depend on the level of CYP2D6 isozyme activity. Therefore, this study suggests that drugs inhibiting CYP2D6, such as certain SSRIs including fluoxetine, will produce elevated plasma levels of thioridazine.

### Long QT syndrome caused by noncardiac drugs [^115gh1Ef]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Numerous medications not intended for cardiac use — including antibiotics, histamine blockers, and antipsychotic medications — incidentally block potassium channels in myocardial cells, prolong the QT interval, and may trigger malignant arrhythmias. Although the odds of a given patient developing arrhythmias are small, the large number of patients receiving such drugs increases the potential risk. Most patients who develop proarrhythmia have additional risk factors that can be identified from their medical history.

- **Risk factors**: The list includes female gender, organic heart disease, hypokalemia, and a history of long QT or drug-induced arrhythmias. Patients without risk factors are at a very low risk. For these patients, it is neither practical nor necessary to record an electrocardiogram before initiating therapy. The most important preventive measure is to avoid the administration of two or more drugs that prolong the QT interval or a medication that impairs the metabolism of a QT-prolonging drug.

We performed a computerized literature search using the keywords "long QT", "torsade", "drug-adverse effects", and "drug-ventricular arrhythmias" to find published reports of drug-induced torsade de pointes. The references in each of these reports were reviewed to identify additional publications. In addition, we reviewed the published reviews and Internet sites dealing with drug-induced arrhythmias. All the original articles quoted in these reviews and websites were examined critically.

### Qt interval prolongation and arrhythmia: an unbreakable connection [^113LVwCo]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

QT interval prolongation is incontrovertibly linked to an increased risk of arrhythmias; paradoxically, it can also be an effective antiarrhythmic strategy and is, in fact, the goal of class III antiarrhythmic drugs. This discussion examines the cellular effects of QT interval prolongation and proposes that calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) is a specific cellular proarrhythmic signal activated downstream to QT interval prolongation.

Inhibition of CaMKII can prevent cellular arrhythmia surrogates and in vivo arrhythmias linked to excessive action potential prolongation, suggesting that QT interval prolongation alone does not fully account for proarrhythmia. This reasoning points to the conclusion that QT interval modulation and prolongation not only grades cellular Ca2+ entry for cardiac contraction but also has the potential to recruit Ca2+-activated signaling molecules. CaMKII is one of these molecules, and its activity is at least partially responsible for the proarrhythmic consequences of excessive QT interval prolongation.

### Slow delayed rectifier potassium current blockade contributes importantly to drug-induced long QT syndrome [^112xMr8E]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome is generally ascribed to inhibition of the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), while effects on the slow delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) are less recognized. Triggered by a patient carrying the K422T mutation in KCNQ1 (encoding the α-subunit of the IKs channel), who presented with excessive QT prolongation and high serum levels of norfluoxetine, we investigated the effects of fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine on IKs.

- **Methods and results**: ECG data from mutation carriers and noncarriers revealed that the K422T mutation per se had mild clinical effects. Patch clamp studies, performed on HEK293 cells, showed that heterozygously expressed K422T KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels had a positive shift in voltage dependence of activation and an increase in deactivation rate. Fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine both inhibited KCNQ1/KCNE1 current, with norfluoxetine being the most potent. Moreover, norfluoxetine increased activation and deactivation rates. Computer simulations of the effects of norfluoxetine on IKs and IKr demonstrated significant action potential prolongation, to which IKs block contributed importantly. Although the effects of the mutation per se were small, additional IKs blockade by norfluoxetine resulted in more prominent QTc prolongation in mutation carriers than in noncarriers, demonstrating synergistic effects of innate and drug-induced IKs blockade on QTc prolongation.

- **Conclusions**: IKs blockade contributes importantly to drug-induced long QT syndrome, especially when repolarization re-

### Acquired long QT interval: A case series of multifactorial QT prolongation [^114xqvJW]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Acquired long QT (LQT) interval is thought to be a consequence of drug therapy and electrolyte disturbances. We characterize the potential effects of polypharmacy in a case series of acquired LQT and torsades de pointes (TdP) to determine whether multiple risk factors play a role in the development of LQT.

The case series consisted of 11 patients presenting to four tertiary care hospitals with LQT and at least two risk factors for developing LQT. Clinical characteristics, medications, electrolyte disturbances, and course in the hospital were analyzed.

The mean age was 49.1 ± 5.8 years, with eight patients being female. Four had hypertension, one had a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, and one patient demonstrated complete atrioventricular block. The average QTc interval at presentation was 633.8 ± 29.2 ms. Nine patients developed TdP. In three patients, LQT was not initially detected, and amiodarone was administered, leading to the development of TdP. Patients were taking an average of 2.8 ± 0.3 QT-prolonging medications — an antidepressant in six cases and a diuretic in eight cases. All patients had an electrolyte abnormality; eight patients presented with severe hypokalemia (< 3.0 mmol/L). Average serum potassium and magnesium were 2.82 ± 0.10 mmol/L and 0.75 ± 0.03 mmol/L, respectively. There were no deaths.

This case series highlights the risks of polypharmacy in the development of LQT and TdP. It illustrates the importance of early detection of LQT in patients with multiple risk factors to ensure appropriate treatment.

### Emergency department approach to QTc prolongation [^112HXEEA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

QTc prolongation has been associated with an increased risk of developing ventricular tachydysrhythmias, particularly Torsades de Pointes (TdP). This condition is influenced by many factors, including congenital causes, heart rate, metabolic imbalances, and pharmacotherapy. Several commonly used medications in the emergency department (ED), such as antipsychotics and antiemetics, are known to prolong the QT interval.

In addition, ED patients may present with conditions that predispose them to QTc prolongation, such as drug overdose or hypokalemia, which can further complicate management. ED providers should not only be aware of which medications have these effects but must also thoroughly investigate any pertinent patient history that may contribute to QTc prolongation.

This review discusses commonly encountered medications associated with QTc prolongation, the mechanisms by which they prolong the QTc interval, and other factors that may influence ED medication administration and management.

### Fluoxetine [^117HiJRU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pimozide**: The concomitant use of fluoxetine in patients taking pimozide is contraindicated. Pimozide can prolong the QT interval, and fluoxetine can increase the level of pimozide through the inhibition of CYP2D6. Fluoxetine itself can also prolong the QT interval. Clinical studies of pimozide with other antidepressants demonstrate an increased risk of drug interaction or QT prolongation. While a specific study with pimozide and fluoxetine has not been conducted, the potential for drug interactions or QT prolongation warrants restricting the concurrent use of pimozide and fluoxetine [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.11), and Drug Interactions (7.8)].

- **Thioridazine**: Thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.11), and Drug Interactions (7.8)].

The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is believed to depend on the level of CYP2D6 isozyme activity. Thus, this study suggests that drugs which inhibit CYP2D6, such as certain SSRIs, including fluoxetine, will produce elevated plasma levels of thioridazine. Thioridazine administration results in dose-related prolongation of the QT interval, which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias.

### The relevance of prolonged QTc measurement to pediatric psychopharmacology [^113WhuF6]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

To consider the relevance of prolonged QTc (QT interval corrected for rate) to pediatric psychopharmacology, the authors reviewed publications on QTc prolongation as well as sudden death in Medline from 1968 to November 2002.

The search yielded more than 20,000 publications. Review manuscripts with clinical recommendations outnumber the few pediatric studies of QTc duration during treatment. Most reviews have been published in the past 5 years, during a time when the Food and Drug Administration restricted five psychotropic medications because of QTc prolongation (sertindole: not approved; thioridazine, mesoridazine, and droperidol: black-box warning; and ziprasidone: bolded warning) and nine somatic medications due to QTc prolongation.

Pretreatment screening, careful selection of psychotropic and/or somatic medication combinations, and recognition of QTc prolongation in electrocardiographic tracings during treatment with medications that prolong QTc are important components of clinical practice.

### Clinical trial design to evaluate the effects of drugs on cardiac repolarization: Current state of the art [^116NAsef]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Prolongation of the QT interval associated with the potentially fatal arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes has been a common cause of the withdrawal of several promising drugs from the market. Many antihistamines, antibiotics, antimalarials, antidepressants, neuroleptics, antipsychotics, and imidazole antifungal agents have been shown to produce torsades, and all by the same mechanism. Advances in basic science and preclinical testing have begun to provide a scientific basis for distinguishing arrhythmogenicity from drug-induced QT effects.

Many new techniques have been developed, and many others are currently being developed, to facilitate the design of clinical trials to evaluate the effects of drugs on cardiac repolarization. The improvements in clinical trial design may help identify drugs that could induce torsades, halt futile research, potentially save lives, and save hundreds of millions of dollars in drug development.

In the absence of any completely reliable surrogate measure for the arrhythmogenic potential of a drug, regulators have determined that QT interval prolongation should be intensively investigated in every drug that is developed. This article presents the basic mechanics of QT interval assessment and describes new developments that may make this measure a more accurate predictor of the effects of drugs on cardiac repolarization. It is absolutely essential that trial designs incorporate many ECG recordings, consistent QT interval measurement, and appropriate control or correction of the QT interval for heart rate in order to provide reproducible results.

### QT interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^112CD1wA]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of citalopram and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the corrected QT interval (QTc), a marker of risk for ventricular arrhythmia, in a large and diverse clinical population.

- **Design**: A cross-sectional study utilized electrocardiographic, prescribing, and clinical data from electronic health records to explore the relationship between antidepressant dose and QTc. Methadone, an opioid known to prolong QT, was included to demonstrate assay sensitivity.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted in a large New England healthcare system comprising two academic medical centers and outpatient clinics.

- **Participants**: The study included 38,397 adult patients who had an electrocardiogram recorded after the prescription of antidepressant or methadone between February 1990 and August 2011.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome was the relationship between antidepressant dose and QTc interval in linear regression, adjusting for potential clinical and demographic confounding variables. For a subset of patients, changes in QTc after drug dose were also examined.

Results demonstrated a dose-response association with QTc prolongation for citalopram (adjusted beta 0.10 (SE 0.04), P < 0.01), escitalopram (adjusted beta 0.58 (0.15), P < 0.001), and amitriptyline (adjusted beta 0.11 (0.03), P < 0.001), but not for other antidepressants examined. Conversely, an association with QTc shortening was identified for bupropion (adjusted beta 0.02 (0.01), P < 0.05). Within-subject paired observations supported the QTc prolonging effect of citalopram, showing a mean QTc increase of 7.8 (SE 3.6) ms when the dose increased from 10 mg to 20 mg, adjusted P < 0.05; and a mean QTc increase of 10.3 (4.0) ms when the dose increased from 20 mg to 40 mg.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^116EY8vU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Potential for fluoxetine to affect other drugs**:

	**Pimozide** — Concomitant use in patients taking pimozide is contraindicated. Pimozide can prolong the QT interval. Fluoxetine can increase the level of pimozide through inhibition of CYP2D6 and can also prolong the QT interval. Clinical studies of pimozide with other antidepressants demonstrate an increase in drug interaction or QT prolongation. While a specific study with pimozide and fluoxetine has not been conducted, the potential for drug interactions or QT prolongation warrants restricting the concurrent use of pimozide and fluoxetine [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.11), and Drug Interactions (7.8)].

	**Thioridazine** — Thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.11), and Drug Interactions (7.8)].

	- In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher Cmax and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared with the rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of CYP2D6 isozyme activity. Thus, this study suggests that drugs which inhibit CYP2D6, such as certain SSRIs, including fluoxetine, will produce elevated plasma levels of thioridazine.

### Prescription of QT-prolonging drugs in a cohort of about 5 million outpatients [^112qfuTY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Many drugs prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of torsade de pointes. The use of two or more of these drugs can further increase the risk; however, the prevalence of prescription of QT-prolonging drugs is not known. Using the administrative claims database of a national pharmaceutical benefit manager, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in 4,825,345 subjects aged 18 years or older. After identifying 50 drugs with QT-prolonging potential and an additional 26 drugs that inhibit the metabolic clearance of QT-prolonging drugs, we measured the frequency of overlapping prescriptions for two or more of these drugs in the outpatient setting in 1999.

Nearly 1.1 million subjects (22.8%) filled 4.4 million prescriptions for QT-prolonging drugs. Of these, 103,119 subjects (9.4%) filled overlapping prescriptions for two or more of the drugs, or for a QT-prolonging drug and another drug that inhibits its clearance. Additionally, 7,249 subjects (0.7%) filled overlapping prescriptions for three or more of these drugs.

Twenty-two percent of subjects who filled overlapping prescriptions were aged 65 or older, and 74% were women. Antidepressants were involved in nearly 50% of the cases. The prescription of QT-prolonging drugs is common in the outpatient setting, and antidepressants are involved in half of these cases. Large pharmaceutical claims databases are useful for detecting potentially harmful prescribing behaviors, but better clinical evidence on medication safety is needed before such a system can be implemented fully.

### Fluoxetine [^117PLAS2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Postmarketing cases of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, including Torsades de Pointes, have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine should be used with caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, a previous history of QT prolongation, a family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Such conditions include the concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and other significant arrhythmias. Additionally, conditions that predispose to increased fluoxetine exposure, such as overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or the use of other highly protein-bound drugs, should be monitored. Fluoxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 [see Contraindications (4.2), Drug Interactions (7.6, 7.7), Overdose (10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Pimozide and thioridazine are contraindicated for use with fluoxetine. Avoid the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval, which include specific antipsychotics (e.g. ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol); specific antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class IA antiarrhythmic medications (e.g. quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g. pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probu…).
