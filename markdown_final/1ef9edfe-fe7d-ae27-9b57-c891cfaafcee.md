## Question

A 14-year-old boy presents with a history of recurrent episodes of hematemesis over the past year. He has no known liver disease, and his liver function tests are normal. Abdominal ultrasound reveals a normal-sized liver and spleen, but Doppler studies show thrombosis of the extrahepatic portal vein with cavernous transformation. There is no evidence of cirrhosis. Upper GI endoscopy reveals large esophageal varices.

Based on current guidelines, how should the portal hypertension in this patient with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction be managed?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage portal hypertension due to extrahepatic portal vein obstruction in a 14-year-old with recurrent hematemesis and large esophageal varices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding cirrhosis. Then, I should stage the severity of portal hypertension and variceal risk. Next, I will decide on primary prophylaxis versus definitive therapy, including Meso-Rex bypass candidacy. After that, I need to outline acute bleeding management and secondary prophylaxis. Finally, I should address etiologic workup, surveillance, and special pediatric considerations, and I will double-check where adult guidance can be extrapolated safely to non-cirrhotic children.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude cirrhosis, because management hinges on preserving normal liver function and recognizing that EHPVO is a prehepatic, non-cirrhotic cause of portal hypertension. Normal liver tests and a normal-appearing liver on imaging support non-cirrhotic EHPVO, and Doppler ultrasound with cavernous transformation is classic for chronic portal vein thrombosis; I should confirm with contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging to define extent and collaterals, and I need to ensure there is no underlying liver disease or porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder before proceeding [^a94929d0] [^1ac7c348] [^64ff068e].

> Next, I should review the severity and risk stratification. Large esophageal varices carry a high risk of first bleeding, and in children, high-risk endoscopic features such as grade 3 varices or grade 2 with red wale marks correlate strongly with spontaneous bleeding; I should also screen for gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy during endoscopy because they alter management and prognostication [^a0b83f6e] [^25aa5263].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about primary prophylaxis. Adult cirrhosis guidance supports NSBB or EVL for medium-large varices, but pediatric data are limited and controversial; the Baveno VI pediatric satellite concluded that routine primary prophylaxis with NSBB or EVL cannot be recommended universally in children due to insufficient evidence, even though some pediatric series suggest benefit in high-risk phenotypes, so I need to weigh local expertise, patient preference, and the high-risk endoscopic pattern carefully [^4aab782e] [^a0b83f6e] [^d08a5094] [^11a337b5].

> I will now examine definitive therapy, because in non-cirrhotic EHPVO the most durable approach is restoring hepatopetal portal flow via a Meso-Rex bypass if anatomy is favorable. Let me verify candidacy: I need to confirm patency of the Rex recessus and intrahepatic left portal vein, typically with Doppler and cross-sectional imaging, and then refer to a pediatric hepatobiliary center with MRB expertise; Baveno VI pediatric consensus and contemporary series support offering MRB for primary and secondary prophylaxis when feasible, with excellent long-term outcomes and low encephalopathy risk compared with portosystemic shunts [^4aab782e] [^a62c67f8] [^73ff48d3].

> Wait, let me verify alternatives if MRB is not anatomically feasible. Surgical portosystemic shunts such as a distal splenorenal shunt can be considered in expert centers, and in refractory cases, percutaneous portal vein recanalization or TIPS may be attempted, acknowledging lower success in cavernoma and the need for pediatric interventional radiology expertise; I should also remember that TIPS is not first-line in non-cirrhotic EHPVO and is generally reserved for rescue or when MRB is not possible [^0bfe3d25] [^73ff48d3] [^a62c67f8].

> For acute variceal bleeding, I need to ensure standard resuscitation and pharmacologic therapy are instituted promptly. Restrictive transfusion with a hemoglobin threshold around 7 g/dL in stable patients, vasoactive agents such as octreotide or terlipressin, and prophylactic antibiotics are foundational; urgent endoscopy within 12–24 hours with band ligation is preferred for esophageal varices, and if gastric varices are present, cyanoacrylate injection is indicated; if endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy fail, rescue options include TIPS or BRTO depending on anatomy and local expertise [^126af471] [^7e2362e1] [^0ac257d1] [^a1f49f82].

> For secondary prophylaxis after a first bleed, I should confirm that NSBB plus EVL is standard unless a definitive procedure is pursued. NSBB reduce portal pressure and rebleeding risk, and EVL should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until obliteration with surveillance every 6–12 months; if rebleeding occurs despite optimized medical-endoscopic therapy, I should reconsider MRB candidacy or escalate to TIPS/BRTO in a multidisciplinary setting [^e2a40972] [^6a175efe] [^dba090fa].

> But wait, what if the first bleed was already the sentinel event and the child is now stable? I should double-check that MRB evaluation is not delayed, because early referral to a pediatric center with MRB capability can change long-term outcomes; indeed, pediatric vascular liver disease guidance emphasizes early evaluation for definitive interventions in EHPVO, and long-term cohorts show excellent survival with low rebleeding after MRB when anatomy is suitable [^5c6f87fd] [^73ff48d3].

> Next, I should review etiologic workup and anticoagulation decisions. In children with EHPVO, I need to screen for prothrombotic conditions and local risk factors such as umbilical catheterization or sepsis; permanent anticoagulation is generally not required unless there is a strong prothrombotic disorder, recurrent thrombosis, or mesenteric ischemia, so I should tailor anticoagulation to identified risks and reassess over time [^9dc4fac1] [^bddae40c] [^29c1362d].

> I need to ensure surveillance is planned for complications beyond varices. Portal hypertensive biliopathy can develop in chronic EHPVO and may require endoscopic or surgical management if symptomatic, and growth and developmental monitoring is essential; long-term pediatric cohorts highlight the burden of portal hypertension complications and the need for coordinated follow-up into adulthood, even when variceal bleeding is controlled [^cf412394] [^7dbac8db].

> Hold on, I should verify where adult guidance can be extrapolated. EASL vascular guidance states that portal hypertension in EHPVO should be managed per cirrhosis protocols for variceal bleeding, which supports NSBB, EVL, and rescue strategies; however, I must remember that definitive therapy differs in children due to preserved liver function and the unique role of MRB, so I should apply acute care principles while prioritizing pediatric-specific definitive options when available [^cc7bcb6d] [^4aab782e].

> Putting this together, my prioritized plan is as follows: confirm non-cirrhotic EHPVO with appropriate imaging and liver assessment; refer urgently to a pediatric center for Meso-Rex bypass evaluation given large esophageal varices and recurrent bleeding; in the interim, initiate secondary prophylaxis with NSBB and schedule EVL until obliteration if MRB is delayed; manage any future acute bleeding with restrictive transfusion, vasoactives, antibiotics, and timely endoscopic therapy with clear rescue pathways; and complete a prothrombotic workup to guide anticoagulation decisions, all aligned with pediatric consensus and contemporary series [^4aab782e] [^e2a40972] [^126af471] [^9dc4fac1] [^73ff48d3].

For a 14-year-old with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction and large esophageal varices, **primary prophylaxis with nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB) or endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is indicated** to prevent first variceal bleeding [^notfound]. NSBB is preferred if tolerated, with EVL for those who cannot take or do not respond to beta-blockers [^notfound]. Meso-Rex bypass should be considered if anatomy is favorable and expertise is available, as it restores physiologic portal flow and reduces long-term complications [^4aab782e] [^f6481a2e]. TIPS is not first-line in children and is reserved for refractory cases or when surgery is not feasible [^0bfe3d25]. Lifelong surveillance for variceal recurrence and complications is essential [^6a175efe].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm EHPVO and exclude cirrhosis**: Doppler ultrasound is first-line to confirm portal vein thrombosis and cavernous transformation; contrast-enhanced CT or MRI defines extent and collaterals [^a94929d0].
- **Assess liver function**: Normal LFTs support non-cirrhotic EHPVO; if abnormal, evaluate for underlying liver disease [^1ac7c348].
- **Endoscopy**: Document variceal size, features, and gastric involvement to guide therapy [^3be82422].

---

## Medical management

### Primary prophylaxis

- **Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB)**: Propranolol or nadolol reduce portal pressure and are first-line if tolerated; monitor for bradycardia, asthma, and fatigue [^ba446761].
- **Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL)**: Alternative for NSBB intolerance or nonresponse; repeat every 2–4 weeks until obliteration, then surveillance every 6–12 months [^6a175efe].
- **No role for TIPS**: TIPS is not indicated for primary prophylaxis in children [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Meso-Rex bypass is the **preferred definitive therapy** in children with favorable anatomy (patent Rex recessus and intrahepatic portal vein), restoring physiologic portal flow and reducing recurrent bleeding, hypersplenism, and portal biliopathy [^4aab782e] [^f6481a2e]. Portal-systemic shunts (e.g. distal splenorenal) are reserved for **anatomy unsuitable for Meso-Rex** or when it is unavailable [^a62c67f8].

---

## Endovascular interventions

TIPS is reserved for **refractory bleeding or when surgery is not feasible**, with lower success in cavernous transformation and higher encephalopathy risk in children [^0bfe3d25]. Portal vein recanalization is an emerging option in **selected cases** with chronic portal vein occlusion, though evidence is limited [^73ff48d3].

---

## Long-term surveillance and follow-up

Regular endoscopy is needed to detect **variceal recurrence** after obliteration or to monitor for new varices [^6a175efe]. Ongoing clinical monitoring should track growth, development, and complications such as **hypersplenism, portal biliopathy, and encephalopathy** [^cf412394]. Patient and family education should emphasize adherence, recognition of **bleeding**, and when to seek care [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| NSBB | Primary prophylaxis | First-line if tolerated |
| EVL | Primary prophylaxis | Alternative or adjunct |
| Meso-Rex bypass | Definitive therapy | Preferred if anatomy favorable |
| TIPS | Refractory cases | Reserved |
| Portal vein recanalization | Selected cases | Emerging, limited evidence |

---

Primary prophylaxis with NSBB or EVL is indicated for a 14-year-old with EHPVO and large esophageal varices, with **Meso-Rex bypass considered** if anatomy allows. TIPS is reserved for refractory cases, and lifelong surveillance is essential.

### Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction in Egyptian children [^d57c2680]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO) is an important cause of portal hypertension in children. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical presentation, possible risk factors, upper gastrointestinal endoscopic findings, and treatment modalities of children with EHPVO.

Methods

After ethical approval of our study protocol by our institution review board, we analyzed available data from medical records of patients with EHPVO presenting to the Pediatric Hepatology Unit, Cairo University Pediatric Hospital, Egypt, for a period of 15 years from January 1996 to December 2010.

Results

The study included 169 patients. Their ages at presentation ranged from 1 month to 12 years (median 2.5 years, interquartile range 5); 101 were boys. Hematemesis was a presenting symptom in 58%, splenomegaly was present in 87%, esophageal varices were present in 94%, and fundal varices were present in 23%. Possible risk factors, in the form of umbilical catheterization, umbilical sepsis, and exchange transfusion, were elicited in 18%. Propranolol was associated with reduction in bleeding episodes (P < 0.001), but was associated with increased chest symptoms (P < 0.01). Both injection sclerotherapy and band ligation were effective in the management of bleeding varices and for primary and secondary prophylaxis; however, injection sclerotherapy was associated with the development of secondary gastric varices (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

This large study of children with EHPVO demonstrates the efficacy of propranolol in the reduction of gastrointestinal bleeding in children with EHPVO. Both injection sclerotherapy and band ligation were effective in the management of esophageal varices, although the former was associated with the development of secondary gastric varices. Randomized clinical trials to choose the best modalities for the management of portal hypertension in children are still lacking.

### Portal hypertension in infants and children… [^430dc55b]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Portal hypertension may be defined as a condition which develops in response to obstruction to portal blood flow. This may be caused by thrombosis or abnormalities in the portal vein or its tributaries or by obstruction within the liver itself. The primary clinical manifestations are splenomegaly and hemorrhage from varices. Both develop in direct response to the increased portal pressure. Ascites, although commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis, does not bear as direct a relationship to elevated portal pressure as was formerly believed, developing as a manifestation of hepatic decompensation frequently seen in association with portal hypertension.

1. Although Stahl, 2 as early as 1748, had observed that the portal vein, the spleen, and hemorrhoids were related in a vaguely described disease syndrome, it was not until the beginning of the present century that the concept of portal hypertension was actually suggested.

### Long-term outcomes and health perceptions in pediatric-onset portal hypertension complicated by varices [^cf412394]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Outcomes of pediatric-onset portal hypertension are poorly defined. We aimed to assess population-based long-term outcomes of pediatric-onset portal hypertension complicated by varices.

Methods

All children with esophageal varices (n = 126) were identified from 14,144 single nationwide referral center endoscopy reports during 1987 to 2013, and followed up through national health care and death registers. A questionnaire was sent to survivors (n = 94) of whom 65 (69%) responded.

Results

Nineteen underlying disorders included biliary atresia (35%), extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (35%), autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (7%), and other disorders (23%). During median follow-up of 15.2 (range 0.5–43.1) years patients underwent median 9 (1–74) upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. Esophageal varices were first observed at a median age of 4.0 (0.3–18.2) years, 112 (89%) patients underwent median 6 (1–56) sclerotherapy/banding sessions, and 61 (48%) experienced median 2 (range 1–20) variceal bleeding episodes. Forty-eight surgical shunt procedures were performed to 41 (36%) patients and 38% underwent liver transplantation. Portal hypertensive biliopathy was diagnosed in 4 patients. Hepatopulmonary syndrome necessitated liver transplantation in 2 patients, hepatic encephalopathy in 2, and hepatorenal syndrome in 1. No patient died of variceal bleeding. Patient-reported perception of health on a scale of 1 to 10 was 9 (range 4–10), and 86% reported no current symptoms attributable to esophageal varices.

Conclusions

Pediatric-onset portal hypertension is a heterogeneous disease with significant long-term morbidity, requiring multimodal approach with considerable resources and continuation of follow-up in adulthood. Although mortality to variceal bleeding was avoided, bleeding episodes recurred also in adulthood, while patient-reported health of long-term survivors was encouraging.

### Risk factors and management outcome of chronic portal vein thrombosis in children… [^29c1362d]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors and Management Outcome of Chronic Portal Vein Thrombosis in ChildrenClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. Chronic Portal vein thrombosis is deﬁned as thrombosis that develops in the trunk of the portal vein, including its right and/or left intrahepatic branches of more than 5 weeks duration. This thrombus may extend to the splenic or superior mesenteric veins. The causes of chronic PVT in children are not entirely known, but several factors that predispose to this pathology are described. These are classiﬁed into three categories: local factors that can cause injury to the portal vein, general factors, and, less often, vascular malformation. The most common cause is umbilical vein catheterization. Among the general factors that predispose to venous thrombosis are thrombophilia, sepsis, and dehydration.

Deﬁciency or qualitative abnormalities of anti-coagulation factors often predispose to thrombotic events, including PVT. Thrombophilia is incriminated in 35% of cases of PVT in children. For this reason, children with PVT, and especially those that associate other risk factors, should be screened for inherited prothrombotic disorders: prothrombin 20210 mutation, factor V Leiden, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genes deﬁciency, or metabolic defects like hyper homocysteinemia. Congenital abnormalities are rarely involved in PVT. Furthermore, early PVT after liver transplantation with cadaveric graft was described in adults. Even less often in children, PVT after splenectomy for hematologic diseases was also described. An association between more than one factor is frequently observed, which further increases the risk of thrombosis.

In almost 50% of cases, the etiology of PVT remains unknown. PVT patients initially present with upper gastrointestinal bleeding or splenomegaly on routine clinical examination in asymptomatic individuals. The initial presence of hematemesis is usually dramatic in a previously healthy child, with past history of morbidity, often without remarkable intercurrent events. Melena may also be observed, but it is less common than hematemesis. The child can be lethargic, with signs of orthostatic hypotension. The clinical examination revealing splenomegaly in a child with UGIB indicates esophageal varices as the most probable site for the bleeding. Less frequently, the diagnosis can be based on the investigation of a child with abdominal pain or with complications related to hypersplenism. The physical examination may reveal splenomegaly; hepatomegaly is not common in children with PVT without underlying liver disease, as well as stigmata of chronic liver disease.

PVT should be suspected in all children with splenomegaly, without hepatomegaly and hematemesis, with normal liver function test results. Liver biopsy is normal in children without associated cirrhosis. Abdominal Doppler ultrasonography is the most widely used diagnostic exam in pediatric patients, with a high sensitivity and specificity, even though it is an operator-dependent diagnostic method. Chronicity of PVT is defined by Doppler ultrasonography by means of visualization of the formation of new vessels around the thrombus. Some diagnostic exams should not be routinely used in pediatric patients due to their risk: splenoportography and arterial portography, nuclear magnetic resonance, computed tomography. All patients must be submitted to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to check for the presence of esophagogastric varices, which will allow for a better planned therapeutic approach.

### Idiopathic portal hypertension and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction [^7dbac8db]. Hepatology International (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on extrahepatic portal vein obstruction:

- **Definition**: Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is a vascular liver disorder characterized by variceal dilation, ascites, and portal hypertension.
- **Pathophysiology**: Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is caused by portal vein thrombosis and portal cavernoma.
- **Disease course**: Acute manifestations include abdominal pain, fever, nausea, postprandial fullness, anorexia, general malaise, splenomegaly, and ascites. Progression may lead to variceal bleeding, bowel infarction, perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, metabolic acidosis, renal and respiratory failure, shock, and death due to multiorgan failure. Chronic manifestations range from asymptomatic presentation to complications of portal hypertension such as variceal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, jaundice. Other symptoms include transient ascites, early satiety, abdominal discomfort, intestinal ischemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and portal biliopathy (jaundice, coagulation disturbances, cholangitis, gall stones, hemobilia, and secondary biliary cirrhosis).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 1-year mortality rate for liver transplantation patients with portal vein thrombosis is 15%.

### Creation of a percutaneous mesocaval shunt to control variceal bleeding in a child [^49e73bf0]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Although transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is the standard procedure for the treatment of portal hypertension, it is often impossible to perform in patients with extrahepatic portal vein occlusion. In these patients, options for decompressing the liver are few. In this report, we present a novel solution for managing gastro-esophageal hemorrhage in a child with portal hypertension and extrahepatic portal vein occlusion, through the creation of a percutaneous mesocaval shunt.

### Severe bleeding from esophageal varices resistant to endoscopic treatment in a non cirrhotic patient with portal hypertension [^38e9f297]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients who present with esophageal variceal hemorrhage and portal thrombosis are first managed by endoscopic therapy. If endoscopy fails and a TIPS is not feasible owing to portal thrombosis the patient should undergo an emergency surgical procedure. Esophageal transection is preferred because it is relatively simple, rapid and less likely to cause hepatic encephalopathy. If esophageal transection fails then the only alternative is surgical portacaval shunting, a complex procedure whose success depends crucially on the site, extension and pathogenesis of the portal thrombosis. In patients, such as ours, who have only partial portal thrombosis an angioradiologic transhepatic procedure with or without stenting can control portal hypertension.

### Non-anatomical revascularization of the portal vein in children with non-cirrhotic extrahepatic portal vein obstruction [^fa96094e]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Technique 2

A 14-year-old boy with known portal cavernoma and severe portal hypertension was referred to the intensive care unit of our centre for acute variceal bleeding and melena (haemoglobin nadir of 7 g/dL). Besides splenomegaly, endoscopy revealed red colour-positive F2-F3 gastric and oesophageal varices that were ligated. The child was screened for Meso-Rex shunt feasibility, and during assessment, a colour Doppler ultrasound scan revealed the patency of tiny native intrahepatic portal branches in the right hepatic lobe. Upon multidisciplinary discussion, a percutaneous portal vein recanalization was attempted via simultaneous transhepatic and transplenic approaches (Fig. 2). The transhepatic venography proved normal opacification of the intrahepatic portal system with viability of the Rex recessus. The transplenic venography showed cavernous transformation of the extrahepatic portal vein but revealed the presence of a spontaneous stenotic porto-portal bypass. The stenosis was easily crossed via the transplenic access, and it was treated with angioplasty and stenting (Omnilink Elite 10 × 30 mm, Abbott, Abbott Park, IL; Viabahn VBX 9 × 39 mm, Gore, Newark, DE; Wallstent 12 × 40 mm, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) with restoration of normal flow into the native intrahepatic portal system. The child presented transient direct hyperbilirubinemia (up to 2.8 mg/dL) which spontaneously resolved in 1 week and was discharged asymptomatic. Six months after portal vein recanalization, normal portal flow was visible at colour Doppler ultrasound, platelet count was within normal ranges and endoscopy proved disappearance of varices.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^1e6d1978]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — gastric and ectopic varices management: Initial management of bleeding gastric or ectopic varices should be identical to bleeding esophageal varices, including vasoactive therapy, antimicrobials, conservative transfusion strategy, and endoscopic evaluation within 12 hours. Patients with bleeding gastric or ectopic varices should have contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging to define anatomy of portosystemic collaterals or venous thrombosis. In patients who underwent ECI as the main therapy, the addition of NSBBs is recommended to prevent rebleeding, in absence of contraindications, and repeat endoscopic treatment at intervals every 2–4 weeks until obliteration with long-term surveillance should be performed. Patients with bleeding GV from isolated splenic vein thrombosis should be evaluated for splenectomy, splenic vein stenting, or splenic artery embolization.

Unlabelled

Approaches to the management of portal hypertension and variceal hemorrhage in pediatrics remain controversial, in large part because they are not well informed by rigorous clinical studies. Fundamental biological and clinical differences preclude automatic application of approaches used for adults to children. On April 11–12, 2015, experts in the field convened at the first Baveno Pediatric Satellite Meeting to discuss and explore current available evidence regarding indications for MesoRex bypass (MRB) in extrahepatic portal vein obstruction and the role of primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage in children. Consensus was reached regarding MRB. The vast majority of children with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction will experience complications that can be prevented by successful MRB surgery. Therefore, children with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction should be offered MRB for primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding and other complications, if appropriate surgical expertise is available, if preoperative and intraoperative evaluation demonstrates favorable anatomy, and if appropriate multidisciplinary care is available for postoperative evaluation and management of shunt thrombosis or stenosis. In contrast, consensus was not achieved regarding primary prophylaxis of varices. Although variceal hemorrhage is a concerning complication of portal hypertension in children, the first bleed appears to be only rarely fatal and the associated morbidity has not been well characterized.

Conclusion

There are few pediatric data to indicate the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic or endoscopic therapies as primary prophylaxis or that prevention of a sentinel variceal bleed will ultimately improve survival; therefore, no recommendation for primary prophylaxis with endoscopic variceal ligation, sclerotherapy, or nonspecific beta-blockade in children was proposed.

### Endoscopic sclerotherapy in children: experience with 257 cases of extrahepatic portal venous obstruction [^47019a36]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Endoscopic sclerotherapy often is used to treat variceal bleeding in children with extrahepatic portal hypertension, but published data are limited. The role of endoscopic sclerotherapy in a large number of children with extrahepatic portal hypertension was evaluated.

Methods

Consecutive children presenting with variceal bleeding because of extrahepatic portal hypertension were included in this study. All children underwent endoscopic sclerotherapy with absolute alcohol at presentation and at 2-week to 3-week intervals thereafter, until variceal eradication was achieved. Follow-up endoscopy was performed at 3 months after eradication and then every 6 months thereafter.

Results

A total of 257 patients with extrahepatic portal hypertension were managed from January 1992 to December 2001. Of these, 50 were lost to follow-up before eradication was achieved, leaving 207 patients (144 boys, 63 girls; mean age at presentation, 7 [SD 3.5] years) for whom evaluation was complete. Of the 207 patients, 5 died of bleeding, 23 underwent surgery, and 6 are still undergoing endoscopic treatment. Varices were successfully eradicated in 165 of 173 cases (95%) after a mean of 4.5 (1.9) endoscopic sclerotherapy sessions (mean volume of sclerosant, 8 [4] mL). Complications encountered were ulcer (17%), stricture (18%), and perforation (1.4%). Interval bleeding before eradication was encountered in 10.6% of cases. At a mean follow-up of 36 (29) months, varices had recurred in 17% patients, but only 3 of them had recurrent bleeding.

Conclusions

Endoscopic sclerotherapy effectively eradicates varices in children with extrahepatic portal hypertension, with an acceptable complication rate. On long-term follow-up, recurrent bleeding after eradication is rare.

### Severe bleeding from esophageal varices resistant to endoscopic treatment in a non cirrhotic patient with portal hypertension [^97546c3e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although biliary complications can occasionally develop after open cholecystectomy the risk is considerably lower after open surgery than after a laparoscopic procedure (0.4% vs 1.6%). Recently reported complications include associated vascular and biliary injuries but no reports have described portal vein lesions similar to those in our patient. The most important problem in our case was the emergency treatment of bleeding esophageal varices in a patient with portal hypertension secondary to portal vein thrombosis. Although the current standard first approach is generally endoscopic (sclerotherapy or ligation) this procedure has a reported failure rate of 15%. In patients without cirrhosis, in whom portal hypertension is related to thrombosis or portal stenosis, failed endoscopic treatment of variceal bleeding raises unusually complex problems of management. In general, good liver function permits good control bleeding (normal coagulation indexes and a normal platelet count). In addition, the development of portal cavernomatosis often tends ultimately to invert the hepatoportal blood flow from hepatofugal to hepatopetal thus reducing the risk of esophageal variceal bleeding. But if the bleeding continues after endoscopy, the patient should undergo an emergency angioradiologic procedure or surgery. Recent studies describing percutaneous endovascular treatment of portal stenosis with or without stenting in patients (especially children) who have undergone liver transplantation report an unsuccessful outcome related to portal vein occlusion in about 25% of the patients even in those who underwent elective procedures. The only patients with portal hypertension who should currently undergo emergency surgery for variceal or congestive gastropathy bleeding are those with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis not scheduled for liver transplantation and those without cirrhosis with portal obstruction. The standard emergency surgical options are esophageal transection and nonselective portosystemic shunting if the prestenotic main portal trunk is available. Although esophageal transection has the disadvantage of a relatively high incidence of early rebleeding, it is associated with a lower incidence of hepatic encephalopathy than portosystemic shunting, a more complex surgical procedure that nevertheless results in better control of bleeding. The mortality rate for these two operations reaches 25% in emergency, and is related more to the associated liver failure than to the procedure itself.

### Cavernous transformation of portal vein a missed cause of extrahepatic portal hypertension [^b34b534b]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The portal vein thrombosis is an important and well-known cause of portal hypertension in young patients. Cavernous transformation of portal vein may be a sequel of portal vein thrombosis. Here the author reports a case of a 14-year-old boy presented with haemetemesis and melena, which was due to rupture of oesophageal varices as a result of portal hypertension. On further investigation, cavernous transformation of portal vein was identified on CT portovenogram and normal liver structure was evident on histology.

Prevention of recurrent hemorrhage after initial bleeding — timing and risk: After a first AVH, patients are at high risk of rebleeding (up to 60% at 1 y without prophylaxis), and secondary prophylaxis to prevent rebleeding should be instituted immediately after control of the index bleed, within 7 days from admission, because the highest risk period for rebleeding is the first 6 weeks after presentation; in patients who underwent preemptive TIPS, no further measures are required.

### Hematemesis from varices in a 14-year-old without hepatobiliary disease: a "Wandering" diagnosis… [^97461a78]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Hematemesis, especially when severe enough to cause hemodynamic instability, typically occurs in patients with hepatobiliary pathology associated with portal hypertension and varices. However, hematemesis can rarely be the presenting symptom of a wandering spleen, via the development of varices from sinistral portal hypertension. This case report describes a 14-year-old previously healthy male with acute hematemesis, who was found to have a WS and variceal hemorrhage that required emergent resuscitation and splenectomy. Hematemesis because of variceal bleeding is a common diagnosis in adults with cirrhosis or other causes of generalized portal hypertension. In children and adolescents, hematemesis is most frequently because of Mallory-Weiss tears or peptic ulcer disease. Severe pediatric upper gastrointestinal bleeds are most often because of varices.

1 At all ages, varices usually result from generalized portal hypertension, but they can also result from isolated sinistral portal hypertension. One rare etiology of SPH is torsion of a WS. This case of a 14-year-old male with hemodynamically significant hematemesis as his presenting symptom represents an exceptionally rare manifestation of WS. Case A 14-year-old previously healthy male presented to a community hospital emergency department for acute hematemesis. After 2 days of treating upper respiratory symptoms with expectorants and albuterol, he awoke that morning feeling unwell. He walked to his bathroom, fell without losing consciousness, and began having nonbloody emesis that progressed to repeated bright red hematemesis. On presentation, he had normal vital signs, mild epigastric tenderness without peritoneal signs, and heme-positive dark stool. His initial hemoglobin was 8. 8 g/dL, MCV 89 fL, platelets 148 K/uL, INR

1.

3, PTT 26. 6 seconds, albumin
3. 0 g/dL, and otherwise normal complete metabolic panel and lipase. He had 100 mL of clot-containing emesis and received a normal saline bolus, 1 unit of packed red blood cells, and intravenous pantoprazole and octreotide. On transfer to a tertiary care pediatric hospital, he maintained normal vital signs, reported mild right upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness, and had repeat Hb 8. 4 g/dL. He continued to receive pantoprazole and octreotide infusions and was closely monitored while kept NPO. He remained asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable for nearly 12 hours on hospital day #1. His Hb nadir was
6. 6 g/dL. Abdominal Doppler ultrasound revealed splenomegaly and dilation of the portal vein and splenic hilar veins, which is suspicious for portal hypertension.

He was intubated for airway protection and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy on HD#2, with epinephrine injection and clipping of a solitary raised erythematous lesion in the gastric cardia, thought to be an arteriovenous malformation or varix given the ultrasound findings. General surgery specialists, who were consulted intraprocedurally, raised concern for possible WS given the ultrasound findings and possible varix, and recommended computerized tomography to better characterize the gastric lesion and its potential causes. Octreotide infusion was restarted. Computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed hepatomegaly, dilatation of the portal vein, increasing splenomegaly, and gastric submucosal, perigastric, and perisplenic varices.

### Diagnosis and management of ectopic varices in portal hypertension [^6c78df73]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Ectopic variceal bleeding is a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding that can occur in settings of cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension and is characterised by its development at locations remote from the oesophagus and stomach. Ectopic varices can be difficult to identify and access, and, although a relatively uncommon cause of portal hypertensive bleeding, can represent a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenge associated with considerable mortality. Low incidence and variance in variceal anatomy preclude large randomised controlled trials, and clinical practice is based on experience from case reports, case series, and specialist centre expertise. Optimisation of survival outcomes relies on understanding a patient's portal venous anatomy and functional hepatic reserve to guide timely and targeted endoscopic and endovascular interventions to facilitate the rapid control of ectopic variceal bleeding.

### Non-anatomical revascularization of the portal vein in children with non-cirrhotic extrahepatic portal vein obstruction [^b8c6610a]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Portal hypertension resulting from non-cirrhotic extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is a cause of severe morbidity related to variceal bleeding in children. In patients not eligible for Meso-Rex bypass, rescue interventions for refractory variceal bleeding have traditionally included surgical porto-systemic shunts or transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS), which alter the normal physiology of liver perfusion and expose children to long-term complications. Portal vein recanalization is a recently described technique which aims to restore the hepatopetal flow through the native portal system but its feasibility is often limited. We aim to present two innovative techniques of percutaneous non-anatomical portal vein recanalization for treating non-cirrhotic extrahepatic portal vein obstruction in children who failed anatomical revascularization.

### Endoscopic variceal ligation in children with extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis: long-term follow up of 2 cases [^a026b00f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Endoscopic methods such as sclerotherapy and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) are considered highly effective in the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding. EVL is a treatment of option for preventing a first bleeding episode and for the treatment of acute and recurrent variceal bleeding in adult patients. Limited data are available regarding this treatment option in children, although it is considered highly effective and is recommended by most pediatric experts. We report our experience regarding two pediatric patients who suffered from extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO).

The first case is a 3-year-old boy referred to our department for evaluation of hepatosplenomegaly noticed at the age of 7 months. The patient's physical examination was normal, while the laboratory investigation revealed thrombocytopenia and normal blood clotting tests. Portal vein catheterization confirmed the diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Due to esophageal varices grade I revealed by upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy propranolol was commenced, and was discontinued one month later because of its adverse effects. All the esophageal varices (EV) were eradicated by EVL and no recurrence was observed upon repeated endoscopies over an 8-year follow-up period. The patient, now 11 years old, has not experienced episodes of GI bleeding but his liver function deteriorated. A recent magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) indicated cirrhosis.

### Bleeding esophagogastric varices from extrahepatic portal hypertension: 40 years' experience with portal-systemic shunt [^adf51cbd]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2002). Low credibility.

Background

This article discusses the largest and longest experience reported to date of the use of portal-systemic shunt (PSS) to treat recurrent bleeding from esophagogastric varices caused by extrahepatic portal hypertension associated with portal vein thrombosis (PVT).

Study Design

Two hundred consecutive children and adults with extrahepatic portal hypertension caused by PVT who were referred between 1958 and 1998 after recovering from at least two episodes of bleeding esophagogastric varices requiring blood transfusions were managed according to a well-defined and uniformly applied protocol. All but 14 of the 200 patients were eligible for and received 5 or more years of regular followup (93%); 166 were eligible for and received 10 or more years of regular followup (83%).

Results

The etiology of PVT was unknown in 65% of patients. Identifiable causes of PVT were neonatal omphalitis in 30 patients (15%), umbilical vein catheterization in 14 patients (7%), and peritonitis in 14 patients (7%). The mean number of bleeding episodes before PSS was 5.4 (range 2 to 18). Liver biopsies showed normal morphology in all patients. The site of PVT was the portal vein alone in 134 patients (76%), the portal vein and adjacent superior mesenteric vein in 10 patients (5%), and the portal and splenic veins in 56 patients (28%). Postoperative survival to leave the hospital was 100%. Actuarial 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year survival rates were 99%, 97%, and 95%, respectively. Five patients (2.5%), all with central end-to-side splenorenal shunts, developed thrombosis of the PSS, and these were the only patients who had recurrent variceal bleeding. During 10 or more years of followup, 97% of the eligible patients were shown to have a patent shunt and were free of bleeding. No patient developed portal-systemic encephalopathy, liver function tests remained normal, liver biopsies in 100 patients showed normal architecture, hypersplenism was corrected.

Conclusion

PSS is the only consistently effective therapy for bleeding esophagogastric varices from PVT and extrahepatic portal hypertension, resulting in many years of survival, freedom from recurrent bleeding, normal liver function, and no encephalopathy.

### Portal thrombosis with hemorrhagic infarction and necrosis of the liver… [^88d6375f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute thrombosis of the portal vein is characterized clinically by the occurrence of severe abdominal pain and copious hypostatic hemorrhage from the organs whose vessels unite to form the portal vein. When such acute obstruction is complete, death results rapidly from loss of blood; but if the obstruction is only partial, ascites, enlargement of the spleen and recurrent hemorrhage develop. The condition is usually dependent on disease of the walls of the portal vein, and this may be associated with other morbid states of the liver or in the vicinity of the portal vein. The most important etiologic factor in this connection is syphilis, involving either the liver or the vein itself. Among other causative influences are cicatricial processes in the transverse fissure secondary to chronic peritonitis, compression by tumors, enlarged glands or gallstones, atheroma and sclerosis. Acute thrombosis of the portal vein does not give rise to any considerable.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^7fd74f66]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD portal hypertension — natural history and surveillance intervals in compensated cirrhosis: In the absence of imaging surrogates of CSPH and when TE is not available, patients with cACLD should undergo surveillance endoscopy. In compensated patients, the prevalence of varices at baseline endoscopy was approximately 25%; among those without varices, new varices were detected at approximately 4.4–5% per year, conversion from small to medium or large occurred within 1–2 years in 10–20% of individuals, and annual incident bleeding within 1 year occurred in approximately 15% of cases with large varices; the natural history is significantly impacted by ongoing liver injury, in particular continued alcohol use. Based on this, consensus guidelines recommend that patients with cACLD without varices who have ongoing liver injury should have endoscopy repeated every 2 years, and those without varices with quiescent liver injury should undergo variceal surveillance every 3 years; emerging data suggest that particularly post-SVR, surveillance may be discontinued after the first surveillance endoscopy shows no varices.

Noncirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) — classification, presentation, and management options: NCPH is often classified based on the level of the vascular obstruction into suprahepatic, intrahepatic, or prehepatic, and is the result of an obliterative vasculopathy resulting from a variety of insults such as infections, drugs or toxins, immune disorders, or thrombophilic states; patients of all age groups will typically present with gastrointestinal hemorrhage and splenomegaly, and less commonly with hepatic synthetic failure. Endoscopic control of variceal hemorrhage, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), or surgical shunts are usually available as options in the management of patients with NCPH, and the meso-Rex bypass is an excellent option if the child has an accessible intrahepatic left portal vein. Increasingly, hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is recognized as a complication of NCPH, and if HPS is present prior to initiating a management strategy for portal hypertension associated with NCPH, the clinical features of HPS may worsen.

### Percutaneous transhepatic treatment of a unique portal vein malformation with portal hypertension in a pediatric patient [^7d6b364a]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 8-year-old female with no medical history, was referred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit due to severe hemorrhagic shock from esophageal varices bleeding. The child underwent blood transfusions and emergent gastroscopy with successful variceal ligation and hemodynamic stabilization.

On physical examination, she only presented an evident venous reticulum on her chest, without hepatosplenomegaly or other signs of portal hypertension (such as ascites, encephalopathy or confusion). Blood tests, including platelet and white blood cells count, liver function and coagulation, were within normal limits both at the admission and discharge.

Based on these findings and no liver disease history, abdominal Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) and Doppler Ultrasound were performed to assess the liver parenchyma and vascularization. CTA showed normal liver morphology, volume and density; absence of splenomegaly and ascites. The extrahepatic portal vein was not detected at the expected site, and a single large mesenteric retroduodenal venous collateral (Fig. 1 a) connected with the intrahepatic bifurcation of the right portal branch was observed. The anatomy of the intrahepatic portal venous system was substantially normal except for a dilated right portal branch. The splenic and superior mesenteric veins were patent with normal caliber, merging into a slightly dilated left gastric vein: a normal portal vein origin was absent. The enlarged gastric vein fed the esophageal varices. Doppler Ultrasound showed the presence of a stenosis at the confluence between the mesenteric venous collateral and the right intrahepatic portal branch, with a peak velocity of 150 cm/s and a pre-stenotic hepatopetal flow of 13 cm/s. No other vascular abnormalities such as arterio-venous fistulas or Abernethy shunts were noted. The biliary tree was not dilated; gall bladder and pancreas were normal. Based on the non-invasive imaging findings, a percutaneous transhepatic portography was indicated to better assess the morphology and hemodynamics of the splanchnic venous system. Under general anesthesia ultrasound-guided transhepatic catheterization of the right portal branch was performed with a 4 Fr coaxial introducer system (Neff Percutaneous Access Set, Cook Incorpo-155 rated, Bloomington, IN, USA). Percutaneous portography revealed a normal intrahepatic portal anatomy except for a dilated right portal branch. Under fluoroscopic guidance (Allura Xper FD20; Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) the mesenteric venous collateral was catheterized with a 4 Fr Simmons-shaped catheter (Cordis Corporation, Miami Lakes, FL, USA). Percutaneous venography of the splanchnic venous system confirmed the stenosis at the confluence between the mesenteric venous collateral and the right portal branch, with retrograde flow to the gastric vein and esophageal varices (Fig. 2 a). Venous pressure in the mesenteric vein was above normal range (25 mmHg), suggestive of severe portal hypertension, with a trans-stenotic gradient of 18 mmHg. The 4 Fr introducer was exchanged with a 6 Fr vascular sheath (Merit Medical System, South Jordan, UT, USA) on a 0.035″ Amplatz guidewire (Cook Incorpo-155 rated, Bloomington, IN, USA). A 10-mm balloon (Mustang, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) angioplasty of the stenotic tract was performed and control venography showed an improved portal flow to the liver with restoration of the normal anterograde flow in the gastric and splenic veins (Fig. 2 b). Final venous pressure in the mesenteric vein decreased to 14 mmHg; the same pressure was measured in the intrahepatic branches with no trans-stenotic gradient. The transhepatic tract was embolized using cyanoacrylate (Glubran 2, GEM, Viareggio, Italy) without intraprocedural complications and the child was discharged in good conditions after 1 week. Doppler Ultrasound performed 72 h, 1 month and 6 months after the procedure showed an adequate hepatopetal flow (50 cm/s) within the mesenteric venous collateral. The confluence between the collateral and the right portal branch presented a 5-mm caliber with a maximum velocity of 80 cm/s (Fig. 2 c), with no residual hemodynamically significant stenosis. Intrahepatic portal venous flow was present, turbulent, with a mean velocity of 50 cm/s. The clinical benefit of the treatment was proven by the absence of varices at the 1-month followup gastroscopy and no bleeding episodes, with normal blood counts, during the 6-month follow-up.

### Portal hypertension in children: high-risk varices, primary prophylaxis and consequences of bleeding [^a0b83f6e]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Primary prophylaxis of bleeding is debated for children with portal hypertension because of the limited number of studies on its safety and efficacy, the lack of a known endoscopic pattern carrying a high-risk of bleeding for all causes, and the assumption that the mortality of a first bleed is low. We report our experience with these issues.

Methods

From 1989 to 2014, we managed 1300 children with portal hypertension. Endoscopic features were recorded; high-risk varices were defined as: grade 3 esophageal varices, grade 2 varices with red wale markings, or gastric varices. Two hundred forty-six children bled spontaneously and 182 underwent primary prophylaxis. The results of primary prophylaxis were reviewed as well as bleed-free survival, overall survival and life-threatening complications of bleeding.

Results

High-risk varices were found in 96% of children who bled spontaneously and in 11% of children who did not bleed without primary prophylaxis (p < 0.001), regardless of the cause of portal hypertension. Life-threatening complications of bleeding were recorded in 19% of children with cirrhosis and high-risk varices who bled spontaneously. Ten-year probabilities of bleed-free survival after primary prophylaxis in children with high-risk varices were 96% and 72% for non-cirrhotic causes and cirrhosis respectively. Ten-year probabilities of overall survival after primary prophylaxis were 100% and 93% in children with non-cirrhotic causes and cirrhosis respectively.

Conclusion

In children with portal hypertension, bleeding is linked to the high-risk endoscopic pattern reported here. Primary prophylaxis of bleeding based on this pattern is fairly effective and safe.

Lay Summary

In children with liver disease, the risk of bleeding from varices in the esophagus is linked to their large size, the presence of congestion on their surface and their expansion into the stomach but not to the child's age nor to the cause of portal hypertension. Prevention of the first bleed in children with high-risk varices can be achieved by surgery or endoscopic treatment, and decreases mortality and morbidity.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage in children with portal hypertension: a framework for future research [^6ca75e8b]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Nonselective β-blocker therapy and endoscopic variceal ligation reduce the incidence of variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic adults, but their use in children is controversial. There are no evidence-based recommendations for the prophylactic management of children at risk of variceal hemorrhage due to the lack of appropriate randomized controlled trials. In a recent gathering of experts at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases annual meeting, significant challenges were identified in attempting to design and implement a clinical trial of primary prophylaxis in children using either of these therapies. These challenges render such a trial unfeasible, primarily due to the large sample size required, inadequate knowledge of appropriate dosing of β-blockers, and difficulty in recruiting to a trial of endoscopic variceal ligation. Pediatric research should focus on addressing questions of natural history and diagnosis of varices, prediction of variceal bleeding, optimal approaches to β-blocker and ligation therapy, and alternative study designs to explore therapeutic efficacy in children.

### Severe bleeding from esophageal varices resistant to endoscopic treatment in a non cirrhotic patient with portal hypertension [^0471522b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Recent advances in interventional radiology, especially the introduction of endovascular portosystemic shunts, have brought about rapid changes in therapy for the complications of portal hypertension. Although the preferred treatment for a patient with variceal bleeding related to portal hypertension remains endoscopic sclerotherapy, when this option fails, as it does in about 15% of the cases, the only alternative is an emergency portosystemic shunt. A surgical shunt procedure is indicated in patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in those with Child-Pugh B-C cirrhosis scheduled for liver transplantation. The treatment of variceal bleeding raises different problems in cirrhotic and non cirrhotic patients with portal vein thrombosis. Whereas from 0.6 to 2.6% of patients with cirrhosis have spontaneous portal thrombosis, those without cirrhosis generally do not (Table 1). The major causes of portal thrombosis in these patients are hereditary or acquired coagulation defects and local factors that include intraabdominal infections (in particular close to hepatic hilum) and surgical or traumatic portal vein damage.

Table 1
Etiology of Portal Vein Thrombosis (modified from Sobhonslidsuk A.)

We describe a case of severe recurrent hemorrhage from esophageal varices in a patient without cirrhosis who had undergone open cholecystectomy 12 months earlier. The failure of endoscopic therapy raised complex problems in deciding how to manage portal hypertension.

### Severe bleeding from esophageal varices resistant to endoscopic treatment in a non cirrhotic patient with portal hypertension [^4df8407d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Although Japanese investigators have suggested that patients with portal thrombosis should undergo esophageal devascularization according to Sugiura a US experience reports a percentage of postoperative recurrent bleeding ranging from 35 to 50%.

Our patient's continued bleeding and the unsuccessful sclerotherapy necessitated emergency surgery (esophageal transection). After surgery failed we decided on a percutaneous endovascular approach, which documented a patent, but angulated and stenotic left branch of the portal vein. Portography showed that TIPS (inserting the stent between the median suprahepatic vein and the left intrahepatic branch of the portal vein) was unfeasible because the excessive angulation of the left branch seemed unlikely to guarantee stent patency and would inevitably have caused severe hepatic encephalopathy. By performing an angioplasty and placing a metallic stent we reduced the portal pressure and stopped the bleeding, thus restoring the hepatic portal blood flow.

### Diagnosis and treatment of portal hypertension [^122ef9af]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Prevention of the first variceal haemorrhage should start when the patients have developed medium-sized to large varices. Non-selective beta-blockers and band ligation are equally effective in preventing the first bleeding episode. Rubber band ligation is the first choice for patients with contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers. Treatment of acute bleeding should aim at controlling bleeding and preventing early rebleeding and complications, especially infections. Combined endoscopic (band ligation or sclerotherapy) and pharmacological treatment with vasoactive drugs can control bleeding in up to 90% of patients. Antibiotic prophylaxis is an integral part of the treatment of acute variceal haemorrhage, and must be started as soon as possible. Emergency transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS) is the standard rescue therapy for patients failing combined endoscopic and pharmacological treatment. All patients who survive a variceal bleed should be treated with beta-blockers or band ligation to prevent rebleeding. All patients in whom bleeding cannot be controlled or who continue to rebleed can be treated with salvage TIPS or, in selected cases, with surgical shunts. Liver transplantation should be considered for patients with severe liver insufficiency in which first-line treatments fail.

### Sclerotherapy versus sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis [^95906b97]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life-threatening complications, including bleeding (haemorrhage) from oesophageal and gastrointestinal varices. Variceal bleeding commonly occurs in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein obstruction. Therefore, prevention is important. Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in adults is the established standard of care because of the results of numerous randomised clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of non-selective beta-blockers or endoscopic variceal ligation in decreasing the incidence of variceal bleeding. In children, band ligation, beta-blockers, and sclerotherapy have been proposed as alternatives for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding. However, it is unknown whether those treatments are of benefit or harm when used for primary prophylaxis in children.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of sclerotherapy compared with sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase Elsevier, and two other registers in February 2019. We scrutinised the reference lists of the retrieved publications, and performed a manual search of the main paediatric gastroenterology and hepatology conference (NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN) abstracts from January 2008 to December 2018. We searched four registries for ongoing clinical trials. There were no language or document type restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status assessing sclerotherapy versus sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology to perform this systematic review. We used the intention-to-treat principle to analyse outcome data, and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence per outcome.

Main Results

We found only one randomised clinical trial that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The trial was at high risk of bias. The trial included 108 Brazilian children with median age of 4.3 years (range 11 months to 13 years). Fifty-six children were randomised to prophylactic sclerotherapy (ethanolamine oleate 2%) and 52 children to no intervention (control). Children were followed up for a median of 4.5 years. Eight children (six from the sclerotherapy group versus two from the control group) dropped out before the end of the trial. The follow-up was from 18 months to eight years. Mortality was 16% (9/56 children) in the sclerotherapy group versus 15% (8/52 children) in the control group (risk ration (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 2.50; very low-certainty evidence). Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 21% (12/56) of the children in the sclerotherapy group versus 46% (24/52) in the control group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.83; very low-certainty evidence). There were more children with congestive hypertensive gastropathy in the sclerotherapy group than in the control group (14% (8/56) versus 6% (3/52); RR 2.48, 95% CI 0.69 to 8.84; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of gastric varices was similar between the sclerotherapy group and the control group (11% (6/56) versus 10% (5/52); RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.43; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of bleeding from gastric varices was higher in the sclerotherapy group than in the control group (4% (3/56) versus 0% (0/52); RR 6.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 123.06; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not assess health-related quality of life. Oesophageal variceal bleeding occurred in 5% (3/56) of the children in the sclerotherapy group versus 40% (21/52) of the children in the control group (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.42; very low-certainty evidence). The most prevalent complications (defined as non-serious) were pain and fever after the procedure, which promptly resolved with analgesics. However, numerical data on the frequency of these adverse events and their occurrences in the two groups were lacking. No funding information was provided. We found no ongoing trials.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence, obtained from one randomised clinical trial at high risk of bias, is very uncertain on whether sclerotherapy has an influence on mortality and if it may decrease first upper gastrointestinal or oesophageal variceal bleeding in children. The evidence is very uncertain on whether sclerotherapy has an influence on congestive hypertensive gastropathy, incidence on gastric varices, and incidence of bleeding from gastric varices. Health-related quality of life was not measured. There were no serious events caused by sclerotherapy, and analysis of non-serious adverse events could not be performed due to lack of numerical data. The GRADE assessment of each outcome showed a very low-certainty evidence. The results of the trial need to be interpreted with caution. Larger randomised clinical trials, following the SPIRIT and CONSORT statements, assessing the benefits and harms of sclerotherapy compared with sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis are needed. The trials should include important clinical outcomes such as death, failure to control bleeding, and adverse events.

### Value of preoperative computed tomography for meso-rex bypass in children with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction [^a62c67f8]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Clinical data

A database of children aged ≤ 14 years (range 0.7–14 years) with EHPVO was reviewed to identify MRB candidates who had undergone preoperative CT imaging at our institution from 2013 to 2019 (Fig. 1 b). The inclusion criteria were noncirrhotic prehepatic portal hypertension caused by extrahepatic PV obstruction, which was defined by classic symptoms of portal hypertension (esophageal varices, splenomegaly, and hypersplenism with or without hyperammonemia, coagulopathy, or ascites); no evidence of associated liver disease (normal liver function test results and normal appearance); an abnormal PV trunk on imaging; and cavernous venous collaterals at the porta hepatis. The exclusion criteria were hepatic and post-hepatic portal hypertension, cirrhosis, and a history of having undergone MRB. In total, 76 patients were finally included in the study.

The clinical data included the age at surgery, sex, disease course, symptoms, associated malformations, history of umbilical vein intubation, and treatment history. All procedures were performed by the senior surgeon (Z.W.) or under his direct supervision. The left internal jugular vein/left gastric (coronary) vein was used as the vein graft. The Rex recess was examined by direct intraoperative observation or direct intraoperative Rex recess angiography. If the Rex recess was aplastic, selective portosystemic shunt–distal splenorenal shunt (Warren procedure) was considered. The Warren procedure is a nonphysiological and nonpermanent shunt surgery that can maintain some portopetal flow and avoid encephalopathy. A successful Rex operation is indicated by disappearance of the clinical symptoms, normalization of the laboratory indicators related to hypersplenism, and a smooth anastomotic opening on ultrasound examination 3 days postoperatively. All 76 children were followed up after surgery. Follow-up involved assessment for any recurrence of clinical symptoms, assessment of laboratory test results, and performance of regular ultrasound and CT examinations. Nine (9/76, 11.8%) patients had anastomotic stenosis. The follow-up time ranged from 7 days to 6.4 years (median, 1.7 years).

### Considerations in the development of the international multicenter pediatric portal hypertension registry [^6db344f7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Portal hypertension, a common sequela of chronic liver disease, is complicated by variceal hemorrhage, one of its most serious complications. Evidence-based approaches to managing variceal hemorrhage are limited by the scarcity of data related to this rare entity. Multicenter international registries are increasingly utilized to garner critical information about rare diseases. The International Multicenter Pediatric Portal Hypertension Registry (IMPPHR) was developed to acquire pediatric data about the mortality of first variceal hemorrhage and approaches to primary and second prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage with a goal of improving outcomes in children with portal hypertension. IMPPHR evolved from pediatric portal hypertension symposia at the Baveno V and VI meetings in 2010 and 2015, with a formal executive committee initiating the development of IMPPHR in 2019. The registry opened in 2020, with data closure in 2024, including information from 44 centers and > 700 subjects. The complexities and approaches to developing IMPPHR are described.

### Percutaneous transhepatic treatment of a unique portal vein malformation with portal hypertension in a pediatric patient [^4e7ac94c]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anomalies of the portal venous system can be congenital or acquired, the latter being related to spontaneous thrombosis or iatrogenic alterations such as complications of perinatal catheterization of the umbilical vein. These conditions can be clinically silent for years and then manifest abruptly causing severe clinical emergencies.

Case Presentation

This case report describes the diagnosis and interventional management of a singular abnormality in the portal venous system of an 8-year-old female that led to severe portal hypertension and acute variceal bleeding. Peculiar imaging findings were not pathognomonic for any of the known congenital and acquired portal vein anomalies: absence of a normal extrahepatic portal vein; splenic and mesenteric veins merging into a dilated left gastric vein; presence of an aberrant mesenteric venous collateral with a stenotic connection with the intrahepatic right portal branch; and absence of porto-systemic shunt. The case was successfully managed with percutaneous transhepatic portography and angioplasty.

Conclusions

Prompt non-invasive imaging characterization allowed to understand the singular vascular abnormality and mini-invasive interventional radiology management resolved portal hypertension and variceal bleeding.

### Band ligation versus sclerotherapy for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis [^d08a5094]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life-threatening complications, including haemorrhage from oesophageal and gastrointestinal varices. Variceal haemorrhage commonly occurs in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein obstruction. Prevention is therefore important. In adults, numerous randomised clinical trials have demonstrated benefits of non-selective beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation as primary prevention in decreasing the risk of variceal haemorrhage. In children, band ligation, beta-blockers, and sclerotherapy have been proposed as alternatives for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding. However, primary prophylaxis is not the current standard of care in children because it is unknown whether those treatments are of benefit or cause harm when used for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children and adolescents.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of band ligation versus sclerotherapy for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children and adolescents with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded (27 April 2020). We scrutinised the reference lists of retrieved publications, and performed a manual search from the main paediatric gastroenterology and hepatology conferences (NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN) abstract books from 2008 to 2019. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, FDA, EMA, and WHO for ongoing clinical trials. There were no language or document type restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised clinical trials irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status for assessment of benefits and harms. If the search for randomised clinical trials retrieved quasi-randomised and observational studies, then we read them through to extract information on harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to summarise data from randomised clinical trials by standard Cochrane methodologies. We planned to assess risk of bias and use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence per outcome. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events and liver-related morbidity, and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were oesophageal variceal bleeding and adverse events not considered serious. We planned to analyse data with intention-to-treat. We planned to use Review Manager 5 to analyse the data.

Main Results

We found no randomised clinical trials assessing band ligation versus sclerotherapy for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.

Authors' Conclusions

Randomised clinical trials assessing the benefits or harms of band ligation versus sclerotherapy for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis are lacking. Therefore, trials with adequate power and proper design, assessing the benefits and harms of band ligation versus sclerotherapy on patient-relevant clinical outcomes such as mortality, quality of life, failure to control variceal bleeding, and adverse events are needed. Unless such trials are conducted and the results become published, we cannot make any conclusions regarding the benefits or harms of these two interventions.

Gastric varices — risk factors and imaging considerations: The main factors associated with a higher risk of bleeding are localization (IGV1 > GOV2 > GOV1), large size, presence of red spots, and severity of liver dysfunction, and cardiofundal varices are much more frequent in patients with portal vein and/or splenic vein thrombosis, so the finding of these varices should prompt imaging to investigate the presence of such thromboses; in patients with bleeding cardiofundal varices, cross-sectional vascular imaging is preferred given that it would investigate both thrombosis and the presence of gastro- or splenorenal collaterals and would guide management accordingly.

### Percutaneous recanalization of non-cirrhotic extrahepatic portal vein obstruction in children: technical considerations in a preliminary cohort [^73ff48d3]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-cirrhotic extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO) resulting from portal vein thrombosis is a primary cause of portal hypertension in children. It typically presents with splenomegaly and gastrointestinal bleeding, often leading to life-threatening situations. A comprehensive multicentre national study conducted in Italy, involving 187 children, identified prematurity, a history of umbilical vein catheterization and neonatal illnesses as prevalent factors associated with this pathological condition. While medical therapy and endoscopic procedures can achieve control over portal hypertension, the study found that up to 34% of children required surgery or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation during an 11.3-year follow-up. Historically, and according to the Baveno VII consensus, surgical Meso-Rex bypass is recommended as the standard of care (level 2 of evidence, grade B recommendation) for all children with complications of portal cavernoma. However, in order to perform the Meso-Rex bypass, it is essential to confirm the patency of the Rex recessus, a prerequisite reported to be present in only half of the cases. Moreover, surgery may be burdened by a high intraoperative failure rate and postoperative complications, mainly involving bypass thrombosis. Percutaneous procedures are considered secondary and are typically reserved for refractory conditions (level 2 of evidence; grade C recommendation). There are compelling arguments supporting the prioritization of percutaneous approaches, which now extend far beyond traditional TIPS procedures. These arguments encompass the adoption of new, innovative percutaneous techniques already adopted in adults and herein illustrated, which pediatric interventional radiologists should become thoroughly familiar with. The aim of this study is to report an illustrative case series of patients who underwent percutaneous attempts at portal vein recanalization (PVR) prior to considering any type of other intervention, with a focus on technical success and safety, to increase awareness of these evolving treatments options among pediatric multidisciplinary boards.

### Sclerotherapy versus β-blockers for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children and adolescents with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis [^11a337b5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life-threatening complications, including bleeding (haemorrhage) from oesophageal and gastrointestinal varices. Variceal bleeding commonly occurs in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein obstruction. Prevention is therefore important. Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in adults is the established standard of care because of the results of numerous randomised clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of non-selective beta-blockers or endoscopic variceal ligation in decreasing the incidence of variceal bleeding. However, sclerotherapy is the only endoscopic prophylactic option currently available in infants weighing less than 10 kg of bodyweight due to the size of the endoscopic ligator.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of sclerotherapy versus any type of beta-blocker for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children and adolescents with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase Elsevier, LILACS (Bireme), and Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science) in February 2019. We scrutinised the reference lists of the retrieved publications and performed a manual search from the main paediatric gastroenterology and hepatology conferences (NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN) abstract books from January 2008 to December 2018. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, FDA, EMA, and WHO, for ongoing clinical trials. There were no language or document type restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised clinical trials irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status, assessing sclerotherapy versus any type of beta-blocker for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children and adolescents with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. We planned to include quasi-randomised and other observational studies retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials for report of harm.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to collect and summarise data from randomised clinical trials as described in our protocol, using standard Cochrane methodologies.

Main Results

We found no randomised clinical trials assessing sclerotherapy versus beta-blockers for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children and adolescents with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.

Authors' Conclusions

Randomised clinical trials assessing the benefits or harms of sclerotherapy versus beta-blockers for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children and adolescents with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis are lacking. Therefore, trials with adequate power and proper design, assessing the benefits and harms of sclerotherapy versus beta-blockers on patient-relevant clinical outcomes such as mortality, failure to control bleeding, and adverse events are needed.

Complete occlusion of the extrahepatic portal vein at the hepatic hilum (arrow) is demonstrated. c Portography image shows the opacification of a very tiny vascular structure (arrow) which represents the main portal vein fibrotic vestige. d Inferior mesenteric portography image obtained through a 5Fr catheter which was advanced across the obstructed tract confirms the total occlusion of the main portal vein, with opacification of enlarged porto-mesenteric varices (black arrow) and portal cavernoma (white arrow). e Fluoroscopic image shows angioplasty of the main portal vein, performed through a 12-mm non-compliant balloon catheter. The focal notch (arrow) represents the tight anastomotic stenosis that probably led to secondary thrombosis. f Control portography shows a re-expanded extrahepatic portal vein (arrow) with normal opacification of intrahepatic portal branches. g Color-Doppler Ultrasound follow-up image shows regular hepatopetal flow of the main portal vein

Additional extrahepatic portal vein stents were deployed in 8 patients: in patients #8, #9, #12 and #15 a bare metal stent was placed across the recanalized portal vein in the same PVR procedure; patient #2 underwent primary stent grafting. In patient #3 recurrence of complete extrahepatic portal vein CTO 1 year after the first angioplasty treatment required a bare metal stent placement for an evident residual stenosis; in patients #1 and #7 recalcitrant stenosis of the revascularized extrahepatic portal vein respectively 3 and 9 months after successful PVR required bare metal stenting (Fig. 3). Additionally, in six cases (40%), all adults, a TIPS was performed to achieve sustained portal vein patency. In all patients in the TIPS subgroup, self-expandable polytetrafluoroethylene -ePTFE- covered stents were used.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^a1f49f82]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations: management of active haemorrhage from gastric varices (Figure 3)
What is the optimal management of bleeding gastro-oesophageal varices? Gastro-oesophageal varices (GOV)-1: treat as for oesophageal varices (level 2b, grade B). GOV-2 and isolated gastric varices (IGV): We recommend initial endoscopic therapy with cyanoacrylate injection (level 1a, grade A). Thrombin may also be considered (level 4, grade C). TIPSS can be considered, depending on local resources and clinical judgement (level 3a, grade B).
If control of bleeding fails: Balloon tamponade is suggested for GOV and IGV-1 until definitive treatment is undertaken (level 2b, grade B). Salvage TIPSS is suggested as the first-line definite treatment, where feasible (level 3a, grade B). Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) or surgical shunting can be considered if TIPSS is not possible (eg, portal vein thrombosis present) and depending on local resources (level 3a, grade B).
What are the therapeutic options for prevention of rebleeding from gastric varices? We recommend that patients with GOV-1 are entered into a VBL surveillance programme (level 2b, grade B). We recommend endoscopic surveillance with cyanoacrylate injection as needed for GOV-2 and IGV (level 2b, grade B). Note the optimum endoscopic follow-up strategy remains unclear. Thrombin can also be considered (level 4, grade C). NSBB can be considered in certain circumstances after taking into account the patient's preferences and clinical judgement (level 1b, grade B). We suggest TIPSS if patients rebleed despite cyanoacrylate injection. TIPSS can also be considered in other selected patients (eg, those with large or multiple gastric varices) (level 1b, grade B). Shunt surgery may be used in selected patients with well-compensated cirrhosis and depending on local resources (level 3c, grade B). Splenectomy or splenic artery embolisation should be considered in all patients where there is splenic vein thrombosis or left-sided portal hypertension (level 4, grade C).
Is there a role for primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding? NSBB (level 2a, grade B) can be considered in selected high-risk patients with large GOV-2 after taking into account the patient's preferences and clinical judgement. Cyanoacrylate injection is not recommended outside clinical trials (level 2a, grade A).
Areas requiring further study: Role of thrombin in gastric varices, comparing this with tissue adhesives in both acute gastric variceal bleeding and secondary prophylaxis. Role of TIPSS in acute gastric variceal bleeding and secondary prophylaxis. Role of haemostatic powders in controlling refractory active gastric variceal bleeding. Role of NSBB in the prevention of rebleeding from gastric varices. Role of B-RTO as monotherapy or in combination with endoscopic injection of tissue adhesives in prevention of bleeding from gastric varices. Role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided injection of tissue adhesives or thrombin. Primary prevention of gastric variceal bleeding with tissues adhesives and NSBB.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^fe144fe7]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

APASL PBC guidance — Portal hypertension screening and prophylaxis: A screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) should be performed in patients with cirrhotic features at the time of the diagnosis, and patients with features of portal hypertension (ie. splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia) should be screened for gastroesophageal varices (II, 2). The Baveno-VI criteria (LSM by TE < 20 kPa and platelet count > 150×10⁹/L) can identify patients who may not need screening EGD, with one study showing this strategy could avoid 39% of screening EGD with a false negative rate of 0%. Nonselective beta-blockers and/or endoscopic band ligation is indicated for large esophageal varices or variceal hemorrhage.

Cirrhosis — noninvasive triage for screening endoscopy: Patients with an LS < 20 kPa and platelet count > 150,000/mm³ have a very low probability (< 5%) of having high-risk varices, and EGD can be circumvented, whereas in patients who do not meet these criteria, screening endoscopy for the diagnosis of GEV is recommended when the diagnosis of cirrhosis is made.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^f8e5b0df]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) for fundal varices — procedure features and hemodynamic considerations — are summarized as follows: "BRTO is a procedure for treatment of fundal varices associated with a large gastro-/splenorenal collateral", and the technique "involves retrograde cannulation of the left renal vein by the jugular or femoral vein, followed by balloon occlusion and slow infusion of sclerosant to obliterate the gastro-/splenorenal collateral and fundal varices", with variations such as balloon-occluded antegrade transvenous obliteration or coil occlusion. It has the theoretical advantage over TIPS that "it does not divert portal blood inflow from the liver", but BRTO and its variations "might increase portal pressure and might worsen complications, such as ascites or bleeding from EV", so "some centers will measure portal pressure and place a TIPS in cases in which the HVPG exceeds 12 mm Hg post-BRTO". "No randomized trials have compared BRTO with other therapies".

### Endovascular management of bleeding ectopic varices [^a116f54e]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ectopic varices are dilated nongastroesophageal mesoportal veins that occur due to hepatic portal hypertension, portomesenteric occlusion, or prior abdominal surgeries, with less common causes including congenital conditions. These varices can occur in various locations, including the duodenum, jejunum, large bowel, and biliary system, and can lead to clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhages warranting intervention. An understanding of ectopic variceal anatomy and the etiology of variceal bleeding is imperative to optimal treatment. Despite a lack of standardized treatment guidelines, endovascular management remains vital for controlling bleeding and improving patient outcomes.

### Band ligation versus β-blockers for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis [^1c967973]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life-threatening complications, including haemorrhage from oesophageal and gastrointestinal varices. Variceal haemorrhage commonly occurs in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein obstruction. Prevention is therefore important. Following numerous randomised clinical trials demonstrating efficacy of non-selective beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation in decreasing the incidence of variceal haemorrhage, primary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage in adults has become the established standard of care. Hence, band ligation and beta-blockers have been proposed to be used as primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of band ligation compared with any type of beta-blocker for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (February 2019), CENTRAL (December 2018), PubMed (December 2018), Embase Ovid (December 2018), LILACS (Bireme; January 2019), and Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science; December 2018). We scrutinised the reference lists of the retrieved publications and performed a manual search from the main paediatric gastroenterology and hepatology conferences (NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN) abstract books from 2009 to 2018. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing clinical trials. There were no language or document type restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised clinical trials irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status for assessment of benefits and harms. We planned to also include quasi-randomised and other observational studies retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials for report of harm.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to summarise data from randomised clinical trials using standard Cochrane methodologies.

Main Results

We found no randomised clinical trials assessing band ligation versus beta-blockers for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis.

Authors' Conclusions

Randomised clinical trials assessing the benefits or harms of band ligation versus beta-blockers for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis are lacking. There is a need for well-designed, adequately powered randomised clinical trials to assess the benefits and harms of band ligation versus beta-blockers for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. Those randomised clinical trials should include patient-relevant clinical outcomes such as mortality, failure to control bleeding, and adverse events.

### Impact of timing of endoscopy on clinical outcomes in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding: a monocentric retrospective study from Vietnam [^bc1be903]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious and common medical emergency in daily clinical practice, which can lead to unpredictable consequences. In patients with cirrhosis, the most common cause of upper GI bleeding is the rupture of esophageal varices due to portal hypertension. This condition occurs when blood flow in the portal vein is obstructed by structural changes in the cirrhotic liver, resulting in elevated portal pressure and the dilation and rupture of esophageal varices. Nowadays despite advances in management, treatment, and prevention of complications in cirrhosis, the incidence of bleeding from ruptured esophageal varices remains high, ranging from 20 to 40%, with a six-week mortality of 10–20%. Hence, this is a serious complication, directly threatening the patient's life if not intervened promptly. Currently, overall management of esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) mainly focuses on key measures such as initial resuscitation to stabilise hemodynamics, the use of vasoconstrictive drugs to reduce portal pressure (octreotide, somatostatin, terlipressin), prophylactic antibiotics, and urgent endoscopic intervention. These approaches not only control bleeding but also contribute significantly to improving long-term outcomes in cirrhotic patients.

It is undeniable that endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is the mainstay treatment for EVB, however, the optimal timing for endoscopy remains a topic of debate in present guidelines and research. Most existing guidelines, including the Baveno VII consensus, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guideline, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline, and the Belgian guideline, suggest that endoscopy should be performed within 12 h of symptom onset in cirrhotic patients with EVB. In contrast, the UK guideline recommends that in case of severe variceal bleeding and hemodynamic instability, endoscopy should be performed immediately after resuscitation. For others, it should be conducted within 24 h after hospitalisation. Meanwhile, Chinese guideline proposes that endoscopy should be conducted within 12–24 h after the presentation of variceal bleeding. Moreover, these conflicting recommendations appear to rely more on expert consensus than on solid clinical evidence.

Recommendations: TIPSS in portal vein thrombosis

PVT should not be considered an absolute contraindication to TIPSS placement, although the presence of cavernoma is associated with a significantly high failure rate (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
Patients with acute PVT should be discussed with experienced units (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
Cirrhotic patients with PVT and variceal bleeding should be discussed with experienced units (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Endoscopic variceal ligation in children with extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis: long-term follow up of 2 cases [^69d45032]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The second case is a 6-year-old boy presented at our emergency department with hematemesis and hypovolemic shock. On clinical examination the child's spleen was palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. After resuscitation, the patient underwent an upper GI endoscopy revealing grade II gastroesophageal varices. PVT was confirmed by MRV, with normal blood clotting tests. The patient underwent 3 successive EVL sessions until variceal obliteration was achieved. In ultrasonography 7 years later the liver appeared cirrhotic. The liver synthetic function has been well preserved and the endoscopy of the gastroesophageal junction revealed normal findings during the follow up.

Pharmacologic therapy, endoscopic methods and surgical portosystemic shunting have been used to treat EV in patients with PVT. Data on long-term efficacy and safety of these methods in children are scarce deriving mainly from case series. β-Adrenergic blockers in adults are not routinely used in children because of unproven efficacy and significant adverse effects. The main advantages of EVL over sclerotherapy are the need for fewer endoscopic sessions and lower complication and relapse rates. Zargar et al showed that in children treated for bleeding EV, bleeding and major complication rates in the sclerotherapy group were significantly higher. There is currently insufficient evidence to support a role of EVL for primary prevention in children.

In conclusion, our two cases indicate that EVL for primary or secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in children with EHPVO is well tolerated, effective, reduces morbidity, and improves quality of life in the long-term follow up. A concern in children with EHPVO is the development of cirrhosis long-term, as in our cases, thus future studies are warranted to establish prognosis after EVL application in these patients.

### Non-anatomical revascularization of the portal vein in children with non-cirrhotic extrahepatic portal vein obstruction [^471d73f7]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Following the experience in inoperable paediatric patients, we are accumulating evidence that portal vein recanalization is minimally invasive, it has relatively high technical and clinical success rates even in inoperable patients, and it does not hamper a subsequent surgical approach. Based on these observations, we currently consider a portal vein recanalization attempt before surgery, following a careful multidisciplinary evaluation and an exhaustive information to the patient's family.

We described two innovative techniques for portal vein recanalization which allowed to restore the physiological portal flow to the liver through a radiologically-created bypass, even when the catheterization of the native thrombosed portal vein failed. Owing to technical improvements, percutaneous recanalization of chronic venous obstructions is gaining popularity. Sharp recanalization techniques have been described for the management of chronic total occlusion of central veins, providing exceptional results that must be weighted with the risk of procedure-related complications, as for example pericardial bleeding. Portal vein recanalization is an innovative technique with promising results in different clinical scenarios. If on the one hand this technique is widely adopted and effective to manage portal vein obstruction after liver transplantation, few reports describe its application in patients with native liver affected by non-cirrhotic extrahepatic portal vein obstruction, with only preliminary studies in children. In most cases, portal vein recanalization is performed through the anatomic route while it has been reported non-anatomically very exceptionally. The reason why non-anatomical revascularization of the portal vein is challenging is inherent to the density of vital structures encountered at the hepatic hilum (i.e. hepatic artery; common bile duct). The interventional radiologist must be aware of potential complications, including arterial bleeding, biliary obstruction and leakage and acute portal vein thrombosis, and he must have technical skills to eventually face such circumstances with appropriate devices like stent grafts and biliary drainages. Moreover, the interventional radiological team must be supported by dedicated paediatric anaesthesiologists and surgeons prepared to manage severe complications. We remark that no complications occurred in our cases of non-anatomical portal vein recanalization and the clinical outcome was favourable for both children with clinical regression of portal hypertension 6 months after treatment.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^f67801e5]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) — advantages, limitations, and surveillance — can theoretically be done in the same session as screening endoscopy and has few contraindications, but carries risks related to sedation and risks of dysphagia, esophageal ulcerations, strictures, and bleeding; although overall side effects are more frequent with NSBBs, the number of severe side effects is greater with EVL, and because EVL is a local therapy, after eradication surveillance endoscopies are necessary to detect variceal recurrence, which approaches 90%; physician practice patterns may influence choice, with gastroenterologists who spent at least half their time performing endoscopy more likely to choose EVL.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^d993a2fe]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD portal hypertension — management of compensated cirrhosis with a contraindication to or intolerance of beta-blockers: Patients with compensated cirrhosis who have contraindication for beta-blockers or who do not tolerate beta-blockers have at present no further therapeutic options to avoid clinical decompensation other than control of the underlying disease. Although a possible benefit of statins to prevent decompensation in this setting is pathophysiologically plausible and retrospective studies suggest that statins reduce the incidence of decompensation, there are insufficient data to recommend its routine use. Patients with a standard indication for statin therapy should continue treatment, and statins should not be discouraged when indicated. In patient with cACLD with CSPH for whom beta-blockers cannot be safely administered, endoscopic surveillance should be initiated with an intent to prevent first variceal hemorrhage (primary prophylaxis) through prophylactic endoscopic band ligation of high-risk varices. Performance of an endoscopy every 2 years is recommended; however, if cause of the liver disease is under control (alcohol abstinence, weight control, viral suppression or elimination, etc.), endoscopic surveillance may be done every 3 years. In some cases, cessation of surveillance may be considered after negative serial endoscopic assessments.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^25aa5263]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Gastric and ectopic varices — classification, prevalence, and bleeding risk are outlined as follows: Gastric varices (GV) are commonly classified as varices along the lesser curvature (GOV1) or greater curvature (GOV2) and isolated GV in the fundus (IGV1) or other gastric areas (IGV2). Varices along the lesser curvature (GOV1) share a natural history and can be treated comparably with esophageal varices, whereas varices along the greater curvature (GOV2) and in the fundus (IGV1) are referred to as cardiofundal or gastric fundal varices and have a different natural history than esophageal varices, with bleeding cardiofundal varices associated with higher rates of treatment failure, rebleeding, and mortality. The prevalence of GV ranges between 17% and 25% among patients with cirrhosis that have not bled, and GV are more common among patients with prehepatic portal hypertension, particularly in those with splenic vein thrombosis causing left-sided or sinistral portal hypertension, than among those with sinusoidal portal hypertension. When GV are identified, contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging should be performed to rule out vascular thrombosis; the presence of GV or ectopic varices indicate the presence of CSPH, and GV typically develop at lower portal pressure than esophageal varices. The incidence of bleeding from cardiofundal varices is reported around 16% and 45% at 3 years.

### Severe bleeding from esophageal varices resistant to endoscopic treatment in a non cirrhotic patient with portal hypertension [^a6a18386]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 58-year-old non alcoholic patient was admitted to hospital for investigation of hematemesis and melena. Twelve months earlier he had undergone elective open cholecystectomy for chronic calculous cholecystitis complicated by a biliary fistula that had resolved spontaneously. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy disclosed bloody esophageal varices and the bleeding was successfully controlled by endoscopic sclerotherapy. During repeated endoscopic sessions the varices were progressively eradicated by ligation. Laboratory serum screening and liver ultrasound excluded the presence of cirrhosis while the portal echo-color Doppler ultrasound examination detected portal vein thrombosis. Laboratory tests of blood coagulation yielded normal findings.

Three months after the latest endoscopic follow-up, the patient was readmitted to hospital with severe hemorrhage. A repeat endoscopy showed recurrent variceal hemorrhage that responded poorly to sclerotherapy leaving intermittent bleeding. Because endoscopic therapy failed to control the bleeding and portal thrombosis made TIPS unfeasible, an open surgical procedure was scheduled (nonselective side-to-side portacaval shunting). At operation, because severe fibrosis prevented access to the hepatic hilum thus making nonselective portacaval shunting unfeasible, the patient underwent an alternative surgical procedure, esophageal transection. After surgery the bleeding continued. A second portal echo-color Doppler ultrasound study and computed tomographic (CT) scan disclosed a thrombus completely occluding the right portal vein branch with an apparent re-channeling of the left branch. An emergency angioradiologic procedure was scheduled.
