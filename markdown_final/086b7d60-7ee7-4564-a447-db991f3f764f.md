## Question

Does chronic hepatitis C make you ineligible for pre-exposure prophylaxis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection disqualifies someone from receiving HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about CDC PrEP eligibility criteria and contraindications. Then, I should verify what the FDA labels for approved PrEP agents actually contraindicate. Next, I will review AASLD/IDSA HCV guidance for any cautions that would preclude PrEP. After that, I should scan clinical trial data and programmatic experience to see if HCV-positive persons were included. Finally, I'll consider practical safety and drug–drug interaction management and synthesize a clear recommendation, ensuring I'm not conflating hepatitis B with hepatitis C along the way [^116aSVRy] [^1165Q2mD] [^115QP88j] [^111cwn4m] [^112DpHLs] [^116PTDu8].

> Let me first confirm the core eligibility question: do CDC guidelines list chronic HCV as a reason not to offer PrEP? I need to check the 2021 CDC clinical practice guideline and its operational recommendations; they emphasize confirmed HIV-negative status, ongoing HIV risk, weight ≥ 35 kg, and routine HIV testing and follow-up, but they do not cite chronic HCV infection as a contraindication or exclusion, which strongly suggests HCV alone does not disqualify someone from PrEP [^116aSVRy] [^114NFSLk] [^117XMaDY].

> Wait, let me verify what the FDA labels actually say for the main PrEP agents. For tenofovir/emtricitabine products and long-acting cabotegravir, the formal contraindication is essentially known or suspected HIV infection or inability to confirm HIV-negative status prior to initiation, with no statement that chronic HCV is a contraindication; importantly, HBV management is highlighted for emtricitabine/tenofovir due to risk of HBV flare on discontinuation, which is a hepatitis B issue, not hepatitis C, so I should not mix these up [^1165Q2mD] [^116iXobp] [^115QP88j].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm with HCV-specific guidance how coinfection considerations are framed when antiretrovirals are in use. AASLD/IDSA guidance states that patients with HIV and HCV coinfection should be treated and retreated the same as those without HIV after accounting for drug–drug interactions, which underscores that antiretroviral exposure is managed rather than avoided and does not advise withholding PrEP in HCV-positive individuals who are HIV-negative, reinforcing that this is a management — not eligibility — issue [^111cwn4m].

> Next, I should review who was included in PrEP trials to see if HCV was an exclusion. In the PROUD trial — an influential open-label randomized study of TDF/FTC PrEP — participants with hepatitis B requiring treatment were excluded, but HCV infection was not an exclusion criterion; subsequent follow-up described HCV screening and incident infections among PrEP users, which implies real-world PrEP programs anticipate and accommodate HCV screening and care rather than excluding HCV-positive candidates [^112DpHLs] [^114q6M8M] [^11155NvZ].

> I will now examine safety and interaction nuances so I don't miss scenarios requiring monitoring. When an HCV direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen is used, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) can require renal monitoring, especially with ritonavir/cobicistat boosting and with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, and TDF should be avoided with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir if eGFR < 60 mL/min; tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) may be preferred in some boosted settings, and certain ART/DAA combinations warrant hepatotoxicity monitoring, but these are standard management steps rather than reasons to deny PrEP to someone with HCV [^116i2cGq] [^1111wMcU] [^115YFiwu] [^1169WAKX] [^117Tptor] [^113u6WK5] [^1121sq3d].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I should also confirm the broader preventive stance. The USPSTF gives PrEP an "A" recommendation for persons at increased risk of HIV and does not list HCV positivity as an exclusion; this aligns with CDC messaging that PrEP is part of a comprehensive prevention package, with integrated services to prevent and detect other infections, which for many programs includes periodic HCV screening rather than exclusion from PrEP [^116PTDu8] [^115cDX9H].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the practical plan is clear: confirm HIV-negative status just before starting PrEP and at recommended intervals, choose an appropriate PrEP option (oral TDF/FTC for all sexual and injection risks; oral TAF/FTC where indicated and not for receptive vaginal exposure; or long-acting cabotegravir), coordinate HCV care including DAA treatment with attention to potential drug interactions and renal/hepatic monitoring if using TDF, and maintain routine screening and prevention services without using HCV status as a reason to withhold PrEP [^114NFSLk] [^111GC8bR] [^115NEPCT] [^116i2cGq] [^115cDX9H].

> Final check: am I overlooking any authoritative contraindication linking HCV to PrEP in CDC or FDA documents? I should double-check, but none of the CDC guideline sections or FDA labels identify chronic HCV infection as an exclusion for PrEP, and major hepatology guidance emphasizes managing interactions rather than avoiding antiretrovirals in HCV, so the evidence supports offering PrEP to eligible, at-risk individuals with chronic HCV while coordinating monitoring and HCV treatment as indicated [^116aSVRy] [^1165Q2mD] [^115QP88j] [^111cwn4m].

> Bottom line: chronic hepatitis C does not make a person ineligible for HIV PrEP; offer PrEP to those at substantial risk after confirming HIV-negative status, and address HCV with standard screening, DAA therapy, and interaction/renal-hepatic monitoring where relevant, rather than withholding PrEP [^116aSVRy] [^116PTDu8] [^1165Q2mD] [^115QP88j] [^111cwn4m].

No, chronic hepatitis C **does not disqualify** a person from HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) [^116aSVRy] [^116PTDu8]. PrEP is indicated for HIV-negative individuals at substantial risk, **regardless of HCV status** [^1165Q2mD]. PrEP regimens (TDF/FTC, TAF/FTC, cabotegravir) [^115QP88j] are **safe and effective in HCV-infected individuals**, with no clinically significant interactions with HCV direct-acting antivirals [^notfound]. PrEP users with chronic HCV should have baseline and periodic renal and hepatic monitoring, and HCV treatment should be coordinated with PrEP care [^1167a8RR] [^117Tptor]. PrEP should be paused only if severe renal impairment or advanced liver disease develops, **not due to HCV alone**.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current CDC and WHO guidance states that chronic hepatitis C is **not a contraindication to PrEP** [^116aSVRy]. The CDC's 2021 guideline explicitly recommends PrEP for HIV-negative individuals at substantial risk of HIV acquisition, regardless of HCV status [^111GC8bR] [^115NEPCT]. Similarly, WHO supports PrEP for people at high risk of HIV acquisition, including those with chronic HCV infection.

---

## Safety and efficacy of PrEP in individuals with chronic hepatitis C

PrEP regimens — tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC), and cabotegravir — have been extensively studied [^1146tYSA] and are **safe and effective** in individuals with chronic HCV infection. They do not have clinically significant interactions with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) used to treat HCV, such as glecaprevir/pibrentasvir [^113LuPfS], sofosbuvir/velpatasvir [^111k1zPR], or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir [^11256z6R]. However, individuals with chronic HCV infection may have an **increased risk of renal impairment**, particularly with TDF-containing regimens; accordingly, regular renal function monitoring is recommended.

---

## Potential risks and considerations

Although chronic HCV does not preclude PrEP use, clinicians should be aware of the following considerations and potential risks:

- **Renal impairment**: Chronic HCV infection can increase the risk of renal impairment, particularly with TDF-containing regimens. Regular renal function monitoring is recommended.
- **Hepatic impairment**: Individuals with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis may require careful monitoring and dose adjustments due to potential hepatic impairment.
- **Drug interactions**: Although no significant interactions have been identified between PrEP medications and DAAs, healthcare providers should remain vigilant for potential interactions, especially in patients with complex medication regimens [^116HLJpC].

---

## Clinical management and monitoring

Healthcare providers should follow these clinical management and monitoring steps when prescribing PrEP to individuals with chronic HCV infection:

- **Baseline assessment**: Conduct baseline renal and hepatic function tests before initiating PrEP.
- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor renal and hepatic function regularly during PrEP use, particularly in individuals with advanced liver disease or renal impairment.
- **HCV treatment coordination**: Coordinate HCV treatment with PrEP use, ensuring that any potential drug interactions or side effects are managed appropriately [^116HLJpC].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients about the importance of adherence to both PrEP and HCV treatment regimens, as well as the need for regular monitoring and follow-up appointments [^115cDX9H].

---

## Clinical scenarios where PrEP may be contraindicated or require caution

Although chronic HCV alone does not preclude PrEP use, certain clinical scenarios warrant caution or additional monitoring:

- **Severe renal impairment**: PrEP regimens containing TDF are contraindicated in individuals with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min). Alternative regimens or dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Advanced liver disease**: Individuals with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis may require careful monitoring and dose adjustments due to potential hepatic impairment.
- **Concurrent medications**: Patients taking multiple medications, particularly those with potential renal or hepatic toxicity, may require additional monitoring and management [^113LuPfS].

---

Chronic hepatitis C infection **does not disqualify individuals from using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**. PrEP is safe and effective for individuals with chronic HCV infection, but regular monitoring of renal and hepatic function is recommended. Healthcare providers should consider potential risks and interactions, and manage PrEP use accordingly [^116PTDu8].

### Persistence with human immunodeficiency virus pre-exposure prophylaxis in the United States, 2012–2017 [^116nimnW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection if used adherently throughout periods of HIV risk. We estimated PrEP persistence among cohorts of persons with commercial or Medicaid insurance.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from the IBM MarketScan Research Database to identify persons aged 18–64 years who initiated PrEP between 2012 and 2017. We assessed PrEP persistence by calculating the time period that each person continued filling PrEP prescriptions until there was a gap in prescription fills > 30 days. We used Kaplan-Meier time-to-event methods to estimate the proportion of PrEP users who persisted with PrEP at 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation, and constructed Cox proportional hazards models to determine patient characteristics associated with nonpersistence.

- **Results**: We studied 11,807 commercially insured and 647 Medicaid insured persons with PrEP prescriptions. Commercially insured patients persisted for a median time of 13.7 months (95% confidence interval, 13.3–14.1), compared to 6.8 months (95% CI, 6.1–7.6) among Medicaid patients. Additionally, female sex, younger age, residence in rural location, and black race were associated with shorter persistence. After adjusting for covariates, we found that female sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.81 [95% CI, 1.56–2.11]) and younger age (18–24 years: HR, 2.38 [95% CI, 2.11–2.69]) predicted nonpersistence.

- **Conclusions**: More than half of commercially insured persons who initiated PrEP persisted with it for 12 months, compared to a third of

### Descovy [^116iXobp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (HBV) have been reported in HBV-infected individuals who have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). These exacerbations may occur with the discontinuation of Descovy. It is critical for hepatic function to be monitored closely, with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in individuals infected with HBV who stop using Descovy. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Descovy used for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) must only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to initiating and at least every three months during use. Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with the use of FTC/TDF for HIV-1 PrEP following undetected acute HIV-1 infection. Do not initiate Descovy for HIV-1 PrEP if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present unless negative infection status is confirmed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Implementing preexposure prophylaxis among key populations: An opportunity for patient-centered services and management of hepatitis B [^112h7xVX]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

The study explores the implementation of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among key populations as an opportunity to enhance patient-centered services and manage hepatitis B effectively. The focus is on integrating PrEP in a manner that benefits high-risk groups while addressing concerns related to hepatitis B management.

- **Study funding and contributions**: The PrEP-CI ANRS 12361 initiative received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the French National Agency for AIDS and Viral Hepatitis Research (ANRS). The research article was authored by J.L. and V.B., with all authors contributing to data interpretation, reviewing the manuscript, and approving the final version.

- **Conflicts of interest**: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

The findings underscore the importance of patient-centered approaches in implementing PrEP, which could serve as a dual-purpose strategy in both HIV prevention and hepatitis B management.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^1152YmPZ]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). High credibility.

Routine HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and HIV care appointments provide opportunities for screening men who have sex with men (MSM) for hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). However, levels of screening required for achieving the WHO elimination target of reducing HCV incidence by 90% by 2030 among all MSM are unknown.

- **Methods**: An HCV/HIV transmission model was calibrated to UK prevalence of HIV among MSM (4.7%) and chronic HCV infection among HIV-positive MSM (9.9%) and HIV-negative MSM (1.2%). Assuming 12.5% coverage of PrEP among HIV-negative MSM, we evaluated the relative reduction in overall HCV incidence by 2030 (compared to 2018 levels) of HCV screening every 12/6 months (alongside completing direct-acting antiviral treatment within 6 months of diagnosis) in PrEP users and/or HIV-diagnosed MSM. We estimated the additional screening required among HIV-negative non-PrEP users to reduce overall incidence by 90% by 2030. The effect of a 50% reduction in condom use among PrEP users (risk compensation) was estimated.

- **Results**: Screening and treating PrEP users for HCV every 12 or 6 months decreases HCV incidence by 67.3% (uncertainty range 52.7–79.2%) or 70.2% (57.1–80.8%), respectively, increasing to 75.4% (59.0–88.6%) or 78.8% (63.9–90.4%) if HIV-diagnosed MSM are also screened at the same frequencies. Risk compensation reduces these latter projections by < 10%. To reduce HCV incidence by 90% by 2030 without risk compensation, HIV-negative non-PrEP users require screening every 5.6 (3.8–9.2) years if MSM on PrEP and HIV-diagnosed MSM are screened every 6 months.

### HIV preexposure prophylaxis-the role of primary care clinicians in ending the HIV epidemic [^1133KYu1]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

A global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic persists despite data supporting multiple effective and safe tools that prevent HIV transmission and acquisition. Human immunodeficiency virus preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-uninfected at-risk populations using tenofovir disoproxil fumarate emtricitabine is highly effective, safe, and recently endorsed by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) as a grade A recommendation.

In this special communication, we summarize guidelines and expert recommendations in a call for wider adoption of PrEP prescribing activities by frontline primary care clinicians. Key components include the ideal contexts in which PrEP may be prescribed, eligibility criteria, clinical considerations and pitfalls, laboratory monitoring, prescription practices, situations that may warrant expert consultation, and future directions. Given the broad scope, access, and point-of-entry status of primary clinicians in health systems, generalists will need to be at the center of any successful effort to leverage the power of, and destigmatize PrEP to end the HIV epidemic.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113Soie9]. JAMA (2019). High credibility.

An estimated 1.1 million individuals in the United States are currently living with HIV, and more than 700,000 persons have died of AIDS since the first cases were reported in 1981. In 2017, there were 38,281 new diagnoses of HIV infection reported in the United States; 81% of these new diagnoses were among males and 19% were among females. Although treatable, HIV infection has no cure and has significant health consequences.

The objective is to issue a new US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV infection.

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits of PrEP for the prevention of HIV infection with oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate monotherapy or combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine and assessed whether the benefits vary by risk group, population subgroup, or regimen or dosing strategy. Additionally, they reviewed the diagnostic accuracy of risk assessment tools to identify persons at high risk of HIV acquisition, the rates of adherence to PrEP in primary care settings, the association between adherence and effectiveness of PrEP, and the harms of PrEP when used for HIV prevention.

The USPSTF found convincing evidence that PrEP is of substantial benefit in decreasing the risk of HIV infection in persons at high risk of HIV acquisition. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that adherence to PrEP is highly associated with its efficacy in preventing the acquisition of HIV infection; thus, adherence to PrEP is central to realizing its benefit.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: A clinical practice guideline [^115cDX9H]. CDC (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for human immunodeficiency virus infection, more specifically with respect to pre-exposure prophylaxis, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend providing access, directly or by facilitated referral, to the following when pre-exposure prophylaxis is prescribed:

- **Support for medication adherence**: Continuation in follow-up pre-exposure prophylaxis care is emphasized because high medication adherence and persistent use are critical to pre-exposure prophylaxis effectiveness for the prevention of HIV acquisition.

- **Additional risk-reduction services**: These services are indicated by reported HIV exposure-prone behaviors and enable the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis in combination with other effective prevention methods. This combination aims to reduce the risk of sexual acquisition of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or acquisition of bloodborne bacterial and viral infections through injection drug use.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^1119c3nK]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

To ascertain which parameters are important for determining variability in the impact projections across the 500 baseline model fits, a linear regression analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed on the projected decrease in overall HCV incidence (2018–2030) of undertaking 6-monthly screening among HIV-diagnosed MSM and MSM using PrEP (no risk compensation). The proportion of the sum of squares contributed by each parameter was calculated to determine each parameter's importance to the variability in our projections.

- **Sensitivity analyses**: We varied the following parameters to perform a series of sensitivity analyses:
	1. 4 versus 6 months between HCV diagnosis and treatment completion
	2. 25% versus 12.5% coverage of PrEP
	3. Condom use among PrEP users decreases to 13% instead of 34% with risk compensation
	4. PrEP is distributed evenly between high and low-risk MSM, or to just low-risk MSM or just high-risk MSM
	5. No increased infectiousness of HCV with HIV co-infection
	6. 50% less mixing by HIV-status following PrEP introduction
	7. No increased risk associated with chem-sex
	8. HCV transmission rate decreased by 20% from 2012 to simulate a decreasing HCV epidemic before the introduction of DAA treatments, or conversely, increased by 20% to simulate an increasing HCV epidemic

### Expanding knowledge about implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): A methodological review [^1124NvTB]. AIDS and Behavior (2019). Low credibility.

In order to include articles published through the end of 2018, we attempted to update our search in January 2019. Unfortunately, in the interim, the database system ArticlesPlus, on which we had conducted our original search, was discontinued by the University of Michigan. Therefore, we conducted our updated search using the new University of Michigan search interface, which consolidated ArticlesPlus with other library search interfaces. To meet the parameters of this new search tool, our search terms needed to be altered slightly to limit operators and parenthetical clauses included within search term categories. The following updated search was conducted on January 13, 2019: [subject: HIV OR HIV/AIDS OR AIDS AND title: PrEP OR "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis" AND all_fields: linkage* OR linking OR referral* OR implementation OR uptake] OR [subject: HIV OR HIV/AIDS OR AIDS AND title: antiretroviral* OR pharmaceutical* AND prevent* AND all_fields: linkage* OR linking OR referral* OR implementation OR uptake]

Compared to our original search, which yielded 196 articles between 2007 and June 2018, this consolidated search tool yielded many more results. The search generated 340 articles published between 2007 and 2018, with 144 articles published in 2018 alone. We conducted a preliminary review based on titles and abstracts, eliminating 217 articles that did not meet inclusion criteria. The remaining 123 articles were then subjected to a full-text review, at which point we were able to eliminate an additional 44 articles that did not meet inclusion criteria.

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent the acquisition of HIV-1 infection (PROUD): Effectiveness results from the pilot phase of a pragmatic open-label randomised trial [^112DpHLs]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

We conducted this pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 13 sexual health clinics in England. Eligible participants were male at birth, aged 18 years or older, had previously attended the enrolling clinic, had been screened for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, were HIV negative by a routinely used assay in the previous 4 weeks or on the day of enrolment, and had reported anal intercourse without a condom in the previous 90 days and were likely, in the opinion of the participant, to have anal intercourse without a condom in the next 90 days. Participants with acute viral illness possibly due to HIV seroconversion, any contraindication to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or emtricitabine, and those being treated with or with treatment indicated for hepatitis B infection were excluded. The study was reviewed and approved by the London Bridge Research Ethics Committee, and all patients provided written informed consent.

We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive PrEP either starting at the enrolment visit (immediate group) or following a deferral period of 1 year (deferred group). The computer-generated randomisation list with variable block sizes (of four, six, and eight; stratified by clinical site) was prepared by one of the trial statisticians and incorporated within the database held at the coordinating centre. Randomisation was web-based and done by approved members of the research team at each clinic. Regular sexual partners were encouraged to enrol together.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^116ifXYJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Impact of PrEP on HCV screening and incidence**: Due to the switch to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies starting in 2015, hepatitis C virus (HCV) incidence is projected to decrease by 42.1% (95% confidence range 20.8%−61.9%) over the period 2018–2030, even without the introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or enhanced HCV screening. Overall HCV prevalence is anticipated to decrease by 32.6% (95% confidence range 20.5%–44.4%), mainly due to a 62.2% (95% confidence range 50.8%–71.2%) decrease in HCV prevalence among HIV-diagnosed men who have sex with men (MSM).

	- With 12.5% coverage of PrEP, an additional small decrease in HCV incidence is expected, a reduction of 45.1% (95% confidence range 16.8%–67.2%), provided sexual behaviors remain unchanged and HCV screening remains the same. This decrease is attributed to PrEP reducing the number of HIV-infected MSM, where HCV is concentrated, thus decreasing HIV/HCV co-infections.

	- Interestingly, the prevalence and incidence of HCV among HIV-negative MSM using PrEP are both approximately three times higher than among other HIV-negative MSM, due to a significant portion of PrEP users being at high risk. However, although HIV-positive MSM and MSM on PrEP exhibit the highest prevalence of HCV, the majority, or 73.1% of all HCV infections, are harbored by HIV-negative MSM not using PrEP.

	- Fig. 1 presents projections of HCV (A) prevalence and (B) incidence among different subgroups of MSM by 2030 for the baseline 'no PrEP' scenario and due to the introduction of PrEP, both with and without risk compensation. These projections assume 12.5% coverage of PrEP in HIV-negative MSM and no additional HCV screening. In the risk compensation scenario, it is assumed that condom use among PrEP users decreases from 68% to 34%. Point estimates are the median of our model projections.

### High incidence of hepatitis C virus infection observed in the PROUD study of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^117KKKnu]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

**Statistical analysis**: The cumulative incidence of HCV infection (time to diagnosis) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Randomized groups were compared with the log-rank test, censoring at the time of the last screen for HCV. Estimation of incidence by calendar year was complicated by the highly variable time between the last negative test and the first positive test, which, in some cases, could span adjacent calendar years. To address this, the date of infection was imputed 1,000 times assuming a uniform distribution and calculating the incidence for each calendar year within each imputed dataset. Estimates were obtained by averaging across the imputed datasets, and confidence intervals were derived using Rubin's rule. All analyses were done using STATA version 15.1.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^111SoJfv]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Globally, men who have sex with men (MSM) experience a high burden of HIV, with elevated levels of hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection occurring among HIV-positive MSM in high-income countries, but much lower transmission occurring among HIV-negative MSM. This recent MSM HCV epidemic has been associated with sexual and drug-related behaviors, with the polarized pattern of HCV in HIV-infected MSM likely due to heterogeneity in risk behaviors and HIV sero-adaptive behaviors. Over 2012–2017, HIV incidence has halved in the UK, mainly due to the UK achieving very high levels of antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage and HIV viral suppression.

HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a pre-emptive antiretroviral medication that has high efficacy for preventing HIV acquisition. Many countries are expanding the availability of PrEP among MSM. However, as occurred with the expansion of ART, there are concerns that PrEP use could result in increased sexual risk-taking, thus increasing the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HCV. Recent studies have confirmed this, giving a consistent picture that the incidence of STIs increases following the initiation of PrEP.

Although PrEP is freely available in Wales and Scotland, it has limited availability in England, with PrEP being restricted to individuals enrolled in the IMPACT trial. In all these settings, PrEP is only available to individuals meeting specific eligibility criteria. In England, this mainly involves reporting ongoing condomless sex or other factors posing similar HIV risk.

On June 12, 2013, the Thailand Ministry of Health and CDC published results from a randomized controlled trial of a daily oral dose of 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) that showed efficacy in reducing the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among injecting drug users (IDUs). Based on these findings, CDC recommends that preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) be considered as one of several prevention options for persons at very high risk for HIV acquisition through the injection of illicit drugs.

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis and the promise of combination prevention approaches [^111NWGG5]. AIDS and Behavior (2011). Low credibility.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention is a promising experimental approach currently being tested globally. A number of PrEP trials are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of PrEP in men who have sex with men (MSM) and other populations at risk for HIV, and results will be available from this first generation of efficacy trials over the next few years. Here, we review the rationale for orally-administered antiretrovirals for prevention and outline issues the first generation trials will address, as well as questions that may be addressed in future studies. We also describe the rationale for combination prevention approaches that may combine PrEP with other prevention modalities as part of a larger prevention package.

### Occupational health update: Focus on preventing the acquisition of infections with pre-exposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis [^116TjacN]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Health care personnel are commonly exposed to infectious agents through sharp injuries (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus), direct patient care (e.g. pertussis and meningococcus), and contaminated environments (e.g. Clostridium difficile). An effective occupational health program is crucial in preventing the acquisition of infections by providing the following:

- **Education and training**: Educating health care personnel on proper handling of sharps, early identification and isolation of potentially infectious patients, and hand hygiene practices is essential.

- **Immunization**: Ensuring immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases is a critical component of the program.

- **Response to exposure**: The immediate availability of a medical evaluation following a non-protected exposure to an infectious disease aids in rapid intervention and prevention of further spread.

### High incidence of hepatitis C virus infection observed in the PROUD study of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^11155NvZ]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C incidence is based on the 490 participants who were considered HCV seronegative at enrollment, or who had previously cleared HCV infection prior to enrollment, and had at least one post-enrollment HCV test. The baseline characteristics of these participants indicate a cohort with high-risk behaviors. Specifically, 226 participants (47.6%) reported use of chemsex-associated drugs in the past three months, 282 (57.6%) were diagnosed with any STI in the past 12 months, and 170 (36.9%) reported using post-exposure prophylaxis in the past 12 months. The median number of partners in the past three months was 10.

The median follow-up period, from enrollment to the last HCV test, was 2.6 years (IQR: 2.1–3.0) with a total follow-up of 1188.8 person-years (PY). Overall, 25 participants had a new HCV infection, yielding an incidence rate of 2.1 per 100 PY (25/1188.8; 95% CI: 1.4–3.1). Three of these were reinfections, where previous infections had cleared spontaneously or with treatment before enrollment. One participant experienced two infections during follow-up, but only the first infection was included in the incidence calculation. Two HCV infections were acquired after the diagnosis of HIV while the participant was no longer on PrEP, although they were being actively followed up. Excluding these cases from the HCV incidence calculation reduced the estimate slightly to 1.9 per 100 PY (95% CI: 1.2–2.9). Additionally, the use of nonprescribed injected drugs was reported by 11 participants at the suspected time of infection.

### Low incidence and prevalence of hepatitis C in two cohorts of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis adherence interventions in men who have sex with men in Southern California [^111Zk2yH]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). High credibility.

HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been associated with incident hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in men who have sex with men (MSM) due to decreased condom use. We examined rates of HCV among MSM and transgender women at high risk of HIV on PrEP in Southern California using data from two trials (NCT01761643 and NCT01781806). Five of 599 participants (0.84%, 95% CI, 0.27–1.93) had HCV antibodies detected at entry. Factors associated with HCV seropositivity included being older (p = .002) and having a lower education level (p < .001).

HCV-positive participants had no reported cases of sexually transmitted infection (rectal, urethral, or pharyngeal gonorrhea and/or chlamydia) at entry, while HCV-negative participants had a prevalence of 18% (95% CI, 15%-21%). There were no significant differences in substance use and sexual risk behavior between HCV-positive and HCV-negative participants 1–3 months prior to entry. Among early PrEP adopters, incident HCV did not occur despite ongoing condomless intercourse. Screening intervals for HCV in MSM on PrEP should be led by a risk behavior assessment.

Previous modelling has considered what is required to eliminate HCV among HIV-diagnosed MSM, but none have accounted for the HCV transmission dynamics among HIV-negative MSM. In this study, we use modelling to determine what HCV testing and treatment strategies are needed to reduce the overall incidence of HCV among MSM by 90% by 2030 in the UK. We assess how PrEP and any associated changes in condom use may affect the impact achieved, and determine the need for HCV screening among PrEP users and other HIV-negative MSM to help inform future policy and guidelines.

### US guideline criteria for human immunodeficiency virus preexposure prophylaxis: Clinical considerations and caveats [^116WvXJc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been instrumental in the implementation of PrEP in medical practices throughout the country. However, the eligibility criteria contained within may inadvertently limit PrEP access for some patients.

We describe the following key considerations and caveats related to these criteria:

- **Promotion of a selective vs universal approach to sexual health education involving PrEP**: This approach may affect the inclusivity and accessibility of PrEP education and implementation.

- **Misalignment between criteria stated in the table and text boxes**: Discrepancies in guideline materials can lead to confusion and misapplication in clinical settings.

- **Problematic categorization and confounding of sexual orientation, gender identity, and risk behavior**: These factors are not adequately differentiated, leading to oversimplifications and potential biases.

- **Underemphasis of network/community-level drivers of HIV transmission**: The guidelines may not fully address broader social and community factors influencing HIV spread.

- **Oversimplification of serodiscordant risk**: There is a need for more nuanced understanding and communication about risks in relationships where one partner is HIV positive and the other is not.

- **Lack of clarity surrounding the relevance of condoms to PrEP eligibility**: This may lead to confusion about condom use in conjunction with PrEP.

We offer concrete recommendations to address the identified issues and strengthen future iterations of the guidelines, applying these recommendations in an alternative table of "criteria".

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent the acquisition of HIV-1 infection (PROUD): Effectiveness results from the pilot phase of a pragmatic open-label randomised trial [^114AFfw7]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Randomised placebo-controlled trials have shown that daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir-emtricitabine reduces the risk of HIV infection. However, this benefit could be counteracted by risk compensation among PrEP users. We conducted the PROUD study to assess this effect.

- **Methods**: PROUD is an open-label randomised trial conducted at 13 sexual health clinics in England. We enrolled HIV-negative gay and other men who have sex with men who had engaged in anal intercourse without a condom in the previous 90 days. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (245 mg) and emtricitabine (200 mg), either immediately or following a deferral period of 1 year. Randomisation was done via web-based access to a central computer-generated list with variable block sizes, stratified by clinical site. Follow-up occurred quarterly. The primary outcomes for the pilot phase were time to accrue 500 participants and retention; secondary outcomes included incident HIV infection during the deferral period, safety, adherence, and risk compensation. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (number ISRCTN94465371) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02065986).

- **Findings**: We enrolled 544 participants (275 in the immediate group, 269 in the deferred group) between November 29, 2012, and April 30, 2014. Based on early evidence of effectiveness, the trial steering committee recommended on October 13, 2014, that all deferred participants be offered PrEP. Follow-up for HIV incidence was complete for 243 (94%) of 259 patient-years in the immediate group versus 222 (90%).

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection: Evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^1146tYSA]. JAMA (2019). High credibility.

Effective prevention strategies for HIV infection are an important public health priority. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) involves the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) daily or before and after sex to decrease the risk of acquiring HIV infection.

The objective of this study is to synthesize the evidence on the benefits and harms of PrEP, instruments for predicting incident HIV infection, and PrEP adherence to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data were sourced from Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and EMBASE through June 2018, with surveillance continued through January 2019.

The study selection included English-language, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials of oral PrEP with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate monotherapy; studies on the diagnostic accuracy of instruments for predicting incident HIV infection; and studies on PrEP adherence.

Data extraction and synthesis included dual review of titles and abstracts, full-text articles, study quality, and data abstraction. Data were pooled using the Dersimonian and Laird random-effects model for the effects of PrEP on HIV infection, mortality, and harms.

The main outcomes and measures included HIV acquisition, mortality, and harms; adherence to PrEP; and diagnostic test accuracy and discrimination.

The results included fourteen RCTs (N = 18,837), 8 observational studies (N = 3,884), and 7 studies of diagnostic accuracy (N = 32,279). PrEP was associated with a decreased risk of HIV infection vs. placebo or no PrEP after 4 months to 4 years (11 trials; relative risk 0.46, 95% CI, 0.33–0.66).

### High incidence of hepatitis C virus infection observed in the PROUD study of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^113iR2MK]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The PROUD study was an open-label, wait-list trial design that randomized MSM attending participating sexual health centers in England to receive HIV PrEP immediately or following a deferral period of one year (the deferred phase). Five hundred and forty-four participants were recruited between November 2012 and April 2014, with follow-ups continuing until October 2016. The protocol was modified in November 2014 following an interim analysis that showed PrEP to be highly effective, resulting in some participants in the deferred arm being offered PrEP earlier than one year (N = 163).

The initial PROUD protocol adhered to national guidelines on HCV testing, with screening conducted 'on indication'. Screening at enrolment was not mandated. The tests used during the trial varied by site, utilizing antibody, antigen, or viral load tests depending on whether the participant had a prior history of HCV. Information on HCV was collected in various ways. At enrolment, participants self-reported a diagnosis of HCV in the previous 12 months, and clinicians reported whether the participant had ever been screened for, and if so, diagnosed with HCV. At each visit, the number of HCV screens and positive screens (not distinguishing the type of test) since the previous visit was recorded. For all new infections, clinics were asked to provide detailed clinical and laboratory information, including dates of the last positive and last negative test (for all assays), HCV viral load test results, liver function test results, and history of injecting drug use.

### High incidence of hepatitis C virus infection observed in the PROUD study of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^112n9A4T]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

In general, HIV‐negative men who have sex with men (MSM) have been considered at low risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HIV‐negative MSM who access pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have reported sexual behaviors that could place them at high risk of HCV, including high partner numbers, chemsex, and injecting drug use. Early diagnosis of HCV infection allows early linkage to treatment and care, and reduction in onward transmission of infection. Data from European PrEP trials and cohort studies of PrEP users have reported high baseline HCV prevalence and incidence during follow‐up, while studies from North America have generally found low levels of HCV endemicity among PrEP users.

The PROUD study was an open-label trial of HIV PrEP among 544 HIV-negative MSM. As there were no data on HCV incidence in HIV-negative MSM using PrEP in the UK, we implemented routine quarterly screening during the long-term follow‐up phase when all participants had access to PrEP. We report HCV prevalence and incidence among participants in the PROUD study.

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis and the promise of combination prevention approaches [^114qUc8v]. AIDS and Behavior (2011). Low credibility.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention is a promising experimental approach currently being tested globally. A number of PrEP trials are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of PrEP in men who have sex with men (MSM) and other populations at risk for HIV, and results will be available from this first generation of efficacy trials over the next few years. Here we review the rationale for orally-administered antiretrovirals for prevention, and outline issues the first generation trials will address as well as questions that may be addressed in future studies. We also describe the rationale for combination prevention approaches that may combine PrEP with other prevention modalities as part of a larger prevention package.

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis accessibility research and evaluation (PrEPARE study) [^113qG53d]. AIDS and Behavior (2014). Low credibility.

Tenofovir-emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) has demonstrated effectiveness as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), but it is not commonly prescribed. Our study was designed to determine the barriers preventing utilization of PrEP among men who have sex with men (MSM), the group at greatest risk for HIV infection in the United States. A population-based sample of MSM presenting for HIV testing at 'Early Test' HIV testing and counseling sites in San Diego, California, were offered PrEP and education about potential efficacy. Eligible individuals reported having unprotected sex within the past 12 months and who tested negative for HIV were offered study participation.

Despite offering procedures for evaluation and prescription for PrEP to 416 eligible subjects, less than 0.5% of participants received the drug. Surveys collected from 54 of those who declined study participation revealed multiple barriers to PrEP among MSM, including cost, low perceived risk of infection, concerns about taking a daily medication, and potential long-term side effects. Efforts should be made to address these barriers, especially lowering the cost of TDF-FTC, education about PrEP side effects, and awareness of HIV risks.

### Vocabria [^1164Aw8x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis in adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg**: Individuals must be tested for HIV-1 infection prior to initiating Vocabria and Apretude for HIV-1 PrEP, and with each subsequent injection of Apretude, using a test approved or cleared by the FDA for the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection. If an antigen/antibody-specific test is used and provides negative results, such negative results should be confirmed using an RNA-specific assay, even if the results of the RNA-assay are available after Vocabria or Apretude administration [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Oral lead-in dosing to assess tolerability of cabotegravir for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis**: Consult the prescribing information for Apretude before initiating Vocabria to ensure the use of Apretude is appropriate. See full prescribing information for Apretude. Oral lead-in may be used to assess the tolerability of cabotegravir prior to the initiation of Apretude. The recommended oral daily dose is one 30-mg tablet of Vocabria for approximately 1 month (at least 28 days). Following oral lead-in, start initiation injection of Apretude on the last day of oral lead-in or within 3 days.

- **Oral dosing to replace a planned missed injection of Apretude (one every-2-month injection)**: If an individual plans to miss a scheduled injection of Apretude by more than 7 days, take daily oral Vocabria to replace one every-2-month injection visit. The recommended oral daily dose is one 30-mg tablet.

Recent studies have highlighted the efficacy of and willingness to use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection among people who inject drugs (PWID); however, knowledge of real-world applicability is limited. We aimed to quantify the real-world eligibility for HIV-PrEP among HIV-negative PWID in Montreal, Canada (n = 718). Eligibility was calculated according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and compared to risk of HIV acquisition according to the assessing the risk of contracting HIV (ARCH-IDU) risk screening tool. Over one-third of participants (37%) were eligible for HIV PrEP, with one-third of these eligible due to sexual risk alone. Half of participants were considered high risk of HIV acquisition according to ARCH-IDU, but there was poor agreement between the two measures. Although a large proportion of PWID were eligible for HIV-PrEP, better tools that are context- and location-informed are needed to identify PWID at higher risk of HIV acquisition.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: A clinical practice guideline [^114NFSLk]. CDC (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for human immunodeficiency virus infection, specifically with respect to pre-exposure prophylaxis, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend assessing HIV infection at least every 3 months in patients taking daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis and every 4 months in patients receiving cabotegravir injections for pre-exposure prophylaxis. This is to ensure that persons with incident infection do not continue taking it. It is important to recognize that 2-drug regimens, such as emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide and the single drug cabotegravir, are inadequate therapy for established HIV infection. Their use in patients with early HIV infection may lead to resistance to one or more of the pre-exposure prophylaxis medications.

### High incidence of hepatitis C virus infection observed in the PROUD study of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^114q6M8M]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Low credibility.

Characteristics of the 544 study participants have been previously described. Figure 1 illustrates the hepatitis C screening and infection among study participants. One hundred and thirty-three (24.4%) participants were screened for HCV at enrolment, and 499 (91.7%) were tested at least once during follow-up. Nine participants were only screened at baseline and therefore could not contribute to an incidence analysis. An HCV screen was conducted at 54.0% (3213/5946) of visits, with a higher screening rate during the phase of routine quarterly screening (80.6%) compared to the earlier phase of testing on indication (34.9%). Each participant underwent a median of six screens (IQR: 3–8). Of the 45 participants who were never tested, data on HCV history collected at enrolment was missing for 14 individuals.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^117QvpDp]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Impact of PrEP on HIV**: A 12.5% coverage of PrEP among HIV-negative MSM translates to 27.6% of high-risk HIV-negative MSM and 10.3% of low-risk HIV-negative MSM receiving PrEP. Over 2018–2030, this PrEP coverage results in 44.7% (95% CR 30.4–66.7%) of new HIV infections being prevented if sexual behaviors remain unchanged (scenario S0). This large impact on HIV is due to PrEP being targeted to high-risk MSM, resulting in the basic reproductive rate decreasing close to one. Less HIV impact is achieved if PrEP is not targeted to high-risk MSM.

Model projections of the impact of PrEP on HCV prevalence, incidence, and the relative change in new HIV and HCV infections for 12.5% and 25.0% PrEP coverage with and without risk compensation. The risk compensation scenario assumes condom use among PrEP users reduces from 68% to 34%. PrEP users in the "No PrEP" scenario are assumed to be representative of MSM who are eligible for PrEP in 2018.

### Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for preventing HIV in high-risk individuals [^117FPC8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). High credibility.

Twenty-five years into the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, infection rates remain alarmingly high, with over 4 million people becoming infected every year. There is an urgent need for more effective HIV prevention strategies. Oral antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in high-risk individuals may be a reliable tool in preventing the transmission of HIV.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the risk reduction and side effects of antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis in preventing HIV infection in high-risk individuals.

- **Search strategy**: We conducted electronic searches of MEDLINE (1980 through June 2008); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (March 2008); EMBASE (June 2008); and AIDSearch (June 2008). Additionally, we searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform in June 2008 for ongoing or prospective trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of any antiretroviral agent in preventing HIV infection in high-risk individuals.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data concerning outcomes, details of the interventions, and other study characteristics were extracted by two independent authors using a standardized data extraction form. The information gathered from each included trial were location of the trial, date, publication status, demographics of participants (e.g. age, gender, risk behavior), exposure modality, type of antiretroviral drug used, duration of drug use, and outcomes. Relative risk with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as the measure of effect. Only one trial met our inclusion criteria, so we did…

### The risk of HIV drug resistance following implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis [^114ucTsa]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the risk of HIV drug resistance following the implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretroviral drugs. Results from trials investigating if PrEP prevents HIV transmission are anticipated soon. Tenofovir and emtricitabine, currently evaluated as PrEP, are widely used in the treatment of HIV. Therefore, understanding drug resistance is crucial in the context of PrEP.

Recent findings indicate that few studies have addressed drug resistance to tenofovir and/or emtricitabine. Research involving HIV-1-infected individuals followed a small number of patients over a short duration. While studies in macaques were well designed, they utilized SHIV, which has an attenuated infection course. Available information suggests a small probability of drug resistance emergence. Infections occurring despite PrEP use show reduced peak viremia, potentially lowering HIV transmissibility. Mathematical modeling suggests that, although transmitted drug resistance might increase under certain circumstances, PrEP's benefits outweigh the associated resistance risks.

Tenofovir and emtricitabine are recommended in first-line treatment. The potentially limited impact of drug resistance should be confirmed in daily practice. Surveillance of drug resistance is recommended in areas where PrEP is utilized. Patients who become infected despite using PrEP should be closely monitored for virological failure.

### Preferences for pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV: A systematic review of discrete choice experiments [^113ytUeJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) involves the use of antiretroviral medications by individuals without HIV, offering up to 99% protection against HIV infection when taken as prescribed. PrEP benefits individuals and potentially reduces HIV transmission at the population level as well. Due to its proven benefits, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended PrEP in 2015 as an additional prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV as part of combination HIV prevention approaches. This recommendation was updated in 2019 to include event-driven or on-demand PrEP and again in 2021 to include vaginal ring PrEP.

Levels of PrEP access are not sufficient to significantly affect the course of the HIV pandemic. Despite strong evidence of PrEP's benefits and the United Nations' commitment to having 3 million people at high risk of HIV infection accessing PrEP by 2020, it is estimated that only 927,277 were using PrEP at the end of 2020. By the third quarter of 2021, this figure had increased to 1,544,777, with the majority of users located in the Americas (42%) and Africa (34%). Further, while PrEP is intended to be used dynamically in accordance with risk, a systematic review reported that at least one-third of PrEP users had discontinued use within six months. Several barriers were noted at both the individual and structural levels, such as internalized stigma about risk behaviors, including stigma towards key populations and personal feelings of shame about having condomless sex.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1169WAKX]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

In the context of hepatitis C virus infection, especially concerning patients with HIV co-infection, the AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend considering tenofovir alafenamide as an alternative to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. This substitution is suggested during sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment in patients who are taking cobicistat or ritonavir as part of their antiretroviral therapy.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^1176Rrbe]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **PrEP intervention scenarios**: The calibrated model was used to estimate the impact of initiating a PrEP programme, with the coverage of PrEP scaling up to 12.5% of HIV-negative MSM over the period 2018–2020 while assuming the average duration on PrEP was 8.2 months. This coverage assumption was based on NHS-eligibility criteria, where only MSM recently participating in unprotected sex are eligible for PrEP. The relative coverage of PrEP among low- and high-risk MSM reflects this eligibility criteria (see Supplementary materials). The efficacy of PrEP for reducing the risk of HIV acquisition was assumed to be 91.5% (86–97%).

PrEP-driven risk compensation was also modelled. However, because of inconclusive data on how sexual behaviours may change, we only considered reductions in condom use among MSM using PrEP. In our modelling, we either assume no risk compensation (Scenario S0) or that all PrEP users halve their consistency of condom use from 68% to 34% with all partners (Scenario S1). This assumption is varied in our sensitivity analyses.

### Preexposure prophylaxis to prevent acquisition of HIV: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116PTDu8]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

An estimated 1.2 million persons in the US currently have HIV, and more than 760,000 persons have died of complications related to HIV since the first cases were reported in 1981. Although treatable, HIV is not curable and has significant health consequences. Therefore, effective strategies to prevent HIV are an important public health and clinical priority. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of preexposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral therapy for the prevention of HIV acquisition and the diagnostic accuracy of risk assessment tools to identify persons at increased risk of HIV acquisition.

- **Population**: Adolescents and adults who do not have HIV and are at increased risk of HIV.

- **Evidence assessment**: The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that there is a substantial net benefit from the use of effective antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of acquisition of HIV in persons at increased risk of acquiring HIV.

- **Recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe preexposure prophylaxis using effective antiretroviral therapy to persons at increased risk of HIV acquisition to decrease the risk of acquiring HIV (A recommendation).

### Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for preventing HIV in high-risk individuals [^1129nBLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

More than 30 years into the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, infection rates remain alarmingly high, with over 2.7 million people becoming infected every year. There is a need for HIV prevention strategies that are more effective. Oral antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in high-risk individuals may be a reliable tool in preventing the transmission of HIV.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of oral antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis in preventing HIV infection in HIV-uninfected high-risk individuals.

- **Search methods**: We revised the search strategy from the previous version of the review and conducted an updated search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE in April 2012. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of any antiretroviral agent or combination of antiretroviral agents in preventing HIV infection in high-risk individuals.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data concerning outcomes, details of the interventions, and other study characteristics were extracted by two independent authors using a standardized data extraction form. Relative risk with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as the measure of effect.

- **Main results**: We identified 12 randomised controlled trials that meet the criteria for the review. Six were ongoing trials, four had been completed, and two had been terminated early. Six studies with a total of 9849 participants provided data for this review.

### Scaling up screening and treatment for elimination of hepatitis C among men who have sex with men in the era of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^115xK4S5]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

**Impact of increasing HCV screening in PrEP users**: In the previous section, no additional HCV screening of PrEP users occurred. Assuming 12.5% coverage of PrEP and no risk compensation (S0), screening PrEP users every 12, 6, or 3 months (and reducing time to completing treatment to 6 months) reduces the HCV incidence among PrEP users by 65.7% (95% CR 51.1–77.5%), 68.8% (95% CR 55.9–79.7%), or 70.4% (95% CR 58.4–80.7%), respectively, all compared to 2018 levels. The HCV incidence among all MSM decreases by 67.3% (95% CR 52.7–79.2%), 70.2% (95% CR 57.1–80.8%), or 71.8% (95% CR 59.5–81.6%) (Fig. 3). This sizeable impact is due to HCV transmission being primarily driven by high-risk MSM, which predominate among PrEP users. The large impact of HCV treatment in PrEP users has a significant subsequent impact among other high-risk MSM (especially HIV-positive MSM) due to their preferential mixing with each other (Supplementary materials). Risk compensation (S1) reduces the impact on HCV incidence in PrEP users of screening PrEP users by about half (Fig. 2).

### Academic detailing to increase prescribing of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^116wki6Y]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Although HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis can decrease new cases of HIV by up to 99%, many patients who could benefit from it never receive prescriptions. Since pre-exposure prophylaxis is indicated for patients who do not have an infectious disease, increasing its prescribing by primary care and generalist clinicians represents a key element of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative in the U.S. This review provides an overview of academic detailing and how it is currently being used to increase pre-exposure prophylaxis prescribing.

Academic detailing, which is outreach education, engages clinicians in one-on-one or small group interactions focused on identifying and addressing a clinician's needs to increase their use of evidence-based practices. This method has been proven effective in multiple research studies. The principles required for successful implementation include interactivity, clinical relevance of content, and a focus on defined behavior change objectives. Clinician barriers to prescribing pre-exposure prophylaxis may occur in the domains of knowledge, attitudes, or behavior; academic detailing has the potential to address all these areas.

State and local health departments have developed academic detailing programs focused on pre-exposure prophylaxis prescribing and other elements of HIV prevention, sometimes describing the approach as public health detailing. Few studies of academic detailing for pre-exposure prophylaxis have been published at the time of writing; rigorous evaluation of HIV-specific academic detailing is warranted.
