## Question

What is a simple AI-based diabetes study that can be carried out?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what simple AI-based diabetes study can be carried out, and to outline methods, validation, and reporting steps with justifications and checks against best practices and known pitfalls. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise clinical outcome definition and time horizon. Then, I should verify inclusion and exclusion criteria for a prediabetes cohort. Next, I will select a minimal, clinically sensible predictor set and justify it. After that, I need to check sample size assumptions and events-per-variable. I will then examine data extraction, cleaning, and missingness handling. Subsequently, I should plan model development and validation to avoid leakage. Next, I will define evaluation metrics including discrimination and calibration. I should confirm software and computational feasibility. Then, I need to anticipate expected performance and clinical utility. Finally, I will outline reporting, bias, and external validation considerations, with contingency simplifications if resources are constrained.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and outcome window: predicting incident T2D within 24 months among adults with prediabetes using routine baseline variables, with incident T2D defined by the first HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, new T2D ICD code, or initiation of glucose-lowering medication; this aligns with ADA diagnostic thresholds for diabetes and reflects pragmatic EHR ascertainment, but hold on, I should verify that using multiple ascertainment sources improves case capture and reduces misclassification, and I should also note that different studies use varying risk horizons, so I need to ensure the 2-year window is consistently applied in labeling and evaluation to avoid horizon-mismatch bias [^115BQFnu] [^1112gtKE] [^115UvkpY].

> Next, I will establish inclusion and exclusion criteria and double-check prediabetes definitions: include adults ≥ 18 years with baseline HbA1c 5.7–6.4% or fasting plasma glucose 100–125 mg/dL and no prior diabetes, and exclude pregnancy, prior bariatric surgery, chronic systemic steroid use, active malignancy, and ESRD to reduce non-glycemic progression drivers; wait, I should ensure baseline is anchored to the earliest qualifying lab or visit and that prior diabetes is excluded by labs, problem lists, and medications to minimize immortal time and prevalent disease bias, consistent with standard definitions used in EHR-based risk modeling [^115BQFnu] [^112AEb9P].

> Now, I will select a limited predictor set and verify that each variable is routinely available and clinically justified: age, sex, BMI, baseline HbA1c, fasting glucose, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, hypertension diagnosis, family history of diabetes, current smoking, and antihypertensive use; let me think about parsimony and interpretability here — baseline HbA1c is typically the strongest single predictor of glycemic outcomes, and traditional cardiometabolic risk factors improve performance while keeping the model practical for single-center deployment; hold on, I should confirm that for structured EHR data, simpler models with these predictors can perform comparably to complex algorithms and are easier to implement and maintain [^111SFjy1] [^112AEb9P] [^112DEvdX].

> I need to check sample size and events-per-variable assumptions: if two-year progression is about 10%, then targeting 100–150 events for 10–12 predictors suggests a cohort around 1,000–1,500 patients; wait, I should verify this against the conventional 10-events-per-variable rule while acknowledging modern ML can sometimes relax this, but for stability and calibration a conservative approach is prudent, and I must ensure that event-rate assumptions are verified during extraction and adjusted if local incidence differs from the literature [^115YcUCq] [^1112gtKE].

> I will now examine data extraction and preparation, but wait, let me verify governance steps first: obtain IRB approval and a defined data use plan; extract baseline variables at index and ascertain outcomes within a fixed 24-month window; de-duplicate and resolve conflicting records; for missingness, my first pass is mean imputation for continuous labs and an explicit "missing" category for categorical variables, but hold on, I should verify that this does not distort distributions in small samples and consider sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation or model-native handling of missingness, noting that clinic-based datasets often have small samples and missing data patterns that can bias performance if not handled carefully [^114oD66C] [^112DEvdX].

> Let me consider the modeling and validation plan and ensure I avoid leakage: perform a single random 70/30 split with the hold-out test set untouched until final evaluation, and use 5-fold cross-validation within the training set for hyperparameter tuning; I will train logistic regression as the interpretable baseline and a random forest as a robust non-linear comparator requiring minimal tuning; wait a minute, I should double-check that all feature engineering, imputation, and scaling are fit only on training folds to prevent leakage, and I should confirm that for structured EHR data, added model complexity does not necessarily outperform simpler baselines [^115J4chk] [^112DEvdX].

> Next, I should review evaluation metrics and calibration procedures: compute ROC AUC for discrimination, sensitivity and specificity at a clinically plausible threshold, and generate calibration plots with calibration-in-the-large and slope to assess agreement between predicted and observed risk; hold on, I should verify calibration with decile-based plots and consider simple recalibration if needed, consistent with external validation literature emphasizing that discrimination without calibration limits clinical utility [^115pJspr] [^1112gtKE].

> I need to ensure software and computational feasibility: standard laptops with R or Python are sufficient for these models; let me verify that no GPUs are needed since we are not using deep learning on unstructured data, contrasting with imaging-plus-EHR approaches where compute and engineering overhead are substantial, and confirming again that for structured predictors, simpler algorithms are usually adequate [^114WVWeY] [^112DEvdX].

> Now, I will anticipate expected results and sanity-check them against the literature: a plausible test AUC is around 0.70–0.78 using routine variables, with baseline HbA1c and BMI likely among the strongest contributors; but wait, I should caution that single-center performance will likely be below large multicenter or feature-rich studies and that over-optimism is common without external validation; nevertheless, such performance can be clinically useful for risk stratification and targeted preventive interventions [^112AEb9P] [^111SFjy1] [^115UvkpY] [^1112gtKE].

> I should confirm a clear, concise reporting strategy and double-check alignment with best practices: report data source, cohort construction, inclusion/exclusion, index date, predictor definitions, missing data handling, modeling workflow with cross-validation, and full test-set metrics including calibration; hold on, I should also report efforts to compare ML with logistic regression and discuss external validity and code/data transparency gaps highlighted in systematic reviews, along with the need for external validation or transportability analyses [^1112gtKE] [^114bcwN4] [^1137baew].

> Let me reconsider simplicity versus complexity so I do not overfit the local data: limiting to 10–12 routine predictors and logistic regression or random forest is a reasonable trade-off for feasibility and interpretability, whereas literature examples using 69 to 388 engineered variables and multi-national datasets achieve higher AUCs but require resources and external data harmonization that a single center may not have; I should explicitly justify why a parsimonious model is preferable for local deployment [^115UvkpY] [^11216hJ5] [^112DEvdX].

> If resources are extremely limited, I can simplify further, but hold on, I should verify the expected performance impact: reduce to five predictors such as age, BMI, baseline HbA1c, fasting glucose, and family history and use only logistic regression; I would expect AUC to drop slightly into the high 0.60s to low 0.70s, which can still be useful for a pilot, provided we clearly communicate limitations and plan for future expansion and validation [^112AEb9P] [^112DEvdX] [^notfound].

> I need to ensure bias, fairness, and localization issues are addressed: hold on, I should verify that the model is evaluated across demographic strata and that performance is not driven by clinic-specific patterns; local recalibration and even redevelopment can improve accuracy in specific populations, but I must acknowledge clinic-based sampling and missing data as key threats to generalizability and document how these were mitigated [^1116WePH] [^114oD66C].

> Finally, I should outline limitations and next steps with self-checks: internal hold-out validation is necessary but not sufficient, so the next step is external validation on a temporally or geographically distinct sample with recalibration if needed; I will also plan periodic monitoring for dataset shift and refresh the model when calibration drifts, consistent with literature emphasizing recalibration and horizon alignment to maintain clinical reliability over time [^115BsK2D] [^115pJspr] [^1112gtKE].

An easy-to-implement AI-based diabetes study is to **predict progression from prediabetes to diabetes** [^115UvkpY] using EHR data [^1151DjHn] and simple machine learning models (logistic regression or random forest) [^112DEvdX] with routine clinical features (age, BMI, blood pressure, fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipids, family history, smoking) [^114UjRp7]. This approach is **feasible with standard EHRs**, requires minimal preprocessing, and can be completed in weeks. The models are interpretable [^112DEvdX], perform well (**AUC ~0.78–0.86**) [^115UvkpY], and enable early identification of high-risk patients for targeted prevention [^112AEb9P] [^117D3eDq].

---

### Prediction of progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes: Development and validation of a machine learning model [^115UvkpY]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Identification, a priori, of those at high risk of progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes may enable targeted delivery of interventional programs while avoiding the burden of prevention and treatment in those at low risk. We studied whether the use of a machine-learning model can improve the prediction of incident diabetes utilizing patient data from electronic medical records.

- **Methods**: A machine-learning model predicting the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes was developed using a gradient boosted trees model. The model was trained on data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database cohort, internally validated on THIN data not used for training, and externally validated on the Canadian AppleTree and the Israeli Maccabi Health Services (MHS) datasets. The model's predictive ability was compared with that of a logistic-regression model within each dataset.

- **Results**: A cohort of 852,454 individuals with pre-diabetes (glucose ≥ 100mg/dL and/or HbA1c ≥ 5.7) was used for model training, including 4.9 million time points using 900 features. The full model was eventually implemented using 69 variables, generated from 11 basic signals. The machine-learning model demonstrated superiority over the logistic-regression model, which was maintained at all sensitivity levels, comparing AUC [95% CI] between the models: in the THIN dataset (0.865 [0.860, 0.869] vs 0.778 [0.773, 0.784], P < 0.05), the AppleTree dataset (0.907 [0.896, 0.919] vs 0.880 [0.867, 0.894], P < 0.05), and the MHS dataset (0.925 [0.923, 0.927] vs 0.876 [0.872, 0.879], P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Machine-learning models show potential for improving the prediction of progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes.

### Reverse engineering and evaluation of prediction models for progression to type 2 diabetes: An application of machine learning using electronic health records [^112AEb9P]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

The application of novel machine learning approaches to electronic health record (EHR) data could provide valuable insights into disease processes. We utilized this approach to build predictive models for progression to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

- **Methods**: Using a novel analytical platform (Reverse Engineering and Forward Simulation [REFS]), we built prediction model ensembles for progression to prediabetes or T2D from an aggregated EHR data sample. REFS relies on a Bayesian scoring algorithm to explore a wide model space and outputs a distribution of risk estimates from an ensemble of prediction models. We retrospectively followed 24,331 adults for transitions to prediabetes or T2D, 2007–2012. Accuracy of prediction models was assessed using an area under the curve (AUC) statistic and validated in an independent data set.

- **Results**: Our primary ensemble of models accurately predicted progression to T2D (AUC = 0.76) and was validated out of sample (AUC = 0.78). Models of progression to T2D consisted primarily of established risk factors (blood glucose, blood pressure, triglycerides, hypertension, lipid disorders, socioeconomic factors), whereas models of progression to prediabetes included novel factors (high-density lipoprotein, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, body temperature; AUC = 0.70).

- **Conclusions**: We constructed accurate prediction models from EHR data using a hypothesis-free machine learning approach. Identification of established risk factors for T2D serves as proof of concept for this analytical approach, while novel factors…

### Applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in prediabetes: A scoping review [^114UjRp7]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Low credibility.

Prediabetes is a prevalent condition where early detection and lifestyle interventions can prevent or delay progression to diabetes. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer enhanced tools for diagnosis, risk stratification, and scalable delivery of lifestyle interventions. This review synthesizes applications of AI/ML in patients with prediabetes.

- **Methods**: We conducted a scoping review using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science (through May 2025) to identify original studies applying AI/ML to prediabetes prediction or management. Population-level forecasting and models combining prediabetes with other conditions were excluded. Data were extracted via structured REDCap instruments and validated through secondary review. Descriptive statistics summarized findings.

- **Results**: Of 2072 records screened, 149 studies met criteria: 118 prediction model studies, 20 intervention studies, and 11 miscellaneous. Machine learning models primarily targeted prediction of prediabetes, progression to diabetes, diabetic complications, and glucose metrics. Overall model performance was favorable (mean C-statistic 0.81), with random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines showing better performance. Only 20 studies reported external validation, few compared ML to standard risk tools, and data/code availability was limited. Six AI-based diabetes prevention programs showed positive clinical outcomes, though randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence was limited. Three personalized nutrition interventions showed mixed efficacy.

- **Conclusion**: This scoping review highlights the potential of AI/ML in improving prediabetes management, though further external validation and comparisons to standard tools are needed.

### Machine learning-based models to predict one-year mortality among Chinese older patients with coronary artery disease combined with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus [^116Vr3hb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). High credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, leading to over 8 million deaths each year and imposing a substantial burden on social care systems. Asians exhibit a greater susceptibility to CAD and diabetes mellitus (DM) compared to Western populations, attributed to higher levels of central obesity, total adiposity, and a greater degree of insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Notably, China is home to the largest number of people with DM, comprising a quarter of the global diabetic population. DM, as a poor prognostic factor, is associated with a two- to four-fold increased risk of developing CAD. Diabetic subjects have been found to experience more severe and diffuse coronary atherosclerosis compared to non-diabetic individuals. Similarly, patients with DM are more likely to experience an acute myocardial infarction than those without DM. In essence, DM contributes to subsequent cardiovascular diseases and adversely affects outcomes in patients with CAD.

Survival prediction for patients with CAD is essential for devising appropriate therapeutic strategies, which can significantly improve their prognosis. By promptly identifying the risk factors for CAD progression, proper interventions can be implemented in advance, thereby enhancing the prognosis more effectively. However, limited studies have focused on the survival risk factors of older patients with CAD combined with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or DM.

Machine learning provides researchers with powerful statistical methods to interpret associations between patients' features and outcomes, allowing for the identification of risk factors and contributing to the development of predictive models.

### Electronic medical record risk modeling of cardiovascular outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes [^1116WePH]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Use of population-specific clinical data and application of machine learning methods can transform existing general predictive models to locally fitted models that perform better in local populations. Predictive analytics are increasingly incorporated into population health management strategies for risk profiling patients, evaluating the comparative effectiveness of different therapeutic plans, and estimating long-term outcomes for different treatment goals. "Generalized" risk prediction models do not necessarily have to be re-built for the local population; however, researchers and clinicians should be cautious about the results of these models when applying them to local populations, as the risks may be over- or underestimated. Locally fitted models may provide better support for achieving population-specific strategies.

### Machine learning and deep learning predictive models for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review [^1137baew]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

The quality assessment of the 261 articles was conducted and classified into their corresponding subgroups based on specific quality questions (Fig. 2).

- **Figure 2**: Percentage of each subgroup in the quality assessment. The criteria do not apply for two results in Quality Assessment Questions 1 and 3.

The first question classified the studies by the type of database used for building the models. The third subgroup represents the most desirable scenario, which includes studies where models were trained using features from electronic health records or a mix of datasets including lifestyle, socio-demographic, and health diagnosis features. There were 22, 85, and 154 articles in subgroups one to three, respectively.

The second question classified the studies by the type of model used. Again, the third subgroup represents the most suitable subgroup as it contains studies where a machine learning model was used to predict diabetes onset. There were 46 studies in subgroup one, 66 in subgroup two, and 147 in subgroup three. Two studies were omitted from these subgroups: one used a cancer-related model and another used a model of no interest to this review.

The third question clustered the studies based on their validation metrics. There were 25 studies in subgroup one (semi-supervised learning), 68 in subgroup two (only one validation metric), and 166 in subgroup three (various validation parameters). The criteria are not applied to two studies as they used special error metrics, making it impossible to compare their models with the rest.

Data extraction excluded 101 articles, significantly affecting the quantitative analysis.

### A machine learning approach to predict foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes [^111iyHs9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Low credibility.

Foot care self-management is underutilized in older adults, and diabetic foot ulcers are more common in this population. It is crucial to identify predictors of foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes to support vulnerable groups. This study aimed to identify these predictors using a machine learning approach.

- **Method**: This cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2023 and February 2024. Data were collected in the endocrinology and metabolic diseases departments of three hospitals in Turkey using a patient identification form and the Foot Care Scale for Older Diabetics (FCS-OD). Gradient boosting algorithms were employed to predict variable importance. Three machine learning algorithms were used in the study: XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest. These algorithms predicted patients with scores below or above the mean FCS-OD score.

- **Results**: XGBoost demonstrated the best performance with an AUC of 0.7469. Common predictors identified by the models included age (0.0534), gender (0.0038), perceived health status (0.0218), and treatment regimen (0.0027). The XGBoost model, with the highest AUC value, also identified income level (0.0055) and A1c (0.0020) as predictors of the FCS-OD score.

- **Conclusion**: The study identified age, gender, perceived health status, treatment regimen, income level, and A1c as predictors of foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes. Attention should be given to improving foot care self-management among this vulnerable group.

### Artificial intelligence perspective in the future of endocrine diseases [^112jLGm4]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results in the diagnosis, prediction, and management of diseases. The move from handwritten medical notes to electronic health records and a large amount of digital data initiated the era of big data in medicine. AI can enhance physician performance and aid in better clinical decision-making, often referred to as augmented intelligence.

The methods applied in the research of AI and endocrinology include machine learning, artificial neural networks, and natural language processing. Research in AI technology is making substantial efforts to improve decision support systems for patient use. One of the best-known applications of AI in endocrinology is in diabetes management, which includes the prediction and diagnosis of diabetes complications (such as measuring microalbuminuria and retinopathy) and glycemic control. AI-related technologies are also being used to assist in the diagnosis of other endocrine diseases, such as thyroid cancer and osteoporosis. This review attempts to provide insight into the development of AI with a focus on endocrinology.

### Not there yet: Using data-driven methods to predict who becomes costly among low-cost patients with type 2 diabetes [^111SADBi]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a leading cause of Medicare spending; predicting which individuals are likely to be costly is essential for targeting interventions. Approaches generally focus on composite measures, short time horizons, or patients who are already high utilizers, whose costs may be harder to modify. Thus, we employed data-driven methods to classify unique clusters in Medicare claims for patients who were initially low utilizers, based on their diabetes spending patterns in subsequent years. We utilized machine learning to predict these patterns.

- **Methods**: We identified beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes whose spending was in the bottom 90% of diabetes care spending during a one-year baseline period in Medicare fee-for-service data. We applied group-based trajectory modeling to classify unique clusters of patients based on diabetes-related spending patterns over a two-year follow-up period. Prediction models were estimated using generalized boosted regression, a machine learning method, which incorporated sets of all baseline predictors, diabetes predictors, and predictors potentially modifiable through interventions. Each model was evaluated through C-statistics and 5-fold cross-validation.

- **Results**: Among 33,789 beneficiaries (baseline median diabetes spending: $4,153), we identified five distinct spending patterns that could largely be predicted. Of these, 68.1% of patients had consistent spending, 25.3% had spending that rose quickly, and 6.6% of patients had spending that rose progressively. The ability to predict these groups was moderate, with validated C-statistics ranging from 0.63 to 0.87. The most influential factors for prediction were…

### Developing risk prediction models for type 2 diabetes: A systematic review of methodology and reporting [^115YcUCq]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

We identified articles that presented new risk prediction models for predicting the risk of detecting undiagnosed (prevalent) diabetes or predicting the risk of developing (incident) type 2 diabetes. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were initially searched on 25 February 2010 (a final search was conducted on 13 May 2011). The search string is given in Appendix 1. Articles were restricted to the English-language literature. Searches included articles from all years in the PubMed (from 1965) and EMBASE (from 1980) databases. Additional articles were identified by searching the references in papers identified by the search strategy and our own personal reference lists.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Articles were included if they met our inclusion criteria: the primary aim of the article had to be the development of a multivariable (more than two variables) risk prediction model for type 2 diabetes (prediabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, or incident diabetes). Articles were excluded if (1) they included only validation of a preexisting risk prediction model (that is, the article did not develop a model), (2) the outcome was gestational diabetes, (3) the outcome was type 1 diabetes, (4) participants were children, or (5) the authors developed a genetic risk prediction model.

### Predictors of metformin failure: Repurposing electronic health record data to identify high-risk patients [^111SFjy1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Metformin is the first-line drug for treating diabetes but has a high failure rate. The objective of this study was to identify demographic and clinical factors available in the electronic health record (EHR) that predict metformin failure.

A cohort of patients with at least one abnormal diabetes screening test that initiated metformin was identified at three sites: Arizona, Mississippi, and Minnesota. We identified 22,047 metformin initiators (48% female, mean age of 57 ± 14 years) including 2,141 African Americans, 440 Asians, 962 Other/Multiracial, 1,539 Hispanics, and 16,764 non-Hispanic White people. Metformin failure was defined as either the lack of a target glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (< 7%) within 18 months of index or the start of dual therapy. We used tree-based extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models to assess overall risk prediction performance and the relative contribution of individual factors when using EHR data for the risk of metformin failure.

In this large, diverse population, we observed a high rate of metformin failure (43%). The XGBoost model that included baseline HbA1c, age, sex, and race/ethnicity corresponded to high discrimination performance (C-index of 0.731; 95% CI 0.722, 0.740) for risk of metformin failure. Baseline HbA1c corresponded to the largest feature performance, with higher levels associated with metformin failure. The addition of other clinical factors improved model performance (0.745; 95% CI 0.737, 0.754, P < .0001).

Baseline HbA1c was the strongest predictor of metformin failure, and additional factors substantially improved model accuracy.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: A comprehensive review [^112Ru6q5]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetes, a metabolic illness, can be characterized by increased amounts of blood glucose. This abnormal increase can cause critical detriment to other organs, such as the kidneys, eyes, heart, nerves, and blood vessels. Therefore, its prediction, prognosis, and management are essential to prevent harmful effects and recommend more useful treatments.

Machine learning algorithms have garnered considerable attention and have been developed successfully for these goals. This review surveys the recently proposed machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for prediction, diagnosis, and management. The reported results indicate that ML and DL algorithms are promising approaches for controlling blood glucose and diabetes. However, they should be improved and employed in large datasets to affirm their applicability.

### Machine learning and deep learning predictive models for type 2 diabetes: A systematic review [^114bcwN4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

The number of studies developed in the field creates two main challenges for researchers and developers aiming to build type 2 diabetes predictive models. First, there is considerable heterogeneity in previous studies regarding machine learning techniques used, making it challenging to identify the optimal one. Second, there is a lack of transparency about the features used to train the models, which reduces their interpretability, a feature utterly relevant to the doctor.

This review aims to inform the selection of machine learning techniques and features to create novel type 2 diabetes predictive models. The paper is organized as follows:

- **Background**: Provides a brief background on the techniques used to create predictive models.
- **Methods**: Presents the methods used to design and conduct the review.
- **Results**: Summarizes the results, followed by their discussion.
- **Discussion**: A summary of findings, the opportunity areas, and the limitations of this review are presented.
- **Conclusions**: Presents the conclusions and future work.

### Prediction models for risk of developing type 2 diabetes: Systematic literature search and independent external validation study [^1112gtKE]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes poses a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Studies on lifestyle modifications and drug interventions have convincingly shown that these measures can prevent diabetes. Early identification of populations at high risk for diabetes is, therefore, important for targeted prevention strategies. It is necessary to enable appropriate efforts for prevention in the many individuals at high risk, while avoiding prevention and treatment efforts for the even larger number of individuals at low risk, benefiting both the individual and society.

The professional practice committee of the American Diabetes Association recommends screening for all overweight or obese adults (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25) of any age who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes, such as a family history or hypertension. The European evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and the International Diabetes Federation recommend using a reliable, simple, and practical risk scoring system or questionnaire to identify people at high risk of future diabetes.

During the past two decades, many prediction models have been developed. Three recent reviews on this topic described existing prediction models and the predictive value of specific risk factors, such as metabolic syndrome, over a wide range of populations. Surprisingly, however, the performance of fewer than a quarter of the prediction models was externally validated, which is concerning as the performance of a prediction model is generally overestimated in the population in which it was developed.

### Development and validation of a prediction model based on machine learning algorithms for predicting the risk of heart failure in middle-aged and older US people with prediabetes or diabetes [^1155rVc5]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

In this study, we used machine learning (ML) algorithms based on the NHANES database to build five prediction models for the risk of heart failure (HF) in patients with prediabetes or diabetes. The random forest (RF) algorithm demonstrated the best prediction performance out of the five ML algorithms. The developed RF model is capable of recognizing high-risk patients in clinical practice and serves as a practical prediction tool for physicians.

### Machine-learning-based early prediction of end-stage renal disease in patients with diabetic kidney disease using clinical trials data [^115YYLfQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Blood pressure lowering with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are guideline-recommended treatments to slow the progression of DKD. However, individual patients show significant variation in disease progression, likely due to the complex heterogeneous nature of the disease. There is a need for a robust and efficient tool to identify patients at the highest risk of developing ESRD and those requiring stringent monitoring and treatment intensification.

In practice, albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are the main predictors of DKD progression. However, a recent study suggests that the margin of error for all eGFR formulae is high, making it a less reliable tool for assessing overall renal function. The primary reason is that the coefficients used in eGFR formulae are population-based and less effective at the individual level. Various renal risk scores have been developed using traditional epidemiological tools, such as Cox regression or logistic regression, for predicting ESRD. The last decade has seen a significant rise in computational processes for predictive analytics using machine-learning techniques. Unlike traditional statistical approaches, where preselected clinical characteristics are used in prediction, machine-learning techniques can automatically identify important characteristics to predict ESRD.

### A machine learning approach to predict foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes [^116r3Mme]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Low credibility.

Predicting foot care self-management in older adults could help identify at-risk groups. However, the studies on predicting foot care self-management in older adults are limited. In recent years, machine learning has commonly been used to construct predictive models capable of capturing intricate patterns and understanding relationships within data, all with minimal human interference. Machine learning has demonstrated great success in analysing complex patterns in healthcare. This study aimed to identify predictors of lower levels of foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes using a machine learning approach. The identification of predictors of foot care self-management in older adults will facilitate the identification of vulnerable groups within healthcare settings and society. Consequently, a focus on this group to improve self-management will be implemented. This will, in turn, help to enhance foot care self-management in older adults.

### Artificial intelligence algorithm for predicting cardio-cerebrovascular risk in type 2 diabetes: Concordance with clinical and instrumental assessments [^116f2bRG]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm in estimating the risk of cardio-cerebrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).

- **Methods**: Medical records of 532 T2D patients from the Diabetology Unit in Padova, Italy, were analyzed using the Metaclinic AI Prediction Module, which estimates the probability of heart and cerebrovascular organ damage. For patients identified as "Very high" (n = 63) or "Low" (n = 122) risk for heart disease, additional clinical and instrumental data on their cardiac history were collected. The level of agreement between AI predictions and traditional clinical-instrumental diagnostics was assessed using Cohen's κ coefficient.

- **Results**: In the "Very high" risk group, the agreement between AI predictions and clinical diagnostics for heart disease was poor (κ = 0.00), while prediction for cerebrovascular disease showed excellent agreement (κ = 0.89). Similarly, in the "Low" risk group, agreement for heart disease remained poor (κ = 0.00), but agreement for cerebrovascular disease was again high (κ = 0.83).

- **Conclusions**: A marked difference was observed in the algorithm's performance. While the AI showed strong predictive ability for cerebrovascular complications, it failed to reliably predict heart disease risk. These results suggest that the algorithm may be clinically valuable for cerebrovascular risk assessment but needs refinement for cardiac prediction.

### Machine learning in precision diabetes care and cardiovascular risk prediction [^112DEvdX]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). High credibility.

Key methodological considerations when interpreting ML models include finding the best algorithm. In the machine learning (ML) literature, it is widely recognized that a priori knowledge of an optimal algorithm is challenging for any given task. This often depends on the underlying dataset and the performance metric utilized, whereas for any given algorithm, performance may still vary with tuning of model-specific hyperparameters (values used to control the training process that are external to the model and cannot be computed from the data).

There is a common misconception that for any given dataset, complex models will always outperform less complex ones. This may be true for tasks involving unstructured data, particularly biomedical images and videos, where deep learning (DL) models enable automatic learning and hierarchical combination of key spatial as well as temporal features. These models are robust to variations, scalable, and transferable across tasks, rather than relying on hand-engineered features. However, for structured datasets, such as databases of clinical information used for predictive modeling, the performance of easily interpretable models, such as logistic regression, is often comparable to that of complex extreme gradient boosting or neural network methods.

Thirdly, complex models are susceptible to learning noise that may not generalize to a new dataset (overfitting). In this context, careful consideration of the available data and training plan, such as cross-validation, as well as strict separation of training and testing datasets, are warranted to maximize external validity.

### Opportunistic detection of type 2 diabetes using deep learning from frontal chest radiographs [^114WVWeY]. Nature communications (2023). High credibility.

Deep learning (DL) models can harness electronic health records (EHRs) to predict diseases and extract radiologic findings for diagnosis. With ambulatory chest radiographs (CXRs) frequently ordered, we investigated detecting type 2 diabetes (T2D) by combining radiographic and EHR data using a DL model. Our model, developed from 271,065 CXRs and 160,244 patients, was tested on a prospective dataset of 9,943 CXRs. Here, we show the model effectively detected T2D with a ROC AUC of 0.84 and a 16% prevalence. The algorithm flagged 1,381 cases (14%) as suspicious for T2D. External validation at a distinct institution yielded a ROC AUC of 0.77, with 5% of patients subsequently diagnosed with T2D. Explainable AI techniques revealed correlations between specific adiposity measures and high predictivity, suggesting CXRs' potential for enhanced T2D screening.

### Advancing point-of-care testing by application of machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence [^115MJARD]. Chest (2025). Low credibility.

The promise of artificial intelligence has generated enthusiasm among patients, healthcare professionals, and technology developers who seek to leverage its potential to enhance the diagnosis and management of an increasing number of chronic and acute conditions. Point-of-care testing increases access to care because it enables care outside of traditional medical settings. Collaboration among developers, clinicians, and end users is an effective best practice for solving clinical problems. A common set of clearly defined terms that are easily understood by research teams is a valuable tool that fosters these collaborations.

### Evaluation of machine learning methods developed for prediction of diabetes complications: A systematic review [^115nDTRe]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2023). Low credibility.

With the rising prevalence of diabetes, machine learning (ML) models have been increasingly used for the prediction of diabetes and its complications due to their ability to handle large complex data sets. This study aims to evaluate the quality and performance of ML models developed to predict microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications in an adult Type 2 diabetes population.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE®, Embase®, the Cochrane® Library, Web of Science®, and DBLP Computer Science Bibliography databases according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. Studies that developed or validated ML prediction models for microvascular or macrovascular complications in people with Type 2 diabetes were included. Prediction performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AUC > 0.75 indicates clearly useful discrimination performance, while a positive mean relative AUC difference indicates better comparative model performance.

- **Results**: Of the 13,606 articles screened, 32 studies comprising 87 ML models were included. Neural networks (n = 15) were the most frequently utilized. Age, duration of diabetes, and body mass index were common predictors in ML models. Across predicted outcomes, 36% of the models demonstrated clearly useful discrimination. Most ML models reported a positive mean relative AUC compared to non-ML methods, with random forest showing the best overall performance for microvascular and macrovascular outcomes.

### Realization of a service for the long-term risk assessment of diabetes-related complications [^1142AnST]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

We present a computerized system for the assessment of the long-term risk of developing diabetes-related complications.

- **Methods**: The core of the system consists of a set of predictive models, developed through a data-mining and machine-learning approach, which are able to evaluate individual patient profiles and provide personalized risk assessments. Missing data is a common issue in electronic patient records, thus the models are paired with a module for the intelligent management of missing information.

- **Results**: The system has been deployed and made publicly available as a web service, and it has been fully integrated within the diabetes-management platform developed by the European project REACTION. Preliminary usability tests showed that clinicians judged the models useful for risk assessment and for communicating the risk to the patient. Furthermore, the system performs as well as the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine when both systems are tested on an independent cohort of UK diabetes patients.

- **Conclusions**: Our work provides a working example of a risk-stratification tool that is (a) specific for diabetes patients, (b) able to handle several different diabetes-related complications, and (c) performing as well as the widely known UKPDS Risk Engine on an external validation cohort.

### A machine learning approach to predict foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes [^112ktjUw]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Low credibility.

Foot care self-management is underutilized in older adults, and diabetic foot ulcers are more common in this population. Identifying predictors of foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes is crucial to supporting vulnerable groups. This study aimed to identify predictors of foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes using a machine learning approach.

- **Method**: This cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2023 and February 2024 in the endocrinology and metabolic diseases departments of three hospitals in Turkey. The Patient Identification Form and the Foot Care Scale for Older Diabetics (FCS-OD) were used for data collection. Gradient boosting algorithms, including XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest, were utilized to predict the variable importance. These algorithms predicted patients with scores above or below the mean FCS-OD score.

- **Results**: XGBoost demonstrated the best performance with an AUC of 0.7469. The common predictors identified were age (0.0534), gender (0.0038), perceived health status (0.0218), and treatment regimen (0.0027). Additionally, the XGBoost model, which had the highest AUC value, identified income level (0.0055) and A1c (0.0020) as predictors of the FCS-OD score.

- **Conclusion**: The study identified age, gender, perceived health status, treatment regimen, income level, and A1c as predictors of foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes. Efforts should focus on improving foot care self-management among this vulnerable group.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: A comprehensive review [^111BLPQx]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

Metformin is the common first-line drug for the treatment of prediabetes and T2DM. However, it fails in the treatment of a third of cases. A machine learning model was developed to predict blood glucose control in patients who have consumed metformin after one year of therapy. Predictors were derived from four main features: baseline HbA1c level, comorbidities, demographic variables, and baseline metformin dosage.

A total of 20 base models containing a broad diversity of underlying methods, including RL with and without regularization and/or stepwise feature selection, tree-based models, SVM, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and flexible discriminants, were constructed. The ensemble models comprised a non-linear stack of all base models, a linear stack of all base models, and a linear stack of a subset of maximally diverse models. The basic approach underlying stacking was used to train a pool of base classifiers on a training set, and then it was utilized for training another classifier named a combiner on the predictions of the base classifiers.

Various ML models were trained by employing variables existent at the time of metformin initiation for predicting the attainment of, and maintaining, HbA1c < 7.0% after one year of treatment. AUC performances were determined from 0.58 to 0.75. The most important features were the baseline HbA1c, the presence of diabetes with complications, and the starting metformin dosage.

One of the main duties of precision medicine is developing Individualized Treatment Rules (ITRs) for patients with heterogeneous responses.

### Machine learning and deep learning predictive models for type 2 diabetes: A systematic review [^116JWY3m]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Over the last years, humanity has achieved technological breakthroughs in computer science, material science, biotechnology, genomics, and proteomics. These disruptive technologies are shifting the paradigm of medical practice. In particular, artificial intelligence and big data are reshaping disease and patient management, shifting to personalized diagnosis and treatment. This shift enables public health to become predictive and preventive.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that aims to create computer systems that discover patterns in training data to perform classification and prediction tasks on new data. Machine learning puts together tools from statistics, data mining, and optimization to generate models.

Representational learning, a subarea of machine learning, focuses on automatically finding an accurate representation of the knowledge extracted from the data. When this representation comprises many layers (i.e. a multi-level representation), we are dealing with deep learning.

### Machine learning techniques to predict the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy: A literature review [^114fsba4]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a major public health challenge with widespread prevalence, often leading to complications such as diabetic nephropathy (DN) — a chronic condition that progressively impairs kidney function. In this context, it is important to evaluate if machine learning models can exploit the inherent temporal factor in clinical data to predict the risk of developing DN faster and more accurately than clinical models.

- **Methods**: Three different databases were used for this literature review: Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed. Only articles written in English and published between January 2015 and December 2022 were included.

- **Results**: We included 11 studies, from which we discuss a number of algorithms capable of extracting knowledge from clinical data, incorporating dynamic aspects in patient assessment, and exploring their evolution over time. We also present a comparison of the different approaches, their performance, advantages, disadvantages, interpretation, and the value that the time factor can bring to a more successful prediction of diabetic nephropathy.

- **Conclusion**: Our analysis showed that some studies ignored the temporal factor, while others partially exploited it. Greater use of the temporal aspect inherent in electronic health records (EHR) data, together with the integration of omics data, could lead to the development of more reliable and powerful predictive models.

### Artificial intelligence: The future for diabetes care [^1127fjf4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing field, and its applications to diabetes, a global pandemic, can reform the approach to the diagnosis and management of this chronic condition. Principles of machine learning have been used to build algorithms that support predictive models for the risk of developing diabetes or its consequent complications. Digital therapeutics have proven to be an established intervention for lifestyle therapy in the management of diabetes. Patients are increasingly being empowered for self-management of diabetes, and both patients and healthcare professionals are benefitting from clinical decision support.

AI allows for continuous and burden-free remote monitoring of the patient's symptoms and biomarkers. Furthermore, social media and online communities enhance patient engagement in diabetes care. Technical advances have helped to optimize resource use in diabetes. Together, these intelligent technical reforms have produced better glycemic control with reductions in fasting and postprandial glucose levels, glucose excursions, and glycosylated hemoglobin. AI will introduce a paradigm shift in diabetes care, moving from conventional management strategies to building targeted data-driven precision care.

### Development and validation of prediction models for stroke and myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetes based on health insurance claims: does machine learning outperform traditional regression approaches [^114osshV]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Low credibility.

Loss to follow-up due to death for reasons other than identifiable (i.e. inpatient) cause-specific (stroke or MI) deaths during the three-year target period was ignored (i.e. treated as "no MI event" / "no stroke event", respectively). This carries the potential for bias due to competing risks for individuals who died for reasons other than stroke or MI.

As we limited eligibility to adults, 98% of the target group was included.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: A comprehensive review [^115BryyK]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

The overview of the published papers discloses that machine learning models can effectively improve the prediction and management of blood glucose and diabetes. However, they should be improved and surveyed in large datasets. A significant advantage of these models is that they can be used as an application on mobile or any other diabetes management device, ensuring the health of diabetic patients and preventing further complications. Moreover, identifying potential risk factors can help assess healthy subjects, preventing them from developing diabetes. It is predicted that the future prognosis of diseases and therapy lines depends on developing powerful machine learning methods.

### Prediction models for risk of developing type 2 diabetes: Systematic literature search and independent external validation study [^115BsK2D]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Differences in the incidence of diabetes in our cohort and in the development populations led to significant deviation between observed risk in our cohort and the predicted risk estimated by the prediction model. To reduce this source of miscalibration, we "recalibrated" each prediction model by adjusting the intercept for logistic regression models or the baseline survival function for survival regression models.

The original models were developed for different time periods of risk prediction, known as prediction horizons. For instance, some models estimate 5-year risk while others estimate 10-year risk. We assessed the performance of each model for risk prediction at 5, 7.5, and 10 years to account for these different time periods. For example, for the 5-year risk, we considered individuals as incident cases if they developed diabetes within the first five years of follow-up. Participants who developed diabetes after more than five years of follow-up were included as non-cases in the 5-year prediction. A similar approach was followed for 7.5 and 10-year predictions.

In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis using the prediction horizon for which each model was originally developed, in case this differed from the 5, 7.5, or 10-year time frames.

### Development and recalibration of a multivariable type 1 diabetes prediction model for type 1 diabetes across multiple screening studies [^115tB158]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The generation of the application represents an easy-to-use tool to help understand an individual's risk and assist in decision making. This creates an interface for clinical researchers, clinicians, families, or participants themselves to generate type 1 diabetes risk estimates. This may be helpful for communication of risk, and for decisions on the frequency of individual follow-up. This approach of generating an app or calculator has been successful in many other settings, such as maturity-onset diabetes in the young (MODY) and cardiovascular disease, which are both used to make clinical decisions.

- **Limitations**: Recalibration of the TEDDY-derived stratified prediction model improved the calibration of estimates and resulted in well-calibrated estimates in all age groups. Discrimination could be improved by additional predictors and their interaction, such as the inclusion of metabolic variables, particularly for the later stages.

Most of the participants in both cohorts are of European ancestry; in the future, it is important to address this imbalance by including participants from diverse ancestries and geographies to ensure prediction models are valid for all. We used T1D GRS percentiles derived from a UK population for individualised risk predictions, assuming that the GRS distributions are similar across the UK and USA. However, it has been previously demonstrated that GRS distributions can vary across populations. Validating these differences and adjusting percentiles accordingly are necessary to ensure accurate and equitable predictions.

### Predictive modeling of hypoglycemia risk with basal insulin use in type 2 diabetes: Use of machine learning in the LIGHTNING study [^1165HtJg]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia remains a global burden and a limiting factor in the glycemic management of people with diabetes using basal insulins or oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Hypoglycemia data gleaned from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have limited generalizability, as the strict RCT methodology and inclusion criteria do not fully reflect the real-world clinical picture. Therefore, real-world evidence, gathered from sources including electronic health records (EHR), is increasingly recognized as an important adjunct to RCTs.

- **Aims and methods**: The LIGHTNING study applied advanced analytical methods, including machine learning (ML), to EHR data. The study aimed to predict hypoglycemic event rates in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) receiving different basal insulin treatments. The goal was to identify potential subgroups of patients who are at lower risk of hypoglycemia when treated with one basal insulin compared to another, and to predict hypoglycemia-related cost savings in these subgroups. Here we provide an overview of the objectives, study design and methods, and validation approaches used in the LIGHTNING study.

- **Conclusion**: It is hoped that the results of the LIGHTNING study will help facilitate real-world clinical decision-making in addition to providing a clinically relevant predictive model of hypoglycemia risk.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: A comprehensive review [^111y7Ua1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

The prediction of blood glucose levels is crucial in the management of diabetes. Maintaining blood glucose (BG) within the normal range of 70–120 mg/dL (3.6–6.9 mmol/L) is challenging, particularly as precise glycemic control using bolus insulin injections can increase the risk of hypoglycemic incidents. To address this, closed-loop systems and computational methods have been developed to aid BG control. However, modeling and controlling BG remain significant challenges in diabetes management.

Modeling involves learning an accurate BG forecasting model based on various variables, while controlling involves using the developed model to forecast BG levels and propose recommendations. The algorithms used for predicting BG are critical in advancing closed-loop insulin delivery and decision support systems for diabetes management.

Multitask learning is an effective strategy for utilizing data from multiple cases, enabling accurate personalized models. This approach has demonstrated a stable performance in predictive metrics for both long-term and short-term prediction horizons. Predictive accuracy measured by RMSE was 18.8, 25.3, 31.8, 41.2, and 47.2 mg/dL at 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes prediction horizons, respectively, achieving approximately 93% clinically admissible predictions using the Clarke Error Grid Analysis (EGA). These results highlighted the success of multitask learning compared to sequential transfer learning.

### Is handling unbalanced datasets for machine learning uplifts system performance? A case of diabetic prediction [^1115zpMd]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

Healthcare is a sensitive sector, and addressing the class imbalance in this domain is a time-consuming task for machine learning-based systems due to the vast amount of data. This study examines the impact of socioeconomic disparities on the healthcare data of diabetic patients to enable accurate disease predictions.

- **Methods**: This study proposed a systematic approach of Closest Distance Ranking and Principal Component Analysis to deal with the unbalanced dataset. A typical machine learning technique was used to analyze the proposed approach. The dataset of pregnant diabetic women was analyzed for accurate detection.

- **Results**: The results of the case were analyzed using sensitivity, demonstrating that the minority class's lack of information makes it impossible to forecast outcomes. However, the unbalanced dataset was treated using the proposed technique and evaluated with the machine learning algorithm, significantly increasing the system's performance.

- **Conclusion**: The performance of the machine learning-based system was significantly enhanced by processing the unbalanced dataset with the proposed technique and evaluating it using the machine learning algorithm. For the first time, an unbalanced dataset was treated with a combination of Closest Distance Ranking and Principal Component Analysis.

### Machine learning-based stratification of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes progression [^112JST4s]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our results indicate that integrating machine learning, bioinformatics, and clinical data with biochemical and molecular features shows significant potential to enhance diagnostic precision and staging of diabetes. The classifiers developed in this study effectively differentiated diabetes stages in our cohort, highlighting the promise of multimodal approaches for precision medicine applications. However, these results represent a proof-of-concept requiring rigorous external validation before clinical implementation can be considered.

Future work must address key limitations through:

- **Validation**: On larger, multi-center datasets with diverse demographics.
- **Real-world performance testing**: In clinical workflows.
- **Assessment of long-term impact**: On patient outcomes.

Until such validation is completed, this framework should be considered a research tool rather than a clinical solution.

### Application of machine learning models to evaluate hypoglycemia risk in type 2 diabetes [^11216hJ5]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

To identify predictors of hypoglycemia and five other clinical and economic outcomes among treated patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using machine learning and structured data from a large, geographically diverse administrative claims database, the following methods were employed:

- **Study design**: A retrospective cohort study design was applied to Optum Clinformatics claims data indexed on the first antidiabetic prescription date.

- **Analytics platform**: A hypothesis-free, Bayesian machine learning analytics platform (GNS Healthcare REFS™: Reverse Engineering and Forward Simulation) was used to build ensembles of generalized linear models. These ensembles aimed to predict six outcomes defined in patients' 1-year post-index claims history, including hypoglycemia, antidiabetic class persistence, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) target attainment, HbA1c change, T2D-related inpatient admissions, and T2D-related medical costs.

- **Predictor variables**: A unified set of 388 variables defined in patients' 1-year pre-index claims history constituted the set of predictors for all REFS models.

- **Results**:

The derivation cohort comprised 453,487 patients with a T2D diagnosis between 2014 and 2017. Patients with comorbid conditions had the highest risk of hypoglycemia, including those with prior hypoglycemia (odds ratio [OR] = 25.61) and anemia (OR = 1.29). Other identified risk factors included insulin (OR = 2.84) and sulfonylurea use (OR = 1.80). Biguanide use (OR = 0.75), high blood glucose (> 125 mg/dL vs. < 100 mg/dL, OR = 0.47; 100–125 mg/dL vs. < 100 mg/dL, OR = 0.53), and missing blood glucose test (OR = 0.40) were associated with reduced risk of hypoglycemia. The area under the curve (AUC) of the hypoglycemia model was not fully provided, indicating cut-off sentences.

### Development and recalibration of a multivariable type 1 diabetes prediction model for type 1 diabetes across multiple screening studies [^117EhM2R]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Accurate type 1 diabetes prediction is important to facilitate screening for pre-clinical type 1 diabetes to enable potential early disease-modifying interventions and to reduce the risk of severe presentation with diabetic ketoacidosis. We aimed to assess the generalisability of a prediction model developed in children followed from birth. Additionally, we sought to create an application for easy calculation and visualization of individualized risk prediction.

- **Methods**: We developed and internally validated a stratified prediction model combining a genetic risk score, age, islet autoantibodies, and family history using data from children followed since birth by The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. We tested the validity of the model through external validation in the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Pathway to Prevention study, which conducts cross-sectional screening in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. We recalibrated the model by adjusting for baseline risk and selection criteria in TrialNet using logistic recalibration to improve calibration across all ages.

- **Results**: The study included 7,798 TEDDY and 4,068 TrialNet participants, with 305 (4%) and 1,373 (34%) developing type 1 diabetes, respectively. The stratified model showed similar discriminative ability in autoantibody-positive participants across TEDDY and TrialNet, but inferior calibration in TrialNet (Brier score 0.40 [95% CI 0.38, 0.43]). Adjustment for baseline risk and selection criteria in TrialNet using logistic recalibration improved calibration across all ages.

### Detection of diabetic patients in people with normal fasting glucose using machine learning [^113XvN3A]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

With the increase of data volume, machine learning techniques have the potential to revolutionize diabetes screening by enabling more accurate risk stratification and timely interventions. The performance of ML-based methods is influenced by the availability of the number of samples and features. For instance, the combination of ML techniques and electronic health record data could enhance the effectiveness of diabetes screening and improve patient outcomes.

One of the challenging issues in utilizing ML techniques is selecting the most suitable method to achieve optimal performance on a given dataset. Nearly all machine learning techniques have been applied to diabetes risk prediction; however, no single method consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. Dinh et al. reported that the model predicting diabetes with eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) performed better than those of RF, SVM, and LR based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset.

With the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD), which is a widely used dataset in diabetes recognition with machine learning, a study constructed 24 classifiers such as decision tree, LR, discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and ensemble learners. It found that the best accuracy score of 77.9% was produced by the LR model. Jahangir and his colleagues devised an automatic multilayer perceptron model achieving an accuracy of 88.7% on PIDD, although they did not train other machine learning models using the processed data. The difference in performance between these two studies may not be solely due to the choice of model.

Diabetes is a chronic, potentially fatal disease that has affected millions globally. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) accounts for 90% of the affected population among all types of diabetes. Millions of T2DM patients remain undiagnosed due to lack of awareness and under-resourced healthcare systems. There is a dire need for diagnostic and prognostic tools to aid healthcare providers, clinicians, and practitioners in the early prediction of T2DM. These tools can recommend lifestyle changes necessary to halt the progression of diabetes. The main objective of this research is to develop a framework based on machine learning techniques using only lifestyle indicators for the prediction of T2DM.

A proposed framework is presented and implemented based on machine learning paradigms using lifestyle indicators for better prediction of T2DM. The research involved experts such as diabetologists, endocrinologists, dieticians, and nutritionists in selecting contributing 1,552 instances and 11 attribute lifestyle biological features to promote health and manage complications related to T2DM. The dataset was collected through surveys and Google Forms from different geographical regions.

Seven machine learning classifiers were employed: K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB).

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: a comprehensive review [^116NYF71]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

To predict glycemic outcomes, an Elastic Network (EN), used to address variable collinearity, was combined with RF, SVM, and Back-Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) algorithms. In addition, a stepwise logistic regression was performed to compare ML models. Basic information, diabetes-related data, and biochemical indices were used as variables. Multivariable analysis revealed that exercising, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease history, hypertension history, and total cholesterol were protective factors in the control of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), whereas family history, insulin dose, central adiposity, complications, T2DM duration, hypertension, and blood pressure were identified as risk factors for increased HbA1c. After dimensional reduction by EN, the AUC of SVM, RF, and BP were determined as 0.72, 0.75, and 0.72, respectively. Furthermore, the EN and machine learning models demonstrated superior accuracy and sensitivity compared to logistic regression models. The EN and ML algorithms could be considered as alternatives to the traditional logistic model for constructing predictive methods of blood glucose control in T2DM patients.

A personalized glucose monitoring system (PGMS) comprises both non-invasive and invasive sensors on a single device. In one study, blood glucose data was used for training ML models. The paired data and corresponding errors were then divided into six different clusters based on blood glucose ranges. Each cluster was trained to develop a unique error prediction model using an AdaBoost approach.

### An early prediction model for gestational diabetes mellitus created using machine learning algorithms [^11699AvN]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

To investigate high-risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in early pregnancy, an analysis of demographic and clinical data was conducted. The study aimed to develop a machine-learning-based prediction model to enhance early diagnosis and intervention. A retrospective study was performed involving 942 pregnant women. A stacking ensemble, a machine learning (ML) approach, was applied to demographic and clinical variables to create a predictive model for GDM. Model performance was evaluated through receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Risk stratification was performed using quartile-based probability thresholds, and predictive accuracy was validated using an independent dataset.

Significant predictors for GDM included: age, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), history of GDM, family history of diabetes, history of fetal macrosomia, education level, history of hypertension, and gravidity. These factors, which can be collected non-invasively at the first prenatal visit, formed the basis of a robust predictive model with an AUC of 0.89. The model demonstrated a strong ability to exclude GDM at a threshold of 28.53%.

The machine-learning-based prediction model effectively identifies populations at high risk for GDM before invasive testing and oral glucose tolerance test, facilitating early clinical intervention and resource optimization.

### Application of machine learning models to evaluate hypoglycemia risk in type 2 diabetes [^115TV31y]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Machine learning models built with real-world data can be informative tools for the development of value-based contracts. The models developed in this study accurately identified patients at risk of critical clinical outcomes, including hypoglycemia, while uncovering the primary risk factors of those outcomes in a real-world setting. The ability of Bayesian network models to extract and perform inference in high-dimensional data is essential for guiding clinical practice, where "black box" technology is untrustworthy and holistic approaches are merited. This study also demonstrated the potential economic impact of deploying machine learning models in practice by quantifying resource use and costs in patients with the highest predicted risk of hypoglycemia. Indeed, targeted interventions towards high-risk patients may additionally benefit economic outcomes relevant to key stakeholders in competitive therapeutic areas like diabetes. As the healthcare industry moves toward value-based care reimbursement models, it becomes critical for pharmaceutical companies to work effectively with health plans by providing key insights into optimal treatment intervention strategies for members at risk of poor clinical and economic outcomes.

### Explainable machine learning for real-time hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia prediction and personalized control recommendations [^115J4chk]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). High credibility.

We separate our CGM data into a hold-out test set (25%) and a training set (75%). An individual's complete set of CGM data is allocated to only one of the training or test sets, ensuring there is no data leakage or overfitting when evaluating model performance. However, we note that randomly separating data, allowing an individual's CGM data to be split between both train and test sets, only marginally improves model performance.

Our supervised models, such as logistic regression and XGBoost, learn from the training set, and all models are evaluated using the same test sample. Since we filter data based on an individual's average usage over the prior week (≥ 80% to be included in the feature set), there are rare occurrences where we have insufficient data to compute trends (e.g. mean, standard deviation [SD], consecutive changes) and have missing feature values for these entries. This most commonly happens when an individual replaces their sensor, resulting in a significant gap in the prior hour's readings. To compare model performance fairly, we remove data with missing values from the test samples.

- **Model performance considerations**: Including entries with missing values for the XGBoost models (which can natively handle missing values, unlike the logistic regression models) does not result in a significant performance decrease.

- **Evaluation metrics**: Overall, model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and average precision, along with fixed measures of specificity and sensitivity.

### Machine learning techniques to predict the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy: a literature review [^114oD66C]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Despite the great capabilities and improvements that these proposed models can potentially bring to medical care, the various papers reviewed have limitations that are clearly stated by the authors. Some of the most commonly cited limitations are as follows:

- **Clinic-based sample**: The patient sample was clinic-based rather than population-based, which means that the model was only tested on a specific dataset extracted from the population of a particular hospital or clinic. Furthermore, in most studies, there is no external validation dataset, leading to great uncertainty about generalization to a wider population. Cabitza et al. show how external validation is essential for building robust predictive models in medicine.

- **Small data samples and missing data**: Models trained on a small amount of data can result in poor generalizability and lead to incorrect conclusions. Too much missing data can affect the consistency of the data across different visits by a given patient. This consistency is essential to build a model that can deal with the time factor and make a prediction.

- **Missing important features**: Several papers have highlighted various missing demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables that may be essential to improve outcomes.

- **Inter-record dependency**: Almost all of the selected papers assume that the examples are independent of each other, which is inaccurate because multiple records belonging to a single patient have been obtained. The ability to account for this inter-record dependency is key to unlocking the potential that may exist in the temporal value of electronic health record (EHR) data.

### Artificial intelligence in diabetes care: Applications, challenges, and opportunities ahead [^111C9Vdi]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming clinical medicine, and its potential impact on diabetes care is particularly noteworthy. In recent years, both traditional machine learning approaches and deep learning algorithms have been applied to improve screening for complications of diabetes, such as retinopathy, macular edema, and neuropathy, predict disease progression risk, and enhance clinical decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment optimization. AI-driven solutions are also emerging to identify noninvasive biomarkers for detecting diabetes and prediabetes, analyze the macronutrient content of meals using image-based deep learning methods, integrate novel risk prediction tools within electronic health records, and optimize automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. These advancements hold promise for streamlining patient care, personalizing treatment plans, and ultimately improving clinical outcomes. In this narrative review, we examine the latest AI applications in diabetes care, exploring their capabilities, limitations, and the future directions necessary to realize their full potential to improve the care of people living with diabetes.

### A machine learning approach to predict foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes [^114kwr5J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Low credibility.

The study had a cross-sectional design, and data were collected between November 2023 and February 2024. It aimed to identify predictors of lower levels of foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes using a machine learning approach. The study was conducted and presented in line with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline.

- **Study setting and sample**: The study was conducted in a public hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, between November 2023 and January 2024. Patients admitted to the endocrinology and metabolic disorders department of the hospital were included. Convenience sampling was used, with inclusion criteria being age 65 years or older, a diagnosis of diabetes for at least six months, absence of cognitive disorders, and willingness to participate in the study. Patients diagnosed with diabetic foot ulcers or those with a history of diabetic foot ulcers or amputation were excluded. Forty-two patients were excluded due to a history of diabetic foot ulcers. Two patients were excluded because of cognitive impairment, as both were diagnosed with dementia by a neurologist, which was confirmed by the patient's electronic records. Written permission was obtained from the medical research ethics committee of Uskudar University under protocol number 2023–54.

### TransformEHR: Transformer-based encoder-decoder generative model to enhance prediction of disease outcomes using electronic health records [^1151DjHn]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) among U.S. hospitals has led to the development and adoption of numerous data mining and statistical techniques for EHRs. Longitudinal EHRs have been successfully used to predict clinical diseases or outcomes. Early work applied regression and traditional machine learning (ML) based models, such as support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting, to predict single diseases or outcomes. Examples include congestive heart failure, sepsis mortality, mechanical ventilation, septic shock, type 2 diabetes, and the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), among others.

With the availability of large cohorts and computational resources, deep learning-based models can outperform traditional ML models. State-of-the-art (SOTA) models in EHR-based predictive modeling achieved this through the pretrain-finetune paradigm — a two-step process where the model is first trained on large-scale longitudinal EHRs to learn the representations of clinical features, such as International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes (pretrain), and then further trained to adapt to specific tasks, e.g. outcome prediction (finetune). Models such as Med-BERT, BEHRT, and BRLTM fall into this category. However, their pretraining objectives were limited to predicting a fraction of ICD codes within each visit. In reality, most patients have multiple diseases or outcomes at once, many of which are highly correlated (such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) and thus collectively contribute to the disease or outcome.

### Machine learning and deep learning predictive models for type 2 diabetes: A systematic review [^1163gHQN]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a severe, chronic disease that occurs when blood glucose levels rise above certain limits. Over the last few years, machine learning and deep learning techniques have been used to predict diabetes and its complications. However, researchers and developers still face two main challenges when building type 2 diabetes predictive models.

First, there is considerable heterogeneity in previous studies regarding techniques used, making it challenging to identify the optimal one. Second, there is a lack of transparency about the features used in the models, which reduces their interpretability. This systematic review aimed to provide answers to the above challenges. The review followed the PRISMA methodology primarily, enriched with the one proposed by Keele and Durham Universities. Ninety studies were included, and the type of model, complementary techniques, dataset, and performance parameters reported were extracted. Eighteen different types of models were compared, with tree-based algorithms showing top performances.

Deep neural networks proved suboptimal, despite their ability to deal with big and dirty data. Balancing data and feature selection techniques proved helpful to increase the model's efficiency. Models trained on tidy datasets achieved almost perfect models.

### Prediction models for risk of developing type 2 diabetes: Systematic literature search and independent external validation study [^115pJspr]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

We assessed performance of the models using measures of discrimination and calibration. Discrimination describes the ability of the model to distinguish those at high risk of developing diabetes from those at low risk. The discrimination was examined by calculating Harrell's C (comparable with the area under the ROC curve), accounting for censored data. Calibration indicates the ability of the model to correctly estimate the absolute risks and was examined by calibration plots. In a calibration plot, the predicted risk is plotted against the observed incidence of the outcome. Ideally, the predicted risk equals the observed incidence throughout the entire risk spectrum, and the calibration plot follows the 45° line. The calibration plot was extended to a "validation" plot as a summary tool. Appendix 2 gives more details on information provided by this plot. Calibration was also tested with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit statistic for time-to-event data.

Follow-up of our cohort was almost complete until about eight years: 3% were censored at 5 years, 5% at 7.5 years, and 44.6% at 10 years. To account for censoring when obtaining the observed probabilities for assessing calibration over, say, 10 years of follow-up, we first calculated for each individual the linear predictor and subsequently the 10-year predicted outcome probability by the original survival models. This predicted probability was then divided into tenths, and we performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis per tenth, which accounts for the observed censoring. Per tenth, we obtained at the 10-year time point the observed outcome.

### Machine learning and deep learning predictive models for type 2 diabetes: A systematic review [^115BQFnu]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. In particular, type 2 diabetes is associated with insulin resistance, where cells respond poorly to insulin, affecting their glucose intake. The diagnostic criteria established by the American Diabetes Association are: (1) a level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) greater than or equal to 6.5%; (2) a basal fasting blood glucose level greater than 126 mg/dL; and (3) a blood glucose level greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test with 75 g of glucose.

Diabetes mellitus is a global public health issue. In 2019, the International Diabetes Federation estimated the number of people living with diabetes worldwide at 463 million, with expected growth at 51% by the year 2045. Moreover, it is estimated that there is one undiagnosed person for each diagnosed person with diabetes.

The early diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes are among the most relevant actions to prevent further development and complications like diabetic retinopathy. According to the ADDITION-Europe Simulation Model Study, an early diagnosis reduces the absolute and relative risk of suffering cardiovascular events and mortality. A sensitivity analysis on USA data proved a 25% relative reduction in diabetes-related complication rates for a 2-year earlier diagnosis.

Consequently, many researchers have endeavored to develop predictive models of type 2 diabetes. The first models were based on machine learning and deep learning techniques.

### Predicting short- and long-term glycated haemoglobin response after insulin initiation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using machine-learning algorithms [^113PdScX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

When oral therapies fail to control blood glucose levels or cause severe side effects in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), insulin therapy is recommended. Approximately 15% to 24% of patients with T2DM receive insulin treatment. Large variability in response to insulin treatment is seen, resulting partly from differences in demographic, genetic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics. Notably, suboptimal blood glucose levels could lead to higher risks of cardiovascular complications and mortality.

In clinical settings, identification of variables that can predict a patient's individual response to insulin could help tailor treatment. Previous studies have established prediction models for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) response to insulin using univariate and multivariate analysis of several demographic and clinical variables. Amongst others, age, body mass index (BMI), and baseline HbA1c appeared to influence HbA1c response after insulin treatment initiation. Prediction models based on such traditional regression analyses, however, have limited utility for clinical decision-making because they do not personalize the prediction to the individual. Similarly, studies that identify clinical characteristics associated with distinct HbA1c trajectories in patients with T2DM over the course of insulin treatment via unsupervised clustering algorithms cannot sufficiently guide clinical decision-making. Such studies lead to inconsistent groupings of patients, suggesting…

### Prediction model for type 2 diabetes mellitus and its association with mortality using machine learning in three independent cohorts from South Korea, Japan, and the UK: a model development and validation study [^117D3eDq]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

The findings of this study suggest that the early prediction of incident T2DM can significantly influence public health policy and clinical practice, particularly when designing targeted prevention strategies. The ability to predict the likelihood of incident T2DM within 5 years based on routine national health checkups offers a significant clinical benefit, as it allows for early preventive interventions that could drastically reduce the disease burden. Health systems, particularly in countries with a high T2DM incidence, could implement these predictive models as part of routine health checkups to identify high-risk individuals. Moreover, the strong association between T2DM risk and mortality enhances its utility in clinical decision-making, enabling more aggressive management of risk factors in those at elevated risk. Because the model has been validated across multiple countries, it holds great potential as a widely used platform, providing clinicians with valuable tools for both disease prevention and mortality reduction.

One of the key strengths of this study is the use of large-scale population-based cohorts from three countries, which enhances the generalizability of the findings. This study also benefits from rigorous external validation and the application of advanced ML techniques, contributing to the predictive models' robustness. However, findings from this study must be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, the reliance on routinely collected health checkup data meant that some potentially relevant variables, such as genetic factors or detailed diet.
