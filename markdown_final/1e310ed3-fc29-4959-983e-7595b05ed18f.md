## Question

For overactive bladder, is there another medication to try instead of mybetriq and gemtesa?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about other medication options for overactive bladder if they want to avoid or switch from Myrbetriq (mirabegron) and Gemtesa (vibegron). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what pharmacologic class these agents belong to and their role in guidelines. Then, I should verify what guideline-directed alternatives exist and which specific drugs within those classes have the strongest evidence. Next, I will review when to consider combination therapy or escalation to third-line options. After that, I need to consider patient-specific factors that influence selection, including cognitive risk and comorbid BPH. Finally, I will outline a practical, guideline-consistent algorithm that incorporates follow-up and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic class we are moving away from. Myrbetriq and Gemtesa are β3-adrenergic receptor agonists that relax the detrusor during bladder filling and increase capacity, a mechanism distinct from antimuscarinics that block muscarinic receptors and suppress involuntary contractions; vibegron's mechanism and neutral blood pressure profile were characterized in FDA materials, and mirabegron is similarly labeled for OAB as a β3 agonist class member, so I should ensure the alternative I propose represents a true mechanistic switch if β3s were ineffective or poorly tolerated [^113Wj2E9] [^114RT1Qc].

> Hold on, I should verify what guidelines recommend as the primary alternative class. The AUA/SUFU 2024 guideline advises that first-line pharmacotherapy can be either a β3 agonist or an antimuscarinic, and if a patient has inadequate efficacy or tolerability with one class, clinicians should consider switching to a different agent within the same class or to the other class; therefore, if we are discontinuing mirabegron or vibegron, the main evidence-based alternative is an antimuscarinic, with shared decision-making about risks, including cognitive concerns that should be discussed explicitly when prescribing antimuscarinics [^117TY3iy] [^117TY3iy] [^114uj6Cg].

> Wait, let me verify specific antimuscarinic options and their evidence. Tolterodine is FDA-approved for OAB and serves as an established comparator in trials and labels; systematic reviews suggest broadly similar efficacy across antimuscarinics with small absolute differences, with dry mouth and constipation driving discontinuations, especially with oxybutynin, which also carries stronger signals for cognitive impairment, while darifenacin (M3 selective) and trospium (quaternary amine with limited CNS penetration) may have more favorable cognitive profiles in older adults; solifenacin and fesoterodine show efficacy advantages in some analyses, albeit with class-typical anticholinergic adverse effects, so I should match the agent to the patient's tolerability and cognitive risk profile [^114PSYbQ] [^116heSEX] [^115Ms6CJ] [^112sMrXb].

> I need to check whether combination therapy has a role before abandoning pharmacotherapy entirely. If a patient had only one class at a time, AUA/SUFU supports combination therapy across classes, typically mirabegron plus solifenacin, which offers modest incremental benefits over monotherapy at the cost of more constipation and dry mouth; although the user is asking about switching from β3 agonists, if partial response was present, re-introducing a lower-dose β3 with an antimuscarinic can be discussed as a shared decision, acknowledging the absolute effect sizes are small but sometimes clinically meaningful to patients [^113gt1ZW] [^116heSEX] [^1158Ej6A].

> Next, I should review third-line pharmacologic options in case both classes are ineffective or intolerable. OnabotulinumtoxinA 100 units intradetrusor is FDA-approved for OAB after inadequate response or intolerance to anticholinergics, with two phase III trials demonstrating significant reductions in incontinence at 12 weeks versus placebo; per AUA/SUFU, when minimally invasive therapies like Botox are effective, oral agents can be discontinued, with the caveat to restart if efficacy wanes, and patients must be counseled on retention risk and the need for intermittent catheterization in a minority [^115f7NH6] [^1133KYDf].

> But wait, what if patient characteristics shift the benefit-risk calculus. For adults 55 and older or with baseline cognitive concerns, I should avoid or minimize agents with higher CNS penetration such as oxybutynin, tolterodine, and possibly solifenacin, and preferentially consider β3 agonists, trospium, or darifenacin if an antimuscarinic is needed; in men with BPH and concomitant OAB, AUA/SUFU allows monotherapy with either class or combination with an α-blocker, with attention to urinary retention risk when adding antimuscarinics, and I should confirm blood pressure stability if re-considering β3s, noting vibegron's dedicated ambulatory BP study showed no clinically meaningful BP change [^114uj6Cg] [^113RD6GM] [^115Ms6CJ] [^113Wj2E9].

> I will now examine the recommended management algorithm to ensure my plan is guideline-concordant. After initiating or changing therapy, assess efficacy and adverse effects early; if response is inadequate but tolerability acceptable, consider dose optimization or switching within class; if side effects are problematic, switch classes; if response is partial, consider combination therapy across classes; if both classes fail or are intolerable, proceed to third-line options like Botox or neuromodulation; EAU guidance similarly emphasizes early follow-up to manage adverse effects and reassess benefit, which I should build into the care plan [^114NckBe] [^113gt1ZW] [^113zcERc] [^112U9XTG].

> Hmm, wait a minute, are there credible investigational or off-pathway pharmacologic alternatives I should mention. Agents such as solabegron (β3), P2X3 antagonists like eliapixant, and PDE-5 inhibitors like tadalafil have been explored but are not standard of care for idiopathic OAB at this time; given the lack of robust, practice-changing data and approvals, I should not recommend these outside trials, but it is reasonable to acknowledge them when patients inquire about pipeline options [^1137xs93] [^116RXSGJ] [^1137xs93].

> Putting this together, the practical switch-away options from Myrbetriq and Gemtesa are the antimuscarinics, chosen and titrated with attention to tolerability and cognitive risk; solifenacin, fesoterodine, darifenacin, tolterodine, and trospium are reasonable, while I should be cautious with oxybutynin in older adults or those with cognitive vulnerability; if monotherapies in either class yield only partial benefit, combination therapy can confer incremental gains, and if both classes fail or cannot be tolerated, onabotulinumtoxinA is the next evidence-based step, all within a framework of early reassessment and shared decision-making tailored to comorbidities such as BPH and risk of urinary retention [^116heSEX] [^115Ms6CJ] [^113gt1ZW] [^115f7NH6] [^114NckBe].

---

Yes, if Myrbetriq (mirabegron) and Gemtesa (vibegron) are not effective or tolerated, **anticholinergic agents** [^117TY3iy] such as oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin, fesoterodine, or trospium are recommended alternatives for overactive bladder [^116heSEX]. If oral medications fail or are not tolerated, **third-line options** [^1133KYDf] include onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injections [^115f7NH6] or neuromodulation (sacral or tibial). Choice should be individualized based on side effects, comorbidities, and patient preference [^114NckBe], with caution regarding cognitive risks in older adults on anticholinergics [^114uj6Cg] [^115Ms6CJ].

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

### Anticholinergic medications

Anticholinergic agents are a well-established class for OAB; they **block muscarinic receptors** in the bladder, reducing involuntary contractions [^112sMrXb]. Commonly prescribed anticholinergic medications include:

- **Oxybutynin**: Available in immediate-release, extended-release, and transdermal patch formulations. It is effective but often associated with side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and cognitive impairment [^1155Fow9], particularly in older adults [^114uj6Cg].

- **Tolterodine**: Available in immediate-release and extended-release formulations [^114PSYbQ]. It has a similar efficacy profile to oxybutynin but may have a slightly better tolerability profile [^116heSEX].

- **Solifenacin**: A selective M3 receptor antagonist that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing urgency, frequency, and incontinence episodes [^116heSEX]. It may have a lower incidence of cognitive side effects compared to non-selective anticholinergics [^116y6hVf].

- **Darifenacin**: Another selective M3 receptor antagonist with a favorable cognitive safety profile, making it a suitable option for older adults concerned about cognitive impairment [^115Ms6CJ].

- **Fesoterodine**: A prodrug of tolterodine that has shown efficacy in reducing OAB symptoms with a tolerability profile similar to other anticholinergics [^116heSEX].

- **Trospium**: A quaternary ammonium compound that poorly penetrates the blood-brain barrier, potentially reducing the risk of cognitive side effects [^115Ms6CJ].

---

### Combination therapy

Combination therapy with an anticholinergic and a beta-3 agonist (such as mirabegron) can provide **additional symptom relief** [^114vtzhv] for patients who respond inadequately to monotherapy [^113gt1ZW]. However, it may also increase the risk of side effects, particularly anticholinergic-related adverse events [^115Sri8N].

---

## Non-pharmacological and minimally invasive alternatives

For patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to pharmacological therapy, several **non-pharmacological and minimally invasive options** are available [^1133KYDf]:

- **OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injections**: Intradetrusor injections of Botox have been shown to significantly reduce urgency, frequency, and incontinence episodes [^115f7NH6] in patients with refractory OAB. However, this treatment requires periodic injections and carries a risk of urinary retention, necessitating intermittent self-catheterization in some patients [^1133KYDf].

- **Sacral neuromodulation**: This minimally invasive procedure involves the implantation of a device that stimulates the sacral nerves, thereby modulating bladder function [^114uj6Cg]. It has been shown to be effective in patients with refractory OAB but requires surgical implantation and ongoing device management.

- **Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS)**: This non-invasive neuromodulation technique involves electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve, which indirectly modulates bladder function. PTNS has demonstrated efficacy in reducing OAB symptoms and is generally well-tolerated [^1133KYDf].

---

## Emerging therapies and investigational drugs

Several **new pharmacological agents** are under investigation for OAB, including solabegron — a beta-3 adrenergic agonist in phase 2 trials with preliminary efficacy and a favorable tolerability profile; phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g. tadalafil), which aim to improve bladder function by increasing cyclic GMP levels and relaxing bladder smooth muscle [^116RXSGJ]; and purinergic P2X3 receptor antagonists (e.g. eliapixant), which target sensory pathways involved in bladder overactivity and may offer a novel mechanism of action.

---

## Clinical considerations and patient-specific factors

When selecting alternative treatments for OAB, several **patient-specific factors** should be considered:

- **Age and cognitive function**: Anticholinergic medications should be used cautiously in older adults due to the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia [^114uj6Cg] [^115Ms6CJ].

- **Comorbidities**: Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, impaired gastric emptying, or a history of urinary retention should avoid anticholinergic medications [^114PSYbQ].

- **Patient preference and lifestyle**: Shared decision-making is essential to ensure patient adherence and satisfaction with treatment [^114RGNvn] [^114NckBe].

## Summary of alternative medications and therapies for OAB

| **Medication/class** | **Mechanism of action** | **Common side effects** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Oxybutynin | Anticholinergic | - Dry mouth <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Cognitive impairment | Caution in elderly |
| Tolterodine | Anticholinergic | - Dry mouth <br/> - Constipation | Similar efficacy to oxybutynin |
| Solifenacin | Anticholinergic | - Dry mouth <br/> - Constipation | Lower cognitive risk |
| Darifenacin | Anticholinergic | - Dry mouth <br/> - Constipation | Lower cognitive risk |
| Fesoterodine | Anticholinergic | - Dry mouth <br/> - Constipation | Similar to tolterodine |
| Trospium | Anticholinergic | - Dry mouth <br/> - Constipation | Lower cognitive risk |
| OnabotulinumtoxinA | Neurotoxin | - Urinary retention <br/> - UTI | Requires injections |
| Sacral neuromodulation | Neuromodulation | Surgical risks | Requires implantation |
| PTNS | Neuromodulation | Minimal | Non-invasive |

---

If Myrbetriq and Gemtesa are ineffective or not tolerated, **anticholinergic medications are recommended alternatives** for OAB [^117TY3iy]. Non-pharmacological options such as Botox injections, sacral neuromodulation, and PTNS are also available [^1133KYDf]. Emerging therapies like solabegron and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are under investigation [^1137xs93]. Treatment selection should consider patient-specific factors, side effects, and preferences [^114NckBe].

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: a systematic review [^116heSEX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition that increases with age and affects quality of life. While numerous OAB drugs are available, persistence is low. We evaluated evidence published since 2012 to determine if newer drugs provided better efficacy and harm profiles.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from 2012 to September 2018 using terms for included drugs and requested information from manufacturers of included drugs. We performed dual review of all systematic review processes, evaluated study quality, and conducted meta-analyses using random effects models.

- **Results**: In addition to 31 older studies, we included 20 trials published since 2012 (N = 16,478; 4 good, 11 fair, and 5 poor quality). Where statistical differences were found, they were clinically small (reductions of < 0.5 episodes/day). Solifenacin plus mirabegron improved efficacy outcomes over monotherapy with either drug but significantly increased constipation compared with solifenacin and dry mouth compared with mirabegron. Solifenacin reduced incontinence over mirabegron and tolterodine and urgency episodes over tolterodine. Mirabegron did not differ from tolterodine in efficacy but had a significantly lower incidence of dry mouth than solifenacin or tolterodine. Fesoterodine showed significant improvements but also anticholinergic effects vs. tolterodine. Oxybutynin, solifenacin, and tolterodine had similar efficacy, but dry mouth led to greater discontinuation with oxybutynin. Blurred vision, cardiac arrhythmia, and dizziness were uncommon.

Conclusion: New evidence suggests that while newer OAB treatments offer some efficacy improvements, they also pose increased risks of adverse effects.

### Botox [^115f7NH6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center, 24-week clinical studies were conducted in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) exhibiting symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency (Studies OAB-1 and OAB-2). Patients needed to have at least three urinary urgency incontinence episodes and at least 24 micturitions over a three-day period to qualify for the studies. A total of 1105 patients, whose symptoms had not been adequately managed with anticholinergic therapy (due to inadequate response or intolerable side effects), were randomized to receive either 100 units of Botox (n = 557) or placebo (n = 548). Patients received 20 injections of the study drug (5 units of Botox or placebo) spaced approximately 1 cm apart into the detrusor muscle.

In both studies, significant improvements in the primary efficacy variable, which measured the change from baseline in the daily frequency of urinary incontinence episodes, were observed for Botox 100 units at the primary time point of week 12 compared to placebo. Significant improvements relative to placebo were also noted for the secondary efficacy variables of daily frequency of micturition episodes and volume voided per micturition.

### Refractory overactive bladder: A common problem [^111q3o1q]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The incidence of refractory overactive bladder (OAB) seems to be overestimated. An unsatisfactory improvement of symptoms in the first-line treatment option for patients with OAB may depend on various factors. Realistic estimation of treatment outcomes and side effects by the patient and/or the physician, individual patient guidance to improve the patient's motivation to adhere to treatment, review of the OAB diagnosis, and exclusion of other underlying causes, as well as individual antimuscarinic dose adjustment, are procedures that can improve the success of OAB therapy in daily medical practice. The authors suggest using the term "refractory OAB" only in cases when the aforementioned steps have confirmed the patient's nonresponse to first-line treatment, including antimuscarinic therapy.

### Clinically meaningful improvements with vibegron in men with overactive bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia: A responder analysis of the phase 3 COURAGE trial [^115m1Fv7]. Urology (2025). Low credibility.

To demonstrate the impact of vibegron treatment in the phase 3 COURAGE trial (NCT03902080) on clinically meaningful response parameters in men with overactive bladder (OAB) receiving pharmacological therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), standard, validated patient-reported outcomes were measured.

Men over 45 years with OAB, receiving pharmacotherapy for BPH, were randomly assigned 1:1 to vibegron 75 mg or placebo for 24 weeks. Participants completed bladder diaries assessing changes in micturition frequency, nocturia, and urge urinary incontinence (UUI); International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS); and OAB questionnaire (OAB-q). Post hoc analyses assessed the percentage of responders (e.g. ≤ 8 daily micturitions, ≤ 1 nightly nocturia episodes, ≤ 1 daily UUI episodes, ≥ 3-point decrease in IPSS scores, > 10-point improvement in OAB-q subscale scores). Responder endpoints were analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel common risk difference estimation.

Of 1105 participants, 1080 were included in the analysis (vibegron, n = 538; placebo, n = 542). At week 12, greater percentages of participants receiving vibegron vs. placebo achieved responder endpoints for micturitions (33.3% vs. 20.5%, respectively; P < 0.0001), nocturia episodes (34.6% vs. 26.8%; P = 0.0036), and UUI episodes (65.8% vs. 53.0%; P = 0.0267). A greater percentage of participants receiving vibegron vs. placebo also achieved a ≥ 3-point decrease in IPSS storage, voiding, and total scores and a 10-point increase in OAB-q subscale scores by week 12. Results were generally sustained through week 24.

### Myrbetriq [^111hv3XH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Myrbetriq monotherapy for adult OAB was evaluated in three 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trials. These studies included patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency (Studies 1, 2, and 3). Entry criteria required patients to have symptoms of overactive bladder for at least 3 months, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 3 episodes of urgency with or without incontinence over a 3-day period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (94%) and female (72%), with a mean age of 59 years (range 18–95 years). The population included both naïve patients who had not received prior muscarinic antagonist pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder (48%) and those who had received such pharmacotherapy (52%).

In Study 1 (NCT00689104), patients were randomized to receive placebo, Myrbetriq 50 mg, Myrbetriq 100 mg, or an active control once daily. In Study 2 (NCT00662909), patients were randomized to receive placebo, Myrbetriq 50 mg, or Myrbetriq 100 mg once daily. In Study 3 (NCT00912964), patients were randomized to receive placebo, Myrbetriq 25 mg, or Myrbetriq 50 mg once daily.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116rkbhj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

We evaluated the results by examining the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies, exploring relationships in the data, and describing patterns across studies in the direction and magnitude of effects. Poor-quality studies were not synthesized with the rest of the evidence. The applicability of the evidence was described using the PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing, setting) framework.

When outcomes were not reported as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio but provided sufficient data, we calculated these ratios. Meta-analysis was conducted when a sufficient number of studies investigated the same drug dose and were homogeneous enough to justify combining their results. We evaluated outcomes in terms of change from baseline rather than a comparison of endpoint scores as was done in the prior review. We imputed variance data where necessary.

Random effects models were used to estimate pooled effects using pairwise meta-analyses. The I² statistic (the proportion of variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity) was calculated to assess heterogeneity across studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined with subgroup analysis by factors such as study design, study quality, variations in interventions, and patient population characteristics. Meta-analyses were conducted using STATA 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Where eight or more studies of a given intervention comparison and outcome were available, publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.

### Use of third line therapy for overactive bladder in a practice with multiple subspecialty providers-are we doing enough [^115oukiN]? The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder impacts more than 15% of the adult population. Compliance with medical treatment is low due to inadequate symptom control or intolerable side effects. Although third line therapies have improved the treatment of overactive bladder, many patients do not receive optimal treatment. We hypothesized that third line treatment use is higher among female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery urologists, and we examined its use at our tertiary referral center.

- **Materials and methods**: The electronic medical record was queried for patients with overactive bladder seen in 1 year. The number of visits associated with an overactive bladder prescription and the number of patients who received third line therapy were determined and subcategorized by department. Female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers were considered separately.

- **Results**: A total of 5,445 patients (8,994 visits) were seen for overactive bladder. Of all patients seen for overactive bladder, 3.5% received third line therapy compared with 10.0% and 14.1% of those seen by urology providers and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The use of third line therapy was reported to be less than 5%. This rate is higher at our institution, which is likely due to multiple female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers. We also apply an algorithm that facilitates patient education on available options should first and second line treatments fail. Given the limited compliance with medical treatment for overactive bladder, we…

### Definition and epidemiology of overactive bladder [^115sH5HW]. Urology (2002). High credibility.

Overactive bladder is a condition that can be associated with a sudden urge to urinate that's difficult to control. This condition can also lead to urinary incontinence and may be related to various factors, including bladder stones, constipation, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and excessive consumption of caffeine or alcohol. Additionally, it can be associated with urinary frequency, certain medications, nocturia (nighttime urination), and a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying.

Several medical conditions can contribute to overactive bladder symptoms, such as stroke, menopause, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, or involuntary bladder contractions. An enlarged prostate in men and declining cognitive function due to aging are also potential factors. Moreover, the presence of cancer may exacerbate these symptoms.

### Gemtesa [^111E4g5K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety of Gemtesa was evaluated in a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (Study 3005) in male patients with overactive bladder (OAB) on pharmacological therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A total of 553 patients received Gemtesa [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Adverse reactions that were reported in Study 3005 at an incidence greater than placebo and in ≥ 2% of patients treated with Gemtesa are listed in Table 2.

Gemtesa was also evaluated for long-term safety in a 28-week extension study (Study 3006) involving 276 patients who completed the 24-week study (Study 3005). Of the 276 patients who received Gemtesa 75 mg once daily in the extension study, 124 patients were treated for a total of one year. There were no additional adverse reactions reported in Study 3006 that are not already included in Section 6.1 above.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of vibegron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse events have been reported in association with vibegron use in worldwide postmarketing experience:
	- **Urologic disorders**: urinary retention
	- **Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders**: angioedema of the face and larynx; hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, pruritus, rash, and drug eruption; eczema
	- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: constipation

### Optimizing nonsurgical treatments of overactive bladder in the United States [^115bnetJ]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome is a prevalent condition impacting quality of life, activities of daily living, work productivity, physical and psychological health, sleep, and sexuality. Published guideline recommendations and effective behavioral, pharmacologic, and neuromodulatory therapies exist; however, adherence can be poor. Clinicians have important roles educating patients, setting treatment expectations, and providing follow-up. Determining patient goals, routinely assessing and adjusting therapy, and combining treatment strategies may improve outcomes. We review the benefits and challenges of overactive bladder treatments and propose approaches to improve patient management, with the goals of initiating therapy earlier and achieving better patient satisfaction, functioning, and quality of life.

### Study design of a phase 4, real-world study (COMPOSUR) to evaluate vibegron in patients with overactive bladder [^112pRSVo]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**

- **Study design**: COMPOSUR is a 12-month, prospective, observational, real-world study (NCT05067478), with an optional 12-month extension to 24 months, in patients with OAB at 60 study sites in the US. Study sites primarily consist of urology and urogynecology departments, with some family medicine practices across academic centers and community practices. Study visits occur at week 2 and again at intervals of 4 to 6 weeks, 12 to 20 weeks, and/or 24 to 36 weeks from baseline, depending on the treating provider's usual practice for routine follow-up of patients with OAB, either in person or via telehealth, as well as at the end of the study or at month 12. Treatments are prescribed and administered at the discretion of the treating provider in line with an observational, pragmatic approach and/or routine clinical practice. Patients are prescribed vibegron by the provider in accordance with US labeling for vibegron and receive their prescriptions at a pharmacy.

- **Schedule of visits**: There will be a baseline, follow-up, and final visits for enrolled patients. The study may include virtual 2-week visits conducted by site staff. Should the study sponsor extend the study by an additional year, the total per-patient follow-up will extend to 24 months. Additional in-person visits for OAB will occur for patients to receive their prescription refills 2 to 4 times in year 2 and to check for adverse events (AEs) around weeks 78 and 104. Virtual follow-ups by site staff will be conducted to record any new safety events. This study is being conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.

### Mixed urinary incontinence: Are there effective treatments [^1137xs93]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Low credibility.

While novel beta‐3‐adrenoreceptor agonists continue being developed, the most recently developed compound, vibegron, was approved by the FDA in 2020. This development program, consisting of two Phase 3 trials preceding approval, found that vibegron reduced micturition frequency, urgency episodes, and urgency incontinence with statistical significance compared to placebo, and had a favorable safety profile with a smaller percentage of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events compared to the tolterodine or imidafenacin control groups. Solabegron is another beta‐3‐adrenoreceptor agonist currently in development; a clinical proof‐of‐concept trial revealed preliminary evidence of efficacy for solabegron over placebo and promising tolerability, but the data from the Phase 2 trials completed in 2019 (NCT03594058 and NCT03475706) have not been published yet. Although these novel beta‐3‐adrenoreceptor agonists also target overactive bladder and UUI, the solabegron trials did not actively list SUI or MUI as exclusion criteria on their registrations.

Various other pharmacologic treatments targeting other mechanisms of action are in development for overactive bladder and UUI, but these have, for the most part, not proceeded to clinical stages of development yet. Some that have reached clinical phases of development include phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as tadalafil, and purinergic P2X3 receptor agonists, such as eliapixant. Tadalafil, which prevents the degradation of mediators including cGMP and cAMP that help maintain smooth muscle tone, showed preliminary evidence of.

Regarding specific circumstances for overactive bladder, especially with respect to patients with BPH, the AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend offering monotherapy with antimuscarinic agents or β-3 agonists. Alternatively, combination therapy with an α-blocker and an antimuscarinic agent or β-3 agonist can be offered to patients with BPH and overactive bladder.

### Flavoxate in urogynecology: An old drug revisited [^1127LJ4m]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Since its emergence in 1967, flavoxate has been used to treat several urogenital tract disorders irrespective of the etiology of the underlying disease, but the main indications have been overactive bladder and urge symptomatology. With the advances in anticholinergic drugs, its popularity has decreased in recent decades.

- **Methods**: In this review, we summarize the status of flavoxate in urogynecological practice, focusing on its historical background, mechanism of action, efficacy, clinical experiences, outcomes, side effects, and tolerability. We reviewed and analyzed all the data and drew major conclusions. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library using the keyword "flavoxate" and summarized review articles, original studies, and case reports published from 1970 to 2013.

- **Results and conclusion**: We conclude that the minimal side effects and high tolerability of flavoxate make it worthy of consideration for the treatment of several clinical urogynecological conditions. It deserves more clinical studies to assess its efficacy as no randomized controlled trials have been performed with flavoxate during the last decade. More studies and novel drug formulations may reveal or improve its efficacy in daily practice.

### Gemtesa [^115LyvQ8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Gemtesa was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled trial (Study 3003, NCT03492281) in patients with overactive bladder (OAB), characterized by urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Patients were randomized in a 5:5:4 ratio to receive Gemtesa 75 mg, a placebo, or active control orally, once daily for 12 weeks. To qualify for the study, patients needed to have shown symptoms of OAB for at least three months, with an average of eight or more micturitions per day and at least one urge urinary incontinence (UUI) episode per day, or an average of eight or more micturitions per day and an average of at least three urgency episodes per day. Urge urinary incontinence was defined as any amount of urine leakage following an immediate urge or need to urinate.

The study population included both OAB medication-naïve patients and those who had previously received OAB medication therapy. The co-primary endpoints were the change from baseline in the average daily number of micturitions and the average daily number of UUI episodes at week 12. Additional endpoints included the change from baseline in the average daily number of "need to urinate immediately" (urgency) episodes and the average volume voided per micturition.

A total of 1,515 patients received at least one daily dose of either placebo (n = 540), Gemtesa 75 mg (n = 545), or an active control treatment (n = 430). The majority of patients were White (78%) and female (85%), with a mean age of 60 years, ranging from 18 to 93 years.

### Medical therapy for the overactive bladder in the elderly [^112Jnwdc]. Age and Ageing (2002). Low credibility.

The overactive bladder is the most common underlying bladder disorder causing urinary incontinence in elderly people. Management of the condition relies on a holistic assessment of the problem, lifestyle adjustment, behavioral management, and drug therapy. The majority of currently available drugs depend on their anti-muscarinic properties for efficacy. Both behavioral techniques and drug therapy are effective in the treatment of the elderly, and each modality has a particular role to play in the successful treatment and maintenance of this condition.

### New perspectives on the overactive bladder: Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability [^117XamXS]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

In the United States alone, approximately 17 million men and women have symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB). For many years, oxybutynin was the drug of choice for treating OAB. Although it provided effective treatment, multiple daily doses were required, and adverse events, such as dry mouth and constipation, were decided drawbacks.

Controlled drug delivery systems seen in commercially available OAB formulations alter the pharmacokinetics of antimuscarinic medications in ways that maintain efficacy and allow once-daily dosing and reduction of adverse events. In the future, OAB medications will not only incorporate new chemical entities, such as the S-enantiomer of oxybutynin, but will also use novel drug delivery technologies, including transdermal patches and bladder implants.

### International phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vibegron in patients with symptoms of overactive bladder: EMPOWUR [^1178HUwB]. The Journal of Urology (2020). High credibility.

We assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vibegron, a novel, potent, highly selective β3-adrenoceptor agonist, administered for 12 weeks at 75 mg once daily to patients with overactive bladder in an international phase III trial with placebo and active control.

- **Materials and methods**: Adult patients with overactive bladder, characterized by 8.0 or more micturitions per day, were randomized in a 5:5:4 ratio to receive 75 mg vibegron, placebo, or extended-release 4 mg tolterodine. Up to 25% of patients could have dry overactive bladder (less than 1.0 urge incontinence episode per day). Patients completed 7-day voiding diaries at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.

- **Results**: Of the 1,518 randomized patients, 90.4% completed the trial. At 12 weeks, micturitions decreased by an adjusted mean of 1.8 episodes per day for vibegron compared to 1.3 for placebo (p < 0.001, co-primary endpoint) and 1.6 for tolterodine. Among incontinent patients, urge incontinence episodes decreased by an adjusted mean of 2.0 episodes per day for vibegron compared to 1.4 for placebo (p < 0.0001, co-primary endpoint) and 1.8 for tolterodine. Moreover, vibegron was statistically significantly superior to placebo for key secondary measures, such as the number of urgency episodes, volume per micturition, and the proportion of incontinent patients with a 75% or greater reduction in urge incontinence episodes (all p < 0.01). Among vibegron-treated patients, 1.7% discontinued treatment due to adverse events, compared to 1.1% for placebo and 3.3% for tolterodine. The incidence of hypertension was 1.7% for both vibegron and placebo.

- **Conclusions**: Once-daily 75 mg vibegron demonstrated efficacy in reducing symptoms of overactive bladder and was associated with a tolerable safety profile.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA/SUFU guideline amendment 2019 [^115od3cd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of non-neurogenic overactive bladder (OAB).

- **Materials & methods**: The primary source of evidence for the original version of this guideline was the systematic review and data extraction conducted as part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence Report/Technology Assessment Number 187 titled "Treatment of Overactive Bladder in Women" (2009). That report was supplemented with additional searches capturing literature published through December 2011. Following initial publication, this guideline underwent amendment in 2014 and 2018. The document reflects relevant literature published through October 2018.

- **Results**: When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such statements are provided as standards, recommendations, or options. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance information is provided as clinical principles and expert opinions.

- **Conclusions**: The evidence-based statements are provided for diagnosis and overall management of OAB, as well as for the various treatments. Diagnosis and treatment methodologies can be expected to change as the evidence base grows and as new treatment strategies become obtainable.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the overactive bladder [^116NR2YX]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a symptomatic diagnosis based on the presence of urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, in the absence of obvious pathologic or metabolic disease. Initial management of OAB requires an integrated approach using behavioral and pharmacologic methods. Patients should be educated about the functioning of the lower urinary tract system, fluid and dietary management, timed or prophylactic voiding and bladder training regimens, the keeping of micturition charts or bladder diaries, and pelvic floor exercises.

Although the effectiveness of muscarinic receptor antagonists for the treatment of OAB has been shown, adverse effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision, have somewhat limited their usefulness. Newer agents that are more bladder-selective have been and continue to be developed. The concept of clinical effectiveness — a combination of efficacy, tolerability, and compliance — can be used to evaluate not only how well a drug works but also the side-effect profile and bothersomeness and how likely patients are to continue treatment. Patients who do not respond to antimuscarinic treatment of OAB may do so because of a variety of non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic reasons. Most cases of OAB are not cured, but rather the symptoms are reduced, with an associated improvement in the patients' quality of life. Patients who have failed behavioral and pharmacologic interventions may respond to neuromodulation and augmentation cystoplasty. Future approaches may include other types of interventions.

### Once-daily vibegron 75 mg for overactive bladder: Long-term safety and efficacy from a double-blind extension study of the international phase 3 trial (EMPOWUR) [^1118uwj4]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of vibegron in adults with overactive bladder during the 40-week phase 3 EMPOWUR extension study.

Patients who completed 12 weeks of once-daily vibegron 75 mg or tolterodine 4 mg extended release in EMPOWUR continued double-blind treatment. Patients who completed 12 weeks of placebo were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive double-blind vibegron or tolterodine. The primary outcome was safety, measured by incidence of adverse events. Secondary outcomes included change from baseline at week 52 in the average daily number of micturitions and urgency episodes (all patients), and urge and total urinary incontinence episodes (patients with overactive bladder wet), based on 7-day diary data.

Of 506 patients randomized, 505 received ≥ 1 dose of medication, and 430 (85%) completed the study. A total of 12 patients (2.4%) discontinued owing to adverse events. The most common adverse events with vibegron/tolterodine (> 5% in either group) were hypertension (8.8%/8.6%), urinary tract infection (6.6%/7.3%), headache (5.5%/3.9%), nasopharyngitis (4.8%/5.2%), and dry mouth (1.8%/5.2%).

Improvements in efficacy endpoints were maintained for patients receiving vibegron for 52 weeks. The least-squares mean change from baseline to week 52 in micturitions was ‒2.4 for vibegron vs. ‒2.0 for tolterodine; in urge urinary incontinence episodes ‒2.2 vs. ‒1.7 (p < 0.05); in urgency episodes ‒3.4 vs. ‒3.2; and in total incontinence episodes ‒2.5 vs. ‒1.9 (p < 0.05). Among patients with overactive bladder wet, 61.0% receiving vibegron experienced notable improvements.

### Gemtesa [^117K7pkZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The following clinically significant adverse reaction is described elsewhere in the labeling: urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

- **Overactive bladder in adults**: The safety of Gemtesa was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study (Study 3003) in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. A total of 545 patients received Gemtesa. The majority of the patients were White (78%) and female (85%), with a mean age of 60 years (range 18 to 93 years).

Adverse reactions that were reported in Study 3003 at an incidence greater than placebo and in ≥ 2% of patients treated with Gemtesa are listed in Table 1.

Other adverse reactions reported in < 2% of patients treated with Gemtesa included:

- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Dry mouth and constipation
- **Investigations**: Residual urine volume increased
- **Renal and urinary disorders**: Urinary retention
- **Vascular disorders**: Hot flush

Gemtesa was also evaluated for long-term safety in an extension study (Study 3004) in 505 patients who completed the 12-week study (Study 3003). Of the 273 patients who received Gemtesa 75 mg once daily in the extension study, 181 patients were treated for a total of one year.

### New technology assessment and current and upcoming therapies for underactive bladder [^114Jg9ob]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Stakeholders from around the world came together to address the unmet needs of underactive bladder (UAB) at the 3rd International Congress for Underactive Bladder. The main recommendation from the regulatory working group is a need for a meeting of UAB stakeholders and regulatory agencies, including the FDA, to discuss guidance for regulatory trial design for devices, drugs, and/or biologics for UAB.

- **Methods**: The following issues to be discussed and agreed upon for UAB trials are: 1) appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria 2) should residual urine volume be the primary outcome parameter, and how often should it be measured? 3) are there secondary measures that should have a place in UAB trials, such as change in the number of catheterizations, quality of life measures, and others? 4) use and format of bladder voiding and catheterization diary for trials 5) define role and technique of urodynamics in UAB trials. Are urodynamics required to monitor, and possibly exclude, individuals with high pressure voiding induced by bladder prokinetic therapies? 6) development and use of UAB questionnaires.

- **Discussion and conclusion**: The UAB regulatory working group recognizes that the path forward should include engaging the FDA and other regulatory organizations that may harmonize and formalize guidance for regulatory trial designs for therapeutics for UAB.

### Overactive bladder: an update [^111K24Uk]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder is an important lower urinary tract syndrome that negatively affects the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. Both sexes and all age groups may be affected; therefore, many specialists, including urologists, gynecologists, geriatricians, pediatricians, physiotherapists, and continence advisors, are involved in managing patients with overactive bladder.

- **Recent findings**: There is ongoing research, both in basic science and clinical trials, to establish the cause of overactive bladder and to determine the best method of managing patients who suffer from this syndrome. New theories and modified definitions of overactive bladder have been proposed. Structured evidence-based management guidelines have been established, more prevalence studies have been conducted, and new treatment strategies have emerged.

- **Summary**: Overactive bladder is now recognized as a chronic, debilitating condition that costs millions of dollars. With an aging population, these costs will increase, and it is necessary that health systems around the world recognize this. Further research into the basic science of the condition is required to identify the true cause of overactive bladder, allowing new targeted treatments to be established.

### Gemtesa [^115B66J6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:

	- **Urinary retention**: Monitor for urinary retention, especially in patients with bladder outlet obstruction and those taking muscarinic antagonist medications for overactive bladder (OAB). The risk of urinary retention may be greater in these patients. If urinary retention develops, discontinue Gemtesa [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- **Angioedema**: Angioedema of the face and/or larynx has been reported with Gemtesa. It can occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema, associated with upper airway swelling, may be life-threatening. If the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx is affected, immediately discontinue Gemtesa and provide appropriate therapy to ensure a patent airway. Gemtesa is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to vibegron or any component of Gemtesa [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Overactive bladder: A better understanding of pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^115ECyJw]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed information regarding the updated definitions, prevalence, etiologies, disease burden, and management of overactive bladder (OAB) from multiple perspectives, including professional impact and patient quality of life.

Published literature and treatment concepts were reviewed to improve the understanding and management of OAB. OAB is a symptom syndrome including urinary urgency with or without urinary incontinence, typically accompanied by frequency and nocturia. Approximately 17% of the adult population experiences OAB. Evolving theories address its pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of the most commonly prescribed pharmacological therapy, which is antimuscarinic agents. Treatment primarily focuses on improving the quality of life.

Behavioral therapy combined with pharmacological interventions often yields acceptable outcomes for patients with OAB. Modalities such as botulinum toxin injections, neuromodulation, and various surgical interventions show promising results in more refractory patients.

### Anticholinergic drugs versus other medications for overactive bladder syndrome in adults [^112WhT34]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome is defined as "urgency with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia". It is a common condition with significant economic and quality of life implications. While the condition's pathophysiology remains to be fully elucidated, pharmacotherapy is the main treatment option. Despite uncertainty regarding the drug treatment of choice, anticholinergics are increasingly being used in primary and secondary care settings. This review compares anticholinergic drugs with other types or classes of drugs for treating overactive bladder syndromes.

- **Objectives**: To compare anticholinergic drugs with other types or classes of drugs for treating overactive bladder symptoms.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 20 December 2006) and the reference lists of relevant articles. No language or other limits were imposed.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing anticholinergic drugs with other drugs for the treatment of overactive bladder symptoms were included. At least one arm of the study used an anticholinergic drug and at least one other arm used a non-anticholinergic drug.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers assessed the identified studies for eligibility and methodological quality and independently extracted data from the included studies. Data analysis was performed using RevMan software (version 4.2.8).

- **Main results**: Thirteen trials were included in the review. There were eight crossover trials and five parallel group studies.

### Satisfaction and persistence with vibegron in the first 6 months of overactive bladder treatment: Interim results of the phase 4, real-world COMPOSUR study [^113Qe3gr]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Vibegron (GEMTESA) is a selective β3-adrenergic receptor agonist approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat OAB with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and UUI. In the phase 3, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled EMPOWUR trial, treatment with once-daily vibegron 75 mg was associated with significant reductions vs. placebo in daily micturitions, urgency episodes, and UUI episodes over 12 weeks of treatment and was safe and well tolerated in patients with OAB. In the phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled COURAGE trial, once-daily vibegron 75 mg was associated with significant reductions vs. placebo in daily micturitions, urgency episodes, nocturia episodes, and UUI episodes over 24 weeks of treatment and was safe and well tolerated among men with OAB symptoms receiving pharmacologic treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

There is limited information on real-world satisfaction with vibegron in patients with OAB who have had prior OAB treatment. Thus, the COMPOSUR study was designed to evaluate vibegron in real-world clinical practice by assessing patient treatment satisfaction, persistence, and safety. We report an interim analysis conducted when collection of 6-month questionnaires was complete and 144 patients had completed the study.

### Do we need more patient-friendly treatment options for overactive bladder (OAB) [^115F1xEd]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

The treatment options currently available for overactive bladder (OAB) are often limited in terms of patient-friendliness and convenience. Patients frequently report challenges related to adherence, side effects, and the need for more accessible solutions.

Recent studies emphasize the importance of developing more user-friendly treatment modalities to enhance patient compliance and overall quality of life. Innovative approaches are necessary to address these unmet needs effectively. Although ongoing research shows promise, more robust clinical trials are essential to validate these new treatment avenues and ensure they align with patient expectations and lifestyle demands.

Additionally, collaborative efforts between medical researchers and the pharmaceutical industry can help accelerate the development of such treatments. Encouraging the creation of guidelines and frameworks within the medical community can further support the adoption of patient-friendly solutions.

### Advancements in pharmacologic management of the overactive bladder [^11595fcF]. Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Continued developments in the understanding of lower urinary tract function have led to improvements in the pharmacologic manipulation of bladder dysfunction. Drug delivery changes have produced drugs that provide better efficacy and tolerability, thus improving patient compliance. Improvements in drug delivery systems have altered drug bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. Active investigations in new agents and delivery systems for intravesical delivery have yielded intriguing early results that may substantially add to the armamentarium for the management of the overactive bladder (urgency, frequency, urge incontinence). New developments in the understanding of the neuropharmacology of the bladder, peripheral pelvic nerves, and sacral cord may provide agents with entirely new drug effects, either as primary agents or agents to be used in combination with currently available drugs. We herein review newer agents and drug delivery systems.

### Do we need more patient-friendly treatment options for overactive bladder (OAB) [^116Mfspg]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

Aims: To collect feedback from subjects diagnosed with overactive bladder (OAB) on its impact on their quality of life, their satisfaction with treatment options, and to assess nonsurgical tibial nerve stimulation as a treatment option.

Methods: Subjects were asked a variety of questions about the impact of OAB on their lives and their satisfaction with previous treatment approaches. Subjects evaluated the comfort of a nonworking prototype garment and were given electrical stimulation over their posterior tibial nerve to assess comfort and tolerability. Electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded.

Results: A total of 40 subjects with OAB symptoms were evaluated in the study. Urgency (55%), frequency (47.5%), nocturia (40%), and incontinence (30%) were the most bothersome symptoms. At the time of the study, only 32.5% of the subjects were treating their OAB symptoms. Of those who had tried and discontinued treatments, most had failed medications (n = 14) due to no improvements or side effects. Only 2 subjects found stimulation to be uncomfortable before an EMG signal could be detected. The most common words used to describe the feeling of stimulation were "constant", followed by "tingling", "vibrating", and "comfortable".

Conclusions: Most subjects who had tried OAB treatments were dissatisfied and discontinued their use. A new patient-friendly approach to OAB therapy that delivers efficacy but overcomes drawbacks associated with currently available treatments is needed. Subjects found electrical stimulation over the tibial nerve to be comfortable and tolerable.

### Patient and physician decision-making dynamics in overactive bladder care: A mixed methods study [^114RGNvn]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Overactive bladder management includes multiple therapeutic options with comparable efficacy but a range of administration modalities and side effects, creating an ideal setting for shared decision-making. This study investigates patient and physician health beliefs surrounding decision-making and expectations for overactive bladder, with the aim of better understanding and ultimately improving decision-making in overactive bladder care.

- **Methods**: Patient and physician participants completed a questionnaire followed by a semi-structured interview to assess health beliefs surrounding decision-making and expectations for overactive bladder treatment. The semi-structured interview guide, developed in an iterative fashion by the authors, probed qualities of overactive bladder therapies patients and physicians valued, their process of treatment selection, and their experiences with therapies.

- **Results**: Patients (n = 20) frequently cited treatment invasiveness, efficacy, and safety as the most important qualities that influenced their decision when selecting overactive bladder therapy. Physicians (n = 12) frequently cited safety/contraindications, convenience, cost/insurance, and patient preference as the most important qualities. In our integration analysis, we identified four key themes associated with decision-making in overactive bladder care: frustration with inaccessibility of overactive bladder treatments, discordant perception of patient education, diverging acceptability of expected outcomes, and lack of insight into other parties' decisional priorities and control.

### Pathophysiology: The varieties of bladder overactivity [^11464JhN]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common term currently used in clinical medicine to describe a complex of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with or without incontinence. The symptoms usually include urgency, frequency, nocturia, troublesome or incomplete emptying, and, occasionally, pain. Causes of bladder overactivity include neurologic illness or injury, bladder outlet obstruction, urethral weakness, detrusor hyperactivity and impaired contractility in elderly patients, emergence of new voiding reflexes, and so-called idiopathic bladder overactivity.

Most clinicians agree that effective treatment for OAB symptoms should be guided by a basic assessment of patients for these contributing factors. However, it is not at all certain that outcomes are significantly improved by diagnostic precision. This is in part because of the ubiquity of LUTS in the setting of the various common lower urinary tract disorders: stress incontinence, outlet obstruction, and neurologic illness or injury. The ubiquity of LUTS would imply that they are caused by common mechanisms and, theoretically at least, would be amenable to a single form of effective therapy. Conversely, the limited kinds and number of LUTS and the limited representation of lower urinary tract structures in the central nervous system may mean that several different causes produce similar symptoms, but these are not amenable to a single form of effective therapy.

Future research directions should keep each possible explanation in mind as new knowledge about lower urinary tract function and possible intervention continues.

### Pathophysiology of overactive bladder [^1124hN65]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a complex of symptoms frequently encountered in the primary care setting. Impediments to optimal management of OAB include inaccurate perceptions on the part of patients and primary care providers, such as the belief that the symptoms of OAB represent a natural progression of aging and are beyond the scope of treatment or that diagnosis and treatment are specialist concerns.

Complicating the physician's task is the reluctance of many patients to initiate discussion of their OAB symptoms and the fact that patients often develop disruptive coping strategies rather than seek medical treatment. This is possibly due to the belief that OAB is a normal part of aging rather than an actual medical condition. In most cases, OAB may be managed quite well by the primary care physician who has an understanding of the pathophysiology of OAB.

This article reviews normal bladder function and then explores pathophysiologic changes that likely cause the symptoms of OAB.

### Characteristics of providers who prescribed only anticholinergic medications for overactive bladder in 2020 [^116sgcXs]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacologic therapy for overactive bladder typically includes either an anticholinergic or a beta-3 agonist. Based on research that has demonstrated increased risks of cognitive impairment and dementia associated with anticholinergic use, guidelines support the use of beta-3 agonists rather than anticholinergics in older patients.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to describe the characteristics of providers prescribing only anticholinergics to treat overactive bladder in patients aged ≥ 65 years.

- **Study design**: The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services publishes data on medications dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries. Data include the National Provider Identifier of the prescriber and the number of pills prescribed and dispensed for any given medication for beneficiaries aged ≥ 65 years. We obtained each provider's National Provider Identifier, gender, degree, and primary specialty. National Provider Identifiers were linked to an additional Medicare database that includes graduation year. We included providers who prescribed pharmacologic therapy for overactive bladder in 2020 for patients aged ≥ 65 years. We calculated the percentage of providers who prescribed only anticholinergics (and did not prescribe beta-3 agonists) for overactive bladder and stratified by provider characteristics. Data are reported as adjusted risk ratios.

- **Results**: In 2020, 131,605 providers prescribed overactive bladder medications. Of those identified, 110,874 (84.2%) had complete demographic information available. Although only 7% of providers who prescribed medications for…

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^114JLb6r]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

A Cochrane Review published in 2012 compared anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder (OAB). However, it did not include the β3-adrenoceptor stimulator, mirabegron. With the FDA approval of mirabegron and a combination product with solifenacin for OAB, we sought to update this evidence. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses comparing the effectiveness of drugs approved by the FDA to treat OAB symptoms.

### Developments in the pharmacotherapy of the overactive bladder [^112HxCeb]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The overactive bladder is a common and distressing condition that significantly impacts the quality of life for many people worldwide. Anticholinergics remain the first line in pharmacotherapy; however, the use of these agents is hindered by adverse effects and limited efficacy. Thus, there is a need for more effective treatments. Recently, there has been a move towards targeting novel pathways thought to play a role in overactivity. This review aims to provide insight into recent developments in the pharmacotherapy of the overactive bladder.

With recent advances in our understanding of the basic science of the overactive bladder, it is becoming clear that the control of bladder functioning is far more complex than previously believed. Peripherally, a prominent role has emerged for the urothelium and the underlying suburothelium in mechanosensory control, and the role of afferent pathways in pathophysiology is increasingly recognized.

Recent research has highlighted several potential targets for the treatment of the overactive bladder, particularly within the mechanosensory pathways. With the exception of botulinum toxin, however, few new therapies have emerged showing clinical benefits. A clearer understanding of the pathophysiology of the bladder will hopefully lead to more effective and better-tolerated treatments.

### Anticholinergic drugs versus other medications for overactive bladder syndrome in adults [^112sMrXb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). High credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome is defined as "urgency with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia". It is a common condition with significant economic and quality of life implications. While the condition's pathophysiology remains to be fully elucidated, pharmacotherapy is the main treatment option. Despite uncertainty as to the drug treatment of choice, anticholinergics are increasingly being used in primary and secondary care settings. This review compares anticholinergic drugs with other types or classes of drugs for treating overactive bladder syndromes.

- **Objectives**: To compare anticholinergic drugs with other types or classes of drugs for treating overactive bladder symptoms.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 20 December 2006) and the reference lists of relevant articles. No language or other limits were imposed.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing anticholinergic drugs with other drugs for the treatment of overactive bladder symptoms. At least one arm of the study used an anticholinergic drug and at least one other arm used a non-anticholinergic drug.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers assessed the identified studies for eligibility and methodological quality and independently extracted data from the included studies. Data analysis was performed using RevMan software (version 4.2.8).

- **Main results**: Twelve trials were included in the review. There were seven crossover trials and five parallel group studies.

### Oxybutynin-associated cognitive impairment: Evidence and implications for overactive bladder treatment [^1155Fow9]. Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Anticholinergic medications have long been a mainstay of overactive bladder (OAB) treatment. Oxybutynin, a first-generation anticholinergic, still accounts for more than half of all OAB medication prescriptions, despite associations with impaired memory and cognition, as well as mounting evidence that it may increase the risk of incident dementia. This review details the literature regarding oxybutynin and cognition, including evidence from preclinical, clinical, and real-world studies showing that oxybutynin binds nonspecifically to muscarinic receptors in the brain and is associated with adverse cognitive outcomes. We also discuss society recommendations to reduce the use of oxybutynin and other anticholinergics to treat OAB.

### Study design of a phase 4, real-world study (COMPOSUR) to evaluate vibegron in patients with overactive bladder [^117SLMER]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Vibegron, a selective β3-adrenergic receptor agonist, demonstrated efficacy in reducing symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) in the 12-week international, phase 3, placebo- and active-controlled EMPOWUR trial and its 40-week, double-blind extension trial. In December 2020, vibegron was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of OAB in adults at a once-daily dose of 75 mg.

Currently, there are limited data showing how OAB drugs work in a real-world clinical setting; thus, we wanted to understand how a recently approved drug, vibegron, works in medical practice. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the way medicine is practiced; however, utilization of telemedicine within urology practice due to the COVID-19 pandemic has shown patient satisfaction with urologic telemedical experiences. This study uses telehealth visits to minimize in-person contact and allow for more visit flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this study is to assess vibegron in real-world clinical practice in the US regarding patient treatment satisfaction, quality of life (QoL), adherence, persistence, and safety.

### Satisfaction and persistence with vibegron in the first 6 months of overactive bladder treatment: Interim results of the phase 4, real-world COMPOSUR study [^112wKrWN]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

The COMPOSUR study is evaluating vibegron for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) in a real-world setting. We report results of a prespecified 6-month interim analysis, assessing patient-reported treatment satisfaction, persistence, safety, and tolerability over the first 6 months after receiving a new prescription for vibegron.

- **Methods**: COMPOSUR (NCT05067478) is a 12-month, phase 4 study of vibegron. Patients were enrolled if they were ≥ 18 years of age with OAB, initiating vibegron after previously receiving anticholinergics (Cohort A) or mirabegron with/without anticholinergics (Cohort B). Satisfaction was assessed via the OAB Satisfaction With Treatment Questionnaire (OAB-SAT-q; domain scores on a 0−100 scale, with higher scores denoting greater satisfaction). The primary endpoint is the OAB-SAT-q satisfaction domain score. The key secondary endpoints are the percentage of positive responses to OAB-SAT-q questions 1–3 and 11. Additional secondary endpoints include OAB-SAT-q scores for side effects, endorsement, preference, and convenience. Persistence was assessed as an exploratory endpoint. Safety was assessed via adverse events (AEs).

- **Results**: A total of 403 patients were enrolled and initiated treatment with vibegron; 104 patients discontinued the study before month 6, most commonly owing to withdrawal of consent (n = 32) and AEs (n = 8). Mean (SD) patient age was 56.1 (12.5) years, and 29% were male. Overall, at 6 months, mean (SD) OAB-SAT-q domain scores were 70.0 (21.9) for satisfaction, 84.7 (20.6) for convenience, and 91.1 (16.4) for side effects.

### Gemtesa [^116Yn56t]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Gemtesa were evaluated in a multinational 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 3005, NCT03902080) in male patients at least 45 years of age with overactive bladder (OAB) on pharmacological therapy (i.e. treatment with an alpha blocker, with or without a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor) for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A total of 1,105 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either Gemtesa 75 mg or placebo once daily for 24 weeks.

For study entry, patients had symptoms of OAB (an average of 8 or more micturitions per day, 3 or more urgency episodes per day with or without incontinence, and 2 or more nocturia episodes per night) while taking pharmacological therapy for at least 2 months for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH. Randomization was stratified based on the baseline average number of micturition episodes per day, alpha blocker use with or without 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use, and urinary incontinence.

- **Co-primary endpoints**: Change from baseline in the average daily number of micturitions and the average daily number of "need to urinate immediately" (urgency) episodes at week 12.
- **Additional endpoints**: Change from baseline in the average daily number of urge urinary incontinence (UUI) episodes and the average volume voided per micturition.

A total of 1,104 patients received at least one daily dose of placebo (n = 551) or Gemtesa 75 mg (n = 553). The majority of patients were White (87%) and enrolled in the U.S. (56%). The mean age was 67 years (range 45 to 97).

### Future studies of overactive bladder: The need for standardization [^1116Z2UB]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians and researchers agree that pharmacologic studies of overactive bladder (OAB) require precise planning, strict adherence to study design, and meticulous attention to study conduct and statistical methods. Additionally, conclusions should be formulated straightforwardly and be highly directed, derived expressly from data that have been collected. However, the exact methods to achieve these ends are often debated among statisticians, experts in study design, and physicians interpreting the clinical implications of findings. Consequently, the conclusions of clinical research in OAB are commonly criticized based on study objectives, study design, statistical methods, or conclusions.

A subtler yet possibly more critical problem exists: the method of defining the population and the methods for collecting data for efficacy outcome parameters, including frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence.

### Do we need more patient-friendly treatment options for overactive bladder (OAB) [^111AfeaN]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

Despite there being several efficacious treatments for OAB, treatment persistence remains extremely low due to the side effects, risks, and inconvenience of the available options. There remains a compelling need for a patient-friendly treatment that is effective, economical, and adaptable to a patient's lifestyle. To determine the feasibility of such an approach, this study evaluated the comfort and tolerability of noninvasive neuromodulation on patients with OAB, as well as their interest in such an approach.

### Newer agents for the management of overactive bladder [^116y6hVf]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The anticholinergics tolterodine and oxybutynin are well established in the management of overactive bladder. However, their activity at muscarinic receptors distant from the target site (i.e. bladder) produces anticholinergic side effects, leading to poor tolerability. In 2004, trospium, solifenacin, and darifenacin were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of overactive bladder. Trospium is water-soluble and therefore is less likely to enter the central nervous system, and solifenacin and darifenacin are more selective for the bladder than older agents. Although these attributes could improve tolerability, clinical trials comparing relevant agents to validate this are lacking. Trials have shown that these newer agents decrease the frequency of incontinence episodes, the number of voids per day, and the number and severity of urgency episodes compared with placebo. These agents also have been shown to improve quality of life in women with overactive bladder and urinary incontinence. Head-to-head studies of the newer agents and immediate-release oxybutynin and tolterodine have suggested similar effectiveness across the class, although the newer agents are better tolerated. Trospium and darifenacin have not been compared with extended-release formulations of tolterodine or oxybutynin, which are better tolerated than the immediate-release versions. In one study, solifenacin produced a somewhat greater decrease in the number of incontinence episodes than extended-release tolterodine, with no difference in tolerability.

### Current and future pharmacological treatment for overactive bladder [^116RXSGJ]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary incontinence and overactive bladder are important and common conditions that have received little general medical attention. We reviewed the magnitude and impact of these conditions and discussed pharmacotherapy, as well as new drugs under investigation.

- **Materials and methods**: The main emphasis of this review is pharmacological therapy for the bladder. We discuss currently available agents, drugs under development, and pharmacological targets that would be suitable for treating overactive bladder. Drugs such as duloxetine, which target not the bladder smooth muscle but rather central nervous system control of the micturition reflex, are undergoing clinical trials. We also discuss intravesical therapy and alternative drug delivery methods, such as intravesical capsaicin and botulinum toxin, with special emphasis on approaches to modulate bladder afferent nerve function for preventing overactive bladder.

- **Results**: There are many advantages to advanced drug delivery systems, including long-term therapeutic efficacy, decreased side effects, and improved patient compliance. Future speculations such as gene therapy hold great promise for overactive bladder because it is possible to access all genitourinary organs via endoscopy and other minimally invasive techniques that are ideally suited for gene therapy.

- **Conclusions**: Traditional anticholinergic therapies are limited in their effectiveness. There is great hope for future research regarding voiding dysfunction and urinary incontinence through a focus on afferent nerve intervention for preventing overactive bladder.

### Acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults [^113HxV55]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Overactive bladder is a common, long-term symptom complex that includes frequency of micturition, urgency with or without associated incontinence, and nocturia. Approximately 11% of the population exhibit symptoms, with prevalence increasing with age. These symptoms can be linked to social anxiety and adaptive behavioral changes. The cost of treating overactive bladder is considerable, with treatments varying in effectiveness and often associated with side effects. Acupuncture has been suggested as an alternative treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults and to summarize the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialized Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (including In-Process, Epub Ahead of Print, Daily), ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP (searched 14 May 2022). We also searched the Allied and Complementary Medicine database (AMED) and bibliographic databases requiring knowledge of the Chinese language, such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI); Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP); and WANFANG (China Online Journals), as well as the reference lists of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cross-over RCTs assessing the effects of acupuncture for treating overactive bladder in adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Four review authors formed pairs to assess the data.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: a systematic review [^1158Ej6A]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Four trials (N = 6430 for included drug doses) compared the combination of mirabegron (25 to 50 mg) plus solifenacin 5 mg versus solifenacin 5 mg alone, with three trials lasting 12 weeks and one lasting 52 weeks. Two trials were rated as good quality and two as fair quality.

The combination of mirabegron 50 mg with solifenacin 5 mg showed significant improvement on all efficacy outcomes compared with solifenacin 5 mg. However, patients still experienced more than one incontinence and about three urgency episodes per day. The absolute difference between the combination therapy and monotherapy was less than one episode of incontinence, urgency, and micturitions per day (−0.18, −0.58, and −0.41, respectively).

There was moderate heterogeneity (I² = 59%) in the pooled estimate of reduction of urgency episodes, but all trials consistently favored combination therapy. Among patients with incontinence at baseline, significantly more patients on combination therapy reported no incontinence over 3 days at the end of treatment (45% vs. 36%).

All four trials reported measures of patient-assessed change in symptoms using both the PPBC and the OAB-q Symptom Bother score, and pooled results favored combination therapy on both assessments. On the OAB-q Symptom Bother score, both treatment groups achieved the MCID from baseline.

### Gemtesa [^113Wj2E9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Vibegron is a selective human beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist. Activation of the beta-3 adrenergic receptor increases bladder capacity by relaxing the detrusor smooth muscle during bladder filling.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Vibegron's exposure-response relationship and the time course of pharmacodynamic response are not fully characterized.
	- **Blood pressure**: In a 4-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, ambulatory blood pressure study in overactive bladder (OAB) patients (n = 200), daily treatment with Gemtesa 75 mg was not associated with clinically significant changes in blood pressure. Subjects enrolled in this study had a mean age of 59 years, and 75% were female. Thirty-five percent of subjects had pre-existing hypertension at baseline, and 29% of all subjects were taking at least one concomitant antihypertensive medication.
	- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: Gemtesa does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent at a single dose 5.3 times the approved recommended dose.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Mean vibegron Cmax and AUC increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner up to 600 mg (8 times the approved recommended dosage). Steady-state concentrations are achieved within 7 days of once-daily dosing. The mean accumulation ratio (Rac) was 1.7 for Cmax and 2.4 for AUC0–24hr.

- **Absorption**: Median vibegron Tmax is approximately 1 to 3 hours. Oral administration of a 75 mg vibegron tablet crushed and mixed with 15 mL of applesauce resulted in no clinically relevant changes in vibegron pharmacokinetics when compared to administration of an intact 75 mg vibegron tablet.

### Risk of dementia associated with anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder in adults aged ≥ 55 years: nested case-control study [^115Ms6CJ]. BMJ Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Anticholinergic drugs for the treatment of an overactive bladder differ in their affinity for the different muscarinic receptor subtypes. Darifenacin has the highest selectivity for the M3 receptor over the M1 and M2 subtypes, whereas solifenacin succinate has only moderate selectivity for the M3 receptor over the M1 and M2 subtypes. Oxybutynin hydrochloride, fesoterodine fumarate, tolterodine tartrate, trospium chloride, and propiverine hydrochloride have been found to be non-selective for the M3 receptor over the M1 subtype.

Our results might therefore be partly explained by the greater ability of oxybutynin hydrochloride, tolterodine tartrate, and solifenacin succinate to penetrate the blood-brain barrier compared to other anticholinergic drugs (e.g. darifenacin and trospium chloride). Drugs with greater penetration of the central nervous system are likely to cause more cognitive side effects, especially in older individuals who have a more permeable blood-brain barrier, as well as age-related changes in drug metabolism and elimination. In a recent British cohort study, oxybutynin hydrochloride and tolterodine tartrate were found to be associated with more harmful outcomes than other anticholinergic drugs used to treat an overactive bladder when used in patients with dementia. More careful prescribing of oxybutynin hydrochloride, solifenacin succinate, and tolterodine tartrate by clinicians is therefore needed. Clinical guidelines should recommend alternative treatments that might be associated with a lower risk of dementia, including the use of non-drug interventions.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^115Sri8N]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Cumulative evidence showed small differences across all comparisons of pharmacotherapies used to treat OAB, including combination therapy (solifenacin/mirabegron) versus monotherapy (< 0.8 episode per day). While some of these differences were statistically significant, the clinical importance is unclear, and all treatment groups reported more than one incontinence episode and 2.5 urgency episodes per day at the study end. For patients with UUI at baseline, less than 65% reported no incontinence over 3 days at the end of treatment.

Anticholinergic adverse effects remain a concern even with mirabegron. Considering that persistence with antimuscarinic drugs is already known to be low, it is unclear whether the added benefit of combining mirabegron with solifenacin outweighs the increased harm. A patient's preference for increased efficacy versus reduced harms, and tolerance of specific adverse events, should be considered when selecting treatment for OAB.
