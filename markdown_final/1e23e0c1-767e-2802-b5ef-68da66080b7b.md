## Question

How long can you take vitamin D 50000 units for

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long they can take vitamin D 50,000 units and how to do it safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is a loading/repletion dose versus a maintenance dose. Then, I should verify the formulation difference between D2 and D3 and how that affects potency and duration. Next, I will review guideline-backed regimens for deficiency, obesity, CKD, and special populations. After that, I need to check safety thresholds, monitoring, and when to stop or switch to maintenance. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, time-limited plan with clear guardrails and exceptions, making sure I cite the highest-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because duration depends on why and how 50,000 IU is being used. If the goal is to treat vitamin D deficiency, guidelines endorse a short, time-limited loading phase followed by maintenance, whereas if the goal is maintenance, 50,000 IU is typically spaced out to every 2–4 weeks and not taken daily, so I need to be precise about intent before giving a number of weeks or months [^d5c6bb1f] [^e74288c6] [^c78d0afb].

> I will now examine the formulation, because D2 and D3 behave differently. Wait, let me verify potency: D3 is substantially more potent and longer-lasting than D2 at the same IU dose, with randomized data showing roughly 1.5–2 fold greater AUC and steady-state 25(OH)D increments for D3 versus D2, and earlier work suggesting even larger differentials in some contexts, so a 50,000 IU D3 capsule is not equivalent to 50,000 IU D2 in clinical effect, and that matters for how long a given regimen should continue [^0aaa0441] [^8cd99483].

> Next, I should review standard repletion protocols for deficiency. The Endocrine Society recommends 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 or D3 once weekly for 8 weeks to achieve 25(OH)D > 30 ng/mL, followed by maintenance therapy of 1,500–2,000 IU/day, and some clinicians extend the loading to 10–12 weeks in severe deficiency or nonresponders, so the typical duration of 50,000 IU weekly is 8–12 weeks, not months or years, and then you transition off that high-dose schedule [^d5c6bb1f] [^e74288c6] [^4091e892].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations where higher or more frequent dosing is used for maintenance. In obesity, malabsorption, or medications that accelerate vitamin D catabolism, guidelines suggest 2–3 times higher daily doses or continued intermittent high-dose regimens, with some protocols using 50,000 IU every 1–4 weeks as maintenance after repletion, and in CKD stages 2–5, 50,000 IU every 2 weeks is a labeled preventive regimen, so in these cases, 50,000 IU may be continued longer term but still as an intermittent, supervised maintenance strategy rather than daily use [^bdcb7965] [^dc600b3a] [^25537e29] [^c78d0afb].

> I need to ensure I address safety and toxicity thresholds. Chronic daily intake of 50,000 IU is unsafe and has caused hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury in case reports, whereas short-term weekly 50,000 IU for 8–12 weeks is generally safe with appropriate monitoring; clinically, toxicity risk rises as 25(OH)D exceeds about 150 ng/mL, and the narrow therapeutic window is emphasized in FDA labeling for ergocalciferol, so I should confirm that any extended high-dose use is indication-driven and monitored [^1848af20] [^0bf7d08b] [^03aa1523].

> Let me consider the newer guidance discouraging intermittent high-dose strategies in older adults. The 2024 Endocrine Society prevention guideline suggests daily lower-dose vitamin D rather than non-daily, higher-dose regimens in adults aged 50 years and older because intermittent high-dose vitamin D may increase fracture risk and falls, so even though 50,000 IU weekly can correct deficiency, I should counsel transitioning promptly to daily maintenance once repletion is achieved in this age group [^17ef9153] [^9e4ec876].

> I should double-check monitoring recommendations. Routine 25(OH)D checks are not required for everyone, but after a loading phase it is reasonable to recheck at about 8–12 weeks to confirm repletion and guide maintenance, and if maintenance includes intermittent 50,000 IU, periodic calcium and 25(OH)D checks are prudent in high-risk patients; in contrast, for generally healthy adults without indications, routine testing is discouraged, so I need to tailor monitoring to risk and regimen [^661ba997] [^ac90b227] [^f0d5bcb8].

> But wait, what if someone is already taking 50,000 IU daily by mistake. I should confirm that this is a critical error and requires immediate cessation and evaluation for hypercalcemia and renal injury, as case reports document severe toxicity with daily 50,000 IU, and the FDA labeling repeatedly warns that the therapeutic-to-toxic window is narrow at high doses, so daily 50,000 IU is never appropriate outside of rare, closely supervised indications like refractory hypoparathyroidism, which is a different clinical scenario altogether [^1848af20] [^03aa1523].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. For treating vitamin D deficiency, 50,000 IU once weekly for 8–12 weeks is the standard repletion course, after which you should stop the weekly high-dose and switch to maintenance, typically 1,500–2,000 IU daily, or in select high-risk patients, 50,000 IU every 2–4 weeks as maintenance with monitoring; for prevention in deficiency-prone states such as obesity or CKD, 50,000 IU every 1–4 weeks may be used long term, but again as an intermittent, supervised regimen rather than continuous high-dose daily use [^d5c6bb1f] [^e74288c6] [^7e616bca] [^25537e29].

> Final check and bottom line: 50,000 IU vitamin D should not be taken daily. For deficiency, limit the high-dose schedule to about 8–12 weeks and then transition to maintenance. For maintenance, 50,000 IU every 2–4 weeks may be appropriate in select high-risk patients, ideally with D3 rather than D2 when available, and with periodic lab oversight to avoid toxicity and ensure the target 25(OH)D of 30–50 ng/mL is maintained without overshooting [^d5c6bb1f] [^0aaa0441] [^01e9d27a] [^661ba997].

---

The safe duration for 50,000 IU vitamin D depends on the indication and formulation: **8–12 weeks** for deficiency repletion [^e74288c6], then transition to maintenance [^d5c6bb1f]; **every 2–4 weeks** for maintenance in adults [^c78d0afb] [^e74288c6]; and **up to 6 months** for specific conditions (e.g. obesity, malabsorption) with monitoring [^7e616bca] [^bdcb7965]. Daily 50,000 IU is unsafe and can cause hypercalcemia [^1848af20]; always use supervised dosing and monitor calcium and 25(OH)D if therapy extends beyond 3 months or if risk factors are present [^661ba997].

## Clinical indications and recommended durations

### Treatment of vitamin D deficiency

For deficiency, **initial treatment** is 50,000 IU weekly for 8–12 weeks [^e74288c6] [^d5c6bb1f], followed by maintenance at 50,000 IU every 2–4 weeks [^e74288c6] [^c78d0afb]. In obesity or malabsorption, **higher doses or more frequent dosing** may be needed [^bdcb7965] [^7e616bca], with monitoring to prevent toxicity [^661ba997].

---

### Maintenance therapy

For maintenance, **50,000 IU every 2–4 weeks** is recommended for adults at risk of deficiency [^e74288c6] [^c78d0afb], including older adults, those with limited sun exposure, or chronic conditions [^2aebc9df] [^25537e29].

---

### Special populations

- **Obesity**: 50,000 IU weekly for 8–12 weeks, then every 1–4 weeks [^7e616bca].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: 50,000 IU every 2 weeks [^25537e29].
- **Pregnancy**: 50,000 IU every 2 weeks [^26e55afe].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Hypercalcemia risk**: Prolonged high-dose use can cause hypercalcemia; monitor calcium and 25(OH)D if therapy exceeds 3 months or if risk factors are present [^661ba997] [^0bf7d08b].
- **Monitoring**: Check serum 25(OH)D and calcium after 8–12 weeks of therapy, then periodically during maintenance [^661ba997] [^3b5d3d40].
- **Adverse effects**: Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal impairment can occur with excessive intake [^0bf7d08b] [^1848af20].

---

## Maximum safe duration

The **maximum safe duration** is 8–12 weeks for initial deficiency treatment [^e74288c6], followed by maintenance dosing [^d5c6bb1f]; prolonged high-dose use without monitoring is not recommended [^661ba997]. For maintenance, 50,000 IU every 2–4 weeks can be continued long term with appropriate monitoring [^c78d0afb] [^e74288c6].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Indication** | **Recommended duration** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| Vitamin D deficiency | 8–12 weeks | 25(OH)D and calcium after 8–12 weeks |
| Maintenance therapy | Every 2–4 weeks | Periodic 25(OH)D and calcium |
| Obesity | 8–12 weeks initially, then every 1–4 weeks | 25(OH)D and calcium |
| Chronic kidney disease | Every 2 weeks | 25(OH)D and calcium |
| Pregnancy | Every 2 weeks | 25(OH)D and calcium |

---

50,000 IU vitamin D is **safe for 8–12 weeks** to treat deficiency, then transition to maintenance every 2–4 weeks [^e74288c6] [^c78d0afb]; prolonged high-dose use requires monitoring to avoid toxicity [^661ba997].

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)". The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^0b7242c7]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

### How well are the optimal serum 25OHD concentrations reached in high-dose intermittent vitamin D therapy? a placebo-controlled study on comparison between 100 000 IU and 200 000 IU of oral D3 every 3 months in elderly women [^a1a90398]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Intermittent dosing may improve adherence to vitamin D therapy. Dosing regimen should maintain optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels over all the year. We compared two dosing regimens, the primary outcome being the percentage of 25OHD measurements reaching the targets of 75 nmol/l or 50 nmol/l after baseline.

Design

Randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group comparison.

Patients

Sixty women aged 75.0 ± 2.9 years.

Interventions

100 000 IU (group 1D) or 200 000 IU (2D) of vitamin D3 or placebo orally every 3 months plus calcium 1 g daily for 1 year.

Measurements

Serum 25OHD, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, PTH, sclerostin, ionized calcium, urinary calcium, renal function, bone turnover markers.

Results

Serum 25OHD increased, but the difference between two doses was of borderline significance (P = 0.0554; area under curve analysis). Immediate postadministrative increases were higher in the 2D vs 1D group (P < 0.05) after 3 and 6 months' dosing. In the 1D and 2D groups, 51.2% and 57.7% of all on-treatment measurements reached the target of 75 nmol/l. PTH levels differed marginally (P = 0.0759) due to tendency to lowering immediately after vitamin D boluses. Urinary calcium differed between the groups (P = 0.0193) due to increases 1 week after vitamin D dosing.

Conclusions

The doses of 100 000 or 200 000 IU of oral cholecalciferol every 3 months were not capable of stabilizing 25OHD levels over the target of 75 nmol/l over the year. To improve the efficacy of high-dose vitamin D therapy, the interval between boluses has to be shortened instead of increasing their size.

Vitamin D supplementation in statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) is discussed with proposed repletion targets but limited trial support, noting that higher doses (50,000–100,000 units per week) aim for on-treatment levels of 50–80 ng/mL; however, to date there has not been evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that vitamin D prevents SAMS or reduces symptom severity, and while it may be reasonable to check vitamin D levels and initiate supplementation if deficiency is identified, a well-designed RCT is still needed before any recommendations can be made about routine vitamin D measurement or treatment in those with SAMS and low vitamin D levels.

Vitamin D supplementation — falls outcomes: In 16 trials assessing participants with any fall as the unit of measure, the risk ratio (RR) was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.91–1.03), with an absolute effects size of 16 fewer people with falls per 1000 (from 48 fewer to 16 more); when the number of falls was the unit, the IRR was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.81–0.99), with no effect in low–risk-of-bias studies (IRR 1.03 [95% CI, 0.92, 1.11]) and greater reductions in institutional-based studies (IRR 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69–0.94]) than community-based studies (IRR 0.96 [95% CI, 0.83–1.05]); among participants with low vitamin D status (< 20 ng/ mL [50 nmol/L]), the RR for fall with vitamin D was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40–1.05).

### Vitamin D toxicity, policy, and science [^7ce57bff]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration that is the threshold for vitamin D toxicity has not been established. Hypercalcemia is the hazard criterion for vitamin D. Past policy of the Institute of Medicine has set the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitamin D at 50 mug (2000 IU)/d, defining this as "the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risks of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population". However, because sunshine can provide an adult with vitamin D in an amount equivalent to daily oral consumption of 250 mug (10,000 IU)/d, this is intuitively a safe dose. The incremental consumption of 1 mug (40 IU)/day of vitamin D(3) raises serum 25(OH)D by approximately 1 nM (0.4 ng/ml). Therefore, if sun-deprived adults are to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations > 75 nM (30 ng/ml), they will require an intake of more than the UL for vitamin D. The mechanisms that limit vitamin D safety are the capacity of circulating vitamin D-binding protein and the ability to suppress 25(OH)D-1-alpha-hydroxylase. Vitamin D causes hypercalcemia when the "free" concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is inappropriately high. This displacement of 1,25(OH)(2)D becomes excessive as plasma 25(OH)D concentrations become higher than at least 600 nM (240 ng/ml). Plasma concentrations of unmetabolized vitamin D during the first days after an acute, large dose of vitamin D can reach the micromolar range and cause acute symptoms. The clinical trial evidence shows that a prolonged intake of 250 mug (10,000 IU)/d of vitamin D(3) is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects in almost all individuals in the general population; this meets the criteria for a tolerable upper intake level.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^435d31f7]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Daily supplementation

From a physiological perspective, daily administration of cholecalciferol seems to be most natural. Indeed, it appears that a daily approach results in higher efficacy in terms of 25(OH)D exposure and extraskeletal benefits.

In a recent RCT comparing 3 different dosing regimens in vitamin D–deficient participants with similar total end-of-study cumulative doses (D 3 daily 10 000 IU 8 weeks, then 1000 IU for 4 weeks; 50 000 IU weekly for 12 weeks; and 100 000 IU every 2 weeks for 12 weeks), the group receiving the daily supplementation was the quickest to reach sufficiency (< 2 weeks, although receiving a higher cumulative dose in the first 8 weeks when compared to the other 2 arms) and reached the highest serum 25(OH)D levels. Importantly, daily administration was associated with higher systemic exposure to 25(OH)D (greater area under the curve, +23% and +27% compared to weekly and biweekly administration, respectively), even when corrected for the cumulative dose. The greater 25(OH)D exposure of daily regimens could be due to lower activation of the 24-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP24A1). In an RCT of lactating women comparing the effect of bolus (150 000 IU) vs daily vitamin D 3 dosing (5000 IU) on vitamin D 3 catabolism, a single high-bolus dose of vitamin D led to greater production of 24,25(OH) 2 D 3, relative to the 25(OH)D 3 value than did daily vitamin D supplementation, with this effect persisting for at least 28 days after supplementation. The greater therapeutic potential of daily regimens compared to other regimens might be less relevant at lower doses (≤ 2000 IU). Two studies comparing 2000 IU/day vs 50 000 IU/month and 800 IU/day vs 5600 IU/month found no statistically significant differences in the 2 areas under the curves.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^0bf7d08b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in men — vitamin D dosing and toxicity notes that for most people, optimal vitamin D levels can be achieved with 1000–2000 IU (25–50 μg) of vitamin D daily; larger doses [e.g., 5,000–50,000 IU (1.25 mg) orally weekly for 8 wk or 300,000 IU (7.5 mg) by im injection every 3 months] may be required for patients with more severe vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D at high doses may result in toxicity (hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria), but this is rarely seen unless 25(OH)D levels exceed 150 ng/ml (375 nmol/liter). In a report of high-dose vitamin D [500,000 IU (12.5 mg) orally once a year] given to women older than 70 yr, there was an increased risk of fracture and falling, especially in the first 3 months after administration, when 25(OH)D levels were on average 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/liter); this finding has not been documented in men and raises caution about giving high doses of vitamin D intermittently.

Nonpharmacologic interventions — calcium and vitamin D intake targets and effects: Counsel patients who are receiving osteoporosis pharmacotherapy and those with postmenopausal osteoporosis who cannot tolerate pharmacologic therapy to consume the recommended daily allowance of calcium and vitamin D through diet (preferably), supplementation, or both. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for calcium is 1,000 mg per day from ages 19 to 50 years and 1,200 mg per day in older women; for vitamin D, the RDA is 600 international units per day to age 70 years and 800 international units per day thereafter, which is believed to maintain 25‑hydroxyvitamin D at 20 ng/mL in 97.5% of the population. In a network meta‑analysis of randomized trials in postmenopausal individuals, combined calcium (1,000–1,200 mg/d) and vitamin D (800 international units/d) reduced hip fracture risk (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.71–0.93) but did not significantly reduce nonvertebral fracture (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.85–1.01) or vertebral fracture (RR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.61–1.27).

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider keeping the maintenance tolerable upper limits of vitamin D, and advise not to exceed without medical supervision, at 4,000 IU/day in adults. Recognize that higher levels of 10,000 IU/day may be required to correct vitamin D deficiency.

Vitamin D metabolites promote the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus by the small intestine, thus elevating serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to permit bone mineralization. Vitamin D metabolites also mobilize calcium and phosphate from bone and probably increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate by the renal tubules. There is a time lag of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active metabolites in the liver and kidneys. Parathyroid hormone is responsible for the regulation of this metabolism in the kidneys. Vitamin D administration from fortified foods, dietary supplements, self-administered and prescription drug sources should be evaluated. Therapeutic dosage should be readjusted as soon as there is clinical improvement. Dosage levels must be individualized and great care exercised to prevent serious toxic effects.

IN VITAMIN D RESISTANT RICKETS THE RANGE BETWEEN THERAPEUTIC AND TOXIC DOSES IS NARROW. When high therapeutic doses are used progress should be followed with frequent blood calcium determinations. Pediatric doses must be individualized. Clinical studies of Ergocalciferol Capsules, USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. A few published reports have suggested that the absorption of orally administered vitamin D may be attenuated in elderly compared to younger, individuals. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

The treatment of hypervitaminosis D with hypercalcemia consists in immediate withdrawal of the vitamin, a low calcium diet, generous intake of fluids, along with symptomatic and supportive treatment. Hypercalcemic crisis with dehydration, stupor, coma, and azotemia requires more vigorous treatment. The first step should be hydration of the patient. Hypoparathyroidism: 50, 000 to 200, 000 USP Units daily concomitantly with calcium lactate 4 g, six times per day. DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED UNDER CLOSE MEDICAL SUPERVISION. Calcium intake should be adequate. Blood calcium and phosphorus determinations must be made every 2 weeks or more frequently if necessary.

Routine documentation of vitamin D metabolites in randomized controlled trials

In most recent large RCTs, participants were monitored only for health effects and serum 25(OH)D levels. One study — the so-called Calgary study (or JAMA study) — used doses of up to 10 000 international units (IU) of vitamin D/day, monitored only 25(OH)D, and reported deleterious effects of the vitamin D on bone mineral density (BMD) (BMD was assessed with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and not with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry). Although this JAMA study reported only 25(OH)D data, by reanalyzing the serum from participants in the study for the full vitamin D metabolome including 1,25(OH) 2 D 3, 24,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 1,24,25(OH) 3 D 3, Burt and colleagues found that several vitamin D metabolites, including 1,24,25(OH) 3 D 3 but not 1,25(OH) 2 D 3, were elevated in individuals given the 10,000 IU of vitamin D/day dose, a fact that could explain the bone loss observed at high supplementation rates.

In conclusion, the study of a wider array of vitamin D metabolites provides insight into a limited number of diseases. It can potentially improve understanding of vitamin D status and its relationship to multiple diseases.

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: variability, knowledge gaps, and the concept of a desirable range [^96de61fe]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2015). Low credibility.

Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent worldwide but proportions vary widely between regions, depending on genetic and lifestyle factors, the threshold to define deficiency, and accuracy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) assays used. Latitude, pollution, concealing clothing, sun exposure, gender, dietary habits, and lack of government regulation account for up to 50% in variations in serum 25OHD levels, whereas genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D pathway account for less than 5%. Organizations/societies have developed guidelines for recommended desirable 25OHD levels and vitamin D doses to reach them, but their applicability across age groups and populations are still debated. This article and the accompanying online Supporting Information highlight sources of variations in circulating 25OHD levels, uncertainties and knowledge gaps, and analytical problems facing 25OHD assays, while keeping efficacy and safety data as the dominant factors when defining a desirable range for 25OHD levels. We propose a desirable range of 20 to 40ng/mL (50 to 100nmol/L), provided precise and accurate assays are used. Although slightly lower levels, 15 to 20ng/mL, may be sufficient for some infants and adults, higher levels, 40 to 60ng/mL, may still be safe. This desirable range allows physicians to tailor treatment while taking season, lifestyle, vitamin D intake, and other sources of variation into account. We reserve 25OHD measurements for at-risk patients, defined by disease or lifestyle, and the use of 25OHD assays calibrated against the recommended international standards. Most target groups reach desirable target levels by a daily intake of 400 to 600IU for children and 800IU for adults. A total daily allowance of vitamin D of up to 1000IU in the pediatric age groups, and up to 2000IU in adults, tailored to an individual patient risk profile, is probably safe over long durations. Additional data are needed to validate the proposed range and vitamin D doses, especially in children, pregnant women, and non-white populations.

### Recommendations abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society consensus statement on vitamin D for prevention of falls and their consequences [^b58f5fcb]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society Consensus Statement — To reduce falls and fractures in older people, clinicians are strongly advised to recommend vitamin D supplementation of at least 1,000 international units (IU)/d, as well as calcium supplementation, to community-dwelling older adults (≥ 65). This minimum daily supplement of 1,000 IU takes into account two major factors, and dosages less than 600 IU did not prevent falls. In most trials, calcium dosages ranged between 500 and 1,200 mg/d, with 1,000 to 1,200 mg/d most commonly prescribed. There are insufficient data at this time to support a recommendation for increased vitamin D supplementation without calcium for older persons residing in the community or in institutional settings. For institutionalized older adults, clinicians are strongly advised to recommend vitamin D supplementation of at least 1,000 IU/d with calcium to reduce the risk of fracture and falls.

### Decalcitrol® cholecalciferol (vitamin d3) 1.25… [^7e2e9507]. FDA (DailyMed) (2017). Low credibility.

Inactive Ingredients: Silica, magnesium stearate, cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose The in vivo synthesis of the major biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of ergocalciferol takes place in the liver and the second in the kidneys. Vitamin D metabolites promote the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus by the small intestine, thus elevating serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to permit bone mineralization. Vitamin D metabolites also mobilize calcium and phosphate from bone and probably increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate by the renal tubules. There is a time lag of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active metabolites in the liver and kidneys.

Colecalciferol Tablets are essential for absorption of calcium and necessary for healthy and strong bones. Cholecalciferol Tablets are indicated for use in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism, refractory rickets, also known as vitamin D resistant rickets, and familial hypophosphatemia. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Geriatric requires seek their primary care physician before starting vitamin D therapy. Hypervitaminosis D is characterized by effects on the following organ system: Metabolic: Mild acidosis, anemia, weight loss. The effects of administered vitamin D can persist for two or more months after cessation of treatment. Hypervitaminosis D is characterized by: DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED UNDER CLOSE MEDICAL SUPERVISION. Calcium intake should be adequate.

Blood calcium and phosphorus determinations must be made every 2 weeks or more frequently if necessary. X-rays of the bones should be taken every month until condition is corrected and stabilized SWALLOW TABLETS. DO NOT CHEW. Take as directed by your physician. Each tablet contains 50000 IU Vitamin D3 equivalent to 1. 25 mg. Vitamin D3 50, 000 IU is essential for absorption of calcium and necessary for healthy bones and a healthy immune system.

### A call for action: standard of care guidelines to assess vitamin D status are needed for patients with hip fracture [^dc600b3a]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

The take-home message is that patients aged ≥ 50 y presenting with fractures, especially those with hip fracture, should be evaluated at intake for their vitamin D status. Consideration should be made to provide vitamin D supplementation if dietary/supplemental intake or blood concentrations of 25(OH)D suggest deficiency. There are a wide variety of multivitamins containing varying amounts of vitamin D, and there are also a variety of over-the-counter vitamin D supplements containing up to 5000 IU. However, the only pharmaceutical form of vitamin D for adults in the United States is vitamin D-2 at a dose of 50,000 IU. The Endocrine Society's practice guidelines on vitamin D recommend that an effective method for treating and preventing recurring vitamin D deficiency is to give a patient 50,000 IU vitamin D-2 or vitamin D-3 once a week for 8 wk followed by a maintenance dose of 50,000 IU vitamin D-2 or vitamin D-3 once every 2 wk thereafter. A 6-y study following this protocol without obtaining a baseline blood concentration of 25(OH)D reported not only that the patients maintained blood concentrations of 25(OH)D of ≥ 30 ng/mL but also, more importantly, that no untoward toxicity was observed.

The data from Hao et al. suggest that it is prudent to institute as standard of care vitamin D status assessment and possible supplementation for all patients presenting with hip fracture. It is important to note that other fragility fractures associated with osteoporosis may present similarly. This simple strategy could potentially significantly reduce morbidity and mortality associated with vitamin D deficiency.

### Treatment with 50, 000 IU vitamin D ₂ every other week and effect on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ₂, 25-hydroxyvitamin D ₃, and total 25-hydroxyvitamin D in a clinical setting [^a80e57f7]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effect of 50,000 IU-vitamin D₂ supplementation in a clinical setting on serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), 25-hydroxyvitamin D₂ (25[OH]D₂), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25[OH]D₃).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study was performed in an urban tertiary referral hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Patients who had been prescribed 50,000 IU vitamin D₂ repletion and maintenance programs were identified through a search of our electronic medical record. Baseline and follow-up total serum 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D₂, and 25(OH)D₃ levels were compared.

Results

We examined the medical records of 48 patients who had been prescribed 50,000 IU vitamin D₂ in our clinic. Mean ± standard deviation baseline total 25(OH)D was 31.0 ± 10.6 ng/mL and rose to 48.3 ± 13.4 ng/mL after treatment (P < .001). 25(OH)D₂ increased from 4.2 ± 4.3 ng/mL to 34.6 ± 12.3 ng/mL after treatment (P < .001), for an average of 158 days (range, 35–735 days). Serum 25(OH)D₃ decreased from 26.8 ± 10.8 ng/mL to 13.7 ± 7.9 ng/mL (P < .001).

Conclusions

Fifty thousand IU vitamin D₂ repletion and maintenance therapy substantially increases total 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D₂ despite a decrease in serum 25(OH)D₃. This treatment program is an appropriate and effective strategy to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^661ba997]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

To summarize, cholecalciferol can maintain physiological 25(OH)D serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) but below 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) for a long time, regardless of whether the dosage given is daily or intermittent (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly), due to its slow pharmacokinetic elimination caused by prolonged storage and release on demand according to physiological needs. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels is generally unnecessary for patients on long-term maintenance vitamin D doses of up to at least 2000 IU/day. Retesting after 8 to 12 weeks from the start of supplementation may be appropriate when poor compliance is suspected, in case of symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency, and for patients at risk of persistent 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These comprise institutionalized or hospitalized individuals, people in whom vitamin D therapy uncovers subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism, obese individuals, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, individuals who use of certain concomitant medications (eg, anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids), and patients with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. For patients on potent antiresorptive agents (eg, denosumab or zoledronic acid), vitamin D levels should be checked annually per protocol.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

Table 2
Description of the main biases of the clinical trials that investigated the effects of vitamin D on inflammatory bowel diseases

Although we only included studies with active disease patients, there was a wide variation in the doses administered (daily oral doses of 1000–50,000 IU, 150,000/3 months, or a single injectable dose of 300,000 IU). The treatment duration ranged from 1 day for 300,000 IU, to 8 days for 60,000 IU, and 8 weeks to 1 year for the other doses.

All studies showed significant improvement in serum VD levels after supplementation (Table 1). The studies of Emani et al and Sharif et al, who used a single injectable dose of 300,000 IU, reported a mean level of 40.8 ± 5.2 ng/mL. Ahamed et al achieved similar values (40.83 ng/mL) with a daily dose of 60,000 IU/8 days. Even higher values of 46.14 ± 12.7 and 45 ± 19 ng/mL were obtained by Baffuto et al and Yang et al, respectively (although half of the patients included in this last study, who received 5000 IU, did not reach values greater than 40 ng/mL). The lowest initial (10.58 ± 3.82 in CD and 10.68 ± 4.11 in UC) and final (23.04 ± 9.66 for CD and 28.09 ± 11.6 for UC) VD values were seen in the study of Tan et al. Karimi et al observed the lowest percentage increases in serum VD levels: the group that received 2000 IU presented 21.83 ± 9.69 at baseline, and 28.99 ± 8.69 after 12 weeks, while the group that received 1000 IU presented 24.37 ± 8.14 initally and 28.75 ± 11.90 ng/mL after 12 weeks. In the study of Bafutto et al, the authors compared supplementation with 2000 (G1), 10,000 (G2), and 50,000 IU (G3)/week and concluded that the highest dose is the best for VD replacement (G1 19.5 ± 5.1 at baseline and 26 ± 6.7 at the end of the study, P = 0.07; G2: 19.1 ± 4.1/26 ± 5.8, P = 0.04; and G3: 19.5 ± 6.4/46.4 ± 12.7, P < 0.001). This study, and the trial performed by Ahamed et al that used 60,000 IU daily for 8 days, showed a higher percentage of augmenting serum levels of VD.

### Risk assessment for vitamin D [^14d526e6]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to apply the risk assessment methodology used by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) to derive a revised safe Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for vitamin D. New data continue to emerge regarding the health benefits of vitamin D beyond its role in bone. The intakes associated with those benefits suggest a need for levels of supplementation, food fortification, or both that are higher than current levels. A prevailing concern exists, however, regarding the potential for toxicity related to excessive vitamin D intakes. The UL established by the FNB for vitamin D (50 microg, or 2000 IU) is not based on current evidence and is viewed by many as being too restrictive, thus curtailing research, commercial development, and optimization of nutritional policy. Human clinical trial data published subsequent to the establishment of the FNB vitamin D UL published in 1997 support a significantly higher UL. We present a risk assessment based on relevant, well-designed human clinical trials of vitamin D. Collectively, the absence of toxicity in trials conducted in healthy adults that used vitamin D dose ≥ 250 microg/d (10,000 IU vitamin D3) supports the confident selection of this value as the UL.

USPSTF vitamin D and calcium supplementation in community-dwelling adults — fracture prevention evidence and RDAs — notes that for community-dwelling, postmenopausal women, the USPSTF "recommends against supplementation with 400 international units or less of vitamin D and 1,000 mg or less of calcium to prevent fractures because adequate evidence indicates that supplementation has no effect on fracture incidence", and it found "insufficient evidence on whether supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium, alone or combined, prevents fracture". Evidence synthesis from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 51,419 adults showed vitamin D alone had "no difference in hip fracture risk" (three RCTs, 5,496 participants; absolute risk difference [ARD], -0.01%; 95% CI -0.80% to 0.78%), and vitamin D plus calcium had "no effect on the risk of total fractures" (one RCT, 36,282 participants; ARD -0.35%; 95% CI -1.02% to 0.31%) and hip fracture (two RCTs, 36,727 participants); the combination was "associated with an increased risk of kidney stones" (three RCTs, 39,213 participants; ARD, 0.33%; 95% CI 0.06%–0.60%). Recommended daily allowance (RDA) values are "1,000 mg per day from ages 19 to 50 years and 1,200 mg per day in older women" for calcium and "600 international units per day to age 70 years and 800 international units thereafter" for vitamin D; the "RDA of vitamin D is believed to maintain an adequate serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (20 ng/mL) in 97.5% of the population". For screening, the USPSTF concludes "the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults", and the Endocrine Society "advises that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk of vitamin D deficiency".

### Large, single-dose, oral vitamin D supplementation in adult populations: a systematic review [^9e1b274a]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Daily vitamin D supplementation is often inadequate in treating vitamin D deficiency due to poor compliance. A single, large dose of vitamin D given at timed intervals may be an alternative strategy.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the efficacy of a single large bolus dose to treat vitamin D deficiency. We identified 2,243 articles in PubMed using the terms "high dose vitamin D", "single dose vitamin D", "bolus vitamin D", or "annual dose vitamin D". Review articles, cross-sectional studies, non-human studies, responses to other articles, and non-English articles were excluded. Manuscripts were also excluded if the study: (1) did not use oral cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, (2) used vitamin D analogs, (3) enrolled participants under age 18 years, (4) administered doses < 100,000 international units (IU) (2.5 mg), or (5) administered > 1 dose per year. References of eligible manuscripts and the Cochrane databases were also searched. Two independent reviewers identified eligible manuscripts, and a third reviewer evaluated disagreements. Thirty manuscripts were selected using these criteria.

Results

Large, single doses of vitamin D consistently increased serum/plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations in several vitamin D-sufficient and -deficient populations. Vitamin D3 doses ≥ 300,000 IU provided optimal changes in serum/plasma 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations. Vitamin D supplementation also impacted bone health and extraskeletal endpoints.

Conclusion

This review recommends that vitamin D3 be used for supplementation over vitamin D2 and concludes that single vitamin D3 doses ≥ 300,000 IU are most effective at improving vitamin D status and suppressing PTH concentrations for up to 3 months. Lower doses, however, may be sufficient in certain populations. Vitamin D doses > 500,000 IU should be used judiciously in order to minimize adverse events.

### Metabolic effects of vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D deficient patients (a double-blind clinical trial) [^0d828ee8]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D has recently been given a lot of attention for its role in controlling insulin secretion. Many studies have spoken of its role in weight management, blood sugar control and many other metabolic variables.

Patient and Methods

In a randomized double-blind clinical trial, 210 people with vitamin D deficiency were randomly allocated into two groups receiving vitamin D (50,000 units per week) or placebo for 8 weeks.

Results

Vitamin D levels were significantly increased in the group receiving vitamin D supplementation (13.7 ± 5.2 unit increase versus 0.8 ± 2.8). The increased levels of vitamin D lead to significant changes in fasting insulin levels (6.8 ± 8.1 unit reduction versus 2.3 ± 3.7), a 2-h insulin (31.1 ± 34.9 unit reduction versus 4.5 ± 24.6) and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) indices.

Conclusion

Correction of vitamin D deficiency leads to increased insulin sensitivity that was significantly able to maintain glucose in the normal range with lower levels of insulin.

### Who should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation? [^2e464778]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is recommended in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Until recently, supplementation was perceived as harmless without adverse effects. However, recent meta-analyses have provided evidence suggesting that calcium supplements, whether or not in combination with vitamin D, may be associated with cardiovascular risks. Although this finding constitutes a safety signal that has to be taken seriously, these data have to be interpreted with some caution. Current data do not allow definite conclusions to be drawn, but require further independent confirmation, since in numerous large studies, combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not increase cardiovascular events, even in the most frail and elderly populations. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to correct calcium deficiency preferably by enhancing dietary intake and to target supplementation on individuals at high risk of fracture or in whom calcium and vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent. Other trials have shown an increased risk of falls and fractures with annual oral administration of high dose of vitamin D. Therefore, supplementation with more frequent, lower doses is preferred. Yet, the optimal dosing schedule is unknown and needs further study. In order to correct age-associated secondary hyperparathyroidism and to prevent osteoporotic fractures, a daily dose of 1,000–1,200 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D is recommended in elderly or institutionalised people, patients with established osteoporosis and individuals on glucocorticoids.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^0ebfc7ef]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Issues surrounding ergocalciferol use are of note for the United States, where 50 000 IU of vitamin D 2 was the only high-dose preparation available by physician prescription and, therefore, ergocalciferol was widely prescribed. Now, instead, 50 000 IU of vitamin D 3 is available by prescription. In addition to assay issues, widespread use of intermittent high-dose ergocalciferol ("bolus" therapy) appears to alter vitamin D metabolism, with increased 24-hydroxylase activity. Other adverse consequences of high-dose vitamin D therapy, notably increased fall risk, are reported and have led to calls to critically assess daily vs bolus vitamin D therapy.

To summarize, vitamins D 2 and D 3 are not equivalent in raising circulating 25(OH)D, and bolus dosing may have adverse effects on vitamin D metabolism and clinical outcomes. As such, it is to be expected that calls for the use of only cholecalciferol and avoidance of ergocalciferol have been and continue to be published with recent osteoporosis-treatment guidance advising cholecalciferol over ergocalciferol (see Table 4). Despite these recommendations, high-dose ergocalciferol remains widely prescribed in the United States.

Calcifediol

Calcifediol is the intermediate metabolite between cholecalciferol and calcitriol. Several pharmacokinetic studies performed in the last 4 decades have demonstrated its hydrophilic properties, leading to higher solubility in organic solvents, less sequestration in adipose tissue, smaller distribution volume, and shorter half-life when compared to cholecalciferol. By virtue of its hydrophilic properties, calcifediol is readily absorbed via the venous portal system and thus quickly increases circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D 3. In contrast to cholecalciferol, which is mostly stored in fat tissue, 25(OH)D tends to be more evenly distributed throughout the body (20% in muscle, 30% in circulation, 35% in fat, and 15% elsewhere). The administered dose will generally lead to predictable 25(OH)D levels and effective PTH suppression. In cases of toxicity, this form of vitamin D is easier to manage than cholecalciferol. Moreover, the greater affinity of calcifediol for DBP allows for more efficient internalization in cells expressing the megalin-cubilin system of endocytic receptors, such as the parathyroids and the renal tissue.

### Magnesium deficit? overlooked cause of low vitamin D status? [^825668ff]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin D status and its predictors

The present data are consistent with the assumption that deficient vitamin D levels are an important health issue that may affect not only musculoskeletal health but also a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. The high prevalence of deficient 25OHD blood levels in the population is believed to be primarily due to inadequate vitamin D synthesis in the skin, together with inadequate dietary intake. However, circulating 25OHD levels also depend on body weight and genetic factors, and a significant portion of the variance in circulating 25OHD remains unexplained at present. Therefore, Deng et al. are to be commended for investigating potential interactions between Mg and vitamin D status. Especially with regard to vitamin D, there is still ongoing debate regarding the optimal oral intake and the adequate circulating 25OHD level. The IOM recommends a daily vitamin D intake of 600 international units and considers circulating 25OHD levels of 20 to 50 ng/ml as adequate, and 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml as potentially harmful. However, according to the Endocrine Society, the circulating 25OHD level should be within the range of 30 to 100 ng/ml. To raise the 25OHD level consistently above 30 ng/ml, they recommend a daily vitamin D intake of 1,500 to 2,000 international units.

### Vitamin D deficiency: a simple algorithm employing weekly administration of 50, 000 IU of vitamin D [^4091e892]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Vitamin D deficiency affects parathyroid hormone levels and is endemic in the American population due to diet and lifestyle. The aim of this study was to evaluate a treatment algorithm using weekly doses of 50,000 IU of Vitamin D2 for thyroid and parathyroid surgery patients.

Study Design

Prospective, non-randomized.

Setting

University health sciences center.

Subjects and Methods

Patients at a thyroid center being treated for benign and malignant thyroid diseases or parathyroid disease. Subjects with total vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/dl were prospectively treated with weekly doses of 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 (D2) for durations dependent upon initial vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) levels. Vitamin D levels were measured after the treatment intervals and change in levels from baseline was determined.

Results

Subjects receiving 8 weeks of therapy demonstrated an average increase in vitamin D level of 13.4 ng/ml, 10 weeks of therapy showed an increase of 16.35 ng/ml, and 12 weeks showed an average increase of 21.6 ng/ml. The treatment groups had success rates of 82%, 75%, and 71% after 8, 10, and 12 weeks of therapy respectively. When only compliant patients were evaluated (defined as greater than 3-ng/ml increase after therapy), the success rates after 8, 10, and 12 weeks increased to 95%, 79%, and 71% respectively.

Conclusions

A simple algorithm using 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 corrects its deficiency in the majority of subjects treated. This is a simple method of treatment for thyroid and parathyroid patients who are vitamin D deficient. Thyroid and parathyroid conditions are frequently treated by otolaryngologists and vitamin D deficiency can complicate their diagnosis and/or management.

### Vitamin D (ergocalciferol) 1.25 mg equivalent to 50, 000 USP unitsdailymed.nlm.nih.gov › dailymed › fda › fdaDrugXsl… [^87102875]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

The in vivo synthesis of the major biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of ergocalciferol takes place in the liver and the second in the kidneys. Vitamin D metabolites promote the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus by the small intestine, thus elevating serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to permit bone mineralization. Vitamin D metabolites also mobilize calcium and phosphate from bone and probably increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate by the renal tubules. There is a time lag of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active metabolites in the liver and kidneys. Parathyroid hormone is responsible for the regulation of this metabolism in the kidneys.

Ergocalciferol Capsules are indicated for use in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism, refractory rickets, also known as vitamin D resistant rickets, and familial hypophosphatemia. Adequate dietary calcium is necessary for clinical response to vitamin D therapy. Protect from light. Mineral oil interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin D preparations. Administration of thiazide diuretics to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with Ergocalciferol Capsules may cause hypercalcemia. Clinical studies of Ergocalciferol Capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. A few published reports have suggested that the absorption of orally administered vitamin D may be attenuated in elderly compared to younger, individuals.

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Hypoparathyroidism: 50, 000 to 200, 000 IU units daily concomitantly with calcium lactate 4 g, six times per day. DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED UNDER CLOSE MEDICAL SUPERVISION. Calcium intake should be adequate. Blood calcium and phosphorus determinations must be made every 2 weeks or more frequently if necessary.

Vitamin D Supplementation

Dosing Regimens

The term " dose " in relation to vitamin D is typically used to signify the measured quantity of vitamin D (usually cholecalciferol, but other formulations such as ergocalciferol, eldecalcitol, calcifediol, etc are also available) in a pill. It is expressed as µg or IU (where 10 µg is 400 IU). The dose of cholecalciferol is considered an important measure as it correlates with the change in blood 25(OH)D level, which is commonly used to define vitamin D status and correlates with important clinical outcomes. Doses can be considered as "loading" or "maintenance". The most common use of a loading dose is to rapidly improve a low blood 25(OH)D; however, the clinical wisdom of this approach is questionable, especially given studies that demonstrate adverse effects with very high doses given infrequently, as discussed next. Intermittent administration of large doses is also used to optimize adherence. Daily doses are generally preferred when vitamin D replacement is considered necessary. The effect of a given dose on changing blood 25(OH)D varies considerably from person to person due to many factors, such as body weight, absorption, diet, degree of adiposity, CYP2R1 activity, DBP. The recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D by the National Academy of Medicine is set at 400 to 800 IU per day, and the tolerable upper intake level at 4000 IU per day; however, the "optimal" dose of vitamin D varies by the desired outcome, and other authors suggest that the upper limit of safety may be lower than 4000 IU per day. For example, 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D per day may be adequate to avoid clinical vitamin D deficiency and maintain calcium homeostasis in healthy individuals. Doses of vitamin D higher than the recommended upper limit may be associated with toxicity; nonetheless, daily doses up to 10 000 IU have been used without safety concerns. Careful and judicious use of vitamin D will permit the realization of potential benefits and achieving optimal outcomes.

Vitamin D — generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years: Subgroup analyses did not provide evidence for benefit with vitamin D in subgroups with 25(OH)D below 20 to 24 ng/mL (50–60 nmol/L), and based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D, in addition to the anticipated undesirable effects, are likely to be trivial. The panel judged that vitamin D supplementation appears to have little or no beneficial impact on the outcomes analyzed in healthy populations aged 50 to 74 years, and concluded there was therefore no compelling rationale to recommend empiric vitamin D in this age group. Noting monetary costs and that a recommendation for 25(OH)D testing could decrease feasibility and health equity, the panel suggested against routine 25(OH)D testing (eg, screening) in generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years.

Objective

To determine which vitamin D dose, formulation, and schedule most effectively and safely achieves a 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level of > 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L).

Methods

In this prospective study, 100 subjects from the NY Harbor HCS Brooklyn Campus, ages 25 to 85 years, with 25(OH)D < 30 ng/mL (< 75 nmol/L), were randomized into four groups: cholecalciferol (D3) 2,000 international units (IU) daily; D3 3,000 IU daily; ergocalciferol (D2) 50,000 IU weekly; and D2 50,000 IU twice weekly. All were supplemented with 500 mg calcium carbonate daily. 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), urinary calcium, urinary creatinine, and other variables were measured during 7 visits over 12 months.

Results

All groups achieved a mean vitamin D level > 30 ng/mL (> 75 nmol/L) by visit 4 (5 months). Those receiving 50,000 IU D2 twice weekly displayed the most rapid and robust response, with 25(OH)D reaching > 30 ng/mL (> 75 nmol/L) after only 1 month and plateauing at 60 ng/mL (150 nmol/L) by 7 months. Although no statistically significant difference was seen in mean 25(OH)D levels between groups 1 through 3, subjects on 50,000 IU D2 weekly more consistently showed higher mean levels than either groups 1 or 2. No episodes of significant hypercalcemia occurred. There was a negative correlation in mean PTH levels and mean vitamin D levels in group 4 and all groups combined.

Conclusion

All four schedules of vitamin D replacement were effective in safely achieving and maintaining 25(OH)D > 30 ng/mL (> 75 nmol/L). D2 50,000 IU twice weekly provided the most rapid attainment and highest mean levels of vitamin D.

### Hypervitaminosis D associated with a vitamin D dispensing error [^1848af20]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of hypervitaminosis D resulting in hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury in a 70-year-old female who was prescribed a standard dose of vitamin D but given a toxic dose of vitamin D 50,000 IU (1.25 mg) daily resulting from a dispensing error.

Case Summary

A 70-year-old female in her usual state of health was instructed to begin supplementation with vitamin D 1000 IU daily. Three months later she developed confusion, slurred speech, unstable gait, and increased fatigue. She was hospitalized for hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury secondary to hypervitaminosis D. All vitamin D supplementation was discontinued and 5 months after discharge, the patient's serum calcium and vitamin D concentrations, as well as renal function, had returned to baseline values. Upon review of the patient's records, it was discovered that she had been taking vitamin D 50,000 IU daily.

Discussion

There is an increased interest in vitamin D, resulting in more health care providers recommending — and patients taking — supplemental vitamin D. Hypervitaminosis D is rarely reported and generally only in the setting of gross excess of vitamin D. This report highlights a case of hypervitaminosis D in the setting of a prescribed standard dose of vitamin D that resulted in toxic ingestion of vitamin D 50,000 IU daily due to a dispensing error. As more and more people use vitamin D supplements, it is important to recognize that, while rare, hypervitaminosis D is a possibility and dosage conversion of vitamin D units can result in errors.

Conclusions

Health care providers and patients should be educated on the advantages and risks associated with vitamin D supplementation and be informed of safety measures to avoid hypervitaminosis D. In addition, health care providers should understand dosage conversion regarding vitamin D and electronic prescribing and dispensing software should be designed to detect such errors.

### Recognition and management of vitamin D deficiency [^82d4e26d]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency affects persons of all ages. Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency are symmetric low back pain, proximal muscle weakness, muscle aches, and throbbing bone pain elicited with pressure over the sternum or tibia. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be obtained in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng per mL (50 nmol per L), and insufficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 to 30 ng per mL (50 to 75 nmol per L). The goal of treatment is to normalize vitamin D levels to relieve symptoms and decrease the risk of fractures, falls, and other adverse health outcomes. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants and children receive at least 400 IU per day from diet and supplements. Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation of at least 700 to 800 IU per day reduces fracture and fall rates in adults. In persons with vitamin D deficiency, treatment may include oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) at 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks. After vitamin D levels normalize, experts recommend maintenance dosages of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at 800 to 1,000 IU per day from dietary and supplemental sources.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D intake and dosing patterns emphasize that many scientific organizations recommend intake of at least 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults aged 50 years and older, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now the National Academy of Medicine [NAM]) suggest 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day as the safe upper limit in the general population; a meta-analysis in postmenopausal women found fracture reduction at doses of 700 to 800 IU/day or more. In frail elderly adults, monthly bolus regimens including 24,000 IU of vitamin D3, 60,000 IU of vitamin D3, or 24,000 IU of vitamin D3 plus 300 μg of calcifediol were associated with increased falls, supporting that caution should be used with bolus dosing, and single, larger annual bolus doses are also not recommended where 500,000 IU of vitamin D3 was given annually in women with risk factors for hip fracture (median age of 76 years and baseline median 25(OH)D level of 21 ng/mL). Mechanistically, a single vitamin D3 dose of 150,000 IU led to greater 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 than daily dosing of 5,000 IU for 1 month.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^06585612]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

"There is at present no consensus regarding the potential beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on muscle function, balance, and risks of falls".

In contrast, Bolland et al. concluded from their meta-analysis that the effect estimated for vitamin D on falls lies within the futility boundary, which they defined as not altering relative risk by 15% or more. A recent post hoc analysis of falls in a large New Zealand (VIDA) study revealed that supplementation with 100,000 IU monthly for 3.4 years had no effect on risk of falling or fractures. The mean baseline serum 25OHD level of these subjects was 63 nmol/L, and less than one-third of all participants started with serum 25OHD levels < 50 nmol/L.

High-dose vitamin D supplementation, however, may increase the risk of falling. This was first observed by Sanders et al. in elderly subjects treated with a single oral dose of 500,000 IU of vitamin D 3 or placebo once a year. The vitamin D–treated group had significantly more falls and fractures during the first 3 months after each loading dose during the 4-year treatment period compared with the placebo group. Smith et al. found that supplementation with 300,000 IU of vitamin D 2 annually by intramuscular injection had no effect on fall risk but increased fracture risk. In elderly women with baseline vitamin D deficiency, monthly doses of vitamin D greater than the equivalent of 800 IU/d for 1 year increased the risk of falls from 48% in the group treated with 24,000 IU monthly (equivalent to 800 IU/d) to 67% in the group treated with 60,000 IU/mo (equivalent to 2000 IU/d) and 66% in the group treated with 24,000 IU of vitamin D 3 plus 300 μg of calcifediol per month. The authors concluded from a post hoc analysis that serum 25OHD concentrations higher than 112.5 nmol/L may be associated with an increased risk of falls. Ginde et al. treated 107 long-term care seniors with 100,000 IU of vitamin D 3 per month or placebo for 12 months. The monthly vitamin D decreased the rate of acute infections by 40% (primary endpoint) but doubled the rate of falls (secondary endpoint). Smith et al. examined fall rates in 146 elderly white women (mean baseline serum 25OHD level of 38 nmol/L) treated with a full range of daily vitamin D 3 doses (from 400 to 4800 IU) or placebo for 1 year. Falls were assessed by daily calendar and phone calls every three months. They found a U-shaped association with falls, the nadir of which occurred in the dose range of 1600 to 3200 IU/d. Fall rates in the higher doses, 4000 and 4800 IU/d, were significantly higher than those in the nadir. In contrast, among 91 African American women in the same study, there was no U-shaped association. Rather there was a progressive decline in percentage of fallers with increasing vitamin D dose, with the lowest rate occurring in the women taking 4000 to 4800 IU/d. This study had a small sample size for the number of dose groups but high-quality fall assessment.

The evidence on whether vitamin D supplementation is effective in decreasing cancers is contradictory.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of cancer in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science to February 2014. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adults who were healthy or were recruited among the general population, or diagnosed with a specific disease. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D₂ (ergocalciferol)), or an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol), or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data independently. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect model meta-analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios (RRs). We considered risk of bias in order to assess the risk of systematic errors. We conducted trial sequential analyses to assess the risk of random errors.

Main Results

Eighteen randomised trials with 50,623 participants provided data for the analyses. All trials came from high-income countries. Most of the trials had a high risk of bias, mainly for-profit bias. Most trials included elderly community-dwelling women (aged 47 to 97 years). Vitamin D was administered for a weighted mean of six years. Fourteen trials tested vitamin D₃, one trial tested vitamin D₂, and three trials tested calcitriol supplementation. Cancer occurrence was observed in 1927/25,275 (7.6%) recipients of vitamin D versus 1943/25,348 (7.7%) recipients of control interventions (RR 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.06); P = 0.88; I² = 0%; 18 trials; 50,623 participants; moderate quality evidence according to the GRADE instrument). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) of the 18 vitamin D trials shows that the futility area is reached after the 10th trial, allowing us to conclude that a possible intervention effect, if any, is lower than a 5% relative risk reduction. We did not observe substantial differences in the effect of vitamin D on cancer in subgroup analyses of trials at low risk of bias compared to trials at high risk of bias; of trials with no risk of for-profit bias compared to trials with risk of for-profit bias; of trials assessing primary prevention compared to trials assessing secondary prevention; of trials including participants with vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL at entry compared to trials including participants with vitamin D levels of 20 ng/mL or more at entry; or of trials using concomitant calcium supplementation compared to trials without calcium. Vitamin D decreased all-cause mortality (1854/24,846 (7.5%) versus 2007/25,020 (8.0%); RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.98); P = 0.009; I² = 0%; 15 trials; 49,866 participants; moderate quality evidence), but TSA indicates that this finding could be due to random errors. Cancer occurrence was observed in 1918/24,908 (7.7%) recipients of vitamin D₃ versus 1933/24,983 (7.7%) in recipients of control interventions (RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.06); P = 0.88; I² = 0%; 14 trials; 49,891 participants; moderate quality evidence). TSA of the vitamin D₃ trials shows that the futility area is reached after the 10th trial, allowing us to conclude that a possible intervention effect, if any, is lower than a 5% relative risk reduction. Vitamin D₃ decreased cancer mortality (558/22,286 (2.5%) versus 634/22,206 (2.8%); RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.98); P = 0.02; I² = 0%; 4 trials; 44,492 participants; low quality evidence), but TSA indicates that this finding could be due to random errors. Vitamin D₃ combined with calcium increased nephrolithiasis (RR 1.17 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.34); P = 0.02; I² = 0%; 3 trials; 42,753 participants; moderate quality evidence). TSA, however, indicates that this finding could be due to random errors. We did not find any data on health-related quality of life or health economics in the randomised trials included in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no firm evidence that vitamin D supplementation decreases or increases cancer occurrence in predominantly elderly community-dwelling women. Vitamin D₃ supplementation decreased cancer mortality and vitamin D supplementation decreased all-cause mortality, but these estimates are at risk of type I errors due to the fact that too few participants were examined, and to risks of attrition bias originating from substantial dropout of participants. Combined vitamin D₃ and calcium supplements increased nephrolithiasis, whereas it remains unclear from the included trials whether vitamin D₃, calcium, or both were responsible for this effect. We need more trials on vitamin D supplementation, assessing the benefits and harms among younger participants, men, and people with low vitamin D status, and assessing longer duration of treatments as well as higher dosages of vitamin D. Follow-up of all participants is necessary to reduce attrition bias.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^4fea203e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — research gaps for adults aged 50 to 74 years: The age group 65 to 74 years requires more attention, since the risks of chronic diseases and the outcomes being examined are higher than in those aged 50 to 64 years. Studies with longer follow-up may be needed, as some outcomes may become apparent only after 5 years. In secondary, exploratory analyses, vitamin D in this age group has been implicated in the prevention of autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and autoimmune thyroid disease, and these data need confirmation by additional RCTs. Studies of the effect of vitamin D fortification on vitamin D status in different populations at risk of low vitamin D status are needed.

### The optimal dosage regimen of vitamin D supplementation for correcting deficiency in adolescents: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^89166008]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Vitamin D deficiency is common in adolescents but the optimal dosage regimen for correcting deficiency is unknown. To test the safety and efficacy of two different vitamin D dosage regimens to correct vitamin D deficiency in adolescents.

Subjects/Methods

In this 12-month, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 28 adolescents (serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) of 21 to 50 nmol/L) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: monthly (n = 9; vitamin D3 50,000IU orally monthly plus three placebo tablets 3-monthly), 3-monthly (n = 9; 150,000IU (3×50,000IU tablets) 3-monthly and placebo orally monthly), or placebo (n = 10; placebo monthly and three placebo tablets 3-monthly). Serum 25(OH)D was measured at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.

Results

Two participants withdrew after their baseline measurement from the 3-monthly group. At 12 months, one participant was deficient (≤ 50nmol/L) in both the monthly and 3-monthly groups, whereas six out of ten in the placebo remained deficient (P = 0.055). At 12 months, the average serum 25(OH)D levels for the monthly, 3-monthly and placebo groups were 76.4, 64.7 and 49.7 nmol/L, respectively (P < 0.001 and P = 0.04 for differences between monthly and placebo groups and 3-monthly and placebo groups respectively, after adjustment for age, sex and seasonal variation). Adherence was 100% and adverse events were minor.

Conclusions

Both 50,000IU monthly and 150,000IU 3-monthly of vitamin D3 safely and effectively corrects vitamin D deficiency in adolescents. These data provide treatment options which can be used by health practitioners to tailor vitamin D dosage regiments according to patient preference and context.

Vitamin D intake targets and testing policy note that "The panel assumed that all should follow the Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)", specifying "The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) in the DRI is 600 IU (15 μg) for persons aged 1–70 years and 800 IU (20 μg) for persons older than 70 years", and in pregnancy "600 IU (15 μg)". For people "older than 50 years" with an indication for treatment, "the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent high doses". The panel also "suggests against routine 25-hydroxyvitamin D testing for generally healthy individuals who do not otherwise have established indications", citing feasibility concerns that "access to accurate 25(OH)D testing is variable across the globe, and an approach requiring such testing may not be feasible in some settings". The scope further notes, "this guideline does not address individuals with underlying conditions that substantially alter vitamin D physiology".

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ac90b227]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

Vitamin D supplementation — justification for recommendations: The panel stated that vitamin D probably results in a slight decrease in all-cause mortality, and probably results in little to no difference in fractures or adverse events, including falls; they also noted concerns that high-dose trials may have masked improvement in fall risk and that subgroup analyses suggested fall risk was likely reduced in trials using standard vitamin D dosages.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^0b919256]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Summary of evidence — benefits and harms: The systematic review included 25 trials (49 879 participants) evaluating vitamin D for all-cause mortality across settings including community (n = 17), nursing homes (n = 6), and hospital clinics (n = 2); most used vitamin D3, commonly as a daily dose (13 trials), either alone or with calcium, with follow-up from 12 weeks to 7 years (median 2 years). The evidence suggests vitamin D lowers mortality versus placebo or no D: RR 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–1.00), absolute effect 6 fewer deaths per 1000 people (from 11 fewer to 0 more); community-based studies showed RR 0.95 [95% CI, 0.90–0.99], and among those with low vitamin D status (< 20 ng/mL [50 nmol/L]) results were consistent (RR of mortality 0.88 [95% CI, 0.46–1.67]). For fractures, trials reporting participants with fractures (43 585 participants) found RR 1.01 (95% CI, 0.94–1.08) with an estimated absolute effect of 1 fewer per 1000 people (from 5 fewer to 6 more).

### Vitamin D deficiency 2.0: an update on the current status worldwide [^d32a9517]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of > 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below < 30nmol/L (or 12ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.

### Vitamin D (3) is more potent than vitamin D (2) in humans [^0aaa0441]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Current unitage for the calciferols suggests that equimolar quantities of vitamins D(2) (D2) and D(3) (D3) are biologically equivalent. Published studies yield mixed results.

Objective

The aim of the study was to compare the potencies of D2 and D3.

Design

The trial used a single-blind, randomized design in 33 healthy adults. Calciferols were dosed at 50,000 IU/wk for 12 wk. Principal outcome variables were area under the curve for incremental total 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and change in calciferol content of sc fat.

Results

Incremental mean (sd) 25(OH)D area under the curve at 12 wk was 1366 ng · d/ml (516) for the D2-treated group and 2136 (606) for the D3 (P < 0.001). Mean (sd) steady-state 25(OH)D increments showed similar differences: 24 ng/ml for D2 (10.3) and 45 ng/ml (16.2) for D3 (P < 0.001). Subcutaneous fat content of D2 rose by 50 μg/kg in the D2-treated group, and D3 content rose by 104 μg/kg in the D3-treated group. Total calciferol in fat rose by only 33 ng/kg in the D2-treated, whereas it rose by 104 μg/kg in the D3-treated group. Extrapolating to total body fat D3, storage amounted to just 17% of the administered dose.

Conclusion

D3 is approximately 87% more potent in raising and maintaining serum 25(OH)D concentrations and produces 2- to 3-fold greater storage of vitamin D than does equimolar D2. For neither was there evidence of sequestration in fat, as had been postulated for doses in this range. Given its greater potency and lower cost, D3 should be the preferred treatment option when correcting vitamin D deficiency.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^36a95ae0]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Many studies investigated dosing regimens in pediatric patients. One trial comparing 4 different daily dosages (400, 800, 1200, 1600 IU) found that all dosages established 25(OH)D concentrations of 50 nmol/L or greater in 97% to 98% of infants at age 3 and 12 months, but only a dosage of 1600 IU/d 25(OH)D levels to 75 nmol/L or greater in 97.5% of infants at age 3 months; nonetheless, this study was discontinued prematurely because of elevated plasma 25(OH)D concentrations that have been associated with hypercalcemia. Another study also found that 1600 IU/day given for 10 weeks to infants from 2 weeks to 3 months of age maintained a 25(OH)D concentration above 80 nmol/L, but without causing hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria.

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^d4230a9a]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of low vitamin D status, it seems that in some countries in the last 10–15 years there has been an increase in global mean vitamin D levels. For instance, in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation there was an increase in mean vitamin D values and a reduction in the prevalence of low vitamin D status.

The long-term effects of vitamin D supplementation are a major clinical concern. The RCT Calgary Vitamin D study recently reported the effects of vitamin D 3 supplementation of 400 UI/day, 4000 UI/day, or 10,000 UI/day on healthy adults aged 55–70 years (mean age 64 ± 4 years) of which 51% were women. Calcium supplementation was initiated when dietary calcium intake was less than 1200 mg/day. The safety profile of vitamin D supplementation was similar for the three doses. Hypercalcemia occurred more frequently with higher doses of vitamin D, but was rare, mild, and transient. Also, the three proposed dosages produced the same changes in bone strength at either the radius or tibia, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation at high doses does not have additional benefits for bone health.

Malihi et al. reported the results of a double-blind RCT regarding the effects of high doses of vitamin D supplementation (monthly doses of 100,000 IU of vitamin D 3 or placebo) in adults (50–84 years) for a median of 3.3 years (range 2.5–4.2 years). Despite a slightly higher incidence of recurrent adverse events in the vitamin D exposed group, this increase was not significant when compared with placebo after adjustment for age, gender, and ethnicity. In addition, in this cohort the incidence of kidney stone events or hypercalcemia was similar to that observed in the placebo group. Despite these RCTs, the available evidence suggests that excessive (very high) circulating levels of 25(OH)D are not always associated with better health outcomes. Vitamin D supplementation should be individualized according to the characteristics of each patient and the aimed clinical outcome.

Healthy women without specific risks may regularly expose themselves to sunlight, without sunscreen for 15 min, 3–4 times per week in the middle of the day to generate healthy endogenous vitamin D levels. Other women may prefer to use the recommended daily dose of 600 IU of cholecalciferol for those aged up to 70 years, and 800 IU for those aged 71 years or more.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^3b5d3d40]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Monitoring vitamin D status during treatment

Monitoring treatments is important to assess their efficacy and safety. Regarding vitamin D supplementations, there is limited evidence for when to monitor response to therapy or toxicity.

When it comes to achieving sufficiency in deficient patients, it seems there is no need to monitor differently according to different dosage regimens (dose and/or frequency) or baseline 25(OH)D serum values. The increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration after supplementation follows a curvilinear response with the increase of the cumulative doses. The delta increase over 100 IU depends on baseline levels, and there is less increase per 100 IU with high doses than low doses. Van Groningen et al calculated that the cholecalciferol loading dose required to reach the serum 25(OH)D target level of 75 nmol/L can be calculated as dose (IU) = 40 × [75 − serum 25(OH)D] × body weight. Mean 25(OH)D levels over a 2-month period are similar to daily, weekly, or monthly administrations (although monthly dosing is associated with more variability), and sufficiency can be reached independently from the baseline 25(OH)D values. In the study by Fassio et al, all participants normalized 25(OH)D safely, regardless of dosing regimens and including patients receiving 10 000 IU/day for the first 8 weeks; moreover, no cases of hypercalcemia were recorded. With regard to recent megatrials results, no effects were found on serum calcium or calciuria unless very high doses were used, such as 4000 to 10 000 IU per day in the Calgary study. Furthermore, these studies did not confirm the modestly increased risk of kidney stones observed in the WHI trial (400 IU per day). However, there might be a need for monitoring in case of other vitamin D metabolite use. As discussed earlier, calcifediol acts much more rapidly than cholecalciferol in increasing serum 25(OH)D levels, resulting in greater fluctuation of 25(OH)D levels. For example, supplementation with 20 μg (800 IU) of cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) increases 25(OH)D concentrations toward 70 nmol/L (28 ng/mL) within 16 weeks, while supplementation with 10 or 15 μg calcifediol (25(OH)D) increases 25(OH)D levels more than 75 nmol/L (> 30 ng/mL) in 8 and 4 weeks, respectively.

KDOQI nutrition guideline — Calcium and phosphorus outcomes with vitamin D supplementation in CKD show no overall effect. Moderate-quality evidence demonstrated no effect of vitamin D supplementation on calcium or phosphorus levels. In predominantly vitamin D–deficient participants, there was no effect of ergocalciferol on calcium with doses of 50,000 IU per week or per month or individualized dosing, while cholecalciferol effects were mixed, with 7 studies showing no effect and 3 showing increases. Across pooled analyses, calcium change showed no effect (mean difference, 0.07 [95% CI, −0.18 to 0.31] mg/dL) and phosphorus change showed no effect (mean difference, −0.15 [95% CI, −0.44 to 0.15] mg/dL). Incidence of hypercalcemia and phosphorous and intact PTH levels were similar between groups.

### Safety of high-dose vitamin D supplementation among children aged 0 to 6 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cd68a07c]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is high-dose vitamin D supplementation safe for children aged 0 to 6 years?

Findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical trials including 8400 unique children, high-dose vitamin D administered as a daily or bolus supplement was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events. Clinical adverse events associated with the supplementation were rare.

Meaning

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that vitamin D supplements in daily doses to 10 000 IU/d or bolus doses to 600 000 IU are well tolerated in children aged 0 to 6 years.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^e8fe620e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D use in nonpregnant adults aged < 50 years — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against empiric vitamin D supplementation beyond the recommended Dietary Reference Intake for this population. Technical remark: This recommendation relates to empiric vitamin D supplementation that exceeds the DRIs established by the IOM, and adults in this age group should follow the Recommended Daily Allowance established by the IOM (600 IU [15 μg] daily). Background notes that levels of 25(OH)D lower than 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L) were seen in 14% of Europeans and lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) in 40%, and in the United States, 24% and 6% of adults have 25(OH)D levels lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), respectively; numerous studies have found associations between low 25(OH)D levels, low BMD, and fractures, low 25(OH)D levels have also been associated with fatigue and higher risks for respiratory infections, and the age span of 18 to 50 years is when peak bone mass occurs.

### Vitamin D2 is much less effective than vitamin D3 in humans [^8cd99483]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Vitamins D(2) and D(3) are generally considered to be equivalent in humans. Nevertheless, physicians commonly report equivocal responses to seemingly large doses of the only high-dose calciferol (vitamin D(2)) available in the U.S. market. The relative potencies of vitamins D(2) and D(3) were evaluated by administering single doses of 50,000 IU of the respective calciferols to 20 healthy male volunteers, following the time course of serum vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) over a period of 28 d and measuring the area under the curve of the rise in 25OHD above baseline. The two calciferols produced similar rises in serum concentration of the administered vitamin, indicating equivalent absorption. Both produced similar initial rises in serum 25OHD over the first 3 d, but 25OHD continued to rise in the D(3)-treated subjects, peaking at 14 d, whereas serum 25OHD fell rapidly in the D(2)-treated subjects and was not different from baseline at 14 d. Area under the curve (AUC) to d 28 was 60.2 ng.d/ml (150.5 nmol.d/liter) for vitamin D(2) and 204.7 (511.8) for vitamin D(3) (P < 0.002). Calculated AUC(infinity) indicated an even greater differential, with the relative potencies for D(3):D(2) being 9.5:1. Vitamin D(2) potency is less than one third that of vitamin D(3). Physicians resorting to use of vitamin D(2) should be aware of its markedly lower potency and shorter duration of action relative to vitamin D(3).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^f0d5bcb8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — general adults younger than 50 years (testing): In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing. In this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials, and the panel suggests against (a) routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making (ie, vitamin D vs no vitamin D) and (b) routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia).

### The American diabetes association's 57th annual advanced postgraduate course: diabetes risk, vitamin D, polycystic ovary syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea [^98b984cb]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Binkley stated that vitamin D levels > 30 ng/ml are safe, with no effect on serum or 24-h urine calcium. Vitamin D intoxication, Binkley said, requires ingestion of > 10,000, and perhaps > 40,000 units daily, with each additional 1,000 units increasing circulating 25-OH D by ∼6 ng/ml. The usual 25-OH D level in individuals intensely exposed to sunlight is 60–80 ng/ml. This shows considerable variability, with Binkley describing a study of surfers in Hawaii whose 25-OH D ranged from 10 to 65 ng/ml. Particularly lower levels were seen in those of Asian ethnicity. Given this variability, one should be careful in recommending replacement doses. Binkley suggested that individuals with screening levels 30–40 ng/ml should have a daily 1,000 IU supplement that at 20–30 ng/ml a 2,000 IU supplement be used, and that those with levels < 20 ng/ml receive a prescription dose of 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks or 50,000 IU three times weekly for 4 weeks. Food fortification might be an effective population approach, but there is currently no evidence to support this. It is noteworthy that intracellular 1α-hydroxylation of vitamin D occurs in many tissues, leading to a variety of autocrine/paracrine nonclassical effects. Higher levels of vitamin D are associated with lower risks of malignancy, and vitamin D appears both to improve β-cell function and insulin action. Numerous epidemiologic studies show association of low vitamin D levels and of lack of supplementation with higher rates of development of diabetes. The dose used is important, with no benefit found from administration of calcium plus 400 IU vitamin D daily in the Womens' Health Initiative or with an 800 IU daily dose in RECORD.

Fascinating studies show that at latitudes near the equator type 1 diabetes incidence is lower, and Finn children supplemented as infants had much lower type 1 diabetes risk, while those who developed rickets had higher risk. There is also evidence that vitamin D reduces risk of macular degeneration, of development of renal disease both in animal models and in human population studies, of myocardial infarction, and of mortality, although Binkley cautioned that low vitamin D status may be a surrogate for illness or socioeconomic factors, which could explain the epidemiologic associations.

### Does vitamin D supplementation improve ovarian reserve in women with diminished ovarian reserve and vitamin D deficiency: a before-and-after intervention study [^4bb6970c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

To best on our knowledge, there are only two small RCTs that examine the effects of vitamin D on AMH levels in women. In a study of infertile PCOS women with vitamin D deficiency, participants received 50,000 IU vitamin D / week (n = 17) or placebo (n = 17) for 8 weeks. The a significant decrease in AMH levels in the vitamin D group compared to placebo was found. Dennis et al. performed RCTs in 49 young women with regular menstruation to evaluate the effects of vitamin D (50,000 IU, taken on the first day of the menstrual cycle) versus placebo on AMH levels over the next week. They found a significant increase in AMH levels in the week following vitamin D supplementation. Although these results may seem contradictory at first, this contradiction can be resolved by considering the different follicular contexts and AMH status of women with PCOS. Women with PCOS typically have abnormal serum AMH levels, which reflect the large number of small antral ovarian follicles captured. Elevated AMH levels in their cases are associated with severe PCOS manifestations. In various studies, vitamin D supplements have also been shown lead to an improvement in the clinical manifestations of PCOS. Therefore, the reduction associated with AMH is not surprising but, most likely, reflects the improvement in folliculogenesis and ovulation status in these population.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^bdcb7965]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D supplementation, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider initiating higher dose (2–3 times higher; at least 6,000–10,000 IU/day) of vitamin D, followed by maintenance therapy of 3,000–6,000 IU/day, in patients with obesity, malabsorption syndromes, or on medications affecting vitamin D metabolism, to treat vitamin D deficiency to maintain a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level > 30 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^a16bcc93]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Randomized trials — all-cause mortality with vitamin D supplementation: All-cause mortality was reported in 13 RCTs (81 695 participants); estimated daily vitamin D dosage varied between 400 IU (10 μg) and 4800 IU (120 μg), with a median of 2000 IU (50 μg), and most trials allowed supplemental vitamin D between 400 to 800 IU/d. The RR for mortality was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.95–1.20), translating to 2 more per 1000 (2 fewer to 6 more). Mortality risk appeared lower with calcium co-administration (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.79–1.01]) than with vitamin D alone (RR 1.12 [95% CI, 1.01–1.24]) (P for heterogeneity = .021), and higher with high dosages (RR 1.22 [95% CI, 1.06–1.39]) compared with standard dosages (RR 0.95 [95% CI, 0.86–1.04]) (P for heterogeneity = .003).

Vitamin D supplementation — evidence-to-decision considerations: Based on best estimates, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely small and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial; the panel concluded that the costs of empiric vitamin D supplementation were negligible because vitamin D is inexpensive, and judged empiric supplementation would be feasible and acceptable to stakeholders; they did not find evidence that the effect of vitamin D is restricted to those with baseline 25(OH)D levels below a threshold and concluded that conditioning supplementation/treatment on 25(OH)D screening may create barriers, with the addition of a 25(OH)D testing requirement increasing costs and possibly decreasing acceptability for some.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^0285a401]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — empiric vitamin D use and 25(OH)D testing: The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years, for adults aged 75 years and older, for those who are pregnant, and for those with high‑risk prediabetes because of its potential to lower disease risks noted on the page. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests daily administration rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower disease risk in healthy adults younger than 75 years, and suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered because routine screening lacks supporting clinical trial evidence (including in those with obesity or dark complexion) and no clear preventive target level was identified. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs and do not apply to those with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

### Call to action: a five nations consensus on the use of intravenous zoledronate after hip fracture [^de85ffbd]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D status and vitamin D loading regimes

The primary aim of vitamin D loading is to reduce the risk of symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Short-term supplementation using typical daily doses of 400–800 IU is insufficient to achieve this. NICE guidance recommends 300,000 IU of vitamin D, split into divided doses over a 6–8-week period. However, this timescale is impractical in the acute hip fracture setting, where the primary aim should be to administer the IV Zol as efficiently as is safe in a time of highly imminent re-fracture risk, i.e. prior to discharge from hospital to avoid the need to return whilst mobility is recovering.

Biochemical vitamin D deficiency is common in the hip fracture population. Checking vitamin D levels before loading can cause delay, generate inaccurate results in the acute phase and add to costs and workload. High-dose loading provides an alternative approach, with toxicity in the form of severe hypercalcaemia very rare.

Whilst large vitamin D doses given to community-dwelling, vitamin-D-replete women may paradoxically increase fracture risk (RR 1.25 for all fractures with 500,000-IU oral vitamin D3; RR 1.49 for hip fracture with 300,000-IU intramuscular vitamin D2), any risk associated with higher dosing in a community setting must be balanced against the huge potential benefit of administering IV Zol safely prior to discharge, in a hip fracture population with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. In support, a single-dose 250,000 IU oral vitamin D has been shown to be safe and effective after hip fracture. Hence, a loading regime of 150,000–250,000 IU, given in 'split' doses over 1–7 days, is appropriate. The risk of missing a single large dose (for instance, if a patient is 'nil by mouth', delirious or vomiting or if lost tablets or spillages mean the drug is erroneously recorded as having been taken) can be minimised by 'splitting' loading doses. The prescribed vitamin D must be taken before IV Zol is administered.
