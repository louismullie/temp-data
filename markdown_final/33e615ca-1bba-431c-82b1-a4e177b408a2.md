## Question

What medication can be given for Parkinson's sleep disorders

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medication options for Parkinson's disease–related sleep disorders. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core sleep phenotypes in PD and their multifactorial drivers. Then, I should verify foundational nonpharmacologic measures and medication review. Next, I will examine disorder-specific pharmacotherapies for insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder, excessive daytime sleepiness, and restless legs syndrome, followed by management of nocturnal motor symptoms. After that, I need to check safety, fall risk, and monitoring considerations. Finally, I will integrate an algorithmic approach and highlight evidence gaps and future directions, making sure each claim aligns with guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical landscape. PD sleep disorders span insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder, excessive daytime sleepiness, restless legs syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and circadian dysregulation, with causes including neurodegeneration of sleep–wake centers, nocturnal motor symptoms, autonomic dysfunction such as nocturia, psychiatric comorbidity, and medication effects, so treatment must be individualized and etiology-driven [^11754fKG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications before basics are in place. I need to ensure sleep hygiene and medication review are addressed first: regular sleep–wake schedules, avoidance of evening caffeine and other stimulants, daytime exercise, restriction of late-day naps, and bedroom safety modifications; concurrently, I should review and deprescribe agents that impair sleep or alertness such as selegiline, sedating antihistamines, antipsychotics, and sedatives, and consider moving dopaminergic doses to optimize nocturnal motor control while minimizing daytime somnolence [^11187fBa] [^1133uYMz] [^1154JsW8].

> Next, I will examine insomnia in PD. I should confirm that nonpharmacologic CBT-I is reasonable when accessible, given small case series suggesting benefit, while acknowledging the need for larger RCTs in PD; pharmacologically, options with modest or possible benefit include melatonin, low-dose sedating antidepressants such as doxepin or trazodone, and eszopiclone, with the caveat that benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics increase fall risk in older adults and should be used cautiously and short term if at all [^111Qz7ZL] [^111Sb5Hz] [^114T3zMn] [^114rH6Vv]. Wait, let me verify the dopaminergic contribution to insomnia: continuous or nighttime dopaminergic strategies can improve sleep when nocturnal akinesia, wearing off, or tremor drive fragmentation; rotigotine improved PDSS-2 in RECOVER, and night-time apomorphine infusion improved PDSS scores in a crossover RCT, supporting targeted dopaminergic optimization for insomnia linked to motor symptoms [^113pmjgR] [^115XU4KB] [^114ZCXjL].

> I will now examine REM sleep behavior disorder. I should confirm that first-line pharmacotherapy remains melatonin or clonazepam despite limited high-quality PD-specific RCTs; a recent randomized trial of prolonged-release melatonin 4 mg did not reduce RBD events in PD, so expectations should be tempered and dosing individualized, with typical melatonin ranges of 2–12 mg and clonazepam 0.25–1 mg at bedtime, alongside mandatory bedroom safety measures and attention to SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs that may worsen RBD; pramipexole may help when periodic limb movements confound the picture, though its mechanism in RBD is uncertain [^1112BJ7U] [^116rnRx8] [^114GPqEA] [^117T7iTV]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought prolonged-release melatonin would be superior for late-night REM clustering, but the negative RCT in PD means I should frame melatonin as a reasonable, safer alternative to clonazepam rather than a proven superior option, and tailor to response and tolerability [^116rnRx8].

> Let me consider excessive daytime sleepiness next. I should double-check that reversible causes are excluded first, including dopaminergic-induced sleep attacks, OSA, and insufficient sleep, and counsel on driving restrictions until somnolence is controlled; modafinil is the most consistently supported agent with meta-analytic evidence of subjective improvement but limited objective benefit, and AASM suggests modafinil or sodium oxybate for hypersomnia secondary to PD, with a small crossover trial showing sodium oxybate improved MSLT and nocturnal slow-wave sleep but induced OSA in some, necessitating polysomnographic monitoring; caffeine has minimal benefit and methylphenidate or atomoxetine remain investigational in PD [^116wzFib] [^114hfJHU] [^112L3Dqh] [^1154JsW8]. Hold on, I should verify safety: sodium oxybate requires careful screening for OSA and respiratory depression risk, and any wake-promoting agent should be trialed with close follow-up given falls and driving risk [^112L3Dqh].

> I need to check restless legs syndrome management in PD. First, I should screen for iron deficiency with ferritin and transferrin saturation and replete iron when indicated; if symptoms persist, dopaminergic therapy can be optimized or a dopamine agonist added, but I must counsel on augmentation risk and consider alpha-2-delta ligands such as pregabalin or gabapentin as alternatives; I should also avoid or minimize antidepressants and antihistamines that worsen RLS when possible [^111UhUR8] [^114K9jND] [^112bCH4p]. Wait, let me verify the levodopa caveat: although levodopa helps RLS short term, AASM advises against standard use due to high augmentation risk, so if used, it should be intermittently and at the lowest effective dose with close monitoring [^114RLXH9].

> Next, I should review nocturnal motor symptom control. Continuous dopaminergic stimulation overnight can reduce nocturnal akinesia, cramps, and early-morning dystonia; options include rotigotine transdermal patch, extended-release pramipexole or ropinirole, COMT-enhanced levodopa regimens, and device-based therapies such as overnight apomorphine infusion or levodopa–carbidopa intestinal gel, with RECOVER and apomorphine trials demonstrating sleep improvements and German guidelines endorsing these strategies when nocturnal motor symptoms fragment sleep [^113pmjgR] [^115XU4KB] [^114ZCXjL]. I should confirm that dose adjustments are individualized to balance nocturnal benefit against daytime sleepiness and hallucinations, especially with dopamine agonists [^114ZCXjL].

> But wait, what if obstructive sleep apnea is present. I should confirm that CPAP is first-line when OSA is diagnosed, as it improves sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in PD and may indirectly benefit motor and cognitive function; this requires polysomnography when clinical suspicion is high, given the overlap of EDS sources in PD [^114T3zMn] [^11754fKG]. Hold on, I should verify that CPAP adherence strategies and mask interfaces are optimized, as adherence can be challenging in PD and directly impacts outcomes [^notfound].

> I will now examine circadian dysregulation. Given blunted melatonin signaling in PD, melatonin 2–5 mg at bedtime is reasonable, with mixed but generally favorable safety data; bright light therapy and regular physical activity can also entrain circadian rhythms and improve sleep quality, and should be integrated with sleep hygiene counseling [^112bCH4p] [^115ZxG3W]. Let me reconsider dosing: starting low and titrating to clinical response minimizes morning sedation, which patients often report with higher melatonin doses [^116rnRx8].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring. Benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics increase fall risk in older adults with PD, particularly when combined with dopaminergic drugs, so I need to use the lowest effective dose, reassess frequently, and deprescribe when possible; for EDS, I must counsel on driving cessation until episodes are controlled and document risk discussions; for sodium oxybate, I should arrange follow-up polysomnography to detect treatment-emergent OSA; and for dopamine agonists, I should screen for impulse control disorders, sleep attacks, and orthostatic hypotension at each visit [^114rH6Vv] [^1158ccDq] [^112L3Dqh] [^113SyPaZ]. I should double-check that caregivers are engaged in safety screening and reporting, as many adverse effects are underrecognized otherwise [^113SyPaZ].

> Let me integrate this into a practical algorithm. First, identify the dominant sleep complaint and its drivers with history, scales such as PDSS-2, ESS, and targeted labs like iron studies; second, implement sleep hygiene and medication optimization; third, layer disorder-specific therapy: melatonin or clonazepam for RBD with safety measures, modafinil or carefully selected alternatives for EDS after reversible causes are excluded, melatonin or low-dose sedating antidepressants for insomnia with CBT-I when feasible, and iron repletion plus dopaminergic or alpha-2-delta therapy for RLS; fourth, address nocturnal motor symptoms with continuous dopaminergic strategies; fifth, screen for and treat OSA with CPAP; and sixth, reassess at 4–6 week intervals to titrate, deprescribe, or escalate as needed, documenting safety outcomes throughout [^11754fKG] [^11187fBa] [^111MgfDz] [^116wzFib] [^111Sb5Hz] [^114K9jND] [^114T3zMn]. Hold on, I should verify that each step is aligned with patient goals and comorbidities, adjusting the sequence when multiple sleep disorders coexist, which is common in PD [^11754fKG].

> Finally, I need to acknowledge evidence gaps and future directions. High-quality RCTs are sparse for many PD sleep interventions, particularly RBD and insomnia; novel agents such as orexin antagonists, cannabinoids like nabilone, and precision circadian approaches are under study but not ready for routine use; and nonpharmacologic modalities like CBT-I, acupuncture, and exercise require larger PD-specific trials, even as preliminary signals suggest feasibility and benefit [^11754fKG] [^111CCz3j] [^115ZxG3W] [^115ZZBwV]. I should confirm that my recommendations remain conservative and evidence-aligned, favoring options with favorable risk–benefit profiles and clear guideline support while transparently noting where data are limited or mixed [^11754fKG].

Medications for Parkinson's sleep disorders should be **individualized** to the specific sleep problem, comorbidities, and safety profile [^11754fKG]. For **insomnia**, optimize nighttime dopaminergic therapy [^114ZCXjL], consider melatonin [^114T3zMn], or low-dose sedating antidepressants (doxepin, trazodone) [^111Sb5Hz]. For **REM sleep behavior disorder**, use melatonin or clonazepam [^111MgfDz]. For **excessive daytime sleepiness**, consider modafinil [^116wzFib] or sodium oxybate [^112L3Dqh] after excluding reversible causes [^116wzFib]. For **restless legs syndrome**, screen for iron deficiency [^111UhUR8] and optimize dopaminergic therapy or use gabapentin [^111vVCUn]. Always review medications that impair sleep [^1133uYMz] and apply sleep hygiene measures [^11187fBa].

---

## Insomnia

Insomnia is common in PD and often reflects nocturnal motor symptoms, medication effects, or comorbidities [^11754fKG]. Pharmacologic options include:

- **Nighttime dopaminergic optimization**: Adjust levodopa or use long-acting dopamine agonists (e.g. rotigotine patch) [^113pmjgR] to reduce nocturnal akinesia and fragmentation [^114ZCXjL].

- **Melatonin**: 2–5 mg at bedtime [^114T3zMn]; modest benefit on sleep quality with a favorable safety profile [^117T7iTV].

- **Low-dose sedating antidepressants**: Doxepin 3–6 mg or trazodone 25–50 mg [^notfound] can aid sleep onset/maintenance; monitor for daytime sedation and falls [^116z1MqW].

- **Eszopiclone**: Possibly useful for insomnia in PD [^114T3zMn], but evidence is limited; use cautiously due to fall risk [^114rH6Vv].

---

## REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)

RBD is common in PD and carries injury risk; **first-line pharmacotherapy** is melatonin 3–12 mg or clonazepam 0.25–1 mg at bedtime [^111MgfDz] [^114GPqEA]. Melatonin is preferred for older adults or those with fall risk; clonazepam is effective but may cause sedation, confusion, and falls [^117T7iTV] [^116z1MqW]. Rivastigmine may be considered for refractory cases, though evidence is limited [^113him8t].

---

## Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)

EDS is common in PD and may be multifactorial; **modafinil** 100–200 mg/day can reduce subjective sleepiness [^notfound], but monitor for cardiovascular effects and interactions [^notfound]. Sodium oxybate 3–9 g/night improved objective and subjective sleepiness in a small RCT [^112L3Dqh], but requires careful monitoring for respiratory depression and sleep apnea [^112L3Dqh]. Caffeine may help mildly but is often insufficient [^1154JsW8].

---

## Restless legs syndrome (RLS)

RLS is frequent in PD and can worsen insomnia; **iron replacement** is first-line if ferritin is low (< 75 ng/mL) [^111UhUR8]. Dopaminergic therapy optimization (e.g. rotigotine, pramipexole) is effective, but monitor for augmentation [^112bCH4p]. Gabapentin 300–900 mg at bedtime is an alternative, especially with neuropathic pain or anxiety [^notfound].

---

## General principles and safety considerations

- **Medication review**: Avoid or adjust drugs that impair sleep or alertness (e.g. selegiline, antipsychotics, sedatives) [^1133uYMz] [^115BMSbo].

- **Sleep hygiene**: Regular schedules, avoidance of evening stimulants, and bedroom safety modifications are foundational [^11187fBa] [^116SEt1h].

- **Fall risk**: Benzodiazepines and sedatives increase fall risk; use the lowest effective dose and monitor closely [^117T7iTV].

- **Driving safety**: Counsel on driving restrictions for patients with EDS or sudden-onset sleep [^1158ccDq] [^114eLEmy].

---

Medication choice should be **tailored** to the specific sleep disorder, comorbidities, and safety profile, with ongoing reassessment and adjustment as needed [^11754fKG].

### Sleep and sleep disorders in people with Parkinson's disease [^11754fKG]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Sleep disorders are common in people with Parkinson's disease. These disorders, which increase in frequency throughout the course of the neurodegenerative disease and impair quality of life, include insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, circadian disorders, obstructive sleep apnoea, restless legs syndrome, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder. The causes of these sleep disorders are complex and multifactorial, including the degeneration of the neural structures that modulate sleep, the detrimental effect of some medications on sleep, the parkinsonian symptoms that interfere with mobility and comfort in bed, and comorbidities that disrupt sleep quality and quantity. The clinical evaluation of sleep disorders include both subjective (eg, questionnaires or diaries) and objective (eg, actigraphy or video polysomnography) assessments. The management of patients with Parkinson's disease and a sleep disorder is challenging and should be individualised. Treatment can include education aiming at changes in behaviour (ie, sleep hygiene), cognitive behavioural therapy, continuous dopaminergic stimulation at night, and specific medications. REM sleep behaviour disorder can occur several years before the onset of parkinsonism, suggesting that the implementation of trials of neuroprotective therapies should focus on people with this sleep disorder.

Sleep disorders are among the most common non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease (PD) and have a significant negative impact on quality of life. While sleep disorders in PD share most characteristics with those that occur in the general population, there are several considerations specific to this patient population regarding diagnosis, management, and implications. The available research on these disorders is expanding rapidly, but many questions remain unanswered. We thus conducted a systematic review of the literature published from 2005 to 2015 on the following disorders of sleep and wakefulness in PD: REM sleep behavior disorder, insomnia, nocturia, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements, sleep disordered breathing, excessive daytime sleepiness, and circadian rhythm disorders. We discuss the epidemiology, etiology, clinical implications, associated features, evaluation measures, and management of these disorders. The influence on sleep of medications used in the treatment of motor and non-motor symptoms of PD is detailed. Additionally, we suggest areas in need of further research.

### Sleep issues in Parkinson's disease [^1145u4Co]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are common, are often severe, and are typically underrecognized and ineffectively treated. After the recognition that some patients with PD could fall asleep unexpectedly when driving, with resulting dangerous consequences, it became evident not only that PD medications might be partly responsible but that there were many additional factors contributing to sleep disturbance in these patients. This review discusses the myriad sleep disorders seen in patients with PD, presents their diagnostic features, and gives recommendations on their management. Effective management of sleep disturbances and excessive daytime sleepiness can greatly improve the quality of life for patients with PD.

### Sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease: many causes, few therapeutic options [^115MbLEJ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Sleep symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are frequent and have multifactorial and multilayered causes. Primary involvement of sleep/wake regulating centers in the brainstem, sleep problems caused by the nocturnal manifestation of motor and dysautonomic signs and medication-induced sleep problems are often impossible to disentangle in the individual patient. Two syndromes, hypersomnia and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), are increasingly recognized as harbingers of the core PD motor syndrome. RBD, associated with a panoply of other nonmotor symptoms, may predispose to a specific PD phenotype. Long-acting dopaminergic stimulation, when abating nocturnal akinesia, also improves subjective sleep quantity. While this strategy is backed up by several randomized controlled trials (RCT), other treatment recommendations are mostly based on case series or expert opinion. Thus we identified only two other RCT, one treating insomnia with eszopiclone, the other nocturnal behavioral abnormalities in demented PD patients with memantine. While the causal complexity of sleep problems in PD certainly hampers the design of therapeutic studies, multiple general treatment strategies against sleep disorders can however be applied efficiently in PD patients as well.

### Sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease [^116t9YKi]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are very common in patients with PD and are associated with a variety of negative outcomes. The evaluation of sleep disturbances in these patients is complex, as sleep may be affected by a host of primary sleep disorders, other primary medical or psychiatric conditions, reactions to medications, aging or the neuropathophysiology of PD itself. In this article, we review the evaluation of the common disturbances of sleep seen in PD. This includes the primary sleep disorders, the interaction of depression and insomnia, the impact that medications for PD have on sleep, as well as the role of factors such as nocturia, pain, dystonia, akinesia, difficulty turning in bed, and vivid dreaming. The treatment of sleep disturbances in PD is largely unstudied but recommendations based on clinical experience in PD and research studies in other geriatric populations can be made. Important principles include, diagnosis, treating the specific sleep disorder or co-occurring disorder, and control of the motor aspects of PD.

### Recognition and diagnosis of sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease [^111kQ6PW]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sleep disorders are among the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), with an estimated prevalence of 65% to more than 95%. Sleep disorders negatively affect the quality of life. Fortunately, specific treatment options are available, but adequate treatment requires a precise and timely diagnosis of the specific sleep disorder at hand. This recognition and diagnosis remain challenging in everyday clinical practice because of the wide variety and intricate combinations of sleep disorders in PD.

The whole gamut of sleep disorders may occur in PD, including excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, nocturnal motor symptoms and sleep-related breathing disorders. Three main groups of causes can be identified. Sleep problems can be a primary disease symptom caused by neuronal degeneration in sleep-regulating brain regions. An example is EDS in patients with cognitive decline. Second, sleep may be disrupted by other symptoms of PD, such as nocturnal motor symptoms (e.g. difficulty turning in bed) or autonomic dysfunction (e.g. nocturia). Third, many drugs used in the treatment of PD can affect sleep. For example, selegiline — which is metabolized to methamphetamine and amphetamine — may cause insomnia.

Most sleep disturbances can be diagnosed and treated by a movement disorders specialist. However, the diversity and complex origin of sleep disorders in PD may complicate the diagnostic trajectory. Ancillary investigations are needed occasionally, including polysomnographic recordings. In specific cases, the diagnostic and therapeutic help of a sleep medicine specialist can be useful.

To adequately treat sleep disorders in PD, an accurate diagnosis is crucial. Treatment options are diverse and depend on the specific sleep disorder(s) that are present. In Table 1, some of the most common sleep disorders are highlighted, together with specifically tailored treatment options. For more elaborate details on the treatment of sleep disorders in PD, we refer to previously published reviews.

Table 1
Therapeutic options of the most common sleep disorders in PD

The purpose of this article is twofold. We highlight the most important recent developments that have clinical relevance for the (differential) diagnosis of sleep disorders in PD. In addition — and based on this new knowledge — we provide a practical, easily applicable approach to the recognition and diagnosis of sleep disorders in PD and atypical parkinsonian syndromes.

### Initial management of Parkinson's disease [^117VTaZB]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders seen in the United States and United Kingdom. The disease is characterised by two processes-cellular degeneration and the resulting biochemical deficiency of dopamine. Although these processes are inter-related, they are approached separately in the clinical setting. Currently, no proven neuroprotective or disease modifying treatment is available for Parkinson's disease. Several agents can be used to treat the motor symptoms associated with dopamine deficiency, and it is important to choose wisely when starting treatment. Drugs can have mild, moderate, or high potency, and the patient's goals, comorbidities, and the short and long term implications of choosing a specific agent should be taken into account when selecting the appropriate agent. Non-motor symptoms, such as depression, fatigue, and disorders of sleep and wakefulness, also need to be evaluated and treated. Research is under way to deliver dopaminergic therapy more effectively, but studies aimed at slowing or stopping disease progression have not shown promise.

### Canadian guideline for parkinson disease [^1133uYMz]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, more specifically with respect to management of sleep disorders, CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend to review all medications and avoid any drugs likely to affect sleep or alertness or to interact with other medications (such as selegiline, H1RAs, H2RAs, antipsychotics, and sedatives).

### Treatment of the sleep disorders associated with Parkinson's disease [^113him8t]. Neurotherapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and preliminary work has suggested viable treatment options for many of these disorders. For rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, melatonin and clonazepam are most commonly used, while rivastigmine might be a useful option in patients whose behaviors are refractory to the former. Optimal treatments for insomnia in PD have yet to be determined, but preliminary evidence suggests that cognitive-behavioral therapy, light therapy, eszopiclone, donepezil, and melatonin might be beneficial. Use of the wake-promoting agent modafinil results in significant improvement in subjective measures of excessive daytime sleepiness, but not of fatigue. Optimal treatment of restless legs syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea in PD are not yet established, although a trial of continuous positive airway pressure for sleep apnea was recently completed in PD patients. In those patients with early morning motor dysfunction and disrupted sleep, the rotigotine patch provides significant benefit.

Conclusions

Sleep disorders are very common in PD, but still their recognition and diagnosis remain challenging. Our proposed diagnostic workup can serve as a basis for tailored therapeutic interventions. The diagnostic armamentarium is extended and refined all the time, for example yielding well-validated clinical questionnaires or new devices to measure body movements related to sleep in the home environment.

### Canadian guideline for parkinson disease [^111Sb5Hz]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, more specifically with respect to management of sleep disorders, CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following for subjective symptoms of insomnia in patients with PD:

- optimization of nighttime dopaminergic treatment

- melatonin

- low-dose sedating antidepressants, such as doxepin or trazodone.

### Dopamine agonists and sleep in Parkinson's disease [^116ts7bd]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Dopaminergic therapy is increasingly recognized as a cause of excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with PD. This adverse effect may be a dose-related phenomenon that is somewhat more likely to occur with dopamine agonists than with levodopa, although all dopaminergic drugs can be sedating. However, medication effect is only one of several causes of somnolence in PD. Other factors include age-related changes in sleep quality, nocturnal motor disturbances, primary sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, medication-induced sleep disruption, and concurrent medical illnesses. There is also increasing evidence that the disease process itself may affect the control of the sleep-wake cycle. Although we have characterized the sleep disturbances in PD, further investigation is needed to define their prevalence and etiology, particularly with respect to the role of dopamine and dopaminergic agents. Clinicians should be alert to the complaint of excessive sleepiness in their patients and should attempt to identify and treat the underlying causes.

### An overview of the effects of levodopa and dopaminergic agonists on sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease [^11556Lek]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sleep disorders are among the most common nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease and are associated with reduced cognition and health-related quality of life. Disturbed sleep can often present in the prodromal or early stages of this neurodegenerative disease, rendering it crucial to manage and treat these symptoms. Levodopa and dopaminergic agonists are frequently prescribed to treat motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, and there is increasing interest in how these pharmacological agents affect sleep and their effect on concomitant sleep disturbances and disorders. In this review, we discuss the role of dopamine in regulating the sleep-wake state and the impact of neurodegeneration on sleep. We provide an overview of the effects of levodopa and dopaminergic agonists on sleep architecture, insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep-disordered breathing, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease. Levodopa and dopaminergic drugs may have different effects, beneficial or adverse, depending on dosing, method of administration, and differential effects on the different dopamine receptors. Future research in this area should focus on elucidating the specific mechanisms by which these drugs affect sleep in order to better understand the pathophysiology of sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease and aid in developing suitable therapies and treatment regimens.

### Diagnosis and treatment of autonomic failure, pain and sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^115eqpPH]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline methodology

During the purposing phase, key PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) questions were formulated by the guideline steering committee. The respective chapter authors subsequently refined the PICO wording and performed a comprehensive literature search, identifying pertinent studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and high-quality guidelines. The identified literature was further enriched with additional evidence sources provided by the assigned authors. The chapter authors subsequently drafted the background and recommendation texts, which were reviewed, and put to an online vote by all members of the German Parkinson Guideline Group. Recommendations that achieved < 75% consensus required group discussion, revision and re-voting. Recommendations with > 75% agreement among the group members were considered consented. Consensus was "strong", if agreement outreached a 95% quote.

For the purposes of the present work, the dosage ranges of the recommended medications have been added based on the available manufacturer's information and clinical experience of the authors. Studies assessing the efficacy and safety of different drug schedules in the specific setting of PD were, however, oftentimes missing. Treating physicians are therefore requested to consult the applicable prescribing information in their respective country and to perform a case-by-case risk–benefit assessment when considering prescribing any of the therapeutic options mentioned hereafter.

### Sleep-related problems of Parkinson's disease [^113Vzq32]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the epidemiology, characteristics and aetiology of nocturnal symptoms and sleep disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and evaluate the available methods for their diagnosis and management.

Methods

A review of the English-language literature pertaining to sleep disturbances associated with PD, using the Medline database and bibliographies in relevant articles.

Results

Sleep-related problems specific to PD may occur early and even predate the diagnosis of the disease but are generally more frequent and more severe in patients with advanced PD. These problems can seriously compromise patients' quality of life and lead to impaired functioning in daily activities. Scales designed specifically for the assessment of sleep problems in patients with PD have recently been developed. Evidence base for the treatment of sleep disturbances in PD is poor, and only nocturnal akinesia, excessive day-time sleepiness and rapid eye movement behaviour disorder have been partially addressed.

Conclusions

Sleep disorders associated with PD are a common and under-recognised problem. The assessment of sleep should be part of the routine evaluation of patients with PD, and large-scale controlled therapeutic trials are necessary.

How to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in PD?

If the diagnostic workup identifies a sleep disorder as a possible cause for daytime sleepiness, an etiology-driven therapeutic approach according to the guidelines summarized above is recommended. Especially motor or non-motor wearing-off phenomena inducing nocturnal sleeplessness call for the adjustment of dopaminergic medications. Total levodopa-equivalent dose should be critically appraised and the possibility of a dose-reduction or medication redistribution should be considered, since suboptimal medication timing may contribute to sleeplessness and impaired daytime vigilance. Sleep attacks associated with dopamine agonists need to be excluded. A switch to amantadine or invasive therapies may prove beneficial.

Non-pharmacological approaches include improvement of sleep hygiene with regular bedtimes and naps, social activation, bright light application to regulate circadian rhythm and intensified physical activities. Intensive sport improved subjective sleep quality and power training has been shown to improve both sleep and cognition.

If all treatable causes of excessive daytime sleepiness have been excluded and non-pharmacological measures prove insufficient, medication may be considered, although evidence is poor. Up to 400 mg of caffeine showed minimal, clinically non-meaningful effects on the ESS. A meta-analysis of studies investigating modafinil in PD, using dosages of 200–400 mg as per prescribing information, demonstrated a reduction of subjective, but not objectively measured daytime sleepiness. An open-label study showed preliminary positive effects for methylphenhidate. Istradefylline, a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, improved daytime sleepiness in an open label study, but is not licensed in Europe. Gamma hydroxybutyric acid improved PSG-based measurements in a double-blind randomized phase II study, but had a severely unfavorable safety profile and cannot be therefore recommended. The selective noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine improved daytime sleepiness and cognition in a pilot randomized double-blind study in PD individuals. Medication for comorbid diseases and other medications, especially hypnotics and sedating antidepressants should be reviewed critically. Ultimately, the MDS recommends to prohibit driving as long as daytime sleepiness persist.

What are the effects of nocturnal sleep disturbances on PD individuals and their relatives?

Numerous cross-sectional cohort studies show that insomnia and sleep disorders are associated with a reduced quality of life and an increased disease burden in PD individuals. An association between sleep disturbances and depression has been found in PD individuals and their partners who may also develop sleep disturbances. Even mild cases of comorbid SDB are associated with cognitive impairment and motor performance deteriorates in case of comorbid sleep disorders.

### Recognition and diagnosis of sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease [^113eog1b]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are among the most frequent and incapacitating non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), and are increasingly recognized as an important determinant of impaired quality of life. Here we review several recent developments regarding the recognition and diagnosis of sleep disorders in PD. In addition, we provide a practical and easily applicable approach to the diagnostic process as a basis for tailored therapeutic interventions. This includes a stepwise scheme that guides the clinical interview and subsequent ancillary investigations. In this scheme, the various possible sleep disorders are arranged not in order of prevalence, but in a 'differential diagnostic' order. We also provide recommendations for the use of sleep registrations such as polysomnography. Furthermore, we point out when a sleep specialist could be consulted to provide additional diagnostic and therapeutic input. This structured approach facilitates early detection of sleep disturbances in PD, so treatment can be initiated promptly.

### Parkinson's disease and sleep [^116fLjRx]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), as almost two thirds of PD patients report them. From a clinical point of view, they can be classified into disorders of initiation and maintenance of sleep (DIMS), parasomnias, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Among the causes of DIMS are degenerative changes in the CNS affecting centers for sleep regulation, persistence into the night of daytime PD-related symptoms, concomitant medical or psychiatric disease, disruption of circadian rhythms, and effects of dopaminergic (and other) medication on sleep regulation. Parasomnias might further contribute to sleep disturbance, as they can be accompanied by motor desinhibition during REM sleep. Parasomnias can precede by several years the presence of daytime PD symptoms. EDS has been over the last years the focus of attention for both sleep and movement disorders specialists, due to the fact that it might predispose to traffic accidents. However, the so-called "sleep attacks" never occur without preexisting somnolence. Thus, a careful sleep history can be helpful to determine which patients are exposed to suffer them. Although EDS was initially attributed to the effects of dopaminergic medication, it seems likely that several disease-related factors might also play an important role. An adequate education of the PD patients in sleep hygiene measures and a skilled use of the medication seem necessary to prevent sleep disturbance.

### Sleep disorders and Parkinson's disease: is there a right direction? [^112CvAyo]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the last years, the hypothesis of a close relationship between sleep disorders (SDs) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has significantly strengthened. Whether this association is causal has been also highlighted by recent evidence demonstrating a neurobiological link between SDs and PD. Thus, the question is not whether these two chronic conditions are mutually connected, but rather how and when this relationship is expressed. Supporting this, not all SDs manifest with the same temporal sequence in PD patients. Indeed, SDs can precede or occur concomitantly with the onset of the clinical manifestation of PD. This review discusses the existing literature, putting under a magnifying glass the timing of occurrence of SDs in PD-neurodegeneration. Based on this, here, we propose two possible directions for studying the SDs-PD relationship: the first direction, from SDs to PD, considers SDs as potential biomarker/precursor of future PD-neurodegeneration; the second direction, from PD to SDs, considers SDs as concomitant symptoms in manifest PD, mainly related to primary PD-neuropathology and/or parkinsonian drugs. Furthermore, for each direction, we questioned SDs-PD relationship in terms of risk factors, neuronal circuits/mechanisms, and impact on the clinical phenotype and disease progression. Future research is needed to investigate whether targeting sleep may be the winning strategy to treat PD, in the context of a personalized precision medicine.

### When Parkinson's disease patients go to sleep: specific sleep disturbances related to Parkinson's disease [^1139Nvgd]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease can be as disabling as the much better studied motor symptoms. Among the nonmotor manifestations are numerous forms of alterations of physiologic sleep patterns that may present at different stages during the course of disease. These include changes believed to be primarily related to the underlying neurodegenerative process of the disease as well as those brought about secondarily, for example, by pharmacologic treatment. Also, sleep disturbances seen in Parkinson's disease can range from temporarily increased daytime sleepiness after introduction of a dopamine agonist to the therapeutic regime to specific sleep-related diagnoses such as restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, periodic limb movements in sleep, and sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea. In this review, we discuss the different specific sleep disturbances that arise in the context of Parkinson's disease with a special emphasis on epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis.

### Safety and efficacy of subcutaneous night-time only apomorphine infusion to treat insomnia in patients with Parkinson's disease (APOMORPHEE): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, double-blind crossover study [^115XU4KB]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Insomnia is a frequent complaint of patients with Parkinson's disease, and it negatively affects quality of life. Drugs that improve both sleep and parkinsonism would be of major benefit to patients with Parkinson's disease-related insomnia. We aimed to test the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous night-time only apomorphine infusion in patients with Parkinson's disease and insomnia.

Methods

We did a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 11 expert centres in Parkinson's disease and sleep centres in France. Participants aged 35–90 years with fluctuating Parkinson's disease and moderate to severe insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index score ≥ 15) were randomly assigned to either first receive night-time subcutaneous apomorphine (up to 5 mg/h) or matching placebo. Randomisation was done using a computer-generated plan in blocks of four, stratified by centre. This first intervention was followed by a 14-night washout period, then crossover to the other intervention. The treatment periods consisted of a 10-night titration phase followed by a 7-night fixed-dose phase. The dose was adjusted during the titration phase on the basis of a daily telephone call assessing sleep quality and treatment tolerability. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in Parkinson's disease sleep scale (PDSS) scores from the beginning to the end of each treatment period. Analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02940912.

Findings

Between Jan 31, 2017, and Jan 29, 2021, 46 participants were enrolled. 25 (54%) patients were randomly assigned to receive apomorphine first and 21 (46%) patients to receive placebo first. Mean change in PDSS score was significantly greater with night-time apomorphine infusion (15.18 [SD 24.34]) compared with placebo (5.23 [21.52]; treatment effect 9.95 [95% CI 0.88–19.03]; p = 0.041). Adverse events were reported in 25 (54%) participants during the apomorphine period and in 17 (37%) participants during the placebo period (p = 0.16). Apomorphine was associated with more frequent dizziness than was placebo (seven [15%] vs 0; p = 0.041).

Interpretation

Subcutaneous night-time only apomorphine infusion improved sleep disturbances according to difference on PDSS score, with an overall safety profile consistent with previous studies in Parkinson's disease. This treatment might be useful to manage sleep disturbances in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and moderate to severe insomnia.

### Targeting sleep and the circadian system as a novel treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease [^115ZxG3W]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

There is a growing appreciation of the wide range of sleep–wake disturbances that occur frequently in Parkinson's disease. These are known to be associated with a range of motor and non-motor symptoms and significantly impact not only on the quality of life of the patient, but also on their bed partner. The underlying causes for fragmented sleep and daytime somnolence are no doubt multifactorial but there is clear evidence for circadian disruption in Parkinson's disease. This appears to be occurring not only as a result of the neuropathological changes that occur across a distributed neural network, but even down to the cellular level. Such observations indicate that circadian changes may in fact be a driver of neurodegeneration, as well as a cause for some of the sleep–wake symptoms observed in Parkinson's disease. Thus, efforts are now required to evaluate approaches including the prescription of precision medicine to modulate photoreceptor activation ratios that reflect daylight inputs to the circadian pacemaker, the use of small molecules to target clock genes, the manipulation of orexin pathways that could help restore the circadian system, to offer novel symptomatic and novel disease modifying strategies.

### New awakenings: current understanding of sleep dysfunction and its treatment in Parkinson's disease [^113Gysyv]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Sleep is of great interest in the field of PD and neurodegenerative diseases for a number of reasons. First, it is a common symptom that has an impact on quality of life and can influence daytime functions (including cognitive abilities). Second, there are some aspects of sleep (such as RBD) which may provide a window into the early prodromal period and enable potentially therapeutic interventions to target this patient population. Third, there is emerging evidence that sleep directly influences brain health and could even be a risk factor for the development and progression of age-related brain diseases. By understanding the full spectrum of sleep disorders and their causes, we will hopefully be able to improve quality of life in patients and potentially influence the course of their disease.

### Sleep disturbance in movement disorders: insights, treatments and challenges [^112naUoP]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are central features of many movement disorders, exacerbating motor and non-motor symptoms and impairing quality of life. Understanding these disturbances to sleep is clinically important and may further our understanding of the underlying movement disorder. This review evaluates the current anatomical and neurochemical understanding of normal sleep and the recognised primary sleep disorders. In addition, we undertook a systematic review of the evidence for disruption to sleep across multiple movement disorders. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder has emerged as the most reliable prodromal biomarker for the alpha synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, often preceding motor symptom onset by several years. Abnormal sleep has also been described for many other movement disorders, but further evidence is needed to determine whether this is a primary or secondary phenotypic component of the underlying condition. Medication used in the treatment of motor symptoms also affects sleep and can aggravate or cause certain sleep disorders. Within the context of movement disorders, there is also some suggestion of a shared underlying mechanism for motor and sleep pathophysiology, with evidence implicating thalamic and brainstem structures and monoaminergic neurotransmission. This review highlights the need for an understanding of normal and abnormal sleep within the movement disorder clinic, an ability to screen for specific causes of poor sleep and to treat sleep disturbance to improve quality of life. Key sleep disorders also act as important biomarkers and have implications in diagnosis, prognosis and the development of future therapies.

### Parkinson disease [^112CsPQp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Parkinson disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive motor and nonmotor disability. It is diagnosed clinically and requires a detailed history and neurologic examination to exclude alternative diagnoses. Although disease-modifying therapies do not exist for Parkinson disease, effective symptomatic therapies, including dopaminergic medications and surgery, allow patients to maintain good quality of life for many years. Nonmotor symptoms, including mood, cognitive, sleep, autonomic, and gastrointestinal symptoms, should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians. Recent advances include new diagnostic criteria from the Movement Disorder Society and the addition of new symptomatic therapies for treating motor complications and nonmotor symptoms in advanced disease.

### Management of sleep problems in Parkinson's disease [^115hf32T]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently complain of sleep problems. These can be due to several factors, and the approach to their management depends on careful consideration of the various possible factors in each case. 1. Older people, in general, require less sleep. After retirement, people may also engage in less physical activity, and this factor is of course even more pronounced in patients with PD because of their illness. 2. Daytime naps, either spontaneous or due to drugs, reduce the need for nocturnal sleep. Explanation of these physiological and circumstantial changes may help those PD patients who manifest these consequences. 3. The existence of a severe progressive disease as well as social isolation have psychologic consequences, such as anxiety and depression, that may manifest as insomnia. Furthermore, depression is part of the disease, frequently antedating the motor manifestations, and may manifest as insomnia. 4. In advanced disease, patients may be immobile and have difficulty in getting up or even turning in bed. This causes great inconvenience, and may impair sleep. Long acting anti-Parkinson drugs such as cabergoline or rotigotine patch may help. 5. In some cases, unpleasant hallucinations may appear which prevent the patient from falling asleep. These may respond to atypical neuroleptics. Clozapine and quetiapine are particularly useful, but require attention to possible adverse effects.

### New awakenings: current understanding of sleep dysfunction and its treatment in Parkinson's disease [^1153urdj]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Spectrum of sleep disorders in PD

Sleep disorders in PD encompass insomnia (difficulties with sleep initiation and/or sleep maintenance), parasomnias [particularly REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD)], excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), restless leg syndrome (RLS) and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). These disorders can be directly related to underlying disease pathology, secondary to symptoms of the disease, or secondary to medication side effects.

Up to 90% of PD patients experience some form of sleep dysfunction. Studies have used a variety of validated sleep scales to demonstrate sleep problems in PD patients: Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2 (PDSS-2), Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease–Sleep (SCOPA-SLEEP), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Most of these scales evaluate symptoms in the recent past (over the prior 1–4 weeks), with questions designed to probe different PD symptoms that might influence sleep. In doing so, these questionnaires not only assess the presence and severity of sleep problems but can also help to identify their cause and point towards suitable management strategies. The advantages and disadvantages of specific sleep questionnaires, both generic and PD-specific ones, have been reviewed elsewhere.

### Management of sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy [^112YWzHa]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are disorders associated with α synuclein-related neurodegeneration. Nonmotor symptoms are common hallmarks of these disorders, and disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle are among the most common nonmotor symptoms. It is only recently that sleep disturbances have received the attention of the medical and research community. Significant progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of sleep and wake disruption in alphasynucleinopathies during the past few decades. Despite these advancements, treatment options are limited and frequently associated with problematic side effects. Further studies that center on the development of novel treatment approaches are very much needed.

### Rotigotine transdermal patch and sleep in Parkinson's disease: where are we now? [^1133EgaY]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

A wide range of sleep dysfunction complicates Parkinson's disease during its course from prodromal to palliative stage. It is now increasingly acknowledged that sleep disturbances are thus integral to the disease and pose a significant burden impacting on quality of life of patients. Sleep fragmentation, restless legs syndrome, nocturia, and nocturnal pain are regarded as one of the main components of night-time sleep dysfunction with possible secondary impact on cognition and well-being. The role of dopaminergic therapies, particularly using a continuous drug delivery strategy in managing some of these sleep issues, have been reported but the overall concept remains unclear. This review provides an overview of several aspects of night-time sleep dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and describes all available published open-label and blinded studies that investigated the use of rotigotine transdermal patch targeting sleep. Blinded studies have suggested beneficial effects of rotigotine transdermal patch on maintenance insomnia and restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease patients. Open-label studies support these observations and also suggest beneficial effects on nocturia and nocturnal pain.

### New awakenings: current understanding of sleep dysfunction and its treatment in Parkinson's disease [^114LoudR]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The non-motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasingly being recognised. This review deals with the spectrum of sleep disorders associated with PD, which have a multifactorial aetiology and can significantly have an impact on the quality of life of patients and their carers. Some sleep disorders represent a prodromal phase of PD, with REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) being of particular interest in this regard, whereas others become more common as the disease advances. Understanding the pathophysiology of these sleep disturbances will hopefully lead to new treatment opportunities in the future. The recent discovery of the glymphatic system for removal of waste products from the brain has also raised the possibility that sleep disruption may cause or accelerate the underlying disease process.

### Acupuncture and sleep quality among patients with parkinson disease: a randomized clinical trial [^115ZZBwV]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson disease (PD), which is characterized by bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, rest tremor (frequency, 4–6 Hz), and postural instability, is one of the most common and complex neurological disorders. As PD advances, nonmotor symptoms may predominate and become associated with increased disability and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Sleep disorder, as part of the disease course and side effects of anti-Parkinson medication, is a prevalent nonmotor symptom in PD and is associated with a more severe PD clinical phenotype. Studies on PD have consistently shown that poor sleep is linked to accelerated deterioration in gait and dyskinesia, and faster progress in mood and cognitive symptoms. Consequently, sleep quality significantly affects HRQOL and symptom burden in patients with PD.

Current management options for sleep disorder among patients with PD remain limited. The primary approach is to optimize dopaminergic therapy, particularly if the sleep disorder is related to nocturnal motor symptoms. Medications such as benzodiazepines, sedative antidepressants, and antipsychotics are beneficial but frequently accompanied by side effects, including excessive daytime sleepiness, morning sedation, imbalance, or confusion. Evidence on safety and efficacy is lacking for nondrug treatments such as cognitive behavior therapy, acupuncture, light treatment, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and exercise. Further studies should focus on novel approaches to treat PD, with the goal of applying safe and effective therapies to alleviate sleep symptoms, decrease motor symptoms, and improve quality of life.

Acupuncture is a therapeutic technique involving the insertion of needles into acupoints to induce a de qi sensation and trigger therapeutic effects, and it has been used in China for thousands of years. When used as an adjunctive therapy with anti-Parkinson medications, acupuncture has shown positive effects in improving sleep quality and reducing motor symptoms in patients with PD. However, there is still insufficient high-quality clinical evidence to support its effectiveness due to small sample sizes, unclear reporting, and potential bias. Therefore, we conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of poor sleep quality among patients with PD. This trial compared the effectiveness of real acupuncture (RA) vs sham acupuncture (SA), and it also comprehensively evaluated improvements in sleep quality, anxiety, nonmotor symptoms, motor symptoms, and HRQOL among patients with PD experiencing comorbid sleep and motor symptoms.

Therapeutic approaches

Management of sleep disorders should begin with simple measures, aiming for optimum management of motor symptoms and ensuring good sleep hygiene. These practices include advice on regularising bed times and light exposure, avoiding wake-promoting substances (such as nicotine and caffeine) and medications later in the day, avoiding prolonged time in bed whilst awake, and avoiding exercising later in the day.

Given the blunted melatonin rhythms observed in PD patients, melatonin supplementation should be considered for the treatment of insomnia. Dowling et al. assessed the efficacy of melatonin administration for sleep disturbances in 40 PD patients. Although no significant differences were seen when 5 mg melatonin was compared to placebo, a small (but statistically significant) increase in sleep time was noted with 50 mg melatonin. In a similar study, Medeiros et al. randomised 18 patients to receive either 3 mg melatonin or placebo. Again, no significant differences were found between the groups. Whilst these studies did not report substantial objective benefit from melatonin therapy, patients reported subjective benefits. It should be noted that these were relatively small studies of heterogenous populations with a mixture of sleep disturbances.

Current treatment options for RBD involve supportive management including altering the sleeping environment to make it safer (e.g. moving furniture and placing cushions next to the bed). Melatonin and clonazepam are the mainstay of pharmacological management, although a recent study found no overall benefit in RBD symptoms using prolonged release melatonin compared to placebo.

Management of RLS includes iron replacement in individuals with proven iron deficiency and avoidance of medications known to exacerbate RLS (such as antidepressants, antihistamines and dopamine antagonists). If additional treatment is required, dopamine agonists are commonly started, with consideration given to the possibility of augmentation (a poorly understood phenomenon that occurs with long-term dopaminergic therapy characterised by more severe symptoms occurring earlier in the day). Alpha-2 delta ligands (such as pregabalin) are now considered an alternative first-line treatment, but the initial drug of choice should be carefully chosen according to symptomatology and the individual needs.

### Sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease: an overview [^117F2KJv]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are one of the most common of the nonmotor complications of Parkinson's disease (PD), and increase in frequency with advancing disease. The causes of sleep disturbance in PD are numerous, and many patients may have several factors that contribute. These disorders can be broadly categorized into those that involve nocturnal sleep and daytime manifestations such as excessive daytime sleepiness. Some sleep disorders, in particular REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) may arise as a primary manifestation of PD, reflecting the anatomic areas affected by the neurodegenerative process. Appropriate diagnosis of the sleep disturbance affecting a PD patient can lead to specific treatments that can consolidate nocturnal sleep and enhance daytime alertness.

### Treatment of nocturnal disturbances and excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease [^116g4x8S]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Nocturnal disturbances are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, with almost 70% of these patients reporting nocturnal disturbances. The etiology of sleep disturbances in patients with PD is still controversial. They might be dependent on dopaminergic drugs, on disease progression, or on a combination of these two factors. Nocturnal disturbances can be categorized in four groups: 1) PD-related motor symptoms, including nocturnal akinesia, early-morning dystonia, painful cramps, tremor, and difficulty turning in bed; 2) treatment-related nocturnal disturbances; 3) psychiatric symptoms, including hallucinations, vivid dreams, depression, dementia, insomnia, psychosis, and panic attacks; 4) other sleep disorders, including insomnia, REM behavioral disorder (RBD), restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic leg movements (PLMS), and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Specific treatment options are supplied for every group. A global evaluation of nocturnal disturbances would provide clinicians with a valuable tool to establish an optimal regimen that could positively influence all nocturnal disturbance categories and thus improve PD management on. However, it is important to consider that management of some nocturnal disturbances in a group may worsen nocturnal symptoms of another group or may increase EDS. PD-related symptoms can be treated with long-acting DA agonists to obtain continuous DA receptor stimulation during the night. Both treatment-related nocturnal disturbances and psychiatric symptoms may be related to drug treatment, and therefore, in both cases, drug reduction or discontinuance should be considered. Some sleep disorders, such as RLS and PLMS, may be controlled by DA agents, and others, such as insomnia and EDS, may be improved by reducing dopaminergic stimulation.

### New awakenings: current understanding of sleep dysfunction and its treatment in Parkinson's disease [^114M7Spj]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1–2% of adults aged over 65 years and is the second most common degenerative brain disorder. It has long been diagnosed based on its cardinal motor features: bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. More recently, the prevalence and extent of non-motor features in PD has come to be recognised. These non-motor manifestations are varied and include dementia, mood disorders, autonomic disturbances, pain and sleep dysfunction. Some of these non-motor features can appear prior to PD motor features. They can have marked effects on quality of life and even patient safety (such as increased risk of injury and accidents due to cognitive problems and excessive daytime sleepiness). The previous under-appreciation of non-motor features in PD was probably a combination of under-reporting of symptoms from patients, as well as a lack of awareness from their physicians.

In the PRIAMO study, Barone et al. found sleep disorders to be the second most prevalent non-motor complaint in a large cohort of 1072 PD patients, affecting 64% of patients across the entire disease spectrum.

This review will discuss the sleep disturbances associated with PD, with particular emphasis on management options and research priorities. It is not intended to be an exhaustive review on the topic. Instead, we will concentrate on topics where there have been recent advances that may lead to an improved understanding or new therapeutic approach to sleep dysfunction in PD.

### Melatonin for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease: a randomised controlled trial [^116rnRx8]. Movement Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Melatonin may reduce REM‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD) symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), though robust clinical trials are lacking.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of prolonged‐release (PR) melatonin for RBD in PD.

Methods

Randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group trial with an 8‐week intervention and 4‐week observation pre‐ and postintervention (ACTRN12613000648729). Thirty PD patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder were randomized to 4 mg of prolonged‐release melatonin (Circadin) or matched placebo, ingested orally once‐daily before bedtime. Primary outcome was the aggregate of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder incidents averaged over weeks 5 to 8 of treatment captured by a weekly diary. Data were included in a mixed‐model analysis of variance (n = 15 per group).

Results

No differences between groups at the primary endpoint (3.4 events/week melatonin vs. 3.6 placebo; difference, 0.2; 95% confidence interval = −3.2 to 3.6; P = 0.92). Adverse events included mild headaches, fatigue, and morning sleepiness (n = 4 melatonin; n = 5 placebo).

Conclusion

Prolonged‐release melatonin 4 mg did not reduce rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in PD. © 2019 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Rotigotine effects on early morning motor function and sleep in Parkinson's disease: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (RECOVER) [^113pmjgR]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms including nocturnal and early morning dystonia and akinesia and is also associated with nonmotor symptoms, such as sleep disorders. These sleep disorders may be secondary to the patient's underlying disease pathology but may, in part, be a consequence of motor complications and other nonmotor symptoms (such as nocturnal pain, insomnia, and vivid dreams), or medication use. Although the importance of identifying and treating sleep disorders in PD is well recognized, few published trials have prospectively studied their management.–

Effective management of nocturnal and early morning PD symptoms may be achieved with either a long-acting treatment or by continuous administration of a short-acting treatment. Rotigotine is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist that is applied once daily using a transdermal patch, providing 24 hours of continuous drug delivery, and is generally well tolerated. Significant treatment benefits of rotigotine have been observed in both early and advanced PD and include improvements in activities of daily living and motor symptoms, clinically relevant reductions in "off" time, and reductions in concomitant-dopa dose. Rotigotine's potential to improve early morning motor function and sleep-associated problems in PD was demonstrated recently by two large controlled studiesthat showed a reduction in the proportion of patients awakening in an "off" state.

This study compared the effects of rotigotine and placebo on early morning motor function and nocturnal sleep disturbances in subjects with PD. (It should be noted that while dopamine agonists have a variable effect on sleep architecture, this was not addressed in this study.) Effects on nocturnal symptoms such as limb restlessness, tremor, and cramps and on other nonmotor symptoms such as pain and mood were also investigated. To our knowledge, this is the first large, controlled trial in PD to use sleep outcomes as a coprimary outcome measure.

### Overview of sleep disturbances and their management in parkinson plus disorders [^115efEK4]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Sleep disturbance is one of the commonly reported non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as in Parkinson plus disorders such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Although there is a wealth of literature on sleep disturbances in PD, the same is not robust on the Parkinson plus disorders. This article aims to comprehensively review the sleep disturbances in Parkinson plus disorders. The literature review was as per the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). We searched PubMed and MEDLINE till December 2019 using a combination of words - "Sleep disturbance" with additional search terms such as: "synucleinopathy", "tauopathy", "multiple system atrophy", "dementia with Lewy bodies", "progressive supranuclear palsy", and "corticobasal syndrome". A wide range of sleep disorders that include insomnia, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), periodic limb movement disorder, excessive daytime sleepiness, and sleep apneas, may complicate the course of the Parkinson plus disorders. Pathophysiology of these sleep disorders remains elusive, thus making targeted pharmacotherapy challenging. We describe the cardinal features and the management options of these sleep disorders in the context of Parkinson plus disorders.

### Diagnosis and treatment of autonomic failure, pain and sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^114ZCXjL]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

How effective are slow-release levodopa preparations or dopamine agonists for treating nocturnal PD motor symptoms?

Whenever PD individuals complain of the nocturnal recurrence of PD symptoms like the inability to turn in or get out of bed, off-dystonic cramps, or the inability to fall asleep again because of tremor worsening, the application of long-acting dopaminergic agents overnight should be considered. To date, the transdermal application of rotigotine is the best investigated dopaminergic treatment option: randomized, controlled trials showed a significant improvement of sleep disturbances, with increased sleep efficiency, shortened sleep latency and reduced nocturnal awakenings under rotigotine treatment. Pramipexole was also effective, and ropinirole proved non-inferior. An open-label study showed improvements on PDSS-2 scorings by combining levodopa/carbidopa with entacapon. PD patients on pump-based continuous delivery of dopaminergic medication will benefit from extending the pump running time through the night. Both an extension of daytime subcutaneous apomorphine infusion and isolated nocturnal applications led to a significant improvement of sleep quality. Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel instillation via PEG/PEJ through the night also proved beneficial on subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Of note, dopamine agonists may cause daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks in a dose-dependent manner. Overnight, dopamine-agonists at high dosages were shown to induce nocturnal wakefulness, increase sleep fragmentation and reduce slow-wave sleep, whereas lower dosages reduced nocturnal wakefulness and improved sleep quality.

A recent overview described a positive effect of deep brain stimulation on sleep latency and fragmentation. Whether this is due to a direct effect of the stimulation or rather to the postoperatively reduction of dopaminergic medications remains unclear.

It should be kept in mind that many substances successfully used in PD pharmacotherapy have never been tested in trials with sleep disorders as primary endpoint. This is for example the case of slow-release levodopa formulations. The clinical experience, however, underlines its therapeutic benefit, especially when dopamine agonists are contraindicated.

### Rotigotine transdermal patch and sleep in Parkinson's disease: where are we now? [^112MYSEe]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

A range of sleep dysfunctions complicate Parkinson's disease (PD) and at some stage during the course of the disease, patients may report insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, hyper-somnolence, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), as well as excessive daytime somnolence can be key clinical markers of prodromal PD and be present in untreated early PD together with RLS. – Later on, motor symptoms can disturb sleep maintenance. Frequent awakenings at night due to RLS, periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) or early morning off (EMO) associated with non-motor symptoms (NMS) likely contribute to the complexity of night-time sleep dysfunction.

Rotigotine (RTG) transdermal patch has been suggested to be efficacious for management of some sleep related problems in PD and is currently the only therapeutic strategy examined with the PD Sleep Scale 2 (PDSS-2) as a primary outcome measure in the RECOVER study, which is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded trial.

In this review, we examine the current state of the evidence base for use of RTG for nocturnal sleep problems in PD. Firstly, we have attempted to summarize the current understanding of some nocturnal sleep disturbances in PD and the rationale for the of RTG transdermal patch in this setting. A more detailed description of studies addressing specific features of sleep disruption and the use of RTG follows. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from inception through to October 15, 2016 using a combination of the following search terms: Parkinson* AND rotigotine AND sleep. The literature search was limited to open-label and blinded studies in the English language. To ensure a comprehensive coverage of the potential effects of RTG on sleep, studies addressing nocturnal pain and RBD were also identified through cited references and authors' databases.

### Current treatments for sleep disturbances in individuals with dementia [^111cQtUW]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are widespread among older adults. Degenerative neurologic disorders that cause dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, exacerbate age-related changes in sleep, as do many common comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions. Medications used to treat chronic illness and insomnia have many side effects that can further disrupt sleep and place patients at risk for injury. This article reviews the neurophysiology of sleep in normal aging and sleep changes associated with common dementia subtypes and comorbid conditions. Current pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic evidence-based treatment options are discussed, including the use of light therapy, increased physical and social activity, and multicomponent cognitive-behavioral interventions for improving sleep in institutionalized and community-dwelling adults with dementia.

### Sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease [^111XZD3k]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor and non-motor features. Sleep disruption, including REM-sleep behaviour disorder and circadian rhythm dysfunction, is a well-recognised prodromal aspect of PD, although other features such as restless leg syndrome and other physical factors may contribute. Treatment of PD remains challenging due to the multifactorial nature of the disorder and requires a holistic approach. Improved understanding of central causes may be key to developing novel, effective and targeted treatments.

In this month's journal club, we first review the association between alpha-synuclein in CSF and sleep disorders in prodromal and established PD. Secondly, we explore the role of Diffusion Tensor Imaging in assessing the glymphatic system in a similar cohort comparison. Finally, we will appraise the efficacy of Nabilone as a possible new therapeutic option for sleep disturbance in patients with established PD.

### Rasagiline improves polysomnographic sleep parameters in patients with Parkinson's disease: a double-blind, baseline-controlled trial [^114AuyXB]. European Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The aim was to study the effects of rasagiline on sleep quality in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with sleep disturbances. Sleep disorders are common in PD. Rasagiline is widely used in patients with PD, but double-blind polysomnographic trials on its effects on sleep disturbances are missing.

Methods

This was a single-center, double-blind, baseline-controlled investigator-initiated clinical trial of rasagiline (1 mg/day) over 8 weeks in patients with PD with sleep disturbances. Blinding was achieved by running a strategic matched placebo parallel group. Co-primary outcome measures were the changes between baseline and end of the treatment period in sleep maintenance/efficiency as assessed by polysomnography and the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale Version 2 (PDSS-2) score.

Results

A total of 20 of 30 patients were randomized to rasagiline (mean ± SD age, 69.9 ± 6.9 years; 10 male; Hoehn-Yahr stage, 1.9 ± 0.8). Compared with baseline, sleep maintenance was significantly increased at the end of the treatment period (relative change normalized to baseline, +16.3 ± 27.9%; P = 0.024, paired two-sided t-test) and a positive trend for sleep efficiency was detected (+12.1 ± 28.6%; P = 0.097). Treatment with rasagiline led to significantly decreased wake time after sleep onset, number of arousals, percentage of light sleep and improved daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. We did not observe changes in the co-primary endpoint PDSS-2 score, and no correlations of polysomnographic sleep parameters or PDSS-2 score with motor function (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score). Rasagiline was well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events.

Conclusions

In patients with PD with sleep disturbances, rasagiline showed beneficial effects on sleep quality as measured by polysomnography. These effects were probably not related to motor improvement or translated into improved overall sleep quality perception by patients.

### Update on treatments for nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease-an evidence-based medicine review [^1112BJ7U]. Movement Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Because of the multiple causative factors involved, the treatment of PD‐related sleep problems and daytime somnolence is usually complex. Careful history taking — often including information from a spouse or caregiver — is essential in identifying the most likely and relevant underlying causes. Treatment options include optimizing PD therapies to improve nocturnal symptom control or to reduce daytime somnolence, treatment of NMS‐like nocturia, depression or mental dysfunction, and counseling about sleep hygiene as well as the addition of sleep or wakefulness promoting drugs. Rotigotine is "possibly useful" for the treatment of insomnia in PD as are eszopiclone and melatonin. Suspicion of comorbid sleep‐disordered breathing requires polysomnographic verification to decide on the need for continuous positive airway pressure therapy, which is "possibly useful" in improving sleep and daytime sleepiness in patients with PD and obstructive sleep apnea.

Before initiating pharmacotherapy for RBD, potential aggravators should be identified and, if possible, removed, for example, the use of SSRIs, SSNRIs or TCAs, which have been associated with causing or worsening RBD in case reports. 162, 163 Treatment options for RBD include clonazepam or melatonin or a combination of these although there are no RCTs available for the treatment of RBD in PD. 163 A small, controlled, crossover trial reported a decreased number of RBD episodes as monitored by diaries of bed partners with rivastigmine patch when compared with placebo, 51 but this study was not included in this review as it did not fulfill the inclusion criteria.

New‐onset EDS or sudden onset of sleep following changes in dopaminergic drug type and dose should raise a suspicion of drug‐induced EDS leading to trials of dose reduction or other medication changes. If EDS appears to be caused by insomnia as a result of PD or comorbid conditions such as sleep apnea or depression, these should be treated accordingly. If this is not feasible, the addition of a wake‐promoting drug such as modafinil may be considered, which is "possibly useful". Often, treating EDS in PD will involve combinations of these measures.

### Abnormal sleep and sleepiness in Parkinson's disease [^111AZaGS]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Sleep problems are frequent and disabling in patients with Parkinson's disease. Recent data provide major advances in the mechanisms and consequences of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders, insomnia and narcolepsy-like daytime sleepiness.

Recent Findings

A large series confirms that rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders may precede parkinsonism or dementia (particuarly, but not exclusively, Lewy bodies dementia) for several years. In Parkinson's disease, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders expose patients to higher risks of dementia and hallucinations. Surprisingly, parkinsonism disappears during rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders, suggesting basal ganglia are bypassed. The interest for structures controlling atonia during rapid eye movement sleep switches from the pedunculopontine nuclei to the locus subcoeruleus. The neuropathology of hypothalamus in Parkinson's disease indicates a massive hypocretin loss, probably underlying the narcolepsy phenotype. The benefit of the new, 24-h long acting ropinirole and transdermal rotigotine on sleep and sleepiness is modest. Eventually, the dopamine release in the mesocorticolimbic pathway is increased during rapid eye movement sleep, supporting its role in dopaminergic-induced vivid dreams.

Summary

In clinical practice, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders should be looked at as heralding neurodegenerative diseases in patients with mild cognitive impairment and as a risk factor for dementia and hallucinations in patients with Parkinson's disease.

### Pharmacological treatment for REM sleep behavior disorder in parkinson disease and related conditions: a scoping review [^116PiSBr]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by the presence of a complex of signals resulting from the loss of REM sleep atony and manifested by vigorous and sometimes violent motor jerks and nocturnal vocalizations associated with dream enactment. RBD might be a clinical predictor of severity for Parkinson's disease (PD) and one of its most important non-motor manifestations, preceding the emergence of synucleinopathy by several years or even decades. The detection of RBD may represent a therapeutic window for research regarding the development of new neuroprotective therapies with the potential to modify the natural course of synucleinopathies, such as PD. We performed a scoping review of studies indexed in MEDLINE and LILACS focusing on pharmacological interventions for RBD associated with PD. Fourteen articles were selected. Study designs comprised randomized and non-randomized clinical trials (n = 153 participants) and observational studies (retrospective cohorts and case series, n = 248 participants). Melatonin and clonazepam appear to be useful for treating RBD in PD, but these findings are mostly supported by observational studies and a few controlled studies with a small number of participants. New pharmacological agents, such as melatoninergic agonists and phytocannabinoids, appear to be promising therapies. The findings from studies focusing on anticholinesterases and new dopaminergic agents are still deemed inconclusive.

### Rotigotine transdermal patch and sleep in Parkinson's disease: where are we now? [^113ryPfd]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Rotigotine in apomorphine or other advanced therapies treated advanced Parkinson's patients

The effects of RTG on sleep disturbances in PD are most frequently assessed in groups of patients with a fairly early disease course, however the described potential beneficial effects of RTG might be observed in advanced PD patients as well. An open-label single-arm study in a small sample of 6 PD patients (age 60.4 ± 7.8 years; 83.3% male; disease duration 17.4 ± 3.2 years) investigated the effects of RTG patch on sleep disorders in advanced PD treated with day-time apomorphine infusion (3.1 ± 0.8 mg/h for 12 h). Compared to baseline, the PDSS total score decreased on average 44.8% [from 21.2 ± 2.8 to 11.7 ± 2.8; p < 0.05] at 4-month follow up. Improvements in 12 out of the 15 items of the scale were recorded, with quality of sleep and difficulty in staying asleep showing statistically significant differences (both p < 0.05). Furthermore, the VAS score used to quantify sleep problems improved by 65% [from 2.6 ± 0.6 to 7.4 ± 0.6]. This small-open label study supports the use of low-dosage RTG in advanced PD patients with sleep disturbances, indicating a good tolerance with no incidence of relevant side effect such as hallucinations. Further studies addressing the effect and tolerability of RTG on sleep disturbances in advanced PD patients are needed to confirm these preliminary observations.

### Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease: dopaminergic pathophysiology and treatment [^1152dzJg]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Several studies, including work from the Parkinson's disease (PD) non-motor group and others, have established that the non-motor symptoms of PD are common, occur across all stages of PD, are under-reported, and are a key determinant of quality of life. Research suggests that the non-motor symptoms of the disease are frequently unrecognised by clinicians and remain untreated. Even when identified, there is a common perception that many of these symptoms are untreatable. The role of dopaminergic drugs in treating the various non-motor problems of PD, although clinically recognised, has received little attention. In this Review, we investigate the dopaminergic basis of the range of non-motor symptoms that occur in PD such as depression, apathy, sleep disorders (including rapid-eye movement sleep behaviour disorder), and erectile dysfunction. We discuss the evidence that these symptoms are treatable, at least in part, with various dopaminergic strategies and, where relevant, we also refer to the use of deep-brain stimulation of appropriate targets in the brain. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the management of this challenging aspect of PD.

### Update on treatments for nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease-an evidence-based medicine review [^1143LwSc]. Movement Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Objective

To update evidence‐based medicine recommendations for treating nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Background

The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Evidence‐Based Medicine Committee's recommendations for treatments of PD were first published in 2002, updated in 2011, and now updated again through December 31, 2016.

Methods

Level I studies testing pharmacological, surgical, or nonpharmacological interventions for the treatment of nonmotor symptoms in PD were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion and quality scoring were as previously reported. The disorders covered were a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, disorders of sleep and wakefulness, pain, fatigue, impaired olfaction, and ophthalmologic dysfunction. Clinical efficacy, implications for clinical practice, and safety conclusions are reported.

Results

A total of 37 new studies qualified for review. There were no randomized controlled trials that met inclusion criteria for the treatment of anxiety disorders, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, excessive sweating, impaired olfaction, or ophthalmologic dysfunction. We identified clinically useful or possibly useful interventions for the treatment of depression, apathy, impulse control and related disorders, dementia, psychosis, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, drooling, orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysfunction, urinary dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and pain. There were no clinically useful interventions identified to treat non‐dementia‐level cognitive impairment.

Conclusions

The evidence base for treating a range of nonmotor symptoms in PD has grown substantially in recent years. However, treatment options overall remain limited given the high prevalence and adverse impact of these disorders, so the development and testing of new treatments for nonmotor symptoms in PD remains a top priority. © 2019 The Authors.

### Update on treatments for nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease-an evidence-based medicine review [^114T3zMn]. Movement Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

New Conclusions

A total of 3 new studies 41, 42, 93 were evaluated. We excluded trials not fulfilling the inclusion criteria for review 51, 54 and where disorders of sleep and wakefulness were not an inclusion criterion. 77 See Table 7 for recommendations. Although there is "insufficient evidence" for the efficacy of eszopiclone and melatonin for the treatment of insomnia in PD, 2 practice implications have been changed since the previous review: both eszopiclone and melatonin have been reported to significantly improve some of the clinical measures of insomnia when compared with placebo in patients with PD and insomnia. 2 Therefore, the practice implication is " possibly useful" for both drugs.

Although there is "insufficient evidence" to conclude on the efficacy of modafinil in the treatment of excessive daytime somnolence and sudden onset of sleep in PD, 2 the practice implications for modafinil for the treatment of insomnia have been changed since the previous review 94 with the practice implication " possibly useful". Indeed, a recent meta‐analysis of 3 trials evaluating modafinil, which were also included in the previous review, 2 showed a significant reduction in sleepiness, as assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. 94

Based on a low‐quality, positive study, 42 continuous positive airway pressure therapy is considered " likely efficacious " and " possibly useful " in improving sleep and daytime sleepiness in patients with PD and obstructive sleep apnea. No safety concerns were identified in this study, and given its wide availability, 95 continuous positive airway pressure therapy is considered safe with an " acceptable risk without specialized monitoring".

Caffeine has been evaluated for the treatment of daytime sleepiness in PD in a high‐quality, negative study. 15 There were some significant effects for caffeine when compared with placebo, and as such the efficacy conclusion is " insufficient evidence " and the practice implication " investigational". Given its wide availability and over‐the‐counter use in many countries, caffeine can be used with an " acceptable risk without specialized monitoring".

### Diagnosis and treatment of parkinson disease: a review [^117YKEXX]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Parkinson disease is the most common form of parkinsonism, a group of neurological disorders with Parkinson disease-like movement problems such as rigidity, slowness, and tremor. More than 6 million individuals worldwide have Parkinson disease.

Observations

Diagnosis of Parkinson disease is based on history and examination. History can include prodromal features (eg, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, constipation), characteristic movement difficulty (eg, tremor, stiffness, slowness), and psychological or cognitive problems (eg, cognitive decline, depression, anxiety). Examination typically demonstrates bradykinesia with tremor, rigidity, or both. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography can improve the accuracy of diagnosis when the presence of parkinsonism is uncertain. Parkinson disease has multiple disease variants with different prognoses. Individuals with a diffuse malignant subtype (9%-16% of individuals with Parkinson disease) have prominent early motor and nonmotor symptoms, poor response to medication, and faster disease progression. Individuals with mild motor-predominant Parkinson disease (49%-53% of individuals with Parkinson disease) have mild symptoms, a good response to dopaminergic medications (eg, carbidopa-levodopa, dopamine agonists), and slower disease progression. Other individuals have an intermediate subtype. For all patients with Parkinson disease, treatment is symptomatic, focused on improvement in motor (eg, tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and nonmotor (eg, constipation, cognition, mood, sleep) signs and symptoms. No disease-modifying pharmacologic treatments are available. Dopamine-based therapies typically help initial motor symptoms. Nonmotor symptoms require nondopaminergic approaches (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for psychiatric symptoms, cholinesterase inhibitors for cognition). Rehabilitative therapy and exercise complement pharmacologic treatments. Individuals experiencing complications, such as worsening symptoms and functional impairment when a medication dose wears off ("off periods"), medication-resistant tremor, and dyskinesias, benefit from advanced treatments such as therapy with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension or deep brain stimulation. Palliative care is part of Parkinson disease management.

Conclusions and Relevance

Parkinson disease is a heterogeneous disease with rapidly and slowly progressive forms. Treatment involves pharmacologic approaches (typically with levodopa preparations prescribed with or without other medications) and nonpharmacologic approaches (such as exercise and physical, occupational, and speech therapies). Approaches such as deep brain stimulation and treatment with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension can help individuals with medication-resistant tremor, worsening symptoms when the medication wears off, and dyskinesias.

### Sleep issues in Parkinson's disease and their management [^112CXgGu]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is an alpha-synucleinopathy that leads to prominent motor symptoms including tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Nonmotor symptoms including autonomic, neurocognitive, psychiatric symptoms, and sleep disturbances are also seen frequently in PD. The impact of PD on sleep is related to motor and nonmotor symptoms, in addition to the disruption of the pathways regulating sleep by central nervous system pathology. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is a parasomnia that can lead to self-injury and/or injury to partners at night. Restless legs syndrome is a subjective sensation of discomfort and urge to move the legs prior to falling asleep and can lead to insomnia and reduced sleep quality. Excessive daytime sleepiness is common in PD and exerts a negative impact on quality of life in addition to increasing the risk of falls. Obstructive sleep apnea is a breathing disorder during sleep that can cause frequent awakenings and excessive daytime sleepiness. Circadian rhythm dysfunction can lead to an advanced or delayed onset of sleep in patients and create disruption of normal sleep and wake times. All of these disorders are common in PD and can significantly reduce sleep quantity, sleep quality, or quality of life for patients and caretakers. Treatment approaches for each of these disorders are distinct and should be individualized to the patient. We review the literature regarding these common sleep issues encountered in PD and their treatment options.

### Rotigotine effects on early morning motor function and sleep in Parkinson's disease: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (RECOVER) [^115qgufs]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbance; nocturnal limb restlessness; cramps, pain, and immobility; and impairment of early morning motor function, mood, and health-related quality of life are common and important nocturnal, early-morning, and daytime problems for PD patients. This study demonstrated significant treatment benefits with rotigotine on each of these outcomes. Indeed, this study is the first to confirm improvements in sleep-related PD problems with a dopaminergic treatment in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial using a patient-reported outcome as a coprimary outcome measure. Moreover, it has demonstrated the clinical benefits of continuous rotigotine delivery, as efficacy was maintained throughout the night and into the next morning, significantly improving the start of the new day, one of the most troubling times for PD patients. However, whether the effects of rotigotine on the nonmotor symptoms of PD are the result of its effects on motor symptoms, or whether there are additional effects of rotigotine which affect nonmotor qualities such as sleep fragmentation, dreaming, respiration and mood, which are unrelated to an improved motor condition, is still unclear and further objective study of sleep outcomes in PD patients may be warranted.

### Update on treatments for nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease-an evidence-based medicine review [^116yJFyZ]. Movement Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update evidence-based medicine recommendations for treating nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Background

The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Evidence-Based Medicine Committee's recommendations for treatments of PD were first published in 2002, updated in 2011, and now updated again through December 31, 2016.

Methods

Level I studies testing pharmacological, surgical, or nonpharmacological interventions for the treatment of nonmotor symptoms in PD were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion and quality scoring were as previously reported. The disorders covered were a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, disorders of sleep and wakefulness, pain, fatigue, impaired olfaction, and ophthalmologic dysfunction. Clinical efficacy, implications for clinical practice, and safety conclusions are reported.

Results

A total of 37 new studies qualified for review. There were no randomized controlled trials that met inclusion criteria for the treatment of anxiety disorders, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, excessive sweating, impaired olfaction, or ophthalmologic dysfunction. We identified clinically useful or possibly useful interventions for the treatment of depression, apathy, impulse control and related disorders, dementia, psychosis, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, drooling, orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysfunction, urinary dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and pain. There were no clinically useful interventions identified to treat non-dementia-level cognitive impairment.

Conclusions

The evidence base for treating a range of nonmotor symptoms in PD has grown substantially in recent years. However, treatment options overall remain limited given the high prevalence and adverse impact of these disorders, so the development and testing of new treatments for nonmotor symptoms in PD remains a top priority. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### The treatment of sleep dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders [^1128MpEu]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Sleep dysfunction is highly prevalent across the spectrum of neurodegenerative conditions and is a key determinant of quality of life for both patients and their families. Mounting recent evidence also suggests that such dysfunction exacerbates cognitive and affective clinical features of neurodegeneration, as well as disease progression through acceleration of pathogenic processes. Effective assessment and treatment of sleep dysfunction in neurodegeneration is therefore of paramount importance; yet robust therapeutic guidelines are lacking, owing in part to a historical paucity of effective treatments and trials. Here, we review the common sleep abnormalities evident in neurodegenerative disease states and evaluate the latest evidence for traditional and emerging interventions, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. Interventions considered include conservative measures, targeted treatments of specific clinical sleep pathologies, established sedating and alerting agents, melatonin, and orexin antagonists, as well as bright light therapy, behavioral measures, and slow-wave sleep augmentation techniques. We conclude by providing a suggested framework for treatment based on contemporary evidence and highlight areas that may emerge as major therapeutic advances in the near future.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^116z1MqW]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Implementation of pharmacological treatments in elderly patients with dementia states that low starting doses, small dose increases, and long intervals between dose increases are necessary, although some patients may ultimately need doses as high as would be appropriate for younger patients. Anticholinergic side effects may also lead to worsening cognitive impairment, confusion, or even delirium, orthostasis is common in elderly patients, and medications associated with central nervous system sedation may worsen cognition, increase the risk of falls, and put patients with sleep apnea at risk for additional respiratory depression; elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or dementia with Lewy bodies are especially susceptible to extrapyramidal side effects. For all these reasons, medications should be used with considerable care, and polypharmacy should be avoided whenever possible, and in nonemergency situations or when neuropsychiatric symptoms are not severe, nonpharmacological approaches should be attempted first to avoid the very significant morbidities associated with psychotropic medication use in elderly patients.

Which sleep disturbances may occur in PD?

Individuals with PD report insomnia with difficulties falling asleep and maintaining sleep, pain, involuntary movements and restlessness of limbs, worsening of motor symptoms such as nocturnal akinesia, rigidity and/or resting tremor, nocturia, nocturnal behavioral disorders, including REM-sleep behavior disorders (RBD) and non-REM parasomnias, anxiety, non-restorative sleep with fatigue and/or daytime sleepiness, and breathing disorders. The etiology of these symptoms may be classified into comorbid primary sleep disorders, motor and non-motor symptoms of PD, coexistence and influence of neuropsychiatric disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, side-effects of PD medications and the impact of neurodegeneration itself on cerebral sleep regulating centers. A bidirectional relationship between sleep disorders and disease progression has been postulated.

Comorbid primary sleep disorders

Sleep disorders listed as an independent diagnosis in the ICSD-3 (International Classification of Sleep Disorders) are considered primary sleep disorders. These entail Restless Legs Syndrom (RLS), sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and parasomnias, including RBD, which occurs in PD as well as in other α-synucleinopathies:
RLS: The overlap between nocturnal restlessness in PD, for instance in the context of wearing-off phenomena, and RLS may complicate the diagnostic differentiation. Several studies investigating the prevalence of RLS in PD came to contradictory results, whereas a meta-analysis concluded on an overall increase in RLS prevalence in PD. Due to the distinctly different pathophysiology, RLS is interpreted as a comorbidity in PD, with newly diagnosed PD individuals initially showing the same prevalence of RLS as non-PD subjects. The prevalence of RLS increases with PD progression and dopaminergic daily dosage. Whether individuals with RLS have a higher risk of developing PD is a matter of debate. A prospective longitudinal questionnaire study showed an elevated incidence of PD in individuals with severe RLS.
SDB: Obstructive and central sleep apneas with recurring oxygen desaturation lead to sleep fragmentation, nocturia, daytime sleepiness and increased cardiovascular risk. Data on the prevalence and severity of SDB in PD patients are controversial. However, a recent meta-analysis showed that PD patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) suffer more severe motor and cognitive symptoms. Although the occurrence of excessive daytime sleepiness in PD does not solely depend on the severity of SDB and the risk for a severe form of SDB does not seem to be elevated in PD patients, an individualized diagnostic work-up and therapeutic approach is recommended to minimize the risk for concomitant cardiovascular disease.

### Hypnotics and injuries among older adults with Parkinson's disease: a nested case-control design [^114rH6Vv]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2016, the number of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) worldwide was approximately 6.1 million, and the prevalence increases with age. Patients with PD experience not only motor symptoms, such as tremors and rigid muscles, but also non-motor symptoms, such as sleep disorders, including insomnia, daytime somnolence, and sleep-related movement disorders. These symptoms appear during the early stage of PD, and their frequency increases with disease progression. Clinical practice guidelines for PD in Japan suggest pharmacotherapy, phototherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with PD. However, there is currently insufficient evidence on the efficacy of any therapy.

In a previous cross-sectional study in Sweden, patients using antiparkinsonian agents had a significantly higher fall risk (odds ratio [OR]: 1.68) than patients who did not use antiparkinsonian agents when they used hypnotics. Although the results suggested that using both antiparkinsonian agents and hypnotics might increase the risk of falls, the effect of hypnotics among patients with PD was not clear. Hypnotics are classified into barbiturates, benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepines, melatonin receptor agonists, and orexin receptor antagonists. According to the 2019 Beers Criteria published by the American Geriatrics Society, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and non-benzodiazepines should not be administered to older adults. Similarly, the Guidelines for Medical Treatment and Its Safety in the Elderly 2015 published by the Japan Geriatrics Society suggest that benzodiazepines should not be administered to older adults because of potential side effects, whereas non-benzodiazepines may be administered with care in small doses, but they should not be used long-term. Guidelines also report that barbiturates have not been used in recent years. Medical fees are deducted from the standard fee by the Japanese government when multiple psychotropic drugs, including hypnotics, are prescribed or when benzodiazepines are prescribed for more than 1 year. Although there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia in patients with PD, the Movement Disorder Society suggested that eszopiclone can improve global and sleep outcomes associated with insomnia. However, eszopiclone is associated with infrequent but serious injuries, such as fractures. Therefore, the preference to prescribe this medication depends on the physician. Effectively treating sleep disorders is crucial for improving the quality of life of patients with PD and their caregivers.

Neurodegenerative alterations in sleep-regulating networks

RBD: therapeutic guidelines based on high evidence levels do not exist due to difficulties in defining adequate assessment methods. Expert consensus calls for a safe sleep environment and recommends the use of clonazepam, melatonin or rivastigmine. Adverse effects of clonazepam on balance and alertness must be considered, especially in elderly patients. An analysis of all clinical and scientific evidence on the treatment of RBD published in 2022 shows the most positive results for clonazepam (dosages used in comparative studies: 0,125–3 mg) and melatonin (dosages used in comparative studies: 2–9 mg); therefore, these substances are regarded as first choice medication.
Impairment of circadian rhythm: the pathophysiological substrate of insomnia associated with alterations of circadian rhythms provides the rationale for melatonin administration in PD. A multicentre, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study indeed demonstrated the safety and efficacy of 2 mg slow-release melatonin, if assessed by means of the PSQI, as a questionnaire non-specific for PD, the Non-Motor-Symptom Scale (NMSS) and PDQ39, while another study had negative results. Due to the favorable safety profile, the updated MDS evidence-based recommendations regards the use of melatonin as potentially useful and therefore justified for treating circadian rhythm disorders in PD. Non-pharmaceutical measures include bright light application, which showed positive effects on sleep quality and diurnal physical activity, general advice on sleep hygiene, as well as enforced physical training. A randomized controlled study showed a significant improvement of sleep quality and efficiency under intensive physical training compared to sleep hygiene measures alone.
Changes in micro- and macrostructure of sleep: after excluding other sleep disorders like RLS, SDB, nocturnal wearing-off or depression, a pharmacological treatment may be considered following current German guidelines for treating insomnia in neurological disorders. Eszopiclon (1 mg), doxepin (25 mg), zolpidem (5 mg), trazodone (50 mg), melatonin (2 mg) as well as the antipsychotic drug pimavanserin and the antidepressants venlafaxin (37,5 mg) and nortryptilin (25 mg, both to be considered in case of co-existing depression) may be tried, despite insufficient evidence. Based on a randomized controlled study in non-PD insomniacs, the antidepressant mirtazapin may be also recommended in doses of 7.5–15 mg. In any case, pharmacological treatment should be started with the lowest possible dosage. Further adjustments may be required on an individual basis and side effects should be carefully monitored at follow-up. To date, no sleep-restorative therapies are available.

### Sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease [^111CCz3j]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Comment: Nabilone demonstrated positive sleep effects in the majority of patients in this small study. Its widespread effects via the endocannabinoid system makes it challenging to determine in these individuals which symptoms (insomnia, pain, nocturia, or other) improved leading to this result. Caution is also needed in patient selection, in particular those with psychiatric disturbance or orthostatic dizziness and may limit its use in later stages of the disease.

### Sleep deprivation and risk for Parkinson's disease: evidence and therapeutic implications [^1149huWm]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra, largely driven by misfolded protein aggregation. Sleep deprivation has emerged as a significant risk factor for neurological disorders, accelerating protein misfolding and dopaminergic neuronal loss through multiple pathological pathways. In this narrative review, we synthesize current evidence linking sleep deprivation to PD. We first outline epidemiological findings that support an association between insufficient sleep and increased PD risk. Building on these mechanisms, we review potential therapeutic strategies, such as behavioral and lifestyle modifications, circadian rhythm regulation, and targeted strategies addressing specific pathological pathways. Together, these insights underscore the importance of sleep in PD prevention and highlight opportunities for developing sleep-based precision therapies.

Dopamine Agonists

Based on a low‐quality, negative study 41 with some significant benefits in the piribedil arm and the lack of further RCTs, there is " insufficient evidence" to conclude on the efficacy of piribedil for improving vigilance and cognitive performance in those experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) while being treated for PD with the oral dopamine agonists pramipexole or ropinirole and who have been switched overnight from their oral dopamine agonists to an equivalent dose of piribedil. The practice implication is " investigational". Based on a low‐quality, positive study, rotigotine is " likely efficacious " and " possibly useful " in improving sleep as it has shown to have significant effects on sleep quality and maintenance in patients with PD. 20

### Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in Parkinson's disease: a case series [^111Qz7ZL]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic insomnia is common in patients with Parkinson's disease. There are limited data to guide its treatment in this patient population, especially in regards to non-pharmacologic interventions, some of which are highly effective in the non-Parkinson's disease population. The aim of this study is to describe a series of Parkinson's disease patients who underwent cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi). Parkinson's disease patients who had undergone a baseline and at least one follow-up CBTi session were identified. Electronic medical records and pre-treatment and post-treatment patient sleep diaries were reviewed. Sleep measures of interest included wake time after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and total sleep time. Pre-treatment and post-treatment values were compared within subjects using paired t -test. Five patients were included. Patients attended an average of eight sessions of CBTi (range 5–12). Significant increases in sleep efficiency (p = 0.02) and decreases in number of awakenings per night (p = 0.02) were found. Our data provide preliminary evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment for insomnia in Parkinson's disease, and is well tolerated and well received by patients. Given the limited data supporting use of medications to treat chronic insomnia in Parkinson's disease, combined with their risks, randomized trials to demonstrate the efficacy of CBTi in Parkinson's disease are warranted.

### Recommended treatment strategies for patients with excessive daytime sleepiness [^113ohxyv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common and bothersome phenomenon. It can be associated with insufficient sleep syndrome, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, shift work disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, or Parkinson's disease. Once the underlying cause of the excessive sleepiness is determined, clinicians must select the most appropriate behavioral and pharmacologic interventions to reduce daytime sleepiness, alleviate other symptoms, improve functioning, and ensure the safety of patients and those around them. Patient history, adverse effects, and efficacy in specific conditions should be considered in pharmacologic treatment options for patients with EDS.

a As most presented studies were designed in a pragmatic fashion, the wide range of RTG dosages used might reflect different PD population groups regarding disease duration, concomitant dopaminergic therapy, side-effects or local standard clinical practice

Sleep fragmentation

No specific treatment for sleep fragmentation is currently established in clinical guidelines for PD, but some of its causes can be treated by the use of long-acting dopaminergic agents. The multinational, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled RECOVER study investigated the effects of RTG in a sample of 246 PD patients with unsatisfactory early-morning motor symptom control. Nocturnal sleep disturbance measured by PDSS-2 was assessed as a coprimary endpoint. RTG transdermal patch (n = 191; 2–16 mg/24 h; mean age 64.8 ± 9.3 years, 64% male) compared to placebo (n = 96; mean age 64.4 ± 10.6 years; 64% male) significantly improved motor function, early morning akinesia, and nocturnal sleep disturbances in patients with PD (PDSS-2 treatment difference −4.26 [95% CI −6.08, −2.45]; p < 0.0001). Moreover, the reported beneficial effects of RTG patch have been shown to be sustained in a 1 year open label extension of that study as shown in Fig. 1. However, regarding individual items of the PDSS-2, specifically individual item 3 ('Did you have difficulty staying asleep?'), no significant improvement was observed in the original RECOVER study. Whereas patients receiving RTG or placebo showed no significant differences in PDSS-2 total score at baseline, it is not clear whether patients with sleep maintenance problems were well-balanced between treatment arms. Considering the limitations of the study and the importance of specifically assessing whether RTG could be effective for improving sleep fragmentation, posterior studies were performed including patients with self-reported complaints of recurrent nocturnal awakenings.

### Movement disorders: a sleep specialist's perspective [^114UzWXK]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

This review focuses on restless legs syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). These conditions are frequently encountered in clinical sleep medicine and are among the most important of the "nonapnea" sleep disorders. RLS and PD share many features, including derangement of central dopaminergic systems as the putative cause, akathisia, and nocturnal motor fluctuations. In addition, both conditions increase in prevalence with aging, exhibit a beneficial response to dopaminergic therapy, and cause marked sleep disturbances. They frequently overlap, with about 20% of patients with PD having symptoms of RLS. Both conditions appear to have a genetic predisposition that is "turned on" by environmental factors. Adverse responses to levodopa occur in both RLS and PD, manifested as rebound and augmentation in RLS and as fluctuations in motor response and dyskinesias in PD. Newer dopaminergic agents are helpful in the management of both conditions.

### Sodium oxybate for excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep disturbance in parkinson disease: a randomized clinical trial [^112L3Dqh]. JAMA Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Sleep-wake disorders are a common and debilitating nonmotor manifestation of Parkinson disease (PD), but treatment options are scarce.

Objective

To determine whether nocturnal administration of sodium oxybate, a first-line treatment in narcolepsy, is effective and safe for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and disturbed nighttime sleep in patients with PD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover phase 2a study carried out between January 9, 2015, and February 24, 2017. In a single-center study in the sleep laboratory at the University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, 18 patients with PD and EDS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score > 10) were screened in the sleep laboratory. Five patients were excluded owing to the polysomnographic diagnosis of sleep apnea and 1 patient withdrew consent. Thus, 12 patients were randomized to a treatment sequence (sodium oxybate followed by placebo or placebo followed by sodium oxybate, ratio 1:1) and, after dropout of 1 patient owing to an unrelated adverse event during the washout period, 11 patients completed the study. Two patients developed obstructive sleep apnea during sodium oxybate treatment (1 was the dropout) and were excluded from the per-protocol analysis (n = 10) but included in the intention-to-treat analysis (n = 12).

Interventions

Nocturnal sodium oxybate and placebo taken at bedtime and 2.5 to 4.0 hours later with an individually titrated dose between 3.0 and 9.0 g per night for 6 weeks with a 2- to 4-week washout period interposed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome measure was change of objective EDS as electrophysiologically measured by mean sleep latency in the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Secondary outcome measures included change of subjective EDS (ESS), sleep quality (Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale-2), and objective variables of nighttime sleep (polysomnography).

Results

Among 12 patients in the intention-to-treat population (10 men, 2 women; mean [SD] age, 62 [11.1] years; disease duration, 8.4 [4.6] years), sodium oxybate substantially improved EDS as measured objectively (mean sleep latency, +2.9 minutes; 95% CI, 2.1 to 3.8 minutes; p = 0.002) and subjectively (ESS score, -4.2 points; 95% CI, -5.3 to -3.0 points; p = 0.001). Thereby, 8 (67%) patients exhibited an electrophysiologically defined positive treatment response. Moreover, sodium oxybate significantly enhanced subjective sleep quality and objectively measured slow-wave sleep duration (+72.7 minutes; 95% CI, 55.7 to 89.7 minutes; P < .001). Differences were more pronounced in the per-protocol analysis. Sodium oxybate was generally well tolerated under dose adjustments (no treatment-related dropouts), but it induced de novo obstructive sleep apnea in 2 patients and parasomnia in 1 patient, as detected by polysomnography, all of whom did not benefit from sodium oxybate treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study provides class I evidence for the efficacy of sodium oxybate in treating EDS and nocturnal sleep disturbance in patients with PD. Special monitoring with follow-up polysomnography is necessary to rule out treatment-related complications and larger follow-up trials with longer treatment durations are warranted for validation.

### Canadian guideline for parkinson disease [^116SEt1h]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for insomnia, more specifically with respect to patients with Parkinson's disease (management), CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend to advise good sleep hygiene in patients with Parkinson's disease with any sleep disturbance, including:

- avoiding stimulants (such as coffee, tea, caffeine) in the evening

- establishing a regular pattern of sleep

- ensuring comfortable bedding and temperature

- using assistive devices, such as a bed lever or rails, to aid with moving and turning, allowing the person to get more comfortable

- restricting napping in the late afternoon and early evening

- advising regular and appropriate exercising to induce better sleep

- avoiding remaining in bed for long periods of time, if unable to sleep.

### Melatonin for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease: a randomised controlled trial [^115wsSvZ]. Movement Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) causes a loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep, leading to dream enactment behaviors that are frequently injurious to patients and their partners. 1 Its prevalence in adults is around 1%, 1 compared to 20% to 50% of people with Parkinson's disease (PD). 2, 3

Treatment includes clonazepam or melatonin. 3, 4 Clonazepam is a long‐acting benzodiazepine linked to adverse outcomes, 3, 4 whereas its efficacy for reducing RBD in PD was recently challenged. 5 Melatonin has a safer profile with milder side effects, such as headache and morning sleepiness. 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 Melatonin has a 30‐ to 50‐minute elimination half‐life. 10 A prolonged‐release (PR) formulation has thus been recommended for RBD, given that most REM sleep occurs later in the night. 11

However, current guidelines are based on mainly case series and small open‐label studies. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Only one previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessed the efficacy of 3 mg of melatonin in just 8 subjects with mixed neurological disorders, showing a modest improvement on the clinical global impression (CGI) and REM epochs without atonia. 8 However, another small RCT recently showed that 2 (n = 7) or 6 mg (n = 9) of PR melatonin did not improve CGI versus placebo (n = 9) in subjects with clinically isolated RBD. 17 No RCT has been conducted for RBD in PD. Moreover, there is need of an RBD‐specific outcome that is free from subjective interpretation by study assessors. 4

We set out to assess the efficacy of 4 mg of PR melatonin on RBD severity using patient‐reported diary entries. We hypothesized that melatonin would reduce RBD compared to placebo.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114GPqEA]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pramipexole for isolated RBD — role, uncertainties, and dosing: Pramipexole is a dopaminergic agonist typically used to treat the motor symptoms of PD, RLS, and periodic limb movement disorder. Its mechanism of efficacy in RBD is uncertain because RBD is not caused by dopaminergic dysfunction. Note that patients with RBD who respond to pramipexole often have increased periodic limb movements on PSG; thus, it is possible that pramipexole helps reduce ancillary motor activity. Conversely, pramipexole may reduce dream enactment by treating an underlying sleep-fragmenting condition, periodic limb movement disorder. Dosing typically starts at 0.125 mg administered orally at bedtime and can be increased, slowly, to 2.0 mg nightly.

### Sudden uncontrollable somnolence and medication use in parkinson disease… [^115V7r5a]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

, Research Triangle Park, NC), and pergolide are synthetic D2-selective DAs often used as primary initial therapy for PD as well as in combination with levodopa. 2–4 While these agents have been well received by patients with PD and their physicians, case reports of the sudden onset of somnolence have caused concern among physicians, patients, and regulators. Particular attention has focused on events in which patients fell asleep while driving. Amantadine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors were also commonly used. The most frequent regimen was levodopa plus a DA plus a third class of antiparkinsonian medication, followed by levodopa plus a DA and levodopa alone. We then performed an aggregated analysis in which we studied the effect of receiving any DA compared with that of receiving any other antiparkinsonian drugs without DAs.

After controlling for all available patient characteristics, this analysis yielded an adjusted OR of 2. 75 for the use of any DA. Additional control for Hoehn and Yahr staging changed these results by less than 5%. When we considered only severe events as the study outcome, there were slightly stronger effects for pramipexole and ropinirole.), ropinirole, and pergolide.

Each participant in this study will be wearing a wrist actigrapch and fill out the sleep diary. Three main treatment strategies will be tested: Placebo Light therapy, Cognitive behavioural therapy and active light therapy, and insomnia medications. The treatment that each person will receive first will be chosen randomly. If the first therapy has not been effective, participant may choose to re-enrol in the trial with one of the remaining two therapies. There are now a variety of treatments that can help to manage insomnia, including non-pharmacological and pharmacologic measures. Although many of these strategies have been proven to be effective in the general population very few studies have been conducted with Parkinson's Disease patients.

Insomnia in PD has unique characteristics and pathophysiology; therefore, measures to treat insomnia in the general population may be ineffective in PD.
- Insomnia medications
- In this portion patient will receive medications to help them sleep. Depending on the type of patient's sleep problem, this will either be a medication called desipramine, or zopiclone. Both of these medications are currently used for insomnia in people without Parkinson's. These medications will be prescribed exactly as any other medical prescription, and participant will take them as any other medical prescription. Device: Light box Behavioral: CBT and sleep hygiene Drug: Doxepin and Zopiclone Device: Light box

- Dementia, defined according to PD dementia criteria as MMSE < 26/30 and ADL impairment secondary to cognitive loss, or inability to understand consent process.
- Change to dopaminergic therapy over the preceding three months.
- Patients with very severe PD, defined as Hoehn and Yahr of 5. Provision of sleep hygiene measures, etiology of insomnia, and potential confounds in interpretation of actigraphy in immobile patients is problematic in very advanced stages of PD.
