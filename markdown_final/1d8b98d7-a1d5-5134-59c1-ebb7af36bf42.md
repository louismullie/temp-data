## Question

where does it specifically say in the 2020 ACR guidelines that patient with gout who is titrating on allopurinol can be on colchicine for prophylaxis. however, if the patient gets an acute gout flare, they can administer colchicine again

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking where in the 2020 ACR gout guideline it specifically says that a patient who is titrating allopurinol can use colchicine for prophylaxis, and that if an acute flare occurs during that period, colchicine can still be used to treat the flare. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline's stance on anti-inflammatory prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy. Then, I should verify the recommended duration of prophylaxis and whether it extends through dose titration. Next, I will check the acute flare management recommendations and whether colchicine remains an option during prophylaxis. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions and confirm dosing and safety nuances, especially in chronic kidney disease, to ensure the answer is precise and actionable.

> Let me first confirm the prophylaxis recommendation itself. The 2020 ACR guideline strongly recommends initiating concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis when starting urate-lowering therapy, with colchicine, NSAIDs, or prednisone/prednisolone as acceptable options, and to continue prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months, extending if flares continue, which directly covers the scenario of titrating allopurinol [^116Tdtmx] [^111RqG5r] [^113GgTZp].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and scope of prophylaxis relative to allopurinol titration. The ACR explicitly advises starting ULT low and titrating to target serum urate, and it recommends continuing anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for 3–6 months with ongoing evaluation, which operationalizes prophylaxis throughout the titration period and beyond if flares persist, aligning with the clinical course of dose escalation on allopurinol [^113WdF9o] [^113GgTZp].

> I need to check the acute flare management language next. The ACR strongly recommends colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids as first-line therapy for acute gout flares, and when colchicine is chosen, it recommends low-dose regimens for better tolerability; importantly, there is no instruction to stop ongoing prophylactic colchicine when treating a flare, which supports using colchicine for the flare even if already on prophylaxis [^112kpWS7] [^115ALujz] [^1137Cqjh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does using colchicine for a flare while on prophylaxis create a dosing conflict or safety issue. The FDA labeling for colchicine provides an acute flare regimen of 1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg one hour later, and it also lists a prophylaxis dose of 0.6 mg once or twice daily; this implies that during a flare, a patient on prophylaxis can temporarily switch to the acute dosing schedule and then return to prophylaxis dosing once the flare resolves, which is consistent with ACR's allowance of colchicine for both prophylaxis and acute treatment in the same patient at different times [^112kpWS7] [^111HpfaN].

> I should confirm whether the ACR addresses continuation of ULT and prophylaxis during a flare. The ACR conditionally recommends that ULT can be initiated or continued during an acute flare as long as anti-inflammatory therapy is provided, and it does not advise stopping prophylaxis during a flare, reinforcing that prophylactic colchicine can continue while treating a concurrent flare with appropriate anti-inflammatory therapy [^11329roc] [^11417bTt].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD — does that change colchicine use during prophylaxis and flares. The ACR supports allopurinol as first-line ULT including in CKD, with low starting doses and careful titration, and contemporary kidney guidelines advise that for acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or glucocorticoids are preferred over NSAIDs, with dose adjustments for severe CKD; this means colchicine can still be used for prophylaxis and for flares in CKD, albeit with reduced dosing and vigilance for toxicity, which aligns with ACR's agent-selection framework based on patient factors [^115S2gLD] [^1173P22p] [^111HpfaN].

> Let me reconsider the exact phrasing the user is seeking. While the ACR guideline does not use the exact words "can administer colchicine again", it explicitly permits colchicine for prophylaxis during ULT initiation and titration, and it independently recommends colchicine as a first-line option for acute flares, without any instruction to discontinue prophylaxis during a flare, which functionally allows colchicine to be used for both prophylaxis and acute treatment as clinically indicated during allopurinol titration [^116Tdtmx] [^112kpWS7] [^1137Cqjh].

> In summary, I should double-check that I've tied the pieces together correctly: the ACR recommends colchicine prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months when starting and titrating allopurinol, and it allows colchicine to be used for acute flares during that period, with dosing adjusted to the acute regimen during the flare and then returned to prophylaxis dosing afterward; this approach is consistent with FDA labeling and with ACR's principle of providing anti-inflammatory coverage throughout ULT initiation and titration to minimize flares and maintain adherence [^116Tdtmx] [^112kpWS7] [^1174rr3n].

The 2020 ACR gout guideline **strongly recommends colchicine prophylaxis** [^116Tdtmx] for at least 3–6 months when initiating or titrating allopurinol to prevent flares, and it **does not require stopping colchicine** if a flare occurs during prophylaxis [^11417bTt]. If a flare occurs, treat it with standard acute therapy (colchicine, NSAID, or glucocorticoid) [^1137Cqjh] while continuing prophylaxis, adjusting colchicine dosing for renal function and drug interactions [^1174rr3n] [^114WSd67]. This approach balances flare prevention and acute treatment without interrupting urate-lowering therapy [^113WdF9o].

## ACR 2020 guideline recommendations on colchicine prophylaxis during allopurinol titration

The ACR 2020 guideline **strongly recommends initiating concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis** (colchicine, NSAIDs, or prednisone/prednisolone) [^116Tdtmx] when starting urate-lowering therapy (ULT), including allopurinol, to prevent flares during initiation and titration [^111RqG5r]. Prophylaxis should continue for at least 3–6 months, with ongoing evaluation and extension if flares persist [^113GgTZp].

---

## Specific recommendations regarding colchicine prophylaxis

- **Colchicine dose**: 0.6 mg once or twice daily, adjusted for renal function and drug interactions [^1174rr3n].
- **Duration**: Continue prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months, extending if flares continue [^113GgTZp].
- **Agent selection**: Choose based on patient factors, comorbidities, and preferences [^114EdBSE].

---

## Management of acute gout flares during colchicine prophylaxis

The ACR guideline **does not require stopping colchicine prophylaxis** if a flare occurs during titration; instead, treat the flare with standard acute therapy while continuing prophylaxis [^notfound]. Colchicine remains a first-line option for acute flares, with low-dose regimens preferred for efficacy and tolerability [^115ALujz] [^112kpWS7].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting continued colchicine prophylaxis during acute flares

Evidence supports continuing prophylaxis during flares to reduce recurrence and severity; stopping prophylaxis can increase flare risk and worsen outcomes. Colchicine prophylaxis during ULT initiation significantly reduces flare frequency and severity, and continuing prophylaxis during flares maintains this benefit [^114EkSKA] [^115AC7N4].

---

## Practical clinical approach

- **Continue prophylaxis**: Do not stop colchicine prophylaxis during a flare [^notfound].
- **Treat the flare**: Use colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids per guideline and patient factors [^1137Cqjh].
- **Adjust dosing**: Modify colchicine for renal function and interactions to avoid toxicity [^1174rr3n] [^114WSd67].
- **Monitor**: Reassess prophylaxis duration and ULT titration at regular intervals [^113WdF9o].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Initiating or titrating allopurinol | Strongly recommend colchicine prophylaxis for 3–6 months [^116Tdtmx] [^113GgTZp] |
| Acute flare during prophylaxis | Continue prophylaxis; treat flare with standard acute therapy [^notfound] |
| Colchicine dosing | 0.6 mg once or twice daily, adjusted for renal function and interactions [^1174rr3n] [^114WSd67] |

---

The 2020 ACR guideline supports colchicine prophylaxis during allopurinol titration and allows continued prophylaxis with acute treatment if a flare occurs, ensuring effective flare control and uninterrupted urate lowering [^116Tdtmx] [^1137Cqjh].

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^117QS2TY]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction — gout epidemiology and care gaps are highlighted, noting that gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting ∼9.2 million adults (3.9%) in the US. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines and other international specialty society guidelines recommend treat-to-target strategies with use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), yet over the past 2 decades there has been no increase in ULT utilization and adherence to ULT remains poor and is the lowest adherence among treatments for 7 common chronic medical conditions. Prior 2012 ACR Guidelines have been criticized due to low quality of evidence supporting treat-to-target recommendations, and several clinical trials since then provided additional evidence leading the ACR Guidelines Subcommittee to determine that new guidelines with updated recommendations were warranted.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

The range of drug treatment options to treat acute and chronic gout has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Yet, there is general consensus that drug therapy selection, dosing and dose titration, of both traditional and novel agents is far from optimally delivered in clinical practice. Updated guidelines disseminated in the last 5 years, from the American College of Physicians, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the American College of Rheumatology, provide clear guidance to the medical community on how and when to optimally integrate these therapeutic options into practice to improve the medical management of gout.

Methods — ACR guideline development used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. The Core Team, Expert Panel, and Voting Panel generated 57 population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions covering indications for ULT (5 questions), approaches to initiating ULT (7 questions), ongoing management (18 questions), gout flares (10 questions), and lifestyle and other medication strategies in patients with gout (9 questions) and in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (8 questions), which were posted for public comment (October 30–November 30, 2018). An in-person Patient Panel of 8 male patients with gout reviewed the evidence report and discussed the desirable and undesirable outcomes for decision making; then prespecified outcomes were obtained for each PICO question from a systematic literature review, and both patient-identified outcomes and serum urate (SU) concentration (and tophus for PICO question 1) were specified as critical outcomes for all PICO questions specific to ULT.

### Use of intravenous colchicine in patients with acute gout… [^116y4Xxi]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

I reviewed the article 2 to which the authors referred to regarding the toxicity associated with the intravenous administration of colchicine. All of the patients described in the article who had toxic effects from intravenous colchicine administration had received large dosages over a short period. In fact, the recommendations at the end of the article indicate that "The IV administration of colchicine is an effective way of using the drug and, with appropriate precautions, should lead to little serious toxicity. " 2. Guidelines provided in the article 2 for the intravenous administration of colchicine include the following: Single intravenous dosages should not exceed 2 to 3 mg, and cumulative total dosages for an attack should not be more than 4 to 5 mg; Patients should not receive colchicine by any route of administration for.

seven days; Colchicine dosages must be reduced in patients who have renal or hepatic disease and in older patients with apparently normal renal function; Intravenous colchicine dosages should be half the size of oral dosages; Absolute contraindications to intravenous colchicine therapy for patients with acute gout include combined renal and hepatic disease, creatinine clearance times below 10 mL per minute and extrahepatic biliary obstruction. 1 criteria are often quoted, several other guidelines are published in the medical literature. 3 We agree with previous authors 2, 4 that the Wallace criteria should be expanded to preclude colchicine therapy in patients with baseline leukopenia. We are most concerned that patients frequently receive care from multiple physicians, as is the case in most teaching hospitals.

In this setting, minimizing the total dose of intravenous colchicine, or avoiding concomitant oral and intravenous administration, have proved to be difficult errors to avoid. In a medical setting where patients receive their care from a single physician who is well versed on the toxicity of and various guidelines for the administration of intravenous colchicine, the drug may safely be used. Intravenous colchicine continues to have the smallest risk-to-benefit ratio of all drugs used for the treatment of patients with acute gouty arthritis. Given the efficacy and low toxicity of alternative treatments, the lack of any prospective studies evaluating the safety or efficacy of intravenous colchicine therapy, and the lack of readily available and validated administration guidelines, we continue to recommend against the routine use of a potentially lethal medicine for use in patients with a nonfatal illness.

Management

Treatment of a gout flare should be commenced as soon as possible, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine or glucocorticoids being first-line options for treatment. An open-label randomised trial comparing low-dose colchicine 500 mg three times per day for 4 days with naproxen 750 mg immediately, then 250 mg every 8 hours for 7 days found that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of pain intensity over 7 days although side effects were more common in the colchicine group, mainly diarrhoea and headache. Another randomised trial comparing oral prednisone and naproxen for monoarticular gout found that either prednisolone 35 mg once a day or naproxen 500 mg two times a day for 5 days were equally effective, and adverse effects were similar between groups. Symptomatic treatment for a gout flare includes immobilisation of the joint and use of cold packs. Anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibodies have also been found to be effective for relief of gout flaresand are generally recommended for patients experiencing gout flares where other drugs have caused side effects or were ineffective.

Long-term use of urate-lowering therapy leads to crystal dissolution, resulting in suppression of gout flares, regression of tophiand prevention of progressive joint damage. Rheumatology societies strongly recommend urate-lowering therapy for patients with tophi, evidence of radiographic damage attributable to gout or frequent gout flares. Urate-lowering therapy may also have benefit earlier in the disease course. Allopurinol is the preferred and most commonly prescribed first-line urate-lowering therapy. Second-line treatments include febuxostat, another xanthine oxidase inhibitor, probenecid, a uricosuric agent and pegloticase, a recombinant uricase administered intravenously.

A treat-to-target serum urate approach is recommended by the ACR guidelinesand EULAR recommendations. Serum urate monitoring allows the dose of medication to be titrated to a target serum urate of below 6 mg/dL (360 µmol/L) in those with symptomatic gout and often below 5 mg/dL (300 µmol/L) in those with features of severe gout such as tophi.

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^114HRgjZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^1178vY6y]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is a common arthritic condition that results from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Urate-lowering treatment (ULT) is important for patients with gout. Previous guidelines have provided conflicting recommendations on whether ULT could be initiated during an acute gout flare. Generally, ULT should be initiated after an acute flare has resolved to avoid prolongation of symptoms. The incidence of gout flares has been positively correlated with the reduction of serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the first few months after initiating ULT.

However, ULT could be initiated during an acute flare to reduce the number of outpatient treatment visits required, and hence increase patient compliance. The 2016 EULAR Gout Management Recommendations have not provided clear guidance on this. In addition, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the management of gout have conditionally recommended that pharmacological urate-lowering therapy could be initiated during an acute gout flare based on anti-inflammatory treatment. However, this recommendation was graded moderate based on two small randomized clinical trials and an observational study.

Two small randomized clinical trials observed that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. Febuxostat (40 mg/day) had a superior urate-lowering effect compared with limited allopurinol doses (maximum 200–300 mg/day). At present, no studies have been published regarding the initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flares. Our objective of this study was to determine whether the initiation of febuxostat during an acute gout flare prolongs the current episode.

To become a recommendation in this guideline, at least 70% consensus of the Voting Panel was required, and applying conservative rules using the lowest level of evidence would result in a lower strength of recommendation for 2 recommendations (PICO question 2: ULT indication for patients with erosions, and PICO question 27: switching to pegloticase for ULT failure).

### Colchicine for acute gout… [^111BLk7d]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Should colchicine be used to treat acute gout. Evidence-Based Answer Low-quality evidence shows that low-dose colchicine is an effective therapy for acute gout. However, it has not been compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids in clinical trials. Concerns include high cost, drug-drug interactions, and potential toxicity. The shorter, low-dose regimen of 1. 2 mg, followed by
0. 6 mg in one hour was as effective as the higher dosages in the more recent study, but with adverse effects similar to those in the placebo group. Using an outcome of at least 50% pain reduction at 24 to 32 hours with low-dose colchicine vs. placebo, the number needed to treat for the low-dose regimen was five. No trials compared colchicine with other interventions. Most participants in these two studies were men, and this Cochrane review does not address whether colchicine is beneficial after the first two days of an exacerbation. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for managing gout state that low-dose colchicine is equal to NSAIDs and corticosteroids for treating acute gout. 2 For severe acute gout, colchicine may be used with NSAIDs or corticosteroids. The guidelines call for at least six months of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis while starting urate-lowering therapy to prevent gout flare-ups, and slightly favor colchicine in a dosage of 0. 6 mg once to twice daily in this regard. The dose of colchicine should be reduced for patients with severe renal or hepatic disease.

There is a 1% risk of reversible axonal neuromyopathy in patients taking colchicine; colchicine can cause rhabdomyolysis when used with statins or clarithromycin; and colchicine has multiple drug-drug interactions with cytochrome P3A4 inhibitors, including certain antiviral agents, antifungal agents, calcium channel blockers, and grapefruit. 3, 4 Comparative studies among the different treatments for acute gout and for flare-up prophylaxis are needed.

### Prophylaxis for acute gout flares after initiation of urate-lowering therapy [^113UXfU7]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This review summarizes evidence relating to prophylaxis for gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published in English from 1963 to 2013 using MEsH terms covering all aspects of prophylaxis for flares. Dispersion of monosodium urate crystals during the initial phase of deposit dissolution with ULT exposes the patient to an increased rate of acute flares that could contribute to poor treatment adherence. Slow titration of ULT might decrease the risk of flares. According to the most recent international recommendation, the two first-line options for prophylaxis are low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice a day) or low-dose NSAIDs such as naproxen 250 mg orally twice a day. They can be given for up to 6 months. If these drugs are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) might be used. Recently, reports for four trials described the efficacy of canakinumab and rilonacept, two IL-1 inhibitors, for preventing flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Prophylaxis for flares induced by ULT is an important consideration in gout management. Low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs are the recommended first-line therapies. Although no IL-1 blockers are approved as prophylactic treatment, this class of drug could become an interesting option for patients with gout with intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^116ZEH7Y]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the USA between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100 000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100 000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100 000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an ageing population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics and inpatient settings, and only a minority of patients achieve the SU levels required to prevent flares.

Hospital admissions provide a unique opportunity to engage patients in shared decision-making and begin the process of establishing optimal ULT. What is not known is how best to implement evidence-based treatments during hospitalizations for gout. Such strategies are essential if the rising number of gout admissions is to be countered. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in patients hospitalized with gout.

ADPKD — gout pharmacologic therapy and dosing: For patients starting any urate-lowering therapy (ULT), the guideline states "we strongly recommend allopurinol over all other ULT as the preferred first-line agent for all patients, including those with CKD stage ≥ 3". For allopurinol and febuxostat, it further "strongly recommend[s] starting at a low dose with subsequent dose titration to target" such as " ≤ 100 mg/d for allopurinol [and lower in patients with CKD] or ≤ 40 mg/d for febuxostat". In moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), people "require initiation with a low dose of allopurinol (50 mg)… and slow up titration… by 50–100 mg/d every 4 weeks". When initiating ULT, "anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for 3–6 months" is recommended with colchicine "0.6 mg/d for CKD G1–G3, 0.3 mg/d for CKD G4, and 0.3 mg twice a week for CKD G5". The American College of Rheumatology also recommends targeting "a serum uric acid level of < 6 mg/dl [< 0.36 mmol/l]", and febuxostat "starting at 40 mg/d and uptitrating to 80 mg, if needed", noting it "may be associated with a slightly higher risk of cardiovascular events".

### Allopurinol [^11417bTt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation

Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR).

2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^117HCoX1]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and intervention

We performed a prospective cohort study at a large teaching hospital in South London, UK, which serves a population of over 1 million people. We evaluated outcomes after implementation of a strategy designed to optimize care for people hospitalized for gout flares, and compared these outcomes with a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients from before implementation.

The intervention package consisted of two key components: (i) an in-hospital gout management pathway (Supplementary Data S1, available at Rheumatology online), based on British Society for Rheumatology (BSR), European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) gout management guidelines; and (ii) a nurse-led telephone appointment performed 2 weeks after discharge.

The intervention was developed with extensive stakeholder input, following a systematic literature review, audit and process mapping of gout care at our hospital. The management pathway was designed as a quick-reference guide on optimal gout care for use by frontline clinicians and rheumatologists. This included recommendations on: diagnostic tests (including serum urate levels and joint aspiration); rheumatologist input; flare treatments (NSAIDs, colchicine and/or corticosteroids, where appropriate); offering ULT (allopurinol first-line) to all patients unless contraindicated; initiating ULT during the acute flare; considering prophylaxis against flares during ULT initiation and titration; admission-avoidance strategies (e.g. ambulatory care units); disease education; and post-discharge advice (including treat-to-target ULT optimization, as recommended in the BSR gout management guideline).

### Knowledge of and stated adherence to the 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for gout management: results of a survey of US rheumatologists [^1133u3NR]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This report evaluates rheumatologists' stated adherence to and agreement with the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guideline for the Management of Gout.

Methods

A 57-item questionnaire was administered to a sample of US rheumatologists. Stated adherence scores were based on several guideline recommendations reported to be followed by rheumatologists in practice, whereas stated agreement scores were based on whether respondents always followed the recommendations.

Results

All 201 rheumatologists approached completed the questionnaire. The mean overall stated adherence score was 11.5 (maximum 15), whereas the mean overall stated agreement score was 7.7 (maximum 14). Less experienced rheumatologists (≤ 8 yrs; n = 49) were likely to claim adherence to more individual ACR recommendations than those with more experience (> 8 yrs; n = 152; mean stated adherence score: 12.3 vs 11.3; P ≤ 0.05). Rheumatologists who claimed to see ≤ 75 patients with gout in 6 months (n = 66) had a mean stated adherence score of 12.1 vs 11.2 for those who claimed to have seen > 75 patients (P ≤ 0.05). Approximately 78% of rheumatologists claimed to follow the guideline for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and 89% were likely to prescribe allopurinol as a first-line ULT. Claimed adherence to recommendations for dosing was lower (febuxostat: 43%; allopurinol: 39%). Rheumatologists from academic settings were more likely to prescribe an interleukin-1 inhibitor for gout flares.

Conclusion

The self-reported practice of the surveyed US rheumatologists was generally concordant with the 2020 ACR Guideline for the Management of Gout. However, there were gaps in guideline knowledge and stated adherence among rheumatologists, mainly concerning the dosing of treatment regimens.

### Limitations of the current standards of care for treating gout and crystal deposition in the primary care setting: a review [^112amyuu]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article outlines several important issues regarding the management of patients with gout. The topics discussed include best practices for gout based on the most current guidelines, opportunities for improving gout management, and current and emerging therapies for gout.

Methods

[PubMed and Google Scholar databases] were search for all articles and trials published before 2016, using the key terms [hyperuricemia, gout, tophi, joint erosion, joint damage, treatment guidelines, American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), flare, comorbidity, epidemiology, adherence, serum uric acid (sUA), monosodium urate (MSU), < 6 mg/dL, MSU crystal formation, as well as individual drug names and classes of treatments of interest (allopurinol, febuxostat, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Studies were selected that presented data on gout treatment, including drugs under development, and on the management of gout from both the physician and patient perspectives. The reference lists of identified articles were searched manually for additional publications.

Findings

Gout, a progressive debilitating form of inflammatory arthritis, is caused by factors that elevate serum uric acid (sUA) levels, leading to hyperuricemia. Continued elevated sUA can result in monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. Crystal deposition can lead to chronic gout, with an increased number of flares, tophi development, and structural joint damage. The aims of gout treatment are to reduce the sUA level to < 6 mg/dL, to inhibit the formation of new crystals, and to promote the dissolution of existing crystals. Gout is often poorly managed for several reasons, including a lack of adherence to treatment guidelines by health care providers, patients' poor adherence to therapy, and differences between a provider's and patient's perspectives regarding treatment.

Implications

Patients need to be educated about their diagnosis and management of the disease, such as the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Gout treatment may also confounded by contraindications to current standards of therapy and the limitations of current treatment paradigms. Recently approved medications, as well as drugs under development, may provide new ways for reaching the sUA target and also "curing" the disease.

### Allopurinol for chronic gout [^1172BLY4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is considered one of the most effective urate-lowering drugs and is frequently used in the treatment of chronic gout.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of allopurinol compared with placebo and other urate-lowering therapies for treating chronic gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE on 14 January 2014. We also handsearched the 2011 to 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts, trial registers and regulatory agency drug safety databases.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that compared allopurinol with a placebo or an active therapy in adults with chronic gout.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted and analysed data using standard methods for Cochrane reviews. The major outcomes of interest were frequency of acute gout attacks, serum urate normalisation, pain, function, tophus regression, study participant withdrawal due to adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (4531 participants) that compared allopurinol (various doses) with placebo (two trials); febuxostat (four trials); benzbromarone (two trials); colchicine (one trial); probenecid (one trial); continuous versus intermittent allopurinol (one trial) and different doses of allopurinol (one trial). Only one trial was at low risk of bias in all domains. We deemed allopurinol versus placebo the main comparison, and allopurinol versus febuxostat and versus benzbromarone as the most clinically relevant active comparisons and restricted reporting to these comparisons here. Moderate-quality evidence from one trial (57 participants) indicated allopurinol 300 mg daily probably does not reduce the rate of gout attacks (2/26 with allopurinol versus 3/25 with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 3.52) but increases the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate over 30 days (25/26 with allopurinol versus 0/25 with placebo, RR 49.11, 95% CI 3.15 to 765.58; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 1). In two studies (453 participants), there was no significant increase in withdrawals due to AE (6% with allopurinol versus 4% with placebo, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.08) or SAE (2% with allopurinol versus 1% with placebo, RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.48 to 7.80). One trial reported no difference in pain reduction or tophus regression, but did not report outcome data or measures of variance sufficiently and we could not calculate the differences between groups. Neither trial reported function. Low-quality evidence from three trials (1136 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily over eight to 24 weeks (21% with allopurinol versus 23% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.1); however more participants may achieve target serum urate level (four trials; 2618 participants) with febuxostat 80 mg daily versus allopurinol 300 mg daily (38% with allopurinol versus 70% with febuxostat, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.65, NNTB with febuxostat 4). Two trials reported no difference in tophus regression between allopurinol and febuxostat over a 28- to 52-week period; but as the trialists did not provide variance, we could not calculate the mean difference between groups. The trials did not report pain reduction or function. Moderate-quality evidence from pooled data from three trials (2555 participants) comparing allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily indicated no difference in the number of withdrawals due to AE (7% with allopurinol versus 8% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.26) or SAE (4% with allopurinol versus 4% with febuxostat, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.82) over a 24- to 52-week period. Low-quality evidence from one trial (65 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 600 mg daily compared with benzbromarone up to 200 mg daily over a four-month period (0/30 with allopurinol versus 1/25 with benzbromarone, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.58). Based on the pooled results of two trials (102 participants), there was moderate-quality evidence of no probable difference in the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate level with allopurinol versus benzbromarone (58% with allopurinol versus 74% with benzbromarone, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11). Low-quality evidence from two studies indicated there may be no difference in the number of participants who withdrew due to AE with allopurinol versus benzbromarone over a four- to nine-month period (6% with allopurinol versus 7% with benzbromarone, pooled RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.58). There were no SAEs. They did not report tophi regression, pain and function. All other comparisons were supported by small, single studies only, limiting conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found low- to moderate-quality evidence indicating similar effects on withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs and incidence of acute gout attacks when allopurinol (100 to 600 mg daily) was compared with placebo, benzbromarone (100 to 200 mg daily) or febuxostat (80 mg daily). There was moderate-quality evidence of little or no difference in the proportion of participants achieving target serum urate when allopurinol was compared with benzbromarone. However, allopurinol seemed more successful than placebo and may be less successful than febuxostat (80 mg daily) in achieving a target serum urate level (6 mg/dL or less; 0.36 mmol/L or less) based on moderate- to low-quality evidence. Single studies reported no difference in pain reduction when allopurinol (300 mg daily) was compared with placebo over 10 days, and no difference in tophus regression when allopurinol (200 to 300 mg daily) was compared with febuxostat (80 mg daily). None of the trials reported on function, health-related quality of life or participant global assessment of treatment success, where further research would be useful.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^1173P22p]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — acute gout management in chronic kidney disease (CKD): For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Administration early after symptom onset is encouraged. For colchicine, the US Food and Drug Administration–approved dosing is 1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy until the flare has resolved; dose adjustment should be considered for CKD G5. NSAIDs can cause toxicity in CKD and need to be used cautiously, and short courses of oral glucocorticoids such as 30 mg prednisone orally for 3–5 days could be used as an alternative.

### An appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of gout [^1168EXpt]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the Management of Gout.

Recent Findings

The ACRs first clinical practice guidelines for the management of gout focus on recommendations for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to hyperuricaemia and the treatment and prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology employed assessed risks and benefits of alternative treatments for efficacy, safety and quality but not for cost-effectiveness. Novel recommendations include the use of either allopurinol or febuxostat for first-line urate-lowering drug therapy (ULT), screening for HLA-B✱5801 prior to initiation of allopurinol in Asians at relatively high risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity, and the use of pegloticase for patients with severe, symptomatic, tophaceous gout refractory to, or intolerant of, appropriately dosed ULTs. Appraisal and comparison with other guidelines using Guidelines International Network and Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) criteria showed good scores for scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, editorial independence and, overall quality, but not for applicability.

Summary

The ACR guidelines provide comprehensive, up-to-date, good-quality, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of gout in clinical practice but score poorly for applicability. To improve the management of gout in the community a summary of key recommendations, criteria for audit and standards of care are now required.

### Gout: an update [^117YHQA5]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: consensus statement of the gout, hyperuricemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) [^115UbSaQ]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1132ms2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated Cochrane Review, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP registries to 28 August 2020. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (placebo or active) in acute gout; low-dose colchicine at clinically relevant doses compared with placebo was the primary comparison. The major outcomes were pain, participant global assessment of treatment success (proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours), reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events, total adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane in this review update.

Main Results

We included four trials (803 randomised participants), including two new trials, in this updated review. One three-arm trial compared high-dose colchicine (52 participants), low-dose colchicine (74 participants) and placebo (59 participants); one trial compared high-dose colchicine with placebo (43 participants); one trial compared low-dose colchicine with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (399 participants); and one trial compared low-dose colchicine with Chuanhu anti-gout mixture (traditional Chinese Medicine compound) (176 participants). We did not identify any trials comparing colchicine to glucocorticoids (by any route). The mean age of participants ranged from 51.2 to 70 years, and trial duration from 48 hours to 12 weeks. Two trials were at low risk of bias, one was possibly susceptible to selection bias (random sequence generation), reporting bias and other bias, and one open-label trial was at high risk of performance and detection bias. For the primary comparison, low-quality evidence from one trial (103 participants, downgraded for imprecision and bias) suggests low-dose colchicine may improve treatment outcome compared to placebo with little or no increased risk of adverse events. The number of people who reported treatment success (50% or greater pain reduction) at 32 to 36 hours was slightly larger with low-dose colchicine (418 per 1000) compared with placebo (172 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 5.64; absolute improvement 25% more reported success (7% more to 42% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important and unimportant benefit); relative change of 143% more people reported treatment success (5% more to 464% more). The incidence of total adverse events was 364 per 1000 with low-dose colchicine compared with 276 per 1000 with placebo: RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.56; absolute difference 9% more events with low-dose colchicine (9% fewer to 43% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important effect and no effect); relative change of 32% more events (32% fewer to 156% more). No participants withdrew due to adverse events or reported any serious adverse events. Pain, inflammation and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision and bias) from two trials (124 participants) suggests that high-dose colchicine compared to placebo may improve symptoms, but with increased risk of harms. More participants reported treatment success at 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine (518 per 1000) compared with placebo (240 per 1000): RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.65, absolute improvement 28% (8% more to 46% more); more also had reduced inflammation at this time point with high-dose colchicine (504 per 1000) compared with placebo (48 per 1000): RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38; absolute improvement 45% greater (22% greater to 68% greater); but more adverse events were reported with high-dose colchicine (829 per 1000 compared with 260 per 1000): RR 3.21, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.11, absolute difference 57% (26% more to 74% more). Pain and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence from a single trial comparing high-dose to low-dose colchicine indicates there may be little or no difference in benefit in terms of treatment success at 32 to 36 hours but more adverse events associated with the higher dose. Similarly, low-quality evidence from a single trial indicates there may also be little or no benefit of low-dose colchicine over NSAIDs in terms of treatment success and pain reduction at seven days, with a similar number of adverse events reported at four weeks follow-up. Reduction of inflammation, function of target joint and withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported in either of these trials, and pain was not reported in the high-dose versus low-dose colchicine trial. We were unable to estimate the risk of serious adverse events for most comparisons as there were few events reported in the trials. One trial (399 participants) reported three serious adverse (one in a participant receiving low-dose colchicine and two in participants receiving NSAIDs), due to reasons unrelated to the trial (low-quality evidence downgraded for bias and imprecision).

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine may be an effective treatment for acute gout when compared to placebo and low-quality evidence that its benefits may be similar to NSAIDs. We downgraded the evidence for bias and imprecision. While both high- and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo, low-quality evidence suggests that high-dose (but not low-dose) colchicine may increase the number of adverse events compared to placebo, while low-quality evidence indicates that the number of adverse events may be similar with low-dose colchicine and NSAIDs. Further trials comparing colchicine to placebo or other treatment will likely have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimates and may change the conclusions of this review. There are no trials reporting the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as glucocorticoids.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^115nG2QK]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Gout — 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations applied to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) specify: For patients experiencing their first flare, "we conditionally recommend against initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) over no ULT, with the following exceptions". For first-flare patients with "CKD stage ≥ 3, serum urate (SU) > 9 mg/dl (540 μmol/l), or urolithiasis, we conditionally recommend initiating ULT". For asymptomatic hyperuricemia "(SU > 6.8 mg/dl or 408 μmol/l with no prior gout flares or subcutaneous tophi), we conditionally recommend against initiating any pharmacologic ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid)". When starting ULT, "we strongly recommend allopurinol over all other ULT as the preferred first-line agent for all patients, including those with CKD stage ≥ 3", and "we strongly recommend starting at a low dose with subsequent dose titration to target over starting at a higher dose (e.g., ≤ 100 mg/ d [and lower in patients with CKD] for allopurinol or ≤ 40 mg/d for febuxostat)". The guideline also states, "We conditionally recommend testing HLA-B✱5801 prior to starting allopurinol for patients of Southeast Asian descent (e.g. Han Chinese, Korean, Thai) and African American patients, who have a higher prevalence of HLA-B✱5801".

### Colchicine for prophylaxis of acute flares when initiating allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis [^114EkSKA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of colchicine to prevent acute gout flares during initiation of allopurinol therapy is widely practiced despite lack of proven benefit. We investigated if colchicine administration during initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and/or severity of acute gout flares.

Methods

Patients starting allopurinol for crystal-proven chronic gouty arthritis were randomized to receive colchicine 0.6 mg po bid or placebo in a randomized, prospective, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Subjects were followed for evidence of acute gout flares and remained on study drug for 3 months beyond attaining a serum urate concentration < 6.5 mg/dl. Treatment arms were analyzed regarding frequency of flares, likelihood of any flare or multiple flares, severity of flares on the visual analog scale (VAS), and length of flares in days.

Results

Forty-three subjects were studied. Subjects treated with colchicine experienced fewer total flares (0.52 vs 2.91, p = 0.008), fewer flares from 0 to 3 months (0.57 vs 1.91, p = 0.022), fewer flares 3–6 months (0 vs 1.05, p = 0.033), less severe flares as reported on VAS (3.64 vs 5.08, p = 0.018), and fewer recurrent gout flares (p = 0.001). Colchicine was well tolerated.

Conclusion

Colchicine prophylaxis during initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and severity of acute flares, and reduces the likelihood of recurrent flares. Treating patients with colchicine during initiation of allopurinol therapy for 6 months is supported by our data.

### Update on gout: new therapeutic strategies and options [^114ohwgB]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Gout, a disease recognized since antiquity, has increased in prevalence in recent years and the clinical profile of this disease has become increasingly complex, owing to large numbers of cases with iatrogenic factors, multiple comorbidities, advanced age, and hyperuricemia and arthritis refractory to treatment. In this Review, key advances in gout research made during the past decade are summarized. Revised strategies for safe and effective employment of dietary measures and pharmacologic treatments for active gouty arthritis, prevention of gout flares and urate lowering are also reviewed, with an emphasis on dosing of colchicine and allopurinol, and the evidence-based approach to systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment of acute gout. Also discussed are new and emerging treatments for gout and hyperuricemia, and the potential influence of dual energy CT imaging on treatment. In this context, the therapeutic role of febuxostat, and clinical development of pegylated uricase urate-lowering therapy and interleukin 1 antagonism for gouty inflammation are reviewed. Collectively, novel approaches will hopefully lead to improved management of hyperuricemia and gout, and also to improvements in patient-centered outcomes, even for those who have previously failed to respond to treatment.

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^111dUatd]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome in gout randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the drug approval of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) by the regulatory authorities. Since there is no way to achieve the sUA target without monitoring or reassessing sUA, rheumatologists monitor sUA and aim for an sUA target level of less than 6 mg/dL. Therapeutic doses of allopurinol (100–800 mg/day) or febuxostat (40–80 mg/day) or a combination with uricosurics is often needed to achieve target sUA. Allopurinol maximum dose need not be reduced, even in the presence of renal failure, since adverse events are related to initial, and not final, allopurinol dose; pegloticase is another option. Appropriately titrated ULT doses can help achieve a near cure for gout by resolving all urate crystals.

### Evolution of management of gout: a comparison of recent guidelines [^114JoBPf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

Recent Findings

For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using low dose. Intra-articular, oral or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective. For management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favour with most guidelines favouring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to target of serum urate (sUA) less than 6mg/dl, and less than 5mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

Summary

Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for management of gout and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Update on gout management: what is old and what is new [^115qVvr2]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The global burden of gout is rising, as are the prevalence of associated comorbidities, all-cause mortality and societal costs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in epidemiology and treatment strategies for gout.

Recent Findings

Genetic factors and obesity are prominent contributors to hyperuricemia and gout, while dietary factors contribute to less variance in serum urate, though can still have some contribution to population attributable risk. A consensus statement by the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network outlined appropriate terminology regarding gout, which will aid in communication about various aspects of the disease. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology gout guideline offers comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia using urate-lowering therapy, prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy, treatment of gout flare and adjunctive management strategies. There is improved understanding of risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and well tolerated use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease. Trial data have provided new insights regarding cardiovascular risk with febuxostat. Several new drug therapies are being tested for both urate-lowering efficacy and gout flare management.

Summary

Although there have been significant advances in understanding of risk factors and treatment approaches, gout remains suboptimally managed. There is substantial need for improving gout management efforts and gout education among patients and clinicians.

Colchicine for acute gout in CKD — dosing and pharmacokinetics are summarized as follows: "The FDA approved dosing for colchicine is 1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg an hour later for acute flares". In a pharmacokinetic study, "colchicine kidney clearance was decreased by 44% and 65% in persons with eGFR 30–59 and 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively", with "Total body clearance… about half of that in those without CKD", while "the maximum concentration… was similar to that found in individuals with normal kidney function".

### Evaluating appropriate use of prophylactic colchicine for gout flare prevention [^116KLR43]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism guidelines recommend colchicine to prevent gout flares in patients initiating and increasing uric acid–lowering therapy until serum uric acid is maintained at ≤ 6 mg/dl. We aimed to evaluate how well colchicine prescribing practices adhere to these guidelines and to examine factors associated with improved prescribing.

Methods

Electronic medical records were reviewed for 126 patients with active colchicine prescriptions for prophylaxis of gout flares. Colchicine prescribing was defined as inappropriate if 1) no concurrent urate-lowering therapy was prescribed, 2) uric acid was not at goal and urate-lowering therapy had not been increased in the past 3 months, or 3) uric acid goals were met for > 1 year and flares had resolved in the absence of tophi.

Results

Colchicine use was considered inappropriate in 93 patients (73.8%). Thirty-four were prescribed no urate-lowering therapy, 50 were above the uric acid goal without urate-lowering therapy increase in the prior 3 months, and 9 were at the uric acid goal for > 1 year without flares or tophi. Patients appropriately prescribed colchicine were younger and were more likely to have been seen by a rheumatologist. Allopurinol dose and allergy, uric acid level, and renal function were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion

We found a high prevalence of what we considered inappropriate prophylactic colchicine use, driven largely by failure to prescribe concurrent urate-lowering therapies or adequately increase these medications. Rheumatology consultation was associated with improved colchicine prescribing.

### Management of gout: update from the American College of Rheumatology… [^112n3eb2]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- During a second gout flare-up in one year, low-dose allopurinol can be started with anti-inflammatory therapy without worsening the flare-up.
- Allopurinol is the preferred urate-lowering agent, but HLA testing should be offered to patients of Southeast Asian or African American descent before starting to identify patients at risk for an allergic reaction.
- Titrating urate-lowering therapy to reach a serum urate level of 6 mg per dL decreases flare-ups and increases treatment adherence.
- During acute flare-ups, low-dose colchicine, NSAIDs, and glucocorticoids delivered orally, intramuscularly, or intra-articularly are similarly effective. When to Consider Urate-Lowering Therapy Urate-lowering therapy is recommended for patients with two or more gout flare-ups per year, tophaceous gout, or damage attributable to gout visible on radiography. Consider starting therapy for patients with a second flare-up even if not within one year.

With a first gout flare-up, shared decision-making is appropriate in patients at high risk because of a serum urate level of 9 mg per dL or higher, urolithiasis, or stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease. Urate-lowering therapy has not been shown to be beneficial for patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. The ACR recommends starting urate-lowering therapy during an acute flare-up instead of waiting until it resolves. Therapy started during a flare-up does not increase or prolong symptoms as long as anti-inflammatory treatments are provided. The ACR notes that patients are most motivated for treatment during an exacerbation. Anti-inflammatory medications such as colchicine or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be continued for three to six months after starting urate-lowering therapy. Acute Flare-up Management Several medications are effective for acute flare-ups.

The effectiveness of low-dose colchicine is similar to that of high-dose colchicine with fewer adverse effects. NSAIDs and glucocorticoids are as effective as colchicine. Glucocorticoids can be given intramuscularly, intra-articularly, or orally. Interleukin-1 inhibitors and adrenocorticotropic hormone have less evidence and higher cost. Limited evidence suggests topical ice is helpful as an adjuvant treatment.

### Management of gout: a systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1135h9gE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

Purpose

To review evidence about treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Study Selection

Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

Data Synthesis

High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-strength evidence indicates that duration of prophylaxis should be longer than 8 weeks. Although lower urate levels reduce risk for recurrent acute attacks, treatment to a specific target level has not been tested.

Limitation

Few studies of acute gout treatments, no placebo-controlled trials of management of hyperuricemia lasting longer than 6 months, and few studies in primary care populations.

Conclusion

Colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. Urate-lowering therapy decreases serum urate levels and reduces risk for acute gout attacks.

### Effect of prophylaxis on gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy: analysis of data from three phase III trials [^115AC7N4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), such as febuxostat or allopurinol, is recommended for the long-term management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout to reduce the incidence of acute flares. Because of the paradoxical relationship between early use of ULT and the increased incidence of gout flares, prophylaxis with either low-dose colchicine or NSAIDs has been recommended, although there have been concerns about the long-term prophylactic use of these agents.

Objectives

The present analysis examined flare rates during the 3 Phase III trials of febuxostat based on mean postbaseline serum urate (sUA) concentrations and duration of prophylaxis. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by prophylaxis with colchicine or naproxen.

Methods

This investigator-initiated, post hoc reanalysis of data on gout flares from the 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III trials evaluated the proportion of patients requiring treatment for gout flares at 4-week intervals based on mean postbaseline sUA concentrations < 6.0 and ≥ 6.0 mg/dL. The 3 trials enrolled males or females aged 18–85 years who had a diagnosis of gout and a baseline sUA concentration ≥ 8.0 mg/dL. Patients received ULT (febuxostat or allopurinol) or placebo for 6 months or 1 year and flare prophylaxis with colchicine 0.6 mg/d or naproxen 250 mg BID for 8 weeks or 6 months. The prophylactic regimen was chosen at the discretion of the investigator, based on renal function and known intolerance to either drug. Patients with an estimated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min were not to receive naproxen. AEs were summarized based on prophylaxis with colchicine or naproxen.

Results

The 3 trials enrolled a total of 4101 patients with gout. The majority were white (80.1%), male (94.5%), and obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m²) (62.8%). The mean duration of gout ranged from 10.9–11.9 years, and the mean baseline sUA concentration ranged from 9.6–9.9 mg/dL. Flare rates increased sharply (up to 40%) at the end of 8 weeks of prophylaxis and then declined gradually, whereas flare rates were consistently low (range, 3%-5%) at the end of 6 months of prophylaxis. Mean postbaseline sUA concentrations were correlated with flare rates; by the end of each study, patients with a mean postbaseline sUA concentration < 6.0 mg/dL had fewer flares than did those with a mean postbaseline sUA concentration ≥ 6.0 mg/dL. There were differences in rates of AEs between prophylaxis groups, but the rates did not increase with increased duration of prophylaxis.

Conclusion

This analysis of gout flare data from the 3 Phase III trials of febuxostat found that flare prophylaxis for up to 6 months during the initiation of ULT appeared to provide greater benefit than flare prophylaxis for 8 weeks, with no increase in AEs.

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^114WSd67]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to management of acute flares, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to avoid using colchicine and NSAIDs in patients with severe renal impairment. Do not use colchicine in patients receiving strong P-glycoprotein and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as cyclosporin or clarithromycin.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part II: management. report of a task force of the EULAR standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^111yGxST]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy and hospitalizations for gout: results from a nationwide cohort study in england [^115XpJnb]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hospitalizations for gout flares have increased markedly in recent years, on a background of an increasing prevalence of gout and sub-optimal management. In England, hospitalizations for gout doubled between 2006 and 2020. Hospitalizations due to gout also doubled in the United States, Canada and Sweden, contrasting large decreases in admissions for rheumatoid arthritis. Despite this, few studies have investigated strategies to prevent avoidable gout admissions.

Gout is unique among the inflammatory arthritides, in that there are curative medications that prevent flares: urate-lowering therapies (ULT), such as allopurinol and febuxostat. The benefits of ULT are well recognized in primary care settings. A large, randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that ULT, when titrated to achieve a serum urate (SU) below the saturation threshold for crystal formation (< 360 micromol/l), significantly reduced the frequency of gout flares at 2 years compared with usual care [risk ratio (RR) 0.33; 95% CI 0.19, 0.57]. However, in the short term, initiation and titration of ULT can precipitate flares: the frequency of gout flares with treat-to-target ULT in the first year of this trial exceeded that observed with usual care (RR 1.36; 95% CI 1.05, 1.77).

What is not known is whether treat-to-target ULT prevents hospitalizations for gout. Using a population-level dataset with over 290 000 people with incident gout, we investigated two primary objectives: (i) the impact of ULT, with and without colchicine prophylaxis, on the risk of hospitalizations for gout; and (ii) whether attaining target SU levels influences the risk of hospitalizations following ULT initiation.

### Recommendations in clinical practice guidelines on gout: systematic review and consistency analysis [^116oDvcB]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare and analyse the recommendations from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on gout worldwide, examine the consistency across CPGs, and provide suggestions to develop and update gout guidelines.

Methods

We conducted systematic searches in MEDLINE, CBM, GIN, NICE, NGC, WHO, SIGN, DynaMed, UpToDate, and Best Practice databases, from their inception to August 2019 to identify and select CPGs related to gout. We used the search terms "gout", "hyperuricaemia" and "guideline". After two rounds of screening, we included the eligible CPGs of gout according to the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Methodological quality of included guidelines was assessed with the AGREE-II instrument. The general characteristics of included guidelines and the recommendations were extracted, and the consistency of recommendations across guidelines was compared and analysed.

Results

A total of 15 gout guidelines including 359 recommendations were retrieved. The main topics covered by the recommendations were diagnosis, pharmacologic treatment of gout flares, pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy (ULT) of chronic gouty arthritis, lifestyle interventions, prophylaxis, and management of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. The results of AGREE-II appraisal showed that only two guidelines achieved high scores (≥ 50%) in all six domains. There was substantial discrepancy between the guidelines in recommendations covering the value of computed tomography (CT) and x-rays for diagnosis, the use of corticosteroids as a first-line treatment for flare, the use of colchicine, indications for ULT, the use of febuxostat as first-line ULT, the administration of allopurinol, and the timing of ULT initiation.

Conlusions

A number of countries are devoting themselves to the development of gout guidelines, but the process of updating guidelines is slower than that suggested by the WHO. Methodological quality is not satisfactory in most guidelines, and recommendations between guidelines are not consistent.
