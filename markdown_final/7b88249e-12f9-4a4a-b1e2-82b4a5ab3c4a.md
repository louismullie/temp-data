## Question

low PSA level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and act on low PSA levels across screening, risk stratification, and post-treatment contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining what "low PSA" means in different clinical scenarios. Then, I should verify the prognostic implications of low PSA in screening cohorts and how baseline PSA informs future risk. Next, I will examine guideline positions on screening frequency and when to stop based on low PSA. After that, I need to check the paradox of high-grade cancer with low PSA and its management implications. I will then review post-treatment monitoring thresholds and assay variability. Finally, I should integrate risk modifiers, shared decision-making, and synthesize practical recommendations with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the operational definition of "low PSA". In screening and risk stratification, "low" typically refers to values under 1.0 ng/mL, with "intermediate-low" around 1.0–2.0 ng/mL, recognizing that risk is continuous and there is no absolute cutoff that excludes cancer. In post-treatment surveillance, "low" often means undetectable or very low levels where assay performance becomes critical, and I should double-check that I am not conflating these contexts when giving advice [^117CE7Ec] [^111YMi55] [^114rP78d].

> Next, I should review the prognostic implications of low baseline PSA in midlife. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of risk reduction: in men aged 55–60, a baseline PSA ≤ 0.49 ng/mL carries a 13-year actuarial risk of clinically significant cancer of about 0.4%, rising to 1.5% for 0.50–0.99 ng/mL and 5.4% for 1.00–1.99 ng/mL. Importantly, most men fall into these low ranges, so a low PSA meaningfully shifts the balance toward less intensive screening or even cessation in selected men [^117CE7Ec] [^116Yaaiu]. I should also confirm that these findings align with earlier cohorts: yes, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study showed that men with PSA below the age-specific median had markedly higher long-term freedom from prostate cancer, reinforcing the concept that low PSA identifies a low-risk stratum [^116tXR2B].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping screening solely based on a single low PSA. I need to check guideline positions. The USPSTF recommends shared decision-making for ages 55–69 and advises against routine screening in men 70 and older, while the ACS suggests that men with PSA < 2.5 ng/mL can extend screening intervals to every 2 years and that individualized risk assessment is appropriate in the 2.5–4.0 ng/mL range. More recent data support considering discontinuation of screening when baseline PSA is < 1.0 ng/mL in midlife, but I should emphasize that this is a risk-based, preference-sensitive decision rather than a blanket rule [^113HgSM8] [^1149of81] [^117CE7Ec]. Let me reconsider the strength of evidence: modeling and cohort data suggest that PSA-stratified strategies reduce testing burden and overdiagnosis while preserving most of the mortality benefit, but I should confirm that these are model-based projections and not randomized outcomes, which they are [^1115e9Wd] [^115Uy1Dj].

> I will now examine the paradox of high-grade prostate cancer with low PSA. Initially, I thought "low PSA equals low risk", but wait, that is too simplistic. A subset of high-grade tumors, particularly those with neuroendocrine or aggressive phenotypes, may secrete little PSA, so a low PSA does not categorically exclude clinically significant disease, and in selected high-grade, low-PSA patients, treatment intensification with docetaxel added to standard local therapy has been associated with improved cancer-specific outcomes, which I should note is meta-analytic and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^114UFAyw] [^116BuvPy]. I should double-check that this applies to carefully selected men with good performance status and high-grade disease, not to average-risk screenees with low PSA, to avoid overgeneralization [^114UFAyw].

> Next, I should review post-treatment monitoring and the meaning of "low" PSA after therapy. Let me verify the commonly used thresholds: after radical prostatectomy, an undetectable PSA is expected, and biochemical recurrence is often defined at 0.2 ng/mL. After radiation, a nadir around 1.0 ng/mL or higher may be concerning depending on context, but I need to ensure I acknowledge that assay variability below 0.4 ng/mL can be substantial, with inter-assay coefficients of variation exceeding 20% in some platforms, which can confound decisions near low thresholds [^114rP78d]. Hold on, I should verify the implication: yes, small changes at very low PSA should be interpreted cautiously and, when possible, trended on the same assay to reduce analytical noise before declaring recurrence or progression [^114rP78d].

> I need to ensure I integrate risk modifiers that modulate interpretation of "low" PSA. Age, family history, African ancestry, prostate volume, and prior biopsy history all influence pretest probability and the likelihood that a given PSA reflects clinically significant cancer. For example, African American men have higher incidence and mortality and may warrant earlier or more intensive strategies despite similar PSA values, and percent free PSA can refine risk when total PSA is borderline, though its utility diminishes at very low PSA levels [^1173wSMU] [^111U3pVK] [^116415Ue]. Let me verify whether low PSA still carries residual risk across ethnic groups: yes, absolute risks are lower but not zero, so shared decision-making must incorporate these modifiers rather than rely on PSA alone [^114rwPes].

> But wait, what about the clinical action steps when PSA is low in a screening context? I should confirm that for men aged 55–60 with PSA < 1.0 ng/mL, extending the interval or even discontinuing screening can be reasonable after discussing uncertainties, while men with PSA 1.0–2.0 ng/mL may benefit from less frequent screening rather than annual testing; conversely, men with PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL have higher long-term risk and may merit closer follow-up, always anchored in life expectancy and patient preferences [^117CE7Ec] [^1149of81]. Hold on, I should verify that these strategies align with broader guidance: contemporary recommendations emphasize risk-stratified approaches, MRI-targeted pathways to reduce unnecessary biopsies, and active surveillance for low-risk disease to mitigate overtreatment, which supports tailoring intensity to baseline risk rather than a one-size-fits-all interval [^117V7Q7Q] [^111RMPRS].

> I should double-check the evidence on stopping screening in older men with low PSA. Large cohorts suggest that men with PSA < 1.0–2.0 ng/mL at age 60 have extremely low lifetime risks of lethal prostate cancer, supporting the safety of stopping screening in this group, and more recent data in men turning 70 show that those with PSA 0.2–0.99 ng/mL have very low risks of metastasis and prostate cancer death even among otherwise healthy individuals, reinforcing that continued screening in low-PSA older men often yields low-value detection of indolent disease [^111YMi55] [^113k8xqb]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that these are observational data and that patient values about overdiagnosis still matter; yes, these are observational, so shared decision-making remains essential [^111YMi55] [^113k8xqb].

> Next, I should review the post-treatment side. For biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy, a confirmed PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL is a standard trigger for evaluation, but I need to ensure I account for assay variability and clinical context before acting on a single marginal value. Repeating on the same platform and correlating with symptoms, imaging, and time to recurrence improves decision-making and avoids overcalling noise as progression [^114rP78d]. Let me verify whether adjuncts like PSA density or kinetics help here: PSA density is more relevant in active surveillance and diagnostic risk refinement than in post-prostatectomy recurrence, so I should avoid overextending its use in this setting [^111dU3Am].

> I will now examine the role of MRI and biomarkers when PSA is low but suspicion persists. Pre-biopsy MRI can reduce unnecessary systematic biopsies and improve detection of clinically significant cancer, though a negative MRI does not fully exclude high-grade disease, so I should caution against using MRI alone to rule out cancer when clinical risk is nontrivial. Emerging urine methylation tests and other biomarkers may further refine risk, but they are not yet substitutes for context-driven decision-making [^117V7Q7Q] [^112eWgnF]. Hold on, I should verify that guideline panels still position MRI and biomarkers as adjuncts to, not replacements for, thoughtful risk assessment and shared decision-making, which they do [^111RMPRS].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations while keeping uncertainties explicit. For men aged 55–60 with PSA < 1.0 ng/mL, consider extending intervals to every 2–4 years or discussing cessation of screening if life expectancy is limited and preferences favor avoiding overdiagnosis. For PSA 1.0–2.0 ng/mL, continue periodic screening every 1–2 years with risk-informed discussion. For PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL, maintain closer follow-up and consider MRI and biomarker-enhanced pathways before biopsy. For men 70 and older with PSA < 2.0 ng/mL, stopping screening is reasonable in most cases, especially if comorbidity is present. After treatment, interpret very low PSA values with assay consistency and clinical correlation, recognizing that small oscillations near detection limits may be analytical rather than biological [^117CE7Ec] [^1149of81] [^113k8xqb] [^114rP78d]. I should confirm that these steps align with a risk-stratified, shared decision-making framework, which they do, while acknowledging that some data are observational and modeling-based rather than from randomized trials of screening intervals [^117V7Q7Q] [^1115e9Wd].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key caveats are explicit. Low PSA substantially reduces but does not eliminate the risk of clinically significant prostate cancer, particularly in younger men with decades of remaining life expectancy. High-grade tumors can present with low PSA. Assay variability at very low levels demands cautious interpretation and, when possible, longitudinal assessment on the same platform. And patient values about overdiagnosis, biopsy, and treatment should drive the intensity of screening and the threshold to stop, with periodic revisiting as risk evolves [^117CE7Ec] [^114UFAyw] [^114rP78d] [^117TKupa]. Hold on, I should verify that this conclusion integrates both benefits and harms coherently: yes, the balance favors less intensive screening for low-PSA men while maintaining vigilance for those with higher baseline risk or concerning trajectories, consistent with contemporary guidelines and risk-stratified care models [^117V7Q7Q] [^111RMPRS].

Low PSA levels are generally reassuring but **do not exclude cancer** [^115f8RoY], especially high-grade or early-stage disease [^115f8RoY]. Low PSA is most often due to age, small prostate volume, or assay variability [^111itW4Z] [^114rP78d], but can also reflect **androgen deficiency** or certain medications [^notfound] [^114hmhTx]. In screening, very low PSA (< 1 ng/mL) at midlife predicts a low long-term risk of clinically significant cancer, supporting less frequent or discontinued screening in some men [^117CE7Ec] [^111YMi55]. After treatment, persistently low PSA usually indicates remission, but **ultra-low PSA assays** are needed to detect early recurrence [^114rP78d]. Always interpret low PSA in clinical context, considering age, medications, and risk factors [^114MFpqg].

---

## Definition of low PSA

By definition, **low PSA** is typically < 4.0 ng/mL, though "normal" varies with age and individual risk [^114hmhTx]. Very low PSA is often defined as < 1.0 ng/mL, which is associated with a low likelihood of clinically significant cancer [^117CE7Ec].

---

## Clinical significance of low PSA levels

### Benign conditions associated with low PSA

Several benign factors can lower PSA:

- **Age**: PSA tends to decline with age due to reduced prostate volume and androgen levels.
- **Prostate size**: Smaller prostates produce less PSA.
- **Medications**: 5α-reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride) lower PSA by ~50% [^notfound].
- **Androgen deficiency**: Lower testosterone reduces PSA production [^notfound].
- **Assay variability**: Differences between laboratories can affect results [^114rP78d].

---

### Malignant conditions associated with low PSA

Although low PSA is reassuring, **cancer can still occur**:

- **High-grade cancer**: Some aggressive tumors produce little PSA, causing false reassurance [^114UFAyw].
- **Early-stage cancer**: Small tumors may not elevate PSA significantly [^112b2wKN].
- **Variant histology**: Neuroendocrine tumors may have low PSA [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of low PSA in different clinical scenarios

### Screening and diagnosis

In screening, **very low PSA (< 1 ng/mL) at midlife** predicts a low long-term risk of clinically significant cancer, supporting less frequent or discontinued screening in some men [^117CE7Ec] [^111YMi55]. However, **no PSA level completely excludes cancer**; high-grade disease can occur even with low PSA [^115f8RoY].

---

### Monitoring treatment response

After treatment, **persistently low PSA** usually indicates remission, but **ultra-low PSA assays** are often needed to detect early recurrence [^111qLbeH].

---

### Active surveillance

In active surveillance, **low and stable PSA** supports continued surveillance, but **PSA kinetics** should be interpreted with other clinical factors [^117CdrUp].

---

## Factors influencing low PSA levels

| **Factor** | **Effect on psa** |
|-|-|
| Age | Decreases with age |
| Prostate size | Smaller glands = lower PSA |
| Medications (5α-reductase inhibitors) | Decrease PSA by ~50% |
| Androgen deficiency | Lowers PSA |
| Assay variability | Can lower apparent PSA |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss benefits and harms of screening, especially in men with low PSA [^113k8xqb].
- **Risk-based screening**: Use baseline PSA to tailor screening frequency and intensity [^117CE7Ec].
- **Active surveillance**: Preferred for low-risk disease; low PSA supports this approach [^116xdkxq].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **False reassurance**: Low PSA can miss high-grade or early-stage cancer [^115f8RoY].
- **Overdiagnosis**: Low PSA may lead to underdiagnosis in some settings [^111itW4Z].
- **Assay variability**: Differences between laboratories can affect interpretation [^114rP78d].

---

## Clinical management strategies

- **Individualized assessment**: Consider age, medications, and risk factors when interpreting low PSA [^114hmhTx].
- **Repeat testing**: Confirm persistent low PSA before making decisions [^notfound].
- **Adjunctive tests**: Use MRI, biomarkers, or clinical judgment when suspicion persists despite low PSA [^111SysHc].

---

Low PSA levels are generally reassuring but **do not exclude cancer**. Interpretation should be individualized, considering age, medications, and risk factors, with shared decision-making to balance benefits and harms.

### PSA screening for prostate cancer: why saying No is a high-value health care choice [^115RgQuv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

Enthusiasm for cancer screening and treatment of screen-detected cancer has led to widespread prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, a marked increase in prostate cancer incidence, and high use of surgical, radiation, and androgen deprivation treatment for screen-detected disease. This has occurred in advance of a full understanding of the clinical and financial tradeoffs. Although questions remain whether lifetime benefits outweigh harms and costs, data indicate that this balance is not favorable through at least 15 years. This article outlines a conceptual framework for determining the value of screening strategies according to screening and treatment intensity. We describe 4 main cancer screening goals and examine whether PSA screening and treatment achieve these goals and thus provide high-value care. Available evidence demonstrates that PSA screening provides at best a small reduction in prostate cancer mortality, and no reduction in all-cause mortality. High-intensity PSA screening and treatment currently practiced in the United States result in substantial harms and large health care expenditures-it is low-value care. The health importance of prostate cancer and the financial costs to patients and society require improved detection and treatment strategies that produce greater value to patients. We propose lower-intensity, higher-value options. However, until evidence supports a higher-value alternative to current PSA screening strategies, physicians should recommend against PSA screening, policymakers should encourage reduced screening, and most men should say no to the PSA test.

### Association of baseline prostate-specific antigen level with long-term diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer among patients aged 55 to 60 years: a secondary analysis of a cohort in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial [^117CE7Ec]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer is controversial because of the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent cancers. Optimal screening strategies are highly sought.

Objective

To estimate the long-term risk of any prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer based on baseline PSA levels among men aged 55 to 60 years.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary analysis of a cohort in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial uses actuarial analysis to analyze the association of baseline PSA levels with long-term risk of any prostate cancer and of clinically significant prostate cancer among men aged 55 to 60 years enrolled in the screening group of the trial between 1993 and 2001.

Exposure

Single PSA measurement at study entry.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Long-term risk of any prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer diagnoses.

Results

There were 10 968 men aged 55 to 60 years (median [interquartile range] age, 57 [55–58] years) at study enrollment in the screening group of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial who had long-term follow-up. Actuarial 13-year incidences of clinically significant prostate cancer diagnosis among participants with a baseline PSA of 0.49 ng/mL or less was 0.4% (95% CI, 0%-0.8%); 0.50–0.99 ng/mL, 1.5% (95% CI, 1.1%-1.9%); 1.00–1.99 ng/mL, 5.4% (95% CI, 4.4%-6.4%); 2.00–2.99 ng/mL, 10.6% (95% CI, 8.3%-12.9%); 3.00–3.99 ng/mL, 15.3% (95% CI, 11.4%-19.2%); and 4.00 ng/mL and greater, 29.5% (95% CI, 24.2%-34.8%) (all pairwise log-rank P ≤ .004). Only 15 prostate cancer-specific deaths occurred during 13 years of follow-up, and 9 (60.0%) were among men with a baseline PSA level of 2.00 ng/mL or higher.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of a cohort from the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, baseline PSA levels among men aged 55 to 60 years were associated with long-term risk of clinically significant prostate cancer. These findings suggest that repeated screening can be less frequent among men aged 55 to 60 years with a low baseline PSA level (ie, < 2.00 ng/mL) and possibly discontinued among those with baseline PSA levels of less than 1.00 ng/mL.

### Low-value prostate-specific antigen screening in older males [^1166bBzP]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines advise against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer in males older than 69 years due to the risk of false-positive results and overdiagnosis of indolent disease. However, this low-value PSA screening in males aged 70 years or older remains common.

Objective

To characterize the factors associated with low-value PSA screening in males 70 years or older.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This survey study used data from the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationwide annual survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that collects information via telephone from more than 400 000 US adults on behavioral risk factors, chronic illnesses, and use of preventive services. The final cohort comprised male respondents to the 2020 BRFSS survey who were categorized into the following age groups: 70 to 74 years, 75 to 79 years, or 80 years or older. Males with a former or current prostate cancer diagnosis were excluded.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcomes were recent PSA screening rates and factors associated with low-value PSA screening. Recent screening was defined as PSA testing within the past 2 years. Weighted multivariable logistic regressions and 2-sided significance tests were used to characterize factors associated with recent screening.

Results

The cohort included 32 306 males. Most of these males (87.6%) were White individuals, whereas 1.1% were American Indian, 1.2% were Asian, 4.3% were Black, and 3.4% were Hispanic individuals. Within this cohort, 42.8% of respondents were aged 70 to 74 years, 28.4% were aged 75 to 79 years, and 28.9% were 80 years or older. The recent PSA screening rates were 55.3% for males in the 70-to-74-year age group, 52.1% in the 75-to-79-year age group, and 39.4% in the 80-year-or-older group. Among all racial groups, non-Hispanic White males had the highest screening rate (50.7%), and non-Hispanic American Indian males had the lowest screening rate (32.0%). Screening increased with higher educational level and annual income. Married respondents were screened more than unmarried males. In a multivariable regression model, discussing PSA testing advantages with a clinician (odds ratio [OR], 9.09; 95% CI, 7.60–11.40; P < .001) was associated with increased recent screening, whereas discussing PSA testing disadvantages had no association with screening (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77–1.17; p = 0.60). Other factors associated with a higher screening rate included having a primary care physician, a post-high school educational level, and income of more than $25 000 per year.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this survey study suggest that older male respondents to the 2020 BRFSS survey were overscreened for prostate cancer despite the age cutoff for PSA screening recommended in national guidelines. Discussing the benefits of PSA testing with a clinician was associated with increased screening, underscoring the potential of clinician-level interventions to reduce overscreening in older males.

### Is there any association between prostate-specific antigen screening frequency and uptake of active surveillance in men with low or very low risk prostate cancer? [^113bAQBd]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, the question of whether frequency of PSA testing or a negative prostate biopsy before diagnosis influence the uptake of AS has not previously been addressed. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether frequency of pre-diagnostic PSA testing was associated with uptake of AS among men diagnosed with low or very low risk PCa. Our secondary aims were to determine whether the experience of a negative prostate biopsy or changes in PSA levels prior to diagnosis influenced the likelihood of choosing AS. The quantitative findings of this work will add to the qualitative studies investigating patient and physician behaviour, so that combined they can help us develop better educational and supportive tools for patients and healthcare professionals.

### Association of baseline prostate-specific antigen level with long-term diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer among patients aged 55 to 60 years: a secondary analysis of a cohort in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial [^116Yaaiu]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Among men entering the screening group of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial at age 55 to 60 years, the risk of being diagnosed with a clinically significant PCa during a median of 11.7 years of follow-up (and an actuarial follow-up of 13 years) differed significantly among those in different baseline PSA level groups and was lowest among men with a baseline PSA level of 0.49 ng/mL or lower. In addition, while our results suggest that there is no absolute baseline PSA cutoff level under which the 13-year risk of any PCa or clinically significant PCa is 0, this risk was higher among men with a baseline PSA level of 2.00 ng/mL or greater.

At a time when the concern regarding the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent PCa has led to intense scrutiny of the value of PSA levels as an effective screening tool, our data on the increasing risks associated with higher baseline PSA levels can be used to determine the optimal PCa screening strategy for individual patients. The low 13-year actuarial risk of a clinically significant PCa diagnosis in middle-aged men with a baseline PSA level less than 2.00 ng/mL (ie, 0.4% among men with PSA levels < 0.49 ng/mL, 1.5% among men with PSA levels of 0.50–0.99 ng/mL, and 5.4% among men with PSA levels of 1.00–1.99 ng/mL) suggests that men younger than 60 years with PSA levels of 1.00 to 1.99 ng/mL can undergo less intensive screening than men with higher baseline PSA levels. Men with baseline PSA levels less than 1.00 ng/mL may wish to discontinue screening. Most men would be affected by these changes in screening strategy because 83% of men in our study had baseline PSA levels less than 2.00 ng/mL.

### Variation of serum prostate-specific antigen levels: an evaluation of year-to-year fluctuations [^115dZRc4]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is frequently used in early detection programs for prostate cancer. While PSA testing has resulted in an increase in prostate cancer detection, its routine use has been questioned because of a lack of specificity.

Objective

To determine whether year-to-year fluctuations in PSA levels are due to natural variation and render a single PSA test result unreliable.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective analysis of an unscreened population of 972 men (median age, 62 years) participating in the Polyp Prevention Trial (1991–1998). Five consecutive blood samples were obtained during a 4-year period and were assessed for total and free PSA levels.

Main Outcome Measure

Abnormal PSA test result based on a PSA level higher than 4 ng/mL; a PSA level higher than 2.5 ng/mL; a PSA level above the age-specific cutoff; a PSA level in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL and a free-to-total ratio of less than 0.25 ng/mL; or a PSA velocity higher than 0.75 ng/mL per year.

Results

Prostate biopsy would have been recommended in 207 participants (21%) with a PSA level higher than 4 ng/mL; in 358 (37%) with a level higher than 2.5 ng/mL; in 172 (18%) with a level above the age-specific cutoff; in 190 (20%) with a level between 4 and 10 ng/mL and a free-to-total ratio of less than 0.25 ng/mL; and in 145 (15%) with a velocity higher than 0.75 ng/mL per year. Among men with an abnormal PSA finding, a high proportion had a normal PSA finding at 1 or more subsequent visits during 4-year follow-up: 68 (44%) of 154 participants with a PSA level higher than 4 ng/mL; 116 (40%) of 291 had a level higher than 2.5 ng/mL; 64 (55%) of 117 had an elevated level above the age-specific cutoff; and 76 (53%) of 143 had a level between 4 and 10 ng/mL and a free-to-total ratio of less than 0.25 ng/mL.

Conclusion

An isolated elevation in PSA level should be confirmed several weeks later before proceeding with further testing, including prostate biopsy.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116dPYfz]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer early detection — PSA thresholds and shared decision-making are outlined as follows: we continue to recommend that men who are at greater risk for developing prostate cancer at earlier ages — African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer in nonelderly relatives — should be provided the opportunity for informed decision-making at a younger age than men who are at average risk. Recognizing that lowering the PSA threshold for biopsy will increase the rate of overdiagnosis, we consider the traditional PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL to be a reasonable threshold for further evaluation. Acknowledging that there is no true PSA cutoff point that distinguishes cancer from noncancer, we suggest that providers consider individualized decision making when PSA levels fall in the indeterminate range between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, particularly in men who are at increased risk for high-grade cancer based on non-PSA risk factors. Until that time, however, it will remain incumbent on health care providers and the health care system as a whole to provide men with the opportunity to decide whether they wish to pursue early detection of prostate cancer.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^1173wSMU]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) recommendations for higher-risk men — The ACS continues to recommend that African American men and men who have a family history of a first-degree relative with prostate cancer be provided information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits surrounding prostate cancer screening beginning at age 45 years. For men who have multiple first-degree relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 years, this discussion should take place beginning at age 40 years. For men who choose to be screened, the ACS recommends integrating established risk factors into an individualized risk assessment, particularly when PSA levels fall into what currently would be considered the high-normal range of 2.5 ng/mL to 4.0 ng/mL.

### Who and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^113LykA8]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Our personal view is that PSA screening should indeed involve shared decision-making, but we believe the focus should primarily be on behavior, rather than preference. For this purpose, we have published a decision-support tool called the 'Simple Schema', which acknowledges that the majority of harms of screening result from unnecessary treatment of low-risk disease and therefore focuses on the importance of active surveillance as the appropriate, evidence-based management strategy for low-risk cancer. We further believe that PSA screening should be a risk-stratified approach aimed at detecting lethal prostate cancer. This is based on evidence that only a small proportion of men with moderately elevated PSA have aggressive disease and that overdiagnosis is strongly influenced by age and PSA levels. For instance, we have shown that almost half of the excess incidence of cancer associated with PSA testing occurs in men over 70 – a group in which screening is likely of little, if any, benefit – and that the effects of screening men in their 60s is highly dependent on their PSA level, with an excellent ratio of harms to benefits in patients with PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL but zero benefit in patients with a lower PSA. Therefore, the current guidelines in place at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center restrict screening in men over 60 to those with above average PSAs and dramatically restrict screening in men over 70 to a small number of men with exceptional health and high PSA. Additionally, biopsy is recommended only after a repeat PSA and further work-up, and the frequency of screening is stratified depending on baseline PSA, which has been shown to be a very strong predictor of long-term prostate cancer metastasis and death.

We were interested in hearing the experts elaborate on these nuances of screening as we believe this would help us forward in striving to identify the group of men who might benefit from screening and those who might not.

### A urine-based methylation signature for risk stratification within low-risk prostate cancer [^113HaYPp]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Over 238 000 men are estimated to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States this year, with ∼29 000 dying from the disease. Nearly 85% of these cancers will be detected by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening with diagnostic PSA level above 4.0 ng mL −1. Two recently reported studies showed disparate findings with regard to the impact of PSA screening on prostate cancer-specific mortality, yet both showed that the single biggest risk for screening is overdetection. It is estimated that 10–56% of the cases of diagnosed prostate cancer would be 'insignificant' and not have had a meaningful clinical impact if they had remained undetected/untreated. In low-risk patients, the Prostate Cancer Intervention versus Observation Trial demonstrated that a survival benefit cannot be observed in radical prostatectomy vs active surveillance (AS) after 10 years of median follow-up. Despite this latter finding, the vast majority of men with prostate cancer are actively treated with surgery, radiation, androgen ablation, or all the three. This holds true even for those cancers deemed ideal for surveillance or less aggressive treatments.

Overdiagnosed prostate cancers can cause a negative impact on the quality-adjusted life years following PSA screening. It is difficult to assure a patient that a low-risk cancer at biopsy is truly 'insignificant' as biopsies inherently undersample the prostate. Using contemporary AS protocols and standard multicore biopsy techniques, patients with no evidence of a high Gleason score cancer on biopsy still carry a significant risk of having a high-grade tumour when the prostate is removed and sampled completely. This is troubling as a number of clinical end points have been linked to Gleason score, including TNM stage, response to different therapies, biochemical failure, progression to metastatic disease, and survival, including prostate cancer-specific survival and overall survival. A recent study reports that 36% of tumours with a Gleason score of 6 on biopsy are upgraded at radical prostatectomy to a Gleason score of 7 or higher. A similar upgrading rate of 34% as well as an upstaging rate of 13% was also reported in both the African American and other racial groups.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^113TBkoF]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The Rapid Recommendations executive felt this new study — taken together with extended follow-up data from existing trials — required a new appraisal of the body of evidence for patients and clinicians.

Although the results of this study suggest screening is not worthwhile, several guidelines advocate offering screening in some cases. The study was much larger than previous studies, and existing trials had published more extended follow-up results, and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations team felt these merited a new appraisal of the body of evidence. This guideline aims to promptly and transparently translate potentially practice-changing evidence to usable recommendations for clinicians and patients, based on the GRADE framework and following standards for trustworthy guidelines.

The panel suggests against systematic PSA screening (weak recommendation). The panel members judged that most men will decline screening because the benefit is small and uncertain and there are clear harms. However, there is likely considerable variation in values and preferences. Men with family history of prostate cancer, African descent or of lower socioeconomic status, having higher baseline risk of prostate cancer death, may be more likely to choose PSA screening. Shared decision making is needed for men considering screening.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^112EQjDF]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer screening — PSA 2.5–4.0 ng/mL risk assessment: It is reasonable to offer men the opportunity for individualized risk assessment at PSA values between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, and multiple studies have demonstrated that greater than 20% of men in this range have prostate cancer on biopsy. Although individualized risk assessment can be time-consuming, only about 10% of men who choose to be screened will have values that fall in the 2.5 ng/mL to 4.0 ng/mL range, and some men with PSA levels below 2.5 ng/mL will harbor prostate cancer but these are less likely to be high-grade and are likely to be detected on serial PSA. The PCPT risk calculator has been updated to include PCA3, a urinary biomarker associated with prostate cancer risk, and the online calculator allows entry of this value. In summary, for men with PSA 2.5–4.0 ng/mL, the ACS recommends that health care providers consider an individualized risk assessment that incorporates other risk factors for prostate cancer, particularly for high-grade cancer, which may be used for a biopsy or referral recommendation.

### Low-value prostate-specific antigen screening in older males [^113HgSM8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males worldwide. While screening for prostate cancer may reduce prostate cancer–specific mortality, it comes at the risk of overdiagnosis, particularly in older males or those with comorbid medical conditions. Screening with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in males who are unlikely to benefit from intervention for prostate cancer exposes these individuals to anxiety, invasive biopsies, and possible overtreatment, which could lead to unnecessary clinical consequences.

Given the lack of evidence of clinical benefit of PSA screening for prostate cancer in older males, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) published revised guidelines in 2018 that advised against PSA screening for prostate cancer in males 70 years or older due to the risk of false-positive results and overdiagnosis of indolent disease. These guidelines now recommend that males aged 55 to 69 years make the personal decision to undergo PSA screening after discussing its potential benefits and risks with their physician.

To characterize the factors associated with low-value PSA screening in males 70 years or older, we analyzed a cohort of males from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We hypothesized that, despite the advice to the contrary, PSA screening in older males remains overused.

### Emerging PSA-based tests to improve screening [^114AC3MC]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article updates advances in prostate cancer screening based on prostate-specific antigen, its derivatives, and human kallikrein markers. Many men are diagnosed with indolent disease not requiring treatment. Although there is evidence of a survival benefit from screening, the numbers needed to screen and treat remain high. There is risk of exposing men to the side effects of treatment for nonthreatening disease. A screening test is needed with sufficiently good performance characteristics to detect disease at an early stage so treatment may be offered with curative intent, while reducing the number of negative or unnecessary biopsies.

### Prostate-specific antigen at or before age 50 as a predictor of advanced prostate cancer diagnosed up to 25 years later: a case-control study [^114zUWC7]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

We have previously shown that a single prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement taken at age 50 or younger is a strong predictor of prostate cancer diagnosed up to 25 years subsequently. Our study cohort was obtained from the Malmö Preventive Medicine Study, a large, representative, population-based study on cardiovascular risk factors that took place in Malmö, Sweden from 1974 to 1986. Using a case-control design, we found that PSA levels in the archived blood plasma taken during 1974–1986 were significantly higher in men subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with matched controls. As the rate of PSA screening in Sweden during the study period was very low, the study constitutes a 'natural experiment' to test hypotheses about the development of prostate cancer.

Our finding has several implications, most notably that a single PSA test at age 45–50 could risk-stratify the population for the intensity of subsequent screening. However, as is well known, more men die with prostate cancer than from prostate cancer, and many prostate cancers affect neither the length nor the quality of a man's life. For example, autopsy studies of men who die from causes other than prostate cancer have found cancer in the prostates of approximately 20% of men at age 60 and approximately 40% at age 70; this sharply contrasts with the low lifetime risk of dying from this disease. Moreover, in contrast to the very marked country-to-country differences in prostate cancer incidence, there is relatively minor variation in prostate cancer mortality rates. These observations raise the possibility that the sort of cancers predicted by an early elevation of PSA might have little clinical relevance.

Accordingly, we decided to reanalyze our data to focus on an endpoint of unquestionable clinical significance: locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis. Skeletal metastases cause symptoms, such as pain, and most men with metastases die of their disease; as regards clinical stage T3, cancer that has demonstrably grown outside the confines of the prostate will, if left untreated, inevitably lead to severe disease symptoms (e.g. local obstruction) or prostate cancer metastasis. In this study, we aimed to determine whether levels of prostate-specific kallikreins (total PSA, free PSA and hK2) measured in anti-coagulated plasma samples could predict locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer up to 25 years before diagnosis. We also investigated whether combining different markers into a single multivariable model could improve our ability to predict compared to use of total PSA alone.

Prostate-specific antigen screening in high-risk populations — Test positivity generally increases with advancing age; in men younger than age 50 years, test positivity, based on a 4-ng/mL PSA cutoff, ranges between 2% and 3% and increases up to as high as 28% among men ages 70 years and older, while the prostate cancer detection rate and positive predictive value (PPV) are lower among men younger than age 50 years (1%-2%, and 6%-38%, respectively) compared with older men (13% and 39%-58%, respectively), and specificity decreases with increasing age (from 97% to 98% in younger adults compared with 80% in older adults); in African American men ages 70 to 79 years, based on a 4-ng/mL PSA cutoff, test positivity reportedly may be as high as 54% with a prostate cancer detection rate of 25% and a PPV of 59%.

### Transcriptome-wide association analysis identifies candidate susceptibility genes for prostate-specific antigen levels in men without prostate cancer [^115LdPft]. HGG Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a serine protease of the human tissue kallikrein-related (KLK) peptidase family. Serum levels are commonly used as a biomarker for detection, monitoring, and risk stratification of prostate cancer (PCa). A small portion of the highly abundant PSA in the prostate is released into blood and elevated in men with PCa. This process is incompletely understood, and disruption of prostate gland architecture by neoplastic transformation has been speculated as a possible mechanism. PSA levels can additionally be influenced by age, ethnicity, body mass index, infection, prostate volume, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and germline genetic variation.

PSA screening has been used for more than 30 years for the detection of PCa, which is the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. However, low test specificity and discrimination have complicated the use and interpretation of PSA as a screening tool. Long-term outcomes data from large, population-based, randomized PSA screening trials show that PSA screening significantly reduces deaths from PCa and also results in the considerable overdiagnosis of low-risk disease. PSA screening might be improved were it to account for variation in PSA levels that is attributable to germline genetics rather than PCa. Twin studies and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have estimated that 30%–45% of serum PSA variation is influenced by hereditary factors. The most recent GWAS meta-analysis from our group identified 318 independent PSA-associated variants, which explained approximately 9% of genetic variation in PSA levels.

Additional genetic variation in PSA levels may be determined by analyses of gene expression, as opposed to individual variants. Such work could lead to the identification of regions or biological pathways that affect PSA levels and point to mechanisms underlying constitutional increases in PSA levels in the absence of carcinogenesis. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) allow for the identification of genes whose cis -regulated expression is associated with complex polygenic traits. To identify genes associated with PSA levels and prioritize them for functional investigation, we performed a TWAS of PSA levels based on summary statistics from a GWAS meta-analysis of 95,768 men without PCa. In doing so, we aimed to identify genes located at loci where prior GWAS signals fell below genome-wide significance. In further implementing colocalization analyses, we were able to identify variants that influence both complex traits and gene expression. We additionally implemented conditional analyses, fine-mapping, colocalization analyses, and pathway analyses to yield comprehensive insights into genes' relationships with PSA levels.

### Prostate-specific antigen and the early diagnosis of prostate cancer [^113bAu8M]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

With digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a major screening tool for prostate cancer. PSA is specific for the prostate, but not for prostate cancer. Multiple factors influence PSA value. Determination of PSA levels is not 100% sensitive for prostate cancer, as PSA levels may be normal despite presence of prostate cancer. The cutoff value for PSA of 4.0 ng/mL gives the highest sensitivity and highest specificity. Several modifications of PSA testing have been developed and may be beneficial for select populations. Uncertainty about the natural progression of prostate cancer and inherent limitations of PSA testing make it unclear whether universal screening is beneficial, and the recommendations of various organizations conflict. Randomized studies are in progress to address the role of PSA testing and of modifications of this test in the early detection of prostate cancer.

### The efficacy of different biomarkers and endpoints to refine referrals for suspected prostate cancer: the TARGET study (tiered integrAted tests for eaRly diaGnosis of clinically significant prostatE tumours) [^113yQm2Q]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer has a high incidence but a relatively low mortality rate. To date, screening studies have failed to show a clear benefit of survival against the counter-balances of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. While this paradigm has been improved with the introduction of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) pre-biopsy, it remains the case that many men need to be tested and referred to a tertiary centre before scans and biopsies are done to confirm or refute if a significant cancer is present. Indeed, it is estimated that for every man diagnosed with a significant cancer, up to 2 others will have unnecessary referral and investigations. Natural history studies have shown that almost all men will develop cancer foci in the prostate with age but relatively few go onto cause morbidity. Our understanding of what is a prognostically important cancer has also evolved greatly and the concept of not detecting cancers too early is now widely accepted.

Current approaches to early detection have tended to view men as a group from which the one at risk needs to be picked out and referred. The key conundrum is the balance between detecting cancer too early for which treatment is not (or will ever be) needed and hence confer no survival gain but, on the other hand, not detecting it too late when curative treatment is not possible, all within the context of a naturally growing prostate gland and ageing male. Whatever the approach, cost and cost–benefit and linking with survival outcomes are going to be key for any prostate cancer early detection programme in an ever more expensive health care environment. These aspects argue strongly for a more rational and tiered strategy to the use of investigations and referrals.

Hitherto, groups working in early detection have generally fallen into separate camps, e.g. using SNP baseline population testing, bio-marker panels or imaging tests to visualise lesions. None have gained traction to replace the simple PSA test. Thus, PSA will likely remain the first and most important baseline test, and this is the case in many current renewed efforts to re-evaluate screening. Here, we tested the incremental value of different types of biomarkers in addition to PSA to detect significant cancer and how performance may vary depending on the definition of 'clinical significance'. Our goal was to derive the optimal sequence or testing tiers to (i) reduce the overall investigated population in men with a raised PSA, (ii) refine or reduce use of imaging and/or biopsies and (iii) explore the impact of using different definitions of clinically significant disease.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^1166SAqe]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening interval evidence and modeling — Although many U.S. men are tested annually, there is no strong evidence to recommend one interscreening interval over another, and different intervals have not been compared in a randomized controlled trial setting. The ERSPC had a screening interval of 4 years (and a PSA threshold level for biopsy of 3.0 ng/mL) in most centers, and these results provide support for a benefit of screening less frequently than every year. Modeling studies project that screening every 2 years would reduce tests and unnecessary biopsies by 50% while retaining 93% of the years of life saved; another model showed almost 50% fewer tests and unnecessary biopsies and reduced overdiagnosis by 13% while retaining 87% of the years of life saved; a third model retained 95% of the years of life saved. All assumed a PSA cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL with screening starting at 50 years, and one showed similar results starting at 40 years. The average delay in diagnosis when moving from annual screening to every 2 years is estimated as between 5 months and 6 months. In men with very low PSA levels, conversion to a PSA above 4.0 ng/mL within 2 years or even 4 years after the initial test is very unlikely; for example, with an initial PSA < 1.0 ng/mL, only 0.24% had a positive test (PSA > 4 ng/mL) the following year and 0.51% at 2 years, whereas with an initial PSA of 1 ng/mL or 2 ng/mL, only 1.2% were positive at 1 year and 2.6% at 2 years.

### Risk-based prostate cancer screening [^116DFwfa]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Widespread mass screening of prostate cancer (PCa) is not recommended because the balance between benefits and harms is still not well established. The achieved mortality reduction comes with considerable harm such as unnecessary biopsies, overdiagnoses, and overtreatment. Therefore, patient stratification with regard to PCa risk and aggressiveness is necessary to identify those men who are at risk and may actually benefit from early detection.

Objective

This review critically examines the current evidence regarding risk-based PCa screening.

Evidence Acquisition

A search of the literature was performed using the Medline database. Further studies were selected based on manual searches of reference lists and review articles.

Evidence Synthesis

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been shown to be the single most significant predictive factor for identifying men at increased risk of developing PCa. Especially in men with no additional risk factors, PSA alone provides an appropriate marker up to 30 yr into the future. After assessment of an early PSA test, the screening frequency may be determined based on individualized risk. A limited list of additional factors such as age, comorbidity, prostate volume, family history, ethnicity, and previous biopsy status have been identified to modify risk and are important for consideration in routine practice. In men with a known PSA, risk calculators may hold the promise of identifying those who are at increased risk of having PCa and are therefore candidates for biopsy.

Conclusions

PSA testing may serve as the foundation for a more risk-based assessment. However, the decision to undergo early PSA testing should be a shared one between the patient and his physician based on information balancing its advantages and disadvantages.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and PSA density — risk assessment and thresholds are characterized as follows: Higher PSA level was associated with increased risks of biochemical recurrence, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality, and overall PSA level was deemed to be an important risk factor that should be assessed, documented, and used to categorize patient risk; the Panel did not include PSA density (serum PSA [ng/mL] divided by imaging measured prostate volume [cc]) in the systematic review, but an ad-hoc review demonstrated that a PSA density ≥ 0.15 ng/mL/cc has been associated with the risk of upgrading on subsequent biopsy among patients on active surveillance; the Panel believes that PSA density remains an important component of disease risk assessment and recognizes the continuous nature of risk with PSA density values, cautioning against use of threshold values in isolation for management decision-making.

### Influence of blood prostate specific antigen levels at age 60 on benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening: population based cohort study [^111YMi55]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Screening, by the use of simple tests in a healthy population, aims to identify those with who have a disease but no manifest symptoms. Patients with early stage prostate cancer are generally asymptomatic. When prostate cancer is palpable through digital rectal examination, the tumour has commonly grown through the prostate capsule. Screening and early detection by means of a blood test for prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a promising approach, since it provides the only way to identify asymptomatic men with prostate cancers that are curable. Such screening has been shown in large scale randomized trials to reduce mortality from the disease. However, screening comes at a high cost in terms of screening participation and overdiagnosis: one estimate is that for every death from prostate cancer prevented by 11 years of follow-up, 1055 men need to be invited for screening and 37 cancers need to be detected. A possible strategy to improve the ratio of benefits to harms of PSA screening is to focus screening on men at highest risk of death from prostate cancer.

One option is to use baseline PSA levels to stratify risk. There is a considerable literature showing that baseline PSA level is strongly predictive of subsequent outcomes from prostate cancer. For example, in a retrospective study based on the Malmö Preventive Project, 60 year old men who gave blood in 1981–2 as part of a cardiovascular study were followed to age 85. Rates of PSA testing were low. PSA levels assessed from stored blood samples were strongly predictive of subsequent prostate cancer mortality, with 90% of deaths occurring in men with PSA levels in the top 25% (> 2 ng/mL). Death from prostate cancer was rare (0.2%) in men with PSA levels below the median value of about 1 ng/mL.

These findings suggest that men with lower PSA levels at age 60 might be exempted from further screening. But recommendations for screening should be based on differences between screening and no screening groups, not risks within a group. For example, screening might still be justified if it reduced death rates to zero in the low PSA level group, a risk reduction of 2 per 1000 men screened.

### Mortality risk for docetaxel-treated, high-grade prostate cancer with low PSA levels: a meta-analysis [^116BuvPy]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the addition of docetaxel to standard of care (SOC) therapy with radiation and testosterone suppression or radical prostatectomy associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer–specific and all-cause deaths in patients with high-grade, nonmetastatic prostate cancer with low prostate-specific antigen levels?

Findings

In this meta-analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials (145 participants with prostate cancer), adding docetaxel to SOC treatment in patients who were in otherwise good health was associated with a significant reduction in death due to prostate cancer.

Meaning

The poor prognosis of patients with high-grade prostate cancer and low levels of prostate-specific antigen levels may be improved with the addition of docetaxel to SOC treatment.

### Prostate cancer mortality in men aged 70 years who recently underwent prostate-specific antigen screening [^113k8xqb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Primary care physicians lack clear guidance on which clinical factors, if any, should guide PSA screening decisions in older men. In this cohort study of more than 900 000 previously screened, racially and ethnically diverse men turning 70 years, we developed individualized risk models to determine long-term PCSM and mPCa using PSA values from age 65 to 69 years, race and ethnicity, and competing mortality risk. We found that PSA has profound prognostic value in differentiating men at higher or lower absolute risk of PCSM and mPCa. In particular, men with a PSA of 0.20–0.99 ng/mL between age 65 and 69 years (which was 45% of our sample) had a very low risk of undergoing prostate biopsy and of mPCa and PCSM, even among the healthiest Black men who would otherwise represent a high-risk subgroup. Meanwhile, men with a PSA of 3.00–3.99 ng/mL, had a substantially elevated risk of PCSM and mPCa compared with men with a lower baseline PSA. These data may inform shared decision-making regarding the potential benefits of continuing PSA screening past age 70 years among healthy men with high-normal PSA values and support the safety of discontinuing screening in men with low PSA values regardless of race and ethnicity or competing mortality risk.

Prior studies have described the influence of PSA values on subsequent risk of deadly prostate cancer. Seminal case-control studies in largely unscreened populations showed that a single PSA in midlife is robustly associated with long-term PCSM risk. Other analyses, such as a recent post hoc analysis of the Rotterdam section of the ERSPC randomized clinical trial, showed that older men with a screening PSA of less than 3 ng/mL, who represent the majority of older screened men, have a less than 1% risk of PCSM and are unlikely to significantly benefit from continued screening. With some exceptions, this work has typically focused on men of European ancestry, who are at lower risk of PCSM than men of African ancestry. Furthermore, we lack robust data on how competing mortality interacts with race and ethnicity and PSA to estimate long-term PCSM and mPCa risk. This lack of data creates ambiguity in which clinical factors should carry the most weight in decision making and drives variation across clinical guidelines. Given that continued screening among older men remains common (at 87% in our study, even among patients with low baseline PSA levels), clearer guidance is needed.

### Early detection, PSA screening, and management of overdiagnosis [^115oDi3a]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment rates have increased significantly since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Although it was initially thought that most prostate cancers would lead to death or significant morbidity, recent randomized trials have demonstrated that many patients with screening-detected cancer will not die of their disease. Modifications to PSA screening, screening guideline statements, and novel screening markers have been developed to minimize the risk and morbidity associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Less aggressive management strategies such as active surveillance may lead to lower treatment rates in men who are unlikely to benefit while maintaining cure rates.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111BPmBt]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — patient selection and very-low-risk criteria identify "insignificant" disease as clinical stage T1c, biopsy Grade Group 1, disease in fewer than 3 biopsy cores, < 50% involvement in any core, and PSA density < 0.15 ng/mL/g; physicians are cautioned against using these as the sole decision maker, as up to 8% were not organ-confined postoperatively. The panel states that such cancer poses little threat to individuals with a life expectancy of less than 20 years, with PSA early-detection lead time bias ranging from an estimated 12.3 years at age 55 to 6 years at age 75. The NCCN Panel consensus is that active surveillance is preferred for all patients with very-low-risk prostate cancer and life expectancy greater than 10 years.

### Are bone scans necessary in men with low prostate specific antigen levels following localized therapy? [^112YxaiH]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The prostate specific antigen level at which to recommend a bone scan after treatment of early prostate cancer is controversial. We identified the incidence of bone metastases at varying prostate specific antigen levels in asymptomatic men following radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy and watchful waiting.

Materials and Methods

Data were obtained from the Early Prostate Cancer trial comparing placebo with bicalutamide in addition to standard care for localized prostate cancer. As part of the trial patients were required to have routine bone scans regardless of prostate specific antigen levels. The prostate specific antigen levels were divided into subgroups and the incidence of positive bone scans was calculated for each group.

Results

The incidence of positive bone scans in patients treated with watchful waiting and given bicalutamide or placebo was low (0.7% to 3.2%) at prostate specific antigen levels less than 20 ng/ml. At greater than this level the sample sizes were smaller but there was a significant increase in the incidence of positive bone scans. In the groups treated with radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy, regardless of the addition of bicalutamide, the incidence of positive bone scans was low (0.2% to 1.4%) at prostate specific antigen levels less than 5 ng/ml. The sample sizes were smaller at prostate specific antigen levels greater than 5 ng/ml so the results are harder to interpret.

Conclusions

Bone scans can be confidently eliminated in the followup of patients with early prostate cancer after standard care of those with prostate specific antigen levels less than 5 ng/ml. This level can be increased to 20 ng/ml with caution in those patients treated with watchful waiting.

### Low-value prostate-specific antigen screening in older males [^115Rc4xz]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Limitations

We recognize several limitations in this study. First, the BRFSS survey data divided respondents by 5-year age intervals without providing exact ages. Since national guidelines recommend PSA screening for males aged 55 to 69 years and we defined recent screening as PSA testing within the past 2 years, the 70-year-or-older age group in this study could possibly include males who were screened at age 68 or 69 years, which is within the recommended screening range. To assess the degree to which the 70-to-74-year age group captured males who were screened at 68 years of age, we measured the proportion of those in the 70-to-74-year age group who were screened within the past year. Of those in this age group, 81.3% were screened within the past year, indicating that the youngest possible age at time of screening was more likely to be 69 years rather than 68 years. While we recognize that a small percentage of the 70-year-or-older age group may include males aged 68 to 69 years, since 69 years is the oldest recommended age for PSA screening according to USPSTF guidelines, we believe the data analysis is still meaningful in the context of low-value PSA screening for older males who would likely not benefit from PSA screening.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117TKupa]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate cancer screening — estimate of net benefit from decision analysis: Conclusions consistent with randomized trials and cohort studies suggest that more aggressive strategies, particularly those using a lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) threshold for biopsy than generally used in the United States, provide the greatest potential reduction in death from prostate cancer; however, these strategies are also associated with more false positives, more biopsies, and higher rates of overdiagnosis, and options to reduce overdiagnosis include lowering the age at which to stop screening, extending the interval between screenings, and using higher PSA thresholds for biopsy. Decision analysis models confirm that the overall benefit of PSA-based screening is sensitive to the values of individual men, and the magnitude of net benefit depends on how each man weighs the potential benefits and harms of screening, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Operating characteristics of prostate-specific antigen in men with an initial PSA level of 3.0 ng / mL or lower [^114Kuojt]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Three fourths of US men older than 50 years have been screened with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer.

Objective

To estimate the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for PSA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Calculation of PSA ROC curves in the placebo group of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, a randomized, prospective study conducted from 1993 to 2003 at 221 US centers. Participants were 18 882 healthy men aged 55 years or older without prostate cancer and with PSA levels less than or equal to 3.0 ng/mL and normal digital rectal examination results, followed up for 7 years with annual PSA measurement and digital rectal examination. If PSA level exceeded 4.0 ng/mL or rectal examination result was abnormal, a prostate biopsy was recommended. After 7 years of study participation, an end-of-study prostate biopsy was recommended in all cancer-free men.

Main Outcome Measures

Operating characteristics of PSA for prostate cancer detection, including sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve.

Results

Of 8575 men in the placebo group with at least 1 PSA measurement and digital rectal examination in the same year, 5587 (65.2%) had had at least 1 biopsy; of these, 1225 (21.9%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Of 1213 cancers with Gleason grade recorded, 250 (20.6%) were Gleason grade 7 or greater and 57 (4.7%) were Gleason grade 8 or greater. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for PSA to discriminate any prostate cancer vs no cancer, Gleason grade 7 or greater cancer vs no or lower-grade cancer, and Gleason grade 8 or greater cancer vs no or lower-grade cancer were 0.678 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.666–0.689), 0.782 (95% CI, 0.748–0.816), and 0.827 (95% CI, 0.761–0.893), respectively (all P values < .001 for AUC vs 50%). For detecting any prostate cancer, PSA cutoff values of 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, and 4.1 ng/mL yielded sensitivities of 83.4%, 52.6%, 32.2%, and 20.5%, and specificities of 38.9%, 72.5%, 86.7%, and 93.8%, respectively. Age-stratified analyses showed slightly better performance of PSA in men younger than 70 years vs those 70 years or older with AUC values of 0.699 (SD, 0.013) vs 0.663 (SD, 0.013) (P = 0.03).

Conclusion

There is no cutpoint of PSA with simultaneous high sensitivity and high specificity for monitoring healthy men for prostate cancer, but rather a continuum of prostate cancer risk at all values of PSA.

### Association of baseline prostate-specific antigen level with long-term diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer among patients aged 55 to 60 years: a secondary analysis of a cohort in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial [^114UCZZe]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are baseline prostate-specific antigen levels in midlife associated with future prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer diagnoses?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a cohort of 10 968 men aged 55 to 60 years who were enrolled in the screening group of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, baseline prostate-specific antigen levels were associated with any future prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer diagnoses. The risk was significantly lower among men with a baseline prostate-specific antigen level of less than 2.00 ng/mL.

Meaning

Future prostate cancer screening among middle-aged men (ie, aged 55–60 years) should be individually tailored based on baseline PSA levels to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent cancers.

### Diagnostic value of free prostate-specific antigen among men with a prostate-specific antigen level of… [^111SysHc]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The percentage of free prostate-specific antigen (%fPSA) improves the diagnostic accuracy for prostate cancer when the serum level of total PSA (tPSA) is elevated. Approximately 14% of men with a tPSA below 3 microg/l have prostate cancer on biopsy, but the diagnostic value of %fPSA in such men is rather unknown. The purpose was to estimate the impact of %fPSA on future prostate cancer risk among men with a normal tPSA in prostate cancer screening.

Subjects and Methods

The first round of the Finnish arm of the European Randomized Trial for Screening of Prostate Cancer in 1996 to 1999 comprised 20,793 men aged 55–67 yr. Screen-negative men (tPSA level below 3.0 microg/l, n = 17,680) were followed up until the end of 2003. Cumulative risk of prostate cancer was calculated as a function of %fPSA.

Results

During the median follow-up of 5.8 yr (range, 0–7.7 yr), 327 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 25% of them had a Gleason score of 7 or higher. Five years after the first screening, cumulative risk of prostate cancer was 1.7% (95%CI, 1.5–1.9%). Men with a %fPSA in the lowest quartile (< 14.2%) showed a 6.9-fold risk compared with those with a level in the highest quartile (> 23.7%).

Conclusions

In men with a low serum tPSA, a low %fPSA is a strong predictor of later diagnosis of prostate cancer.

### Development and validation of an 18-gene urine test for high-grade prostate cancer [^112eWgnF]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer (PCa) remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The European Randomized Study of Screening for PCa and Göteborg Randomized Prostate Cancer Screening trial showed significant reductions in cancer mortality for men participating in prostate-specific antigen (PSA)–based screening. At the same time, these studies confirmed that PSA screening leads to unnecessary invasive biopsies in men without cancer and frequent overdiagnosis of low-grade, indolent cancers (grade group [GG] 1). In response to this, current clinical guidelines offer that men with an elevated PSA level undergo multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), if available, or biomarker testing for risk stratification prior to biopsy.

Indeed, use of prostate mpMRI with targeted biopsy has improved detection of clinically significant, high-grade cancer (ie, cancer of GG 2 or greater) in men with tumors visible on mpMRI. While these data support prebiopsy mpMRI in patients requiring biopsy, the use of negative findings on mpMRI to rule out high-grade cancers in men with elevated PSA levels is not well supported. Population-level data spanning academic and community settings reveal a negative predictive value (NPV) of only 77% for high-grade cancers, and subjective interpretation of mpMRI is highly problematic, with NPVs as low as 63% by site and 40% among radiologists. Thus, even following negative findings on mpMRI, its limited sensitivity merits biopsy in a substantial proportion of men. Moreover, there are practical reasons mpMRI may not be feasible for populationwide use after PSA, including its resource burden and limited availability in the community setting.

### Prostate cancer: epidemiology and health-related quality of life [^112b2wKN]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

The dramatic increase during the past decade in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and prostate biopsies has resulted in the detection of large numbers of small lesions, an increase in the incidence of prostate cancer, and an increasing incidence-to-mortality ratio. Currently, the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is increasingly greater than the risk of dying of it. The currently available treatments for prostate cancer are not well suited to treating small or indolent tumors. Radical treatment, whether surgery or radiotherapy, can eradicate cancer effectively, but these techniques, as well as hormonal manipulations, can have adverse effects on patients' health and quality of life. Watchful waiting, or "active surveillance", has the advantage of avoiding the deleterious effects on quality of life, but it confronts patients with the emotional burden of living with an untreated cancer that could progress and metastasize. For active surveillance, no established, objective criteria are available for progression that would signal the optimal time for therapeutic intervention. PSA levels in patients with low-risk, small-volume cancers are more indicative of the size of the benign prostate or the presence of inflammation than of changes in the volume or growth of the cancer, and PSA levels inherently fluctuate, creating a low signal-to-noise ratio until the cancer is very large. Little risk exists in waiting to confirm a sustained increase in the PSA level before proceeding with a diagnostic biopsy. This policy would decrease the number of unnecessary biopsies, but still diagnose men within a safe timeframe. In studies controlled for age and comorbidity, the survival rate for patients with low-risk prostate cancer mirrors that expected in the general population. This holds true across cohorts of patients, whatever the treatment used. Because no strong medical or scientific evidence supports any particular ablative technique for low-risk prostate cancer, no standard of care has been universally accepted. Therefore, practice patterns are heterogeneous and depend more on the availability of treatments than on the features of the disease itself.

### Genome-wide association study of prostate-specific antigen levels identifies novel loci independent of prostate cancer [^111itW4Z]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a blood-based biomarker used for the detection and surveillance of prostate cancer (PCa). PCa can cause disruption of the prostate's cellular architecture, which in turn can result in PSA leaking into circulating blood. However, PSA levels can also be affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), local inflammation or infection, prostate volume, age, and germline genetics. In this regard, PSA is an organ — but not cancer — specific biomarker.

PSA screening for PCa has been used for over 20 years, but its use has declined recently because of concerns about over-diagnosis and over-treatment. While PSA levels at mid-life may modestly predict long-term PCa risk, and high PSA levels are correlated with more aggressive and lethal forms of disease, low PSA levels do not rule out PCa, and high PSA levels have a low predictive value for PCa. In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, which had substantial crossover, there was no appreciable reduction in mortality directly related to PSA screening. Another randomized trial, however, showed that PSA screening may reduce PCa mortality. Between 20 and 60% of PSA-screened PCas are estimated to be over-diagnoses, and non-aggressive PSA-detected PCas are often treated with therapy that may involve substantial side effects.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen–based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^1115e9Wd]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Medium credibility.

An additional benefit of screening is the reduction in metastases at diagnosis and after diagnosis. Effects of risk-stratified screening on this endpoint, and implications for quality of life, should be examined in future research.

Less intensive PSA screening in men with low PSA levels can substantially reduce the testing burden. The specific quantitative impact on overdiagnosis and lives saved is sensitive to the model used, but both models project that stratifying screening by PSA level is expected to reduce overdiagnosis by a modest amount while preserving the majority of the benefit of screening. Depending on how these harms and benefits are valued, our results confirm that PSA-based stratification could lead to more efficient use of the PSA test in early detection of prostate cancer.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111RMPRS]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Overview — Screening and management considerations state that use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for early detection of potentially fatal prostate cancer, together with imaging and consideration of risk calculators and/or biomarkers to improve screening specificity, should decrease the risk of overdetection. Reduced overdetection along with use of active surveillance in appropriate patients should reduce overtreatment AND preserve the relatively low rates of prostate cancer mortality.

### Illustration of association between change in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values and time to tumor status after treatment for prostate cancer patients: a joint modelling approach [^111qLbeH]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent tumor in men, and Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) serves as the primary marker for diagnosis, recurrence, and disease-free status. PSA levels post-treatment guide physicians in gauging disease progression and tumor status (low or high). Clinical follow-up relies on monitoring PSA over time, forming the basis for dynamic prediction. Our study proposes a joint model of longitudinal PSA and time to tumor shrinkage, incorporating baseline variables. The research aims to assess tumor status post-treatment for dynamic prediction, utilizing joint assessment of PSA measurements and time to tumor status.

Methods

We propose a joint model for longitudinal PSA and time to tumor shrinkage, taking into account baseline BMI and post-treatment factors, including external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), prostatectomy, and various combinations of these interventions. The model employs a mixed-effect sub-model for longitudinal PSA and an event time sub-model for tumor shrinkage.

Results

Results emphasize the significance of baseline factors in understanding the relationship between PSA trajectories and tumor status. Patients with low tumor status consistently exhibit low PSA values, decreasing exponentially within one month post-treatment. The correlation between PSA levels and tumor shrinkage is evident, with the considered factors proving to be significant in both sub-models.

Conclusions

Compared to other treatment options, ADT is the most effective in achieving a low tumor status, as evidenced by a decrease in PSA levels after months of treatment. Patients with an increased BMI were more likely to attain a low tumor status. The research enhances dynamic prediction for PCa patients, utilizing joint analysis of PSA and time to tumor shrinkage post-treatment. The developed model facilitates more effective and personalized decision-making in PCa care.

### Active surveillance for favorable risk prostate cancer: what are the results, and how safe is it? [^114vRyZy]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Active surveillance for favorable risk prostate cancer has become increasingly popular in populations in which prostate cancer screening is widespread because of evidence that prostate cancer screening results in the detection of disease that is not clinically significant in many patients (ie, untreated, would not pose a threat to health). The approach is supported by data showing that patients who fall into the category of clinically insignificant disease can be identified with reasonable accuracy and that patients who are initially classified as low risk who reclassify over time as higher risk and are treated radically are still cured in most cases. This means (1) identifying patients who have a low likelihood of disease progression during their lifetime based on clinical and pathologic features of the disease and patient age and comorbidity, (2) close monitoring over time, (3) reasonable criteria for intervention that will both identify more aggressive disease in a timely fashion and not result in excessive treatment, and (4) meeting the communication challenge to reduce the psychological burden of living with untreated cancer. The results of active surveillance, the criteria for patient selection, and the appropriate triggers for intervention are reviewed.

### Risk of prostate cancer for young men with a prostate specific antigen less than their age specific median [^116PxMoY]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We previously reported that the median prostate specific antigen for men 40 to 49 years old is 0.7 ng/ml and that a baseline prostate specific antigen between 0.7 and 2.5 ng/ml is associated with a 14.6-fold increased risk of prostate cancer. Although this suggests the need for close followup of men in their 40s with a prostate specific antigen level greater than 0.7 ng/ml, the appropriate screening strategy for men with a level less than the age specific median is unclear.

Materials and Methods

From a large prostate cancer screening study 581 participants 40 to 49 years old with a baseline prostate specific antigen level less than 0.7 ng/ml were identified. All men were classified as high risk due to a positive family history and/or black heritage. Changes in prostate specific antigen over time, the cancer detection rate and pathological tumor features were examined as a function of the baseline prostate specific antigen.

Results

At a median followup of 13 months 2 patients with an initial prostate specific antigen level less than 0.7 ng/ml reached the threshold for biopsy, and a single patient was diagnosed with prostate cancer. A significantly greater proportion of men with a baseline prostate specific antigen level greater than the age specific median had a prostate specific antigen velocity greater than 0.75 ng/ml per year (9% vs 3%, p = 0.009) and were diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 50 (4.6% vs 0.16%, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Men 40 to 49 years old with a prostate specific antigen less than the age specific median have a low risk of prostate cancer in the short term. Performing a baseline prostate specific antigen measurement in the fifth decade led to few additional biopsies, and was extremely useful for risk stratification since men with levels greater or less than the age specific median had strikingly different risk profiles.

### Prostate cancer screening and the associated controversy [^1164K9t8]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in men and the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. Widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening led to a decrease in mortality; however, PSA screening may have led to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant cancers. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released a statement recommending against the use of PSA, which was met with concern from professional organizations. This article reviews the epidemiology of prostate cancer, data from the largest screening trials, USPSTF recommendation statement, and current strategies used to improve overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^114QtBPe]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

PSA thresholds for prompting biopsy — no universal cutoff: In considering whether a biopsy should be performed based on overall or high-grade cancer risk, "no absolute PSA level exists that is applicable to all men". Instead, "the risk level at which a biopsy should be considered should be based on factors related to a man's life expectancy (age, comorbidities) as well as a man's concern regarding his risk", and because detection and treatments can entail harms, "the level of risk at which a biopsy should be undertaken should be based on a man's integration of these considerations into his decision making".

### Management of low risk prostate cancer-active surveillance and focal therapy [^114w3JTV]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Low-risk prostate cancer, defined as Gleason Score 6 or less with PSA < 10 ng/ml, is diagnosed in about half of men undergoing screening. Approximately 30% of men diagnosed with low-risk disease harbour high-grade cancer that is unrepresented on the biopsy. Moreover, a small percentage of low-grade cancers have molecular alterations that result in progression to aggressive disease. Favourable-risk prostate cancer should be managed with close follow up. Active surveillance is appropriate for most patients with low-risk disease, and radical treatment should be reserved for cases in which higher-risk disease is identified. In turn, focal therapy aims to preserve tissue and function in men who have been diagnosed with localized disease, and should be offered to men with higher risk disease at baseline, as an alternative to whole-gland radiation or surgery, or when the patient transitions from low-risk to higher-risk disease. The two strategies should be viewed as complementary elements of care that can be applied in a risk-stratified manner. In this Review, we discuss the rationale and current status of active surveillance-which constitutes a standard of care in most evidence-based guidelines-and comment on whether and when focal therapy should complement it in those men wishing to continue a tissue-preserving strategy.

### Mortality risk for docetaxel-treated, high-grade prostate cancer with low PSA levels: a meta-analysis [^114UFAyw]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with high-grade prostate cancer and low levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) have an unfavorable prognosis when compared with patients with high-grade prostate cancer with elevated PSA levels. The reason for this observation is supported by the genomic characterization of these high-grade prostate cancers with low levels of PSA (< 4 ng/mL; to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1.0) revealing genomic signatures that are associated with both resistance to testosterone suppression and a higher propensity to harbor micrometastatic disease at presentation. Therefore, for these patients, an improved treatment paradigm is needed.

Docetaxel has been shown to prolong overall survival (OS) in men with castrate-resistant and castrate-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. However, 7 prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs), that examined the role of adding docetaxel to National Cancer Center Network–defined standard of care (SOC) treatmentshave been completed and reported. The totality of evidence for use of radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with testosterone suppression alone or radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients with high-risk localized or locally advanced nonmetastatic prostate cancer suggests that treatment intensification with docetaxel does not uniformly improve treatment outcomes in these disease states.

In 1 of the 7 RCTs, a hypothesis-generating postrandomization analysis of OS stratified by PSA level was performed and yielded a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.33 among men with high-grade prostate cancer with low PSA levels when docetaxel was added to testosterone suppression for 6 months and primary radiotherapy. Furthermore, in a prior study of men with intermediate or high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer, only men with no or minimal comorbidity appeared to benefit from the addition of ADT to radiotherapy with respect to OS; those with moderate to severe comorbidity did not. Therefore, using individual patient data from the available RCTs from the Intermediate Clinical Endpoints in Cancer of the Prostate (ICECaP) Consortium database, we evaluated whether adding docetaxel to testosterone suppression plus curative local treatment (radiotherapy or RP) can reduce prostate cancer–specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM) in patients with localized or locally advanced nonmetastatic prostate cancer who have both a PSA level of less than 4 ng/mL and a biopsy Gleason score of 8 to 10 and are in otherwise good health with performance status defined as 0.

### PSA testing: an evolving relationship with prostate cancer screening [^113fkPnk]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

PSA testing has made prostate cancer screening a reality for men in many parts of the world, but its benefit for men's health continues to be debated. In men exposed to PSA testing, there has been a well-documented change in the presentation of prostate cancer with a shift towards earlier pathological stage, not without justifiable concern about over-diagnosis by prostate biopsy. Increasingly, men now diagnosed with early stage cancer have previous PSA exposure and are selected for biopsy based on PSA change in relation to cutoff values. Some recent observations suggest that PSA may no longer be an effective marker for early stage tumours, with PSA elevation failing to discriminate tumour-specific characteristics from benign gland enlargement. Traditionally, variation in pathological stage of clinically localised prostate cancer at diagnosis has related to clinical stage, PSA and biopsy Gleason grade, but with distinctions based upon these three assessments declining and an increasing proportion of organ-confined tumours at presentation, new methods of cancer detection and prognostic assessment are now required. Molecular technologies hold great promise in this respect, and in the future biomarker signatures are likely to overshadow total PSA for guiding early diagnosis and prognostic assessment. While arguments about prostate screening will continue, owing not least to its feasibility, future debate is likely to focus increasingly on technological advances and molecular profiling of these notoriously heterogeneous tumours.

### Low-value prostate-specific antigen test for prostate cancer screening and subsequent health care utilization and spending [^114hGpjP]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

To what extent is an initial low-value prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer screening associated with subsequent health services utilization and costs?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 995 442 men aged 70 years and older, 38% received a low-value PSA cancer screening between 2016 and 2018, and more than half received follow-up services, with repeated PSA testing being the most common. For every $1 spent on a low-value PSA cancer screening, an additional $6 was spent on follow-up care.

Meaning

In this study, low-value PSA screening for prostate cancer increased from 2016 to 2018 and was associated with unnecessary expenditures due to avoidable care cascades, despite multiple guidelines recommending against its routine use in men aged 70 years and older.

American Cancer Society guideline — early detection of prostate cancer: For providers and their patients who choose to be tested, the guideline offers guidance on testing frequency and actions based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and it considers the traditional PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL a reasonable threshold for further evaluation; acknowledging that there is no true PSA cutoff point distinguishing cancer from noncancer, it suggests that providers consider individualized decision making when PSA levels fall in the indeterminate range of 2.5 ng/mL to 4.0 ng/mL, particularly for men at increased risk for high-grade cancer based on non-PSA risk factors.

### Effect of a low-intensity PSA-based screening intervention on prostate cancer mortality: the CAP randomized clinical trial [^1119joCg]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prostate cancer screening remains controversial because potential mortality or quality-of-life benefits may be outweighed by harms from overdetection and overtreatment.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of a single prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening intervention and standardized diagnostic pathway on prostate cancer-specific mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP) included 419 582 men aged 50 to 69 years and was conducted at 573 primary care practices across the United Kingdom. Randomization and recruitment of the practices occurred between 2001 and 2009; patient follow-up ended on March 31, 2016.

Intervention

An invitation to attend a PSA testing clinic and receive a single PSA test vs standard (unscreened) practice.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome: prostate cancer-specific mortality at a median follow-up of 10 years. Prespecified secondary outcomes: diagnostic cancer stage and Gleason grade (range, 2–10; higher scores indicate a poorer prognosis) of prostate cancers identified, all-cause mortality, and an instrumental variable analysis estimating the causal effect of attending the PSA screening clinic.

Results

Among 415 357 randomized men (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [5.6] years), 189 386 in the intervention group and 219 439 in the control group were included in the analysis (n = 408 825; 98%). In the intervention group, 75 707 (40%) attended the PSA testing clinic and 67 313 (36%) underwent PSA testing. Of 64 436 with a valid PSA test result, 6857 (11%) had a PSA level between 3 ng/mL and 19.9 ng/mL, of whom 5850 (85%) had a prostate biopsy. After a median follow-up of 10 years, 549 (0.30 per 1000 person-years) died of prostate cancer in the intervention group vs 647 (0.31 per 1000 person-years) in the control group (rate difference, -0.013 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, -0.047 to 0.022]; rate ratio [RR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.08]; p = 0.50). The number diagnosed with prostate cancer was higher in the intervention group (n = 8054; 4.3%) than in the control group (n = 7853; 3.6%) (RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14 to 1.25]; P < .001). More prostate cancer tumors with a Gleason grade of 6 or lower were identified in the intervention group (n = 3263/189 386 [1.7%]) than in the control group (n = 2440/219 439 [1.1%]) (difference per 1000 men, 6.11 [95% CI, 5.38 to 6.84]; P < .001). In the analysis of all-cause mortality, there were 25 459 deaths in the intervention group vs 28 306 deaths in the control group (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.03]; p = 0.49). In the instrumental variable analysis for prostate cancer mortality, the adherence-adjusted causal RR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.29; p = 0.66).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among practices randomized to a single PSA screening intervention vs standard practice without screening, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality after a median follow-up of 10 years but the detection of low-risk prostate cancer cases increased. Although longer-term follow-up is under way, the findings do not support single PSA testing for population-based screening.

### Prostate-specific antigen velocity before and after elimination of factors that can confound the prostate-specific antigen level [^11141kEe]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) velocity, like PSA level, can be confounded. In this study, we estimated the impact that confounding factors could have on correctly identifying a patient with a PSA velocity > 2 ng/ml/y.

Methods and Materials

Between 2006 and 2010, a total of 50 men with newly diagnosed PC comprised the study cohort. We calculated and compared the false-positive and false-negative PSA velocity > 2 ng/ml/y rates for all men and those with low-risk disease using two approaches to calculate PSA velocity. First, we used PSA values obtained within 18 months of diagnosis; second, we used values within 18 months of diagnosis, substituting the prebiopsy PSA for a repeat, nonconfounded PSA that was obtained using the same assay and without confounders.

Results

Using PSA levels pre-biopsy, 46% of all men had a PSA velocity > 2 ng/ml/y; whereas this value declined to 32% when substituting the last prebiopsy PSA for a repeat, nonconfounded PSA using the same assay and without confounders. The false-positive rate for PSA velocity > 2 ng/ml/y was 43% as compared with a false-negative rate of PSA velocity > 2 ng/ml/y of 11% (p = 0.0008) in the overall cohort. These respective values in the low-risk subgroup were 60% and 16.7% (p = 0.09).

Conclusion

This study provides evidence to explain the discordance in cancer-specific outcomes among groups investigating the prognostic significance of PSA velocity > 2 ng/ml/y, and highlights the importance of patient education on potential confounders of the PSA test before obtaining PSA levels.

### Recent changes in prostate cancer screening practices and epidemiology [^111ifKWa]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prostate specific antigen based screening for prostate cancer has had a significant impact on the epidemiology of the disease. Its use has been associated with a significant decrease in prostate cancer mortality but has also resulted in the over diagnosis and overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer, exposing many men to the harms of treatment without benefit. The USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) in 2008 issued a recommendation against screening men older than 75 years, and in 2012 against routine screening for all men, indicating that in its interpretation the harms of screening outweigh the benefits. We review changes in the use of prostate specific antigen testing, performance of prostate biopsy, incidence of prostate cancer and stage of disease at presentation since 2012.

Materials and Methods

An English language literature search was performed for terms that included "prostate specific antigen", "screening" and "United States Preventive Services Task Force" in various combinations. A total of 26 original studies had been published on the effects of the USPSTF recommendations on prostate specific antigen based screening or prostate cancer incidence in the United States as of December 1, 2016.

Results

Review of the literature from 2012 through the end of 2016 indicates that there has been a decrease in prostate specific antigen testing and prostate biopsy. As a result, there has been a decline in the incidence of localized prostate cancer, including low, intermediate and high risk disease. The data regarding stage at presentation have yet to mature but there are some early signs of a shift toward higher burden of disease at presentation.

Conclusions

These findings raise concern about a reversal of the observed improvement in prostate cancer specific mortality during preceding decades. Alternative screening strategies would 1) incorporate patient preferences by allowing shared decision-making, 2) preserve the survival benefits associated with screening, 3) improve the specificity of screening to reduce unnecessary biopsies and detection of low risk disease, and 4) promote the use of active surveillance for low risk cancers if they are detected.

### Use of the percentage of free prostate-specific antigen to enhance… [^116415Ue]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

PSA level in this cohort of subjects with total PSA values between 4. 0 and
10. 0 ng/mL. Conclusions. — Use of the percentage of free PSA can reduce unnecessary biopsies in. patients undergoing evaluation for prostate cancer, with a minimal loss in sensitivity in detecting cancer. A cutoff of 25% or less free PSA is recommended for patients with PSA values between 4. 0 and
10. 0 ng/mL and a palpably benign gland, regardless of patient age or prostate size. To our knowledge, this. the 4. 0- to

### Ethnic differences in prostate-specific antigen levels in men without prostate cancer: a systematic review [^111U3pVK]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in males worldwide with 357 000 annual deaths. Incidence and mortality of prostate cancer differ according to ethnicity: each are twice as high in Black males compared to White males in both the USA and the UK, whereas Asian men in the UK experience lower rates.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein secreted by the prostate gland and is measured through blood testing. PSA can be elevated in patients with prostate cancer or benign prostate disease; it does not accurately discriminate between the two and the benefits of PSA screening are unclear. Evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of PSA in symptomatic men is focussed on the referred population, and the performance in men consulting primary care is unknown. The most recent systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of PSA for prostate cancer in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms found that a PSA threshold of 4 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.88, 0.96) specificity of 0.20 (95% CI 0.12, 0.33), and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.72 (95% CI 0.68, 0.76), although this did not factor in patient ethnicity and studies were at high risk of bias.

To assess a patient's risk of prostate cancer in the USA, doctors are encouraged to use their clinical judgement of a patient's PSA level in combination with factors that elevate their risk (such as whether a patient is of Black ethnicity). Patients are then referred for further tests or monitoring if necessary. In the UK, guidance from the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) provides age-specific PSA thresholds to assess a patient's risk of prostate cancer. These guidelines recommend that men with a PSA above age-specific thresholds should be offered investigation and referral for suspected prostate cancer, but does not take into account the patient's ethnicity. A recent systematic review found ethnicity to be a considerable source of heterogeneity when assessing age-adjusted PSA reference ranges and concluded ethnicity should be considered when clinically assessing PSA levels.

### The problem is not what to Do with indolent and harmless prostate cancer-the problem is how to avoid finding these cancers [^113v2S88]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

One of the most effective ways to reduce overtreatment of prostate cancer is to limit its detection in men with low-risk disease. Although many data are currently missing, we foresee a future with reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in men selected through baseline PSA values or genetic predisposition. Then selective biopsy using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and longitudinal biomarkers will play a role.

### Prostate cancer and the evolving role of biomarkers in screening and diagnosis [^113rB7vd]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of prostate cancer have substantially changed over the last 3 decades. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was adopted for screening in the 1990s after it was found to be a sensitive indicator of disease. Because of a lack of specificity for significant disease, indiscriminate PSA testing led to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Several biomarkers have been developed that are superior to PSA in stratifying a man's risk for harboring potentially lethal prostate cancer.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for the detection of prostate cancer in symptomatic patients [^112uEfTJ]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Implications for research and practice

PSA is a commonly used test to assess for the presence of prostate cancer, mostly in a primary care setting, and is recommended as part of the assessment of patients with LUTS in national guidelines. The lack of primary care evidence for the use of PSA to detect prostate cancer is known and is not the only condition for which secondary care evidence has been applied to primary care guidance. Even so, this is a major gap in knowledge, as spectrum bias means that secondary care data (or screening data) do not translate to primary care. High-quality studies in primary care populations are needed to fill this gap, and future studies should report not just on prostate cancer per se but on clinically significant cancer as well. The introduction of more accurate diagnostic tests for prostate cancer, including multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, increases the need for better understanding of the role of PSA in the early detection of symptomatic prostate cancer. PSA performance could also be enhanced by incorporating additional relevant clinical data in multivariable risk models, although only one has been validated in primary care.

Primary care clinicians are generally aware of the limitations of PSA testing, and clinical guidelines encourage a balanced discussion with patients of the potential benefits and harms of relying on PSA to detect prostate cancer. The findings of this review suggest this is a pragmatic approach in providing care to patients with LUTS. False-positive PSA results can also occur from non-cancer conditions affecting the prostate such as benign prostatic hypertrophy or prostatitis, further limiting the clinical utility of the test for prostate cancer detection. Alternative tests to PSA have been extensively researched, and some show promise of improving the level of confidence in detecting prostate cancer, though none has entered primary care practice as yet.

### Management of an increasing prostate-specific antigen level after negative prostate biopsy [^116cgiqV]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Patients who have a previously negative biopsy in the setting of clinical suspicion of prostate cancer still have a high risk of harboring significant undiagnosed disease. Various markers such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) velocity, PSA density, PCA3, and newer markers may aid in repeat biopsy selection. Repeating the same biopsy procedure in such patients does not yield high cancer detection rates. More anteriorly directed transrectal or transperineal biopsies are indicated. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging can detect abnormal areas, and lesion-targeted biopsies can improve the cancer detection rate.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^111zjN33]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test thresholds and performance — Using a threshold of 4 ng/mL in average-risk men, the rate of PSA test positivity varies between 9% and 11%, the cancer detection rate is about 3%, the positive predictive value (PPV) ranges from 28% to 32%, and specificity remains high (92%-94%). When lower thresholds are used (2.0 ng/mL or 2.5 ng/mL), PPVs are substantially higher among men with a positive family history (38%-43%) with variable specificity (64%-93%). PSA screening in higher risk populations is characterized by higher detection rates and higher PPVs, but it is stated that we still do not know whether PSA screening performs better in higher risk men in terms of reduced prostate-specific mortality; the ERSPC observed no effect of age on mortality and neither the PLCO nor the ERSPC has reported subgroup analyses examining the impact of ethnicity or family history.

### Critical appraisal of prostate-specific antigen in prostate cancer screening: 20 years later [^11562deK]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is secreted by all types of prostate epithelial cells and has been used for 2 decades as a biologic marker for prostate cancer (PCa). Since the implementation of PSA screening in the United States, the detection of PCa has increased, accompanied by a decrease in the incidence of high-grade cancer and PCa-specific mortality rates. It has been suggested that these decreases have resulted from the enhanced detection of PCa while still curable. These data have been the impetus for early detection programs, which have recommended the initiation of screening as early as 40 years of age. Despite widespread use, PSA screening remains controversial, principally because of the lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating a mortality benefit that could outweigh the concerns of the costs of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Two ongoing, randomized controlled trials are examining whether screening reduces the risk of PCa-related mortality, and the results of these studies are expected soon. Although it has its limitations, PSA still remains the best-studied marker for the detection of PCa.

### Viewpoint: expanding prostate cancer screening [^115HeSfD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The authors address 3 key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening. The authors argue, on the basis of evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening are convincing. They recommend screening for risk assessment for average-risk men beginning at age 40 years, screening selected healthy men older than age 70 years, and lowering the PSA threshold for considering biopsy to 2.5 ng/mL for all men.

### Prostate-specific antigen-enhanced testing and risk stratification for chemoprevention trials [^111dDxS9]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing could be used to identify men who are at higher future risk of developing clinical prostate cancer or to diagnose prostate cancer earlier in high-risk groups, such as black men or those with a family history of the disease. These cohorts then could be offered chemopreventive clinical trial participation opportunities. The Physicians' Health Study and other longitudinal studies have shown that even between a PSA level of 1.0 and 4.0 ng/mL, the risk of future prostate cancer is incrementally increased. Department of Defense Studies of young men between 15 and 45 show that normal men have very low PSA values. Using a threshold PSA even as low as 1.5 ng/mL for men in their fifth decade is well beyond the 95th percentile of "normal" PSA. Young black men between 40 and 49 years old have a higher risk of prostate cancer than white men and should be pursued for chemoprevention studies. PSA is not perfect. Benign prostatic hyperplasia and inflammation (and, perhaps, other factors) can confound the use of PSA thresholds to identify men for chemoprevention or early detection. Certain chemopreventive agents may affect PSA physiology without affecting the disease process itself creating a meaningless epiphenomenon. Young black men may not generally be receptive to PSA testing or chemopreventive trials.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen–based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^115Uy1Dj]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Medium credibility.

Although using two models that simultaneously approximate high-dimensional empirical data from two sources creates some robustness around the main result, it also leaves the primary scientific question partially unanswered. The models concur that a key effect of stratifying screening by PSA level is a large reduction in testing burden. The models also agree about the effects of lengthening screening intervals for men with low PSA. The models predict quantitatively different effects of early cessation for men with low PSA at age 60 years and older. Nevertheless, the models agree qualitatively across all settings that PSA-stratified strategies will lead to modest reductions in both overdiagnoses and lives saved, and therefore these strategies are ready to be evaluated in a clinical setting.

Limitations of this study include the necessary simplification of biology represented by disease models and the difficulty in quantifying uncertainty around model projections. Discrepancies between the empirical and model-predicted probabilities of prostate cancer diagnosis may be due at least in part to the unknown proportion of men who received screening tests in the later years in Sweden, which probably increased the probability of diagnosis in the observed data, and to the low number of men with baseline PSA greater than 1.5 ng/mL, leading to uncertainty in the predicted probability of diagnosis for men with PSA levels in this range. Several assumptions were made to simplify comparisons across strategies. We assumed 100% of men received biopsy after a positive PSA test. In practice, receipt of biopsy after a positive PSA test depends on patient risk factors, preferences, and comorbidities. Lower receipt of biopsy, particularly in low-risk men, is likely to reduce overdiagnosis more than it reduces lives saved under both stratified and nonstratified strategies. We also assumed receipt of definitive treatment based on patient age and tumor grade. In practice, genomic profiling, imaging, and other technologies can guide treatment selection. Our results with the greatest uncertainty concern overdiagnosis, which cannot be accurately predicted for individual patients.

### Prostate specific antigen best practice statement: 2009 update [^114MFpqg]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We provide current information on the use of PSA testing for the evaluation of men at risk for prostate cancer, and the risks and benefits of early detection.

Materials and Methods

The report is a summary of the American Urological Association PSA Best Practice Policy 2009. The summary statement is based on a review of the current professional literature, clinical experience and the expert opinions of a multispecialty panel. It is intended to serve as a resource for physicians, other health care professionals, and patients. It does not establish a fixed set of guidelines, define the legal standard of care or pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases.

Results

There are two notable differences in the current policy. First, the age for obtaining a baseline PSA has been lowered to 40 years. Secondly, the current policy no longer recommends a single, threshold value of PSA, which should prompt prostate biopsy. Rather, the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy should be based primarily on PSA and DRE results, but should take into account multiple factors including free and total PSA, patient age, PSA velocity, PSA density, family history, ethnicity, prior biopsy history and comorbidities.

Conclusions

Although recently published trials show different results regarding the impact of prostate cancer screening on mortality, both suggest that prostate cancer screening leads to overdetection and overtreatment of some patients. Therefore, men should be informed of the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening before biopsy and the option of active surveillance in lieu of immediate treatment for certain men diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Scope of review — To update its 2012 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force commissioned a systematic review of the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer and subsequent treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer, and also commissioned a review of multiple contextual questions, including existing decision analysis models and what they suggest about mitigating harms and the overdiagnosis rate of PSA-based screening.

### Risk stratification of low-risk prostate cancer: individualizing care in the era of active surveillance [^111cNfcn]. The Journal of Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

While active surveillance is the preferred management for most men with low-risk prostate cancer, a subset may harbor more aggressive disease. In this review we examine the evidence underlying an accurate and nuanced assessment of oncologic risk in these men.

Materials and Methods

We performed a nonsystematic literature review current to January 2023 on PubMed for articles relating to clinical, pathological, molecular, and imaging-based modalities available for risk assessment in men with low-risk prostate cancer. Relevant articles were reviewed by the authors and evidence was summarized.

Results

Many tools are available to personalize clinical decision-making for men with low-risk prostate cancer. Total volume of cancer, PSA density, and presence of ductal components have been consistently and strongly associated with current or future evidence of higher-grade disease. PSA kinetics, Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System 4/5 lesions on MRI, perineural invasion, germline mutations, and genomic classifiers all appear to be associated with an increased risk, although are not as extensively validated. Race, percent free PSA, and other serum biomarkers such as Prostate Health Index and 4Kscore do not appear to be associated with long-term elevated risk.

Conclusions

Long-term prognosis for men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer is excellent. There are many factors which should be routinely integrated into the initial management decision as well as determining intensity and frequency of active surveillance. Development of comprehensive multivariable instruments to guide clinical decisions is encouraged.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^113gT9RX]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) velocity — risk markers and ACS stance: A rate of increase in PSA > 0.75 ng/mL per year was associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer, and a follow-up analysis suggested that a PSA velocity as low as 0.35 ng/mL per year might be useful to differentiate cancer from noncancer. Limitations include substantial day-to-day variation in PSA, with repeat testing showing that as many as 25% no longer will be abnormal, and the high correlation of PSA velocity with the PSA value itself. In the PCPT, PSA velocity no longer influenced prostate cancer risk after incorporating PSA and other risk factors, and in the ERSPC it did not substantially improve on the performance of PSA alone; a systematic review produced little evidence that PSA kinetics provided independent predictive information beyond PSA alone. Accordingly, the ACS does not recommend routinely incorporating PSA velocity into prostate cancer screening strategies.

### Prostate-specific antigen and prostate cancer: prediction, detection and monitoring [^116VRury]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2008). Medium credibility.

Testing for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has profoundly affected the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. PSA testing has enabled physicians to detect prostate tumours while they are still small, low-grade and localized. This very ability has, however, created controversy over whether we are now diagnosing and treating insignificant cancers. PSA testing has also transformed the monitoring of treatment response and detection of disease recurrence. Much current research is directed at establishing the most appropriate uses of PSA testing and at developing methods to improve on the conventional PSA test.

### A commentary on PSA velocity and doubling time for clinical decisions in prostate cancer [^117CdrUp]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Although the value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) velocity or doubling time has never been seriously questioned for aiding the clinical management of recurrent or advanced cancer, there has historically been considerable uncertainty about PSA kinetics for decisions about biopsy and initial treatment. Recent studies, including analyses of cohorts from all the major randomized trials of localized prostate cancer, have failed to find any evidence that PSA velocity and application of PSA cutpoints are of benefit in this setting. Given current data on PSA velocity and doubling time, we propose the following "take home" messages for the practicing urologist: (1) High PSA velocity is not an indication for biopsy; (2) for men with a low total PSA but a high PSA velocity, consideration should be given to having PSA taken at a shorter interval; (3) men with an indication for biopsy should be biopsied irrespective of PSA velocity; (4) changes in PSA after negative biopsy findings do not determine the need for repeat biopsy; (5) monitoring PSA over time can aid judgment in decisions about biopsy, as informed by the clinical context; (6) PSA velocity is uninformative of risk at diagnosis; (7) high PSA velocity is not an indication for treatment in men on active surveillance; (8) PSA velocity at the time of recurrence should be entered into prediction models (or "nomograms") to aid patient counseling; (9) PSA changes after treatment for advanced disease can help indicate therapeutic response.

### Trends in active surveillance for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer [^116xdkxq]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2023, prostate cancer remains a significant health burden, with an estimated 288 300 new cases and 34 700 deaths in the US. For men with a new diagnosis, optimal treatment management depends on a variety of factors related to patients' age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, tumor stage, and pathology from standardized multicore biopsy. Risk stratification systems, including those published in Nation Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, stratify patients based on these patient oncologic characteristics, with management options tailored to a patient's estimated life expectancy. Current NCCN recommendations allow for active surveillance or definitive management with surgery or radiation for patients with favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer, with similar recommendations — sans active surveillance and with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) intensification — for those with unfavorable risk disease. Data from several prospective trials including PIVOT and UK ProtecT demonstrate comparably low prostate cancer–specific mortality for patients with low risk disease, or those diagnosed by PSA screening, randomized to active treatment with prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or observation at initial prostate cancer diagnosis. Active surveillance is the preferred strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer, and use of this strategy has increased over time. With the inclusion of an additional 4 years of data, this study is an update of our prior research reexamining national trends in implementation of active surveillance as an initial treatment strategy in men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

### Defining the optimal prostate-specific antigen threshold for the diagnosis of prostate cancer [^111irqaU]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-driven testing for prostate cancer is common around the world. There is uncertainty about its proper use in diagnosing prostate cancer. This review describes the background of the addressed problem and summarizes relevant, recent findings reported during 2008.

Recent Findings

Available data suggest that the performance characteristics of PSA do not permit the identification of a valid cutoff value that balances sensitivity and specificity in indicating a biopsy of the prostate. However, biopsy in all men by age would only lead to unacceptably high biopsy and detection rates. Data reported in this study show that within the population of men aged 55–75 years, 80% have PSA values of less than 3.0 ng/ml and 87% below 4.0 ng/ml. Data from European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Rotterdam suggest that, on the basis of a 12-year follow-up period, biopsy in men with PSA values of less than 3.0 ng/ml can safely be delayed. Several of the studies suggest that in following such men, other risk factors such as prostatic volume, previous screens and biopsies, rectal examination, age and family history may be helpful in decision making. Molecular markers, which may replace PSA or identify selectively indolent, aggressive prostate cancer, are under investigation.

Summary

At this time, PSA cutoff values (> 2.5, 3.0 or 4.0 ng/ml) provide a reasonable balance between excessive detection rates and the risk of missing relevant prostate cancer. Men presenting with PSA values of 2.0–3.0 ng/ml should be reexamined more frequently. Available nomograms applying risk modifiers should be used specifically in this category of men.

### Prostate-specific antigen levels at age 60 and lifetime risk of lethal prostate cancer [^114NJUaB]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We investigated the natural history of the relationship between PSA at age 60 and lifetime risk of prostate cancer death in an unscreened cohort followed for 40years, the Malmö Preventive Project. We also investigated whether percent free PSA could risk-stratify men with low PSAs.

Methods

The cohort included 1162 men aged 58–62 at blood draw in 1981–82, with 1151 deaths by December 31, 2020. Total and free PSA were measured for 130 men with prostate cancer and 517 without prostate cancer. Lorenz curves were calculated for life years lost to prostate cancer by baseline PSA level.

Results

Total PSA at age 60 remained highly predictive for full lifetime risk of lethal prostate cancer (C-index 0.87, 95% CI 0.82, 0.92). More than half of the life years lost to prostate cancer in this cohort were in men who had a PSA > 4.0ng/ml (59%, 95% CI 54%, 63%) at age 60, with 85% (95% CI 81%, 89%) and 92% (95% CI 90%, 94%) in men with a PSA > 2.0ng/ml and > 1.0ng/ml respectively. Percent free PSA did not aid risk stratification in men with low PSA.

Conclusion

Men with a PSA below 1–2ng/ml at age 60 are at low risk for lethal prostate cancer and do not require further PSA screening. Unlike a proven role in men with elevated PSA, percent free PSA is not useful in informing the decision to stop or continue further PSA screening for men with PSA < 2ng/ml at age 60.

### Men (aged 40–49 years) with a single baseline prostate-specific antigen below 1.0 ng / mL have a very low long-term risk of prostate cancer: results from a prospectively screened population cohort [^112hUJfH]. Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the use of a baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination in men (aged 40–49 years) in predicting long-term prostate cancer risk in a prospectively followed, representative population cohort.

Patients and Methods

Since 1990, a random sample of men in Olmsted County (aged 40–49 years) has been followed up prospectively (n = 268), with biennial visits, including a urologic questionnaire, PSA screening, and physical examination. The ensuing risk of prostate cancer (CaP) was compared using survival analyses.

Results

Median follow-up was 16.3 years (interquartile range 14.0–17.3, max 19.1). For men with a baseline PSA < 1.0 ng/mL (n = 195), the risk of subsequent Gleason 6 CaP diagnosis by 55 years was 0.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0%-1.7%) and 15.7% (95% CI 6.5%-24.9%) for men with a baseline PSA ≥ 1.0 ng/mL. No man with a low baseline PSA developed an intermediate or high risk CaP, whereas 2.6% of men with a higher baseline PSA did (95% CI 0.58%-4.6%).

Conclusion

Men (aged 40–49 years) can be stratified with a baseline PSA. If it is below 1.0 ng/mL, there is very little risk for developing a lethal CaP, and as many as 75% of men might be able to avoid additional PSA screening until 55 years. Conversely, men aged 40–49 years with a baseline PSA level > 1.0 ng/mL had a significant risk of CaP diagnosis and should be monitored more closely.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116b6Jpm]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and cancer risk — historical thresholds and biopsy-era findings: A PSA value of 4.0 ng/mL was accepted as the upper limit of normal, but prostate cancer rates were significant at lower PSA levels (between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL), and men with PSA levels < 2.5 ng/mL were believed to have low risk. With biopsies performed across all PSA levels, PSA "should not be considered 'elevated' or 'normal', because prostate cancer was identified at all levels of PSA, including values < 1.0 ng/mL", and "the higher the PSA, the higher the risk of cancer", with aggressive cancers identified at higher levels.

### Baseline prostate-specific antigen level and clinically significant prostate cancer among younger patients… [^116GdAXA]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Men with a baseline PSA level of 0. 50 to
0. 99 ng/mL and 1. 00 to

1. 99 ng/mL also had a low actuarial risk of long-term PCa and clinically significant PCa diagnosis. Compared with men with a baseline PSA level between 1. 00 and
2. 99 ng/mL, the 13-year risk of clinically significant PCa nearly doubled for men with a baseline PSA level between 2. 00 and
2. 99 ng/mL. The low 13-year actuarial risk of a clinically significant PCa diagnosis in middle-aged men with a baseline PSA level less than 2. 00 ng/mL suggests that men younger than 60 years with PSA levels of

1. 00 to 1. 99 ng/mL can undergo less intensive screening than men with higher baseline PSA levels. Men with baseline PSA levels less than 1. 00 ng/mL may wish to discontinue screening.

Most men would be affected by these changes in screening strategy because 83% of men in our study had baseline PSA levels less than 2. 00 ng/mL. In contrast, men with baseline PSA levels of 2. 00 to
2. 99 ng/mL, 3. 00 to
3. 99 ng/mL, and especially 4. 00 ng/mL or greater had 13-year actuarial risks of a clinically significant PCa diagnosis of
10. 6%, 15. 3%, and
29. 5%, respectively. These men are likely to benefit from more intensive screening strategies. There are several potential clinical interpretations of these results. First, our results suggest that younger men with a low baseline PSA level can be screened less frequently without significantly increasing the risk of future PCa-specific morbidity or mortality.

Second, improved risk-stratification of screened patients could lead to a reduction in the number of PSA tests and unnecessary prostate biopsies, thus reducing the rates of biopsy-related sepsis, anxiety and stress among patients, overdiagnoses, and overall costs to the health care system.

### Who and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^112NFfP2]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A Vickers and S Carlsson: You say that " discontinuing screening for those with low baseline risk profiles [would] significantly improve the efficiency of [PSA] screening ". Could you give a specific example of the profile of a man for whom screening should be discontinued?

M Leapman & P Carroll: Obviously, those in poor health or of advanced age do not benefit from early detection efforts. The optimal frequency of PSA testing has not been explicitly compared in a randomized fashion, but screening at 2–4 year intervals appears appropriate in low-risk patients based on PSA levels. Baseline PSA status may offer a valuable insight into a patient's further risk for harboring or developing significant prostate cancer. Persuasive evidence from a Swedish population-based cohort examining PSA levels at age 60 suggests that men with levels < 1 ng/mL possess a low (near zero) risk of prostate cancer death in extended follow-up. It would be reasonable to forego further screening of a 60-year-old without other known risk factors with baseline PSA < 1 in the absence of cause.

### Low levels of prostate-specific antigen predict long-term risk of prostate cancer: results from the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging [^116tXR2B]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the relationship between low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels that are considered normal and the long-term risk of prostate cancer.

Methods

The relative risk of, and cumulative probability of freedom from, prostate cancer by PSA level and age decade was evaluated in male participants of a longitudinal aging study, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (National Institute on Aging). The relative risk was estimated from a Cox proportional hazards regression model for men aged 40 to 49.9 (n = 351) and 50 to 59.9 (n = 445). The disease-free probability was determined by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

Results

The relative risk of prostate cancer for men aged 40 to 49.9 was 3.75 (range 1.6 to 8.6) when the PSA level was at or greater than the median (0.60 ng/mL) compared with men with PSA levels less than the median. This risk was similar for men aged 50 to 59.9 when comparing those with PSA levels greater than and less than the median (0.71 ng/mL). At 25 years, the cumulative probability of freedom from prostate cancer for men aged 40 to 49.9 was 89.6% (range 81% to 97%) and 71.6% (range 60% to 83%) when the PSA level was less than and greater than the median, respectively. The 25-year disease-free probability for men aged 50 to 59.9 was 83.6% (range 76% to 91%) and 58.9% (range 48% to 70%) when the PSA level was less than and greater than the median, respectively.

Conclusions

The association between the baseline serum PSA level and the subsequent risk of prostate cancer suggests that the biologic events that predispose to prostate cancer begin early in middle age. Men who have baseline PSA levels that are "normal" but reflect a higher risk of prostate cancer may be the most appropriate candidates for future prevention trials. Those men with the lowest risk of prostate cancer on the basis of the baseline PSA measurements are unlikely to benefit from frequent PSA surveillance in an effort to detect prostate cancer early.

### Prostate cancer screening and determining the appropriate prostate-specific antigen cutoff values [^117XkumZ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2010). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in combination with digital rectal examination forms the basis for current prostate cancer (CaP) screening programs. Although PSA screening was recently shown to reduce CaP-specific mortality in the European randomized trial, its limitations include the risk for unnecessary prostate biopsy and the diagnosis and treatment of some CaP that might never have caused suffering or death. A potential way to minimize these pitfalls is through the use of derivatives of PSA, particularly PSA kinetics, to increase the specificity for clinically relevant CaP. CaP is the second-leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States and many other westernized countries; accordingly, judicious screening of healthy men allows for diagnosis sufficiently early that all options (i.e., treatment or surveillance) are still available in most cases.

### Viewpoint: limiting prostate cancer screening [^114UBZ33]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The author addresses 3 key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening. The author argues, on the basis of evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening remain unconvincing. The author recommends that screening should not be expanded to include average-risk men younger than age 50 years or older than age 75 years and that a PSA threshold below 4.0 ng/mL should not be used to trigger biopsy referral.

### Association of the USPSTF grade D recommendation against prostate-specific antigen screening with prostate cancer-specific mortality [^117CeLKA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer remains the most common cancer diagnosed for men in the United States, with an estimated 248 530 new cases and 34 130 deaths in 2021. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provides recommendations regarding the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer. More recently, with evidence that the lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis far outweighed the lifetime risk of prostate cancer death, as well as concerns of overdiagnosis or overtreatment, the USPSTF recommended against PSA screening for men older than 75 years in 2008and subsequently transitioned to a Grade D recommendation against PSA screening for all men in 2012 (draft statement released October 2011).

This recommendation against PSA screening has remained controversial. Several studies have demonstrated that, in the years after the Grade D recommendation, there have been decreases in PSA testing, prostate biopsies, and prostate cancer diagnoses. These decreases have been accompanied by a shift to higher-stage disease, including more metastatic prostate cancers at diagnosis and fewer low-grade prostate cancers.,

We sought to understand the association between the 2012 USPSTF Grade D recommendation against PSA screening for all men and prostate cancer–specific mortality (PCSM) using contemporary, comprehensive, population-based nationwide data between 1999 and 2019, comparing mortality rates before and after the 2012 change to the screening guidelines. We also evaluated US trends in diagnoses of both localized prostate cancer and metastatic prostate cancer and in mortality from all malignant neoplasms during the same interval to better understand their association with the Grade D PSA screening recommendation.

### How sensitive is a prostate-specific antigen measurement? How sensitive does it need to be? [^114rP78d]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Assays are now available that can measure very low concentrations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), but their analytic performance and clinical utility are not well defined. This brief article highlights some of the clinical issues related to the limited prognostic significance of small changes in PSA concentrations in men with prostate cancer who have been treated with prostate ablation therapy. College of American Pathologists proficiency survey data are presented, illustrating the performance of commercial PSA assays with low PSA concentration survey samples tested between 1998 and 2002. The performance of the assays appears to be improving, but many of the currently used assays have intralaboratory coefficients of variation greater than 20% for PSA concentrations less than 0.4 ng/mL. Also, there are major differences in the level of PSA reported by various assays in these low concentration samples. These level differences (if they are also seen in clinical samples) may cause clinical problems when fixed serum PSA thresholds (eg, 0.2 ng/mL) are used to make clinical decisions related to prostate tumor recurrence.

Currently, Medicare provides coverage for an annual PSA test for all Medicare-eligible individuals over 50. Many private insurers cover PSA screening as well. What is a normal PSA test result. There is no single threshold that distinguishes a normal versus an abnormal PSA result. This is in part because there is no specific PSA level that means that someone has prostate cancer. However, the higher someone's PSA level, the likelier it is that prostate cancer is present. In general, a PSA level above 4. 0 ng/mL is considered abnormal and may result in a recommendation for prostate biopsy. However, because PSA levels increase with age, some doctors apply a higher cutoff for older men and a lower cutoff for younger men. In addition, a lower cutoff for abnormal is used in men taking certain drugs, including finasteride and dutasteride, which are used to treat BPH. These drugs lower the PSA level.

Various factors can increase someone's PSA level temporarily. An infection or inflammation of the prostate or having had a recent prostate biopsy can cause PSA levels to be raised for a month or two. Vigorous exercise and ejaculation can also increase the PSA level transiently. People are generally recommended to wait until any conditions that can change PSA level resolve before they have testing and to avoid activities that may raise the PSA level for 2 days before testing. What is done if a screening test shows an elevated PSA level. If someone who has no symptoms of prostate cancer chooses to undergo prostate cancer screening and is found to have an abnormal PSA level, the doctor may recommend another PSA test in 6 to 8 weeks to confirm the original finding. If the PSA level is still elevated, the doctor may recommend continued observation with repeat PSA tests along with digital rectal exams to watch for any changes over time.

False-positive test results are common with PSA screening. About 6%–7% of men have a false-positive PSA test on any given screening round, and only about 25% of men who have a biopsy due to an elevated PSA level are found to have prostate cancer. The United States Preventive Services Task Force has estimated that, for every 1, 000 men ages 55 to 69 years who are screened for 13 years:

### Diagnostic properties of total and free prostate-specific antigen to predict overall and clinically significant prostate cancer among men with low testosterone and prior negative biopsy [^112GxVzo]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether total serum PSA, free-PSA ratio and PSA density have similar diagnostic properties for detecting prostate cancer (PCa) and clinically-significant (cs) PCa in men with normal testosterone compared to men with low testosterone with a prior negative biopsy.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 3295 men undergoing a 2-year prostate biopsy following a negative prestudy biopsy in the placebo arm of the Reduction by Dutasteride of PCa Events (REDUCE) study. Men were divided in 2 groups based on testosterone level < or ≥ 300 ng/dL. Diagnostic properties of total serum PSA, free-PSA ratio, and PSA density to predict PCa and csPCa, defined as Gleason score ≥ 7, were determined for several thresholds and plotted as receiver operator characteristic curves.

Results

A total of 603 men (18.3%) had low testosterone. The prevalence of PCa and csPCa was 92 (15.3%) and 27 (4.5%), respectively, for low testosterone men compared to 458 (17.0%) and 138 (5.1%), correspondingly, for normal testosterone men. Total PSA, free-PSA ratio and PSA density showed similar sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy to predict PCa and csPCa among low testosterone men compared to normal testosterone men.

Conclusion

Among subjects in a clinical trial with a prior negative biopsy, total PSA, free-PSA ratio and PSA density have comparable diagnostic characteristics for PCa screening in low and normal testosterone men.

### Strategy for detection of prostate cancer based on relation between prostate specific antigen at age 40–55 and long term risk of metastasis: case-control study [^1162Vc6n]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Overview of findings

PSA concentration can be used to predict of long term risk of metastasis or death from prostate cancer. It can identify a small group of men at greatly increased risk compared with a much larger group highly unlikely to develop prostate cancer morbidity if rescreening is delayed for seven or eight years. As PSA screening was extremely rare in this cohort, our findings can be used to design screening programmes by determining the age at which men should start to undergo screening and the interval between screenings. Men at low risk of death from prostate cancer without screening have little to gain from being screened but still risk overdiagnosis and overtreatment; men likely to die from prostate cancer without screening could avoid cancer specific mortality if they choose to be screened.

In an earlier paper, we showed that PSA concentration at age 60 had a strong association with the risk of death from prostate cancer by age 85 (AUC 0.90), with extremely low risk (≤ 0.2%) in men with PSA concentration below the median (≤ 1.0 µg/L). Taken together with our current data, this suggests a simple algorithm for prostate screening. All men with a reasonable life expectancy could be invited for PSA screening in their mid to late 40s. Men with a PSA concentration < 1.0 µg/L would be advised to return for screening in their early 50s and then again at age 60, whereas men with PSA ≥ 1.0 µg/L would return for more frequent screening, with literature suggesting repeat tests every two or four years. The choice of 1.0 µg/L as a tentative threshold might vary according to preference. At age 60, men with PSA at median or lower — that is, ≤ 1.0 µg/L (or possibly below the highest quarter, ≤ 2.0 µg/L, depending on preference) — would then be exempted from further screening; men with a higher concentration would continue to undergo screening until around 70. Particular focus should be placed on men in the highest 10% of PSA concentrations at age 45–55, who will contribute close to half of all deaths from prostate cancer occurring before the age of 70–75. Some of these men will have concentrations above current thresholds for consideration of biopsy — such as 3 µg/L — and should be referred to a urologist. The remaining men could be told that, although they will probably not die from prostate cancer (with a mean risk of metastasis within 25 years close to 10%), they are at much higher risk than average and that it is especially important that they return for regular, frequent, and possibly more elaborate screening. It is also worth considering whether management of these men should become proactive, with reminder letters and attempts to follow-up non-compliers by telephone. Most importantly, the proposed PSA concentration of 1.0 µg/L to discriminate a low from a higher risk group is not suggested to serve as an indication for biopsy but rather be used to determine the frequency and intensity of subsequent monitoring.

### Low-value prostate-specific antigen test for prostate cancer screening and subsequent health care utilization and spending [^116FzNA4]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

In 2012, updating from the earlier I statement (ie, insufficient evidence) for men aged 70 to 74, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against PSA screening for prostate cancer, regardless of age (ie, D Grade), because it found that "benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer do not outweigh the harms"(no further change was made for men aged 70 and older in the 2018 update). The American Urological Association and the American College of Physicians also do not recommend routine PSA screening in men aged 70 years or older or in any man with less than a 10- to 15-years' life expectancy. PSA screening for men aged 70 years and older could lead to greater harms from false-positive results for cancers, invasive diagnostic biopsy, and treatment related to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, including more costly procedures, such as biopsy, imaging, and prostatectomy. In a previous study, 11% of men who received initial PSA screening needed additional tests to confirm whether they did or did not have cancer. Despite multiple guidelines recommending against its routine use in this population, low-value PSA tests for prostate cancer screening remain prevalent. However, to our knowledge, potentially avoidable subsequent utilization and costs of health services associated with the initial low-value PSA cancer screening have not been examined. Our study aimed to investigate care cascades of low-value PSA tests for prostate cancer screening among men 70 years of age and older enrolled in a Medical Advantage plan by analyzing: (1) utilization of and spending on low-value PSA cancer screening and associated care cascades and (2) the difference in overall health care utilization and spending among individuals after a low-value PSA cancer screening vs individuals without one.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^111Q1Yvb]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Screening test characteristics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA thresholds — systematic review and Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) findings are detailed. A systematic review of the literature was performed to assess PSA test performance among men at average risk for prostate cancer, noting that although a PSA cutoff value of 4.0 ng/mL has been used historically, many of the countries participating in the ERSPC lowered their threshold to 3.0 ng/mL. Accordingly, the review included prospective studies using either 4.0 ng/mL or 3.0 ng/mL as the cutoff value; after a full-text review of 78 studies, nine prospective studies that examined a PSA cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL in average-risk men were selected. Four studies that used a PSA cutoff of 3.0 ng/mL were deemed eligible for inclusion. In PCPT, men who had PSA levels < 3.0 ng/mL and normal DRE results were included at baseline, underwent annual PSA and DRE, and were recommended for a prostate biopsy if PSA was above 4.0 ng/mL or if DRE was abnormal; at the end of the 7-year follow-up period, all men without a diagnosis underwent a prostate biopsy. Relatively low prostate cancer detection sensitivities of 20.5% and 32.2% were reported for PSA cutoff values of 4.0 ng/mL and 3.0 ng/mL, respectively.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^1149of81]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer screening recommendations — men who choose to be screened after considering benefits and risks should follow these directives: Screening is recommended with PSA with or without DRE; screening should be conducted yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or greater; for men whose PSA is less than 2.5 ng/mL, screening intervals can be extended to every 2 years; a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL or greater historically has been used to recommend referral for further evaluation or biopsy, which remains a reasonable approach for men at average risk for prostate cancer; for PSA levels between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, health care providers should consider an individualized risk assessment that incorporates other risk factors and may be used to recommend a biopsy, noting that African American race, family history of prostate cancer, increasing age, and abnormal DRE increase risk and that a previous negative biopsy lowers risk.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111Dhxgp]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate cancer screening — age-related evidence scope and counseling: The 3 large randomized clinical trials predominantly included men aged 55 to 69 years. There is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger age or to obtain a baseline PSA level, and evidence in men 70 years or older does not support routine screening. Although some older men may request screening, men older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of the reduced likelihood of benefit and the increased risk of false-positive test results and complications of diagnosis and treatment.

### Risk of prostate cancer-related death following a low PSA level… -publications… [^114rwPes]. cdas.cancer.gov (2020). Medium credibility.

Longer-than-annual screening intervals have been suggested to improve the balance of benefits and harms in prostate cancer screening. Many researchers, societies and guideline committees have suggested that screening intervals could depend on the prostate specific antigen result. We analyzed data from men aged 55–74yrs with a baseline PSA test in the intervention arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening trial. We estimated 5- and 10-year risks of aggressive cancer and 15-year risks of prostate cancer mortality for men with baseline PSA ≤ 0. 5ng/ml, ≤ 1ng/ml and

1. 01–2. 5ng/ml. 217 men died from prostate cancer through 15yrs, though no men with PSA ≤ 1ng/ml died from prostate cancer within 5yrs. The 5-year incidence of aggressive disease was low for men with PSA ≤ 1ng/ml, and higher for men with baseline PSA 1. 01–2. 5ng/ml. No men aged ≥ 65yrs with PSA ≤ 0. 5ng/ml died from prostate cancer within 15yrs, and their 10-year incidence of aggressive disease was low. Compared to white men, black men with PSA ≤ 1ng/ml had higher 10-year rates of aggressive disease. 5-year screening intervals may be appropriate for the 45% of men with PSA ≤ 1ng/ml. Men aged ≥ 65yrs with PSA ≤ 0. 5ng/ml could consider stopping screening. Substantial risk disparities suggest appropriate screening intervals could depend on race/ethnicity.

### Screening for prostate cancer: evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^116TQ29s]. BMJ Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Long-term screening with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and systematic prostate biopsies can reduce prostate cancer mortality but leads to unacceptable overdiagnosis. Over the past decade, diagnostic methods have improved and the indolent nature of low-grade prostate cancer has been established. These advances now enable more selective detection of potentially lethal prostate cancer. This non-systematic review summarises relevant diagnostic advances, previous and ongoing screening trials, healthcare policies and important remaining knowledge gaps. Evidence synthesis and conclusions: The strong association between low serum PSA values and minimal long-term risk of prostate cancer death allows for adjusting screening intervals. Use of risk calculators, biomarkers and MRI to select men with a raised PSA value for biopsy and lesion-targeting rather than systematic prostate biopsies reduce the detection of low-grade cancer and thereby overdiagnosis. These improvements recently led the European Union to recommend its member states to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of organised screening programmes for prostate cancer. Nonetheless, important knowledge gaps remain such as the performance of modern diagnostic methods in long-term screening programmes and their impact on mortality. The knowledge gaps are currently being addressed in three large randomised screening trials. Population-based pilot programmes will contribute critical practical experience.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^117V7Q7Q]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Costs and resources

Results from a recent cost-effectiveness study modelled for the US suggested that screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years combined with active surveillance for low risk men could only be cost-effective at a $100 000 threshold if the screening frequency remains low (every four years) and active surveillance is offered to all men with low risk prostate cancer (that is, Gleason score ≤ 6 and stage ≤ T2a). Strategies with shorter screening intervals or in which immediate treatment is offered to all men were not cost-effective. Although the Rapid Recommendations panel focused on the patients' priorities rather than those of society, our recommendation is compatible with these findings.

Uncertainties for future research

Recent evidence suggests that incorporating MRI in the investigation of those with a positive PSA test result decreases the false positive rate, and thus the number of patients undergoing unnecessary biopsies, and may also increase the accuracy of biopsies in those who do have prostate cancer. The Rapid Recommendations panel considered addressing this issue in the guideline, but the impact of MRI on long term outcomes of prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment remains uncertain. Sophisticated decision modelling might shed light on this issue, but the panel decided not to conduct such an analysis because of logistic and feasibility considerations, and because the panel's review of the evidence suggests that modelling would introduce further uncertainties regarding the impact of MRI on patient-important outcomes.

Key research question to inform decision makers and future guidelines include

Could new screening and diagnostic techniques reduce the harms and burden of the diagnostic procedure by better identifying non-progressive and slowly progressive cancer from cancer that is likely to become symptomatic and affect quality or length of life? These strategies may include genetic markers or biomarkers, risk stratification tools, or MRI guided biopsy. For example, two recent high quality studies on MRI guided biopsy have shown encouraging results of MRI to reduce overdiagnosis, but the impact of this strategy on long term, patient-important outcomes (such as prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment) remains uncertain.
For men opting for screening, what would be the ideal age range and screening interval? Randomised trials varied in their offer of a one-off or repeated PSA testing and it remains uncertain which strategy is more suitable.
What is the impact of screening on men at higher baseline risk (men with a family history of cancer, of African descent, and of lower socioeconomic status)? Are their values and preferences different from those of men in the general population?

### Prevalence of prostate cancer among men with a prostate-specific antigen level [^115f8RoY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal upper limit of the normal range for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is unknown. We investigated the prevalence of prostate cancer among men in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial who had a PSA level of 4.0 ng per milliliter or less.

Methods

Of 18,882 men enrolled in the prevention trial, 9459 were randomly assigned to receive placebo and had an annual measurement of PSA and a digital rectal examination. Among these 9459 men, 2950 men never had a PSA level of more than 4.0 ng per milliliter or an abnormal digital rectal examination, had a final PSA determination, and underwent a prostate biopsy after being in the study for seven years.

Results

Among the 2950 men (age range, 62 to 91 years), prostate cancer was diagnosed in 449 (15.2 percent); 67 of these 449 cancers (14.9 percent) had a Gleason score of 7 or higher. The prevalence of prostate cancer was 6.6 percent among men with a PSA level of up to 0.5 ng per milliliter, 10.1 percent among those with values of 0.6 to 1.0 ng per milliliter, 17.0 percent among those with values of 1.1 to 2.0 ng per milliliter, 23.9 percent among those with values of 2.1 to 3.0 ng per milliliter, and 26.9 percent among those with values of 3.1 to 4.0 ng per milliliter. The prevalence of high-grade cancers increased from 12.5 percent of cancers associated with a PSA level of 0.5 ng per milliliter or less to 25.0 percent of cancers associated with a PSA level of 3.1 to 4.0 ng per milliliter.

Conclusions

Biopsy-detected prostate cancer, including high-grade cancers, is not rare among men with PSA levels of 4.0 ng per milliliter or less — levels generally thought to be in the normal range.

### Influence of blood prostate specific antigen levels at age 60 on benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening: population based cohort study [^1146jsCF]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In the current study, we noted clear differences in the effects of PSA screening depending on the baseline PSA level at age 60. Screening led to large reductions in prostate cancer mortality in the 26% (767/2918) of men with PSA levels ≥ 2 ng/mL, with relatively few men needing to be screened and diagnosed to prevent one death from prostate cancer. We saw that men with a baseline PSA level < 1 ng/mL at age 60 constitute a low risk group for 15 year risk of metastasis and prostate cancer mortality. Men with a PSA level of 1–2 ng/mL might be considered a grey area. In all, men with a baseline PSA level < 2 ng/mL correspond to approximately three quarters of 60 year olds. Thus the balance between harms and benefits of PSA screening could be optimised if focus shifted to screening men at highest risk. Continuing to screen men aged 60 with PSA levels < 1 and 1–2 ng/mL would possibly lead to overdiagnosis, with little, if any, effect of screening on preventing metastasis and death from prostate cancer. As such, exempting men aged 60 or more with PSA levels in these ranges from further rescreening would reduce their risk of overdiagnosis without compromising the risk of avoiding preventable metastasis of prostate cancer death for most men. Long term risk of cancer metastasis and death was low in men with PSA levels < 2 ng/mL, in itself a reason to limit screening in this group.

Several findings support the use of the Malmö cohort as control. The point estimate of a relative risk of 0.57 for prostate cancer mortality at 15 years was consistent with that reported from the Gothenburg trial using the randomized no screening arm as control (0.56 at 14 years). The corresponding relative risks for a diagnosis of prostate cancer were 3.65 and 1.64, respectively. The increased relative risk in this study possibly reflects both contamination in the Gothenburg control group and cancers detected for cause. Though the exact contamination in the Gothenburg control group during the course of the trial is difficult to assess, it is estimated that more than 1 in 3 men of screening age in Sweden has had a PSA test between 2000 and 2007.

### Association of the USPSTF grade D recommendation against prostate-specific antigen screening with prostate cancer-specific mortality [^111taCy5]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on PCSM rates in response to the USPSTF Grade D recommendation against PSA screening for all men using comprehensive, contemporary population-based data over 20 years (1999–2019), along with comparison with rates of localized and metastatic prostate cancer diagnoses. We have illustrated that significant changes in PCSM rates occurred across age groups, races and ethnicities, and regions, coinciding with the 2012 recommendation against PSA screening. Prior to this recommendation, the PCSM rate was decreasing annually, but this decrease stagnated or increased with the change in the screening guideline. This change also coincided with lower rates of localized prostate cancer diagnoses and higher rates of metastatic prostate cancer diagnoses, without such changes observed in overall cancer mortality.

The benefit of PSA screening has been contested over the past 2 decades. Concerns regarding overdiagnosis or overtreatment, together with 2 major trials, contributed to the 2012 USPSTF Grade D recommendation. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial demonstrated no mortality benefit for annual PSA screening after 13 years of follow-up. However, this trial was intrinsically flawed, with nearly 90% controls undergoing PSA screeningand no mandated biopsy or treatment for an elevated PSA level. Conversely, the European Randomized Screening for Prostate Cancer trial demonstrated a benefit in PCSM associated with PSA screening but also warned of a significant risk of overdiagnosis. Initial results after a median follow-up of 9 years found that the number needed to screen was 1410 and the number needed to treat was 48 to prevent 1 prostate cancer death. Longer follow-up, however, at 13 and 16 years, demonstrated greater effectiveness of PSA screening, with a lower number needed to screen (n = 570) and a lower number needed to treat (n = 18) to prevent 1 death. This finding, along with evidence demonstrating increased metastatic cancer diagnoses and aggressive prostate cancer diagnoses, as well as evidence of increased use of active surveillance for men with low-risk prostate cancer, prompted the 2018 Grade C recommendation supporting shared decision-making for PSA screening among men 55 to 69 years of age.

### Low-risk prostate cancer: identification, management, and outcomes [^115amp5m]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

The incidence of low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) has increased as a consequence of prostate-specific antigen testing.

Objective

In this collaborative review article, we examine recent literature regarding low-risk PCa and the available prognostic and therapeutic options.

Evidence Acquisition

We performed a literature review of the Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The search strategy included the terms: prostate cancer, low risk, active surveillance, focal therapy, radical prostatectomy, watchful waiting, biomarker, magnetic resonance imaging, alone or in combination.

Evidence Synthesis

Prospective randomized trials have failed to show an impact of radical treatments on cancer-specific survival in low-risk PCa patients. Several series have reported the risk of adverse pathologic outcomes at radical prostatectomy. However, it is not clear if these patients are at higher risk of death from PCa. Long-term follow-up indicates the feasibility of active surveillance in low-risk PCa patients, although approximately 30% of men starting active surveillance undergo treatment within 5 yr. Considering focal therapies, robust data investigating its impact on long-term survival outcomes are still required and therefore should be considered experimental. Magnetic resonance imaging and tissue biomarkers may help to predict clinically significant PCa in men initially diagnosed with low-risk disease.

Conclusions

The incidence of low-risk PCa has increased in recent years. Only a small proportion of men with low-risk PCa progress to clinical symptoms, metastases, or death and prospective trials have not shown a benefit for immediate radical treatments. Tissue biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging, and ongoing surveillance may help to identify those men with low-risk PCa who harbor more clinically significant disease.

Patient Summary

Low-risk prostate cancer is very common. Active surveillance has excellent long-term results, while randomized trials have failed to show a beneficial impact of immediate radical treatments on survival. Biomarkers and magnetic resonance imaging may help to identify which men may benefit from early treatment.

### Prevention and early detection of prostate cancer [^114vh4uA]. The Lancet: Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is a common malignancy in men and the worldwide burden of this disease is rising. Lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation, exercise, and weight control offer opportunities to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. Early detection of prostate cancer by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is controversial, but changes in the PSA threshold, frequency of screening, and the use of other biomarkers have the potential to minimise the overdiagnosis associated with PSA screening. Several new biomarkers for individuals with raised PSA concentrations or those diagnosed with prostate cancer are likely to identify individuals who can be spared aggressive treatment. Several pharmacological agents such as 5α-reductase inhibitors and aspirin could prevent development of prostate cancer. In this Review, we discuss the present evidence and research questions regarding prevention, early detection of prostate cancer, and management of men either at high risk of prostate cancer or diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer.

### Relationship between baseline prostate-specific antigen on cancer detection and prostate cancer death: long-term follow-up from the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer [^1118FQaU]. European Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We assessed the relationship between baseline PSA at age 55–69 yr and subsequent PCa detection and PCSM. In this PSA-based (repeated) screening setting, the overall actuarial probability at 16 yr was 12–16% for any PCa and 3.7–5.7% for csPCa. Among the men aged 65–69 yr with baseline PSA < 1.0 ng/ml, the cumulative incidence of screen-detected PCa at 16 yr was only 0.4%, most likely because these men were screened only once. For men with baseline PSA < 1.0 ng/ml at age 55–69 yr, the actuarial probability of any PCa at 16 yr was 2.7–3.0%. This low actuarial probability confirms that men with low initial PSA at age 55–69 yr are unlikely to reach the commonly applied PSA biopsy threshold of 3.0 or 4.0 ng/ml and be subsequently diagnosed with (cs)PCa. This is consistent with earlier results from the PLCO and ERSPC trials. While the actuarial probability is low for men with these baseline PSA levels, almost half of these cancers were csPCa. Men with an initial low PSA are unlikely to have benign enlargement of their prostate. Thus, when their PSA level increases and reaches the threshold for biopsy, this is an indication of cancer progression. As a result, there is less overdiagnosis in this subgroup. Conversely, men with benign enlargement of their prostate are likely to have elevated PSA and can be diagnosed with indolent tumor. These findings could also underlie our results showing that some men have low PSA for many years (median time from first screening to diagnosis is 12 yr for those aged 55–59 yr with PSA < 1.0 ng/ml) and died relatively shortly after diagnosis (median 1.7 yr). These findings would call for an improved screening algorithm for these men, who represent approximately 35% of those aged 55–75 yr. However, this should not be achieved simply by lowering the PSA biopsy threshold, as it has been estimated that the number needed to screen to avoid one man with PSA < 2.0 ng/ml dying from PCa is nearly 25 000 and the corresponding number needed to treat is 724. These numbers illustrate the scarce benefits of aggressive investigation for men with low PSA. Men eligible for repeat screening and prostate biopsy because of PSA above the threshold contribute to overdiagnosis. Here, repeat biopsies over a period of 8 yr (3 consecutive screening visits at an interval of 4 yr each) accounted for a quarter of all biopsies but yielded only < 10% of all csPCa cases.

### Prostate-specific antigen screening: pro [^113gxFPv]. Current Opinion in Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignancy among men in the USA and is most frequently diagnosed through prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening. Nevertheless, PSA testing has become increasingly controversial. In this review, we will present the evidence supporting the role of PSA in prostate cancer screening.

Recent Findings

Numerous studies have shown that the risk of current and future prostate cancer is directly related to the serum PSA level. Moreover, increasing PSA levels predict a greater risk of adverse pathologic features and worse disease-specific survival. Substantial epidemiologic evidence has suggested a reduction in advanced disease and improvements in prostate cancer survival rates since the introduction of PSA-based screening. Recently, evidence from a randomized trial further validated that PSA testing reduces both metastatic disease and prostate cancer-specific mortality.

Summary

PSA is a valid marker for prostate cancer and its aggressiveness. Level 1 evidence is now available that PSA-based screening reduces both the rate of metastatic disease and prostate cancer-specific mortality.
