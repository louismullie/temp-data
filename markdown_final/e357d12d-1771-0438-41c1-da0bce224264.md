## Question

Gbs prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about GBS prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why prophylaxis matters. Then, I should verify the core prevention strategy and its evidence base. Next, I will examine screening timing and indications, followed by intrapartum antibiotic choices and dosing. After that, I need to check duration-of-prophylaxis nuances and what to do when time is limited. I will then review special populations and penicillin allergy management, consider neonatal risk stratification and management, appraise limitations and controversies, and finally synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant algorithm with key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and the rationale for prophylaxis. GBS remains the leading cause of neonatal early-onset sepsis, with vertical transmission during labor or membrane rupture as the primary route; without intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, about 1–2% of infants born to colonized mothers develop invasive early-onset disease, which carries substantial morbidity and mortality, so prevention hinges on interrupting transmission at delivery [^b233c37f] [^c2b7062f] [^5dedb7b9].

> I need to verify the core prevention strategy and its effectiveness. Universal antenatal screening with vaginal–rectal cultures at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks, followed by intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for those who test positive, has reduced early-onset GBS disease by more than 80% in the United States, from roughly 1.8 per 1,000 live births in the 1990s to about 0.23 per 1,000 in 2015; this is the cornerstone strategy endorsed by ACOG and aligned with AAP neonatal guidance [^3804a019] [^b233c37f] [^1c2c98f7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing; I should confirm the optimal screening window. Initially, I thought 35–37 weeks was standard, but wait, let me verify the most current guidance. ACOG updated the recommendation to 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks to maximize predictive value for colonization at delivery while capturing births up to about 41 weeks; this timing balances colonization dynamics and practical obstetric care [^00910133] [^88d5aaea].

> Next, I should review who actually needs intrapartum prophylaxis and when. Prophylaxis is indicated for those with a positive screen at 36–37 weeks, GBS bacteriuria at any point in the current pregnancy, or a prior infant with invasive GBS disease; it is also indicated when GBS status is unknown at labor and intrapartum risk factors are present, namely preterm delivery, rupture of membranes for 18 hours or more, or intrapartum fever of 100.4°F or higher; importantly, prophylaxis is not indicated for cesarean delivery before labor with intact membranes, and prior colonization alone without current confirmation is not an automatic indication, though recurrence risk is about 50% and may prompt shared decision-making in some cases [^3995329a] [^23c99cc2] [^5b633eb8].

> I will now examine antibiotic selection and dosing, and I should double-check first-line choices. Penicillin G remains the agent of choice due to narrow spectrum and low resistance selection; ampicillin is an acceptable alternative; for patients with low-risk penicillin allergy, cefazolin is preferred; for high-risk allergy, clindamycin is used only if the isolate is susceptible, and vancomycin is reserved when clindamycin resistance is suspected or confirmed; dosing should aim for at least 4 hours of intrapartum exposure when feasible, with penicillin G 5 million units IV initially, then 2.5–3 million units every 4 hours until delivery [^84163a96] [^acccb109] [^03e567b3].

> But wait, what if there isn't enough time to give 4 hours of antibiotics before delivery; I need to ensure I capture the dose–response nuance. Shorter durations are less effective, yet even 2 hours can reduce vaginal colony counts and neonatal sepsis diagnoses; thus, clinicians should not delay indicated obstetric interventions solely to extend antibiotic duration, while still striving to start prophylaxis promptly upon presentation in labor or membrane rupture [^65d4640b] [^00910133].

> Let me consider special populations and penicillin allergy management, and I should confirm susceptibility testing requirements. For women with a reported penicillin allergy, ACOG recommends penicillin allergy testing when safe, because delabeling enables first-line beta-lactam prophylaxis; laboratories should be prompted to perform clindamycin susceptibility testing on GBS isolates when penicillin allergy is documented, given high clindamycin resistance rates and inferior neonatal outcomes with alternatives; vancomycin dosing should be weight- and renal-adjusted when needed [^1c358cde] [^4ef6fd45] [^acccb109].

> I should confirm preterm and PPROM scenarios, since colonization status is often unknown. In preterm labor or PPROM before 37 weeks, obtain a vaginal–rectal swab on admission and start empiric GBS prophylaxis pending results; if cultures are negative and the patient is not in labor, discontinue GBS prophylaxis, but if labor ensues or results are positive, continue prophylaxis; this approach balances the higher risk of early-onset disease in preterm infants with the need to avoid unnecessary antibiotics [^e03ce210] [^5cc4ff12].

> Next, I should review neonatal risk stratification and management, and I need to ensure I align with AAP. Adequate maternal prophylaxis is defined as penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin for at least 4 hours before delivery; infants are categorized by gestational age and maternal risk factors to guide observation versus limited evaluation and empiric therapy, with most term infants born to adequately treated mothers observed for 48 hours, while preterm infants or those with inadequate prophylaxis generally warrant a limited evaluation and observation, recognizing that categorical risk schemes result in treatment of many low-risk infants [^9b5c106f] [^3044d635].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and acknowledge limitations. The Cochrane review found that intrapartum antibiotics reduce early-onset GBS infection but did not show a mortality reduction and highlighted high risk of bias in the small, older RCTs; nonetheless, large observational datasets and decades of implementation demonstrate substantial declines in disease incidence, supporting the universal screening plus IAP approach despite the evidence quality constraints [^51479eb8] [^3804a019].

> I need to ensure I address controversies and unintended consequences. Widespread IAP has raised concerns about antimicrobial resistance, disruption of the neonatal microbiome, and increased non-GBS early-onset sepsis, particularly E. coli; surveillance and stewardship are essential, and these limitations underscore the need for vaccines and improved diagnostics to complement or replace IAP in the future [^0fc806b6] [^eb530a99] [^b1cb1f90].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it against guidelines. All pregnant patients should be screened at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks with vaginal–rectal cultures; those with positive cultures, GBS bacteriuria, or a prior infant with invasive GBS disease receive intrapartum prophylaxis with penicillin G or ampicillin, aiming for at least 4 hours when feasible; if status is unknown at labor, prophylaxis is indicated for preterm delivery, ROM ≥ 18 hours, or intrapartum fever; for penicillin allergy, use cefazolin if low risk and clindamycin or vancomycin only when appropriate and supported by susceptibilities; coordinate with pediatrics for neonatal risk assessment and follow-up [^00910133] [^3995329a] [^acccb109].

> Key takeaway, and I should confirm this aligns with the evidence: universal screening at 36–37 weeks plus timely intrapartum beta-lactam prophylaxis is the most effective available strategy to prevent neonatal early-onset GBS disease, reducing incidence by over 80% in countries with high coverage; however, implementation gaps persist, and future progress will depend on improving adherence, addressing disparities, and advancing maternal vaccination and rapid diagnostics to close remaining prevention gaps [^3804a019] [^b233c37f] [^30eda5ce].

Group B streptococcus (GBS) prophylaxis relies on **universal screening at 35–37 weeks** [^fae4b23d] and **intrapartum antibiotics** for colonized women or those with risk factors [^3995329a], which reduces early-onset GBS by ~80% [^3804a019] [^5a64511a]. Penicillin G is first-line; ampicillin or cefazolin are alternatives, with clindamycin or vancomycin reserved for high-risk penicillin allergy when susceptibility is known [^84163a96] [^acccb109]. Prophylaxis is not indicated for cesarean with intact membranes before labor [^70e7fc1b] or for prior GBS colonization without current evidence [^3995329a]. Limitations include no impact on late-onset disease [^0fc806b6], concerns about resistance [^0fc806b6], and access barriers in low-resource settings [^44ae0a21]; ongoing research targets vaccines and rapid diagnostics to address these gaps [^30eda5ce] [^8aff2160].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

GBS colonizes the vaginal and rectal flora in **10–30% of pregnant women** [^ac7d5618] [^979467a2]; vertical transmission occurs during labor or membrane rupture [^fa1842bf]. Without prophylaxis, 1–2% of infants born to colonized mothers develop early-onset GBS disease (EOGBS), including sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis [^c2b7062f] [^5dedb7b9]. Risk factors include preterm delivery, prolonged rupture of membranes, intrapartum fever, and previous infant with invasive GBS disease [^3995329a] [^c2b7062f].

---

## Screening strategies

Two primary strategies exist: **universal screening** — culture-based screening at 35–37 weeks [^fae4b23d] with intrapartum antibiotics for colonized women [^3995329a] — and **risk-based prophylaxis** — intrapartum antibiotics based on risk factors (e.g. preterm labor, prolonged rupture of membranes, intrapartum fever) [^822deaa3]. Universal screening is superior, reducing EOGBS by ~80% [^3804a019] [^b233c37f].

---

## Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP)

### Indications

IAP is indicated for:

- Positive GBS screening culture at 35–37 weeks [^3995329a].
- GBS bacteriuria at any point in pregnancy [^e61f1f03].
- Previous infant with invasive GBS disease [^3995329a].
- Unknown GBS status with risk factors (preterm delivery, prolonged rupture of membranes, intrapartum fever) [^3995329a].

---

### Antibiotic regimens

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage** |
|-|-|-|
| Penicillin G | First-line | 5 million units IV initially, then 2.5–3 million units IV every 4 hours until delivery [^5a57d1ab] |
| Ampicillin | Alternative | 2 g IV initially, then 1 g IV every 4 hours until delivery [^df4f87bb] |
| Cefazolin | Penicillin allergy (low risk) | 2 g IV initially, then 1 g IV every 8 hours until delivery [^notfound] |
| Clindamycin | Penicillin allergy (high risk) | 900 mg IV every 8 hours until delivery (if susceptible) [^notfound] |
| Vancomycin | Penicillin allergy (high risk, clindamycin-resistant) | 20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours until delivery (max 2 g/dose) [^acccb109] |

---

### Timing and duration

IAP should be administered **at least 4 hours before delivery** for optimal effectiveness [^65d4640b]; shorter durations are less effective but still beneficial [^65d4640b].

---

## Effectiveness of IAP

IAP significantly reduces EOGBS incidence from 1.8 per 1,000 live births in the 1990s to 0.23 per 1,000 in 2015 in the United States [^3804a019]. However, IAP **does not reduce late-onset GBS disease** (LOD), which occurs after 7 days of life and is associated with horizontal transmission [^0fc806b6] [^fa1842bf].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Late-onset disease**: IAP does not prevent LOD, which accounts for ~50% of infant GBS cases [^0fc806b6] [^fa1842bf].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Concerns about increasing resistance in GBS and non-GBS pathogens persist [^0fc806b6] [^eb530a99].
- **Implementation gaps**: Inadequate screening, delayed IAP, and limited access in low-resource settings hinder effectiveness [^6fe11dc3] [^44ae0a21].

---

## Current research and future directions

- **Vaccine development**: Maternal vaccination is a promising strategy to prevent both EOGBS and LOD, with several candidates in clinical trials [^30eda5ce] [^293448f2].
- **Rapid diagnostics**: Point-of-care tests may improve identification of colonized women and enable timely IAP [^8aff2160].
- **Alternative prophylaxis**: Research into non-antibiotic interventions, such as probiotics and antimicrobial peptides, is ongoing [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

GBS prophylaxis centers on **universal screening at 35–37 weeks** [^fae4b23d] and **intrapartum antibiotics** for colonized women or those with risk factors, reducing EOGBS by ~80% [^3804a019]. Limitations include no impact on LOD, resistance concerns, and implementation challenges; ongoing research into vaccines and rapid diagnostics aims to address these gaps [^0fc806b6] [^30eda5ce].

### Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease [^4ed3d5f6]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcal (GBS) infection remains the most common cause of neonatal early-onset sepsis and a significant cause of late-onset sepsis among young infants. Administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is the only currently available effective strategy for the prevention of perinatal GBS early-onset disease, and there is no effective approach for the prevention of late-onset disease. The American Academy of Pediatrics joins with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to reaffirm the use of universal antenatal microbiologic-based testing for the detection of maternal GBS colonization to facilitate appropriate administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. The purpose of this clinical report is to provide neonatal clinicians with updated information regarding the epidemiology of GBS disease as well current recommendations for the evaluation of newborn infants at risk for GBS disease and for treatment of those with confirmed GBS infection. This clinical report is endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), July 2019, and should be construed as ACOG clinical guidance.

### Duration of intrapartum prophylaxis for neonatal group B streptococcal disease: a systematic review [^ad92e6ce]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine published evidence regarding duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis administered to pregnant women colonized with group B Streptococcus (GBS) to reduce infant colonization with GBS and to prevent early-onset GBS sepsis.

Data Sources

A search was conducted in The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (1980 to January 2006), CINAHL (1982 to January 2006), and in protocols and guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Methods Of Study Selection

All randomized controlled trials and observational studies in which duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is reported relative to subsequent neonatal GBS colonization or sepsis were considered. Case series and study designs using historical cohorts or controls for comparison were excluded.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Three prospective cohort studies and one case-control study met inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity of study design and assembly of cohorts precluded meta-analysis. A systematic review of the individual studies was performed. All studies were rated as fair or poor validity with regard to their ability to evaluate duration of intrapartum prophylaxis and transmission of GBS to the newborn. All 4 studies were largely composed of women with existing risk factors for GBS disease of the newborn. One study supported more than 1 hour of prophylaxis, two studies supported more than 2 hours of prophylaxis, and one was inconclusive.

Conclusion

Despite unequivocal clinical guidelines recommending at least 4 hours of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, there are no well-designed studies examining duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of early-onset GBS disease of the newborn. We recommend continuing to initiate intrapartum prophylaxis according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines; however, the transmission of GBS to neonates exposed to less than 4 hours of intrapartum prophylaxis and their subsequent management require further study.

### Neonatal group B. streptococcus disease [^9230da0b]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important cause of neonatal sepsis in term and preterm infants. Because GBS colonizes human genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, a significant focus of neonatal GBS disease prevention is to interrupt vertical transmission of GBS from mother to infant during parturition. Routine antepartum GBS screening in pregnant women, as well as widespread use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, have aided in overall reductions in neonatal GBS disease during the past 3 decades. However, neonatal GBS disease persists and may cause mortality and significant short- and long-term morbidity among survivors. Herein, we highlight contemporary epidemiology, microbial pathogenesis, and the clinical presentation spectrum associated with neonatal GBS disease. We summarize obstetric recommendations for antenatal GBS screening, indications for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and considerations for antibiotic selection. Finally, we review national guidelines for risk assessment and management of infants at risk for GBS disease.

### Policy statement-recommendations for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease [^5a64511a]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease were initially published in 1996. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also published a policy statement on this topic in 1997. In 2002, the CDC published revised guidelines that recommended universal antenatal GBS screening; the AAP endorsed these guidelines and published recommendations based on them in the 2003 Red Book. Since then, the incidence of early-onset GBS disease in neonates has decreased by an estimated 80%. However, in 2010, GBS disease remained the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis. The CDC issued revised guidelines in 2010 based on evaluation of data generated after 2002. These revised and comprehensive guidelines, which have been endorsed by the AAP, reaffirm the major prevention strategy — universal antenatal GBS screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for culture-positive and high-risk women — and include new recommendations for laboratory methods for identification of GBS colonization during pregnancy, algorithms for screening and intrapartum prophylaxis for women with preterm labor and premature rupture of membranes, updated prophylaxis recommendations for women with a penicillin allergy, and a revised algorithm for the care of newborn infants. The purpose of this policy statement is to review and discuss the differences between the 2002 and 2010 CDC guidelines that are most relevant for the practice of pediatrics.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^fae4b23d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Despite substantial progress in prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease since the 1990s, GBS remains the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States. In 1996, CDC, in collaboration with relevant professional societies, published guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: a public health perspective. MMWR 1996;45[No. RR-7]); those guidelines were updated and republished in 2002 (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: revised guidelines from CDC. MMWR 2002;51[No. RR-11]). In June 2009, a meeting of clinical and public health representatives was held to reevaluate prevention strategies on the basis of data collected after the issuance of the 2002 guidelines. This report presents CDC's updated guidelines, which have been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Nurse-Midwives, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Society for Microbiology. The recommendations were made on the basis of available evidence when such evidence was sufficient and on expert opinion when available evidence was insufficient. The key changes in the 2010 guidelines include the following:

- expanded recommendations on laboratory methods for the identification of GBS,
- clarification of the colony-count threshold required for reporting GBS detected in the urine of pregnant women,
- updated algorithms for GBS screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes,
- a change in the recommended dose of penicillin-G for chemoprophylaxis,
- updated prophylaxis regimens for women with penicillin allergy, and
- a revised algorithm for management of newborns with respect to risk for early-onset GBS disease. Universal screening at 35–37 weeks' gestation for maternal GBS colonization and use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has resulted in substantial reductions in the burden of early-onset GBS disease among newborns. Although early-onset GBS disease has become relatively uncommon in recent years, the rates of maternal GBS colonization (and therefore the risk for early-onset GBS disease in the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis) remain unchanged since the 1970s. Continued efforts are needed to sustain and improve on the progress achieved in the prevention of GBS disease. There also is a need to monitor for potential adverse consequences of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., emergence of bacterial antimicrobial resistance or increased incidence or severity of non-GBS neonatal pathogens). In the absence of a licensed GBS vaccine, universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the cornerstones of early-onset GBS disease prevention.

### Updated guidance: prevention and management of perinatal group BInfection [^1c2c98f7]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains the most common cause of neonatal early-onset sepsis among term infants and a major cause of late-onset sepsis among both term and preterm infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published separate but aligned guidelines in 2019 and 2020 for the prevention and management of perinatal GBS disease. Together, these replace prior consensus guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis based on antenatal screening for GBS colonization remains the primary recommended approach to prevent perinatal GBS disease, though the optimal window for screening is changed to 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks of gestation rather than beginning at 35 0/7 weeks' gestation. Penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin are recommended for prophylaxis, with clindamycin and vancomycin reserved for cases of significant maternal penicillin allergy. Pregnant women with a history of penicillin allergy are now recommended to undergo skin testing, because confirmation of or delabeling from a penicillin allergy can provide both short- and long-term health benefits. Aligned with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for evaluating newborns for all causes of early-onset sepsis, separate consideration should be given to infants born at less than 35 weeks' and more than or equal to 35 weeks' gestation when performing GBS risk assessment. Empiric antibiotics are recommended for infants at high risk for GBS early-onset disease. Although intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing GBS early-onset disease, currently there is no approach for the prevention of GBS late-onset disease.

### Diagnosis and management of group B. streptococcus in pregnancy [^cf9ec149]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) can cause significant maternal and neonatal morbidity. Over the past 30 years, reductions in early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis in the United States have been attributable to the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for antepartum screening and treating this organism during labor. This article highlights the clinical implications, screening, diagnosis, prophylactic interventions, and future therapies for mothers with GBS during the peripartum period.

### Group B streptococcal disease worldwide for pregnant women, stillbirths, and children: why, what, and how to undertake estimates? [^69b8cfe5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Improving maternal, newborn, and child health is central to Sustainable Development Goal targets for 2030, requiring acceleration especially to prevent 5.6 million deaths around the time of birth. Infections contribute to this burden, but etiological data are limited. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important perinatal pathogen, although previously focus has been primarily on liveborn children, especially early-onset disease. In this first of an 11-article supplement, we discuss the following: (1) Why estimate the worldwide burden of GBS disease? (2) What outcomes of GBS in pregnancy should be included? (3) What data and epidemiological parameters are required? (4) What methods and models can be used to transparently estimate this burden of GBS? (5) What are the challenges with available data? and (6) How can estimates address data gaps to better inform GBS interventions including maternal immunization? We review all available GBS data worldwide, including maternal GBS colonization, risk of neonatal disease (with/without intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis), maternal GBS disease, neonatal/infant GBS disease, and subsequent impairment, plus GBS-associated stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal encephalopathy. We summarize our methods for searches, meta-analyses, and modeling including a compartmental model. Our approach is consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER), published in The Lancet and the Public Library of Science (PLoS). We aim to address priority epidemiological gaps highlighted by WHO to inform potential maternal vaccination.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^02ae6962]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Early-onset GBS prevention — prior recommendations and disease burden are outlined. The 2002 guidelines "recommended universal culture-based screening of all pregnant women at 35–37 weeks' gestation to optimize the identification of women who should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis". Before active prevention, "an estimated 7,500 cases of neonatal GBS disease occurred annually in the United States", with "striking declines in disease incidence" during increased prevention in the 1990s and "a further reduction" after universal screening in 2002; however, "GBS disease remains the leading infectious cause of morbidity and mortality among newborns in the United States".

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^0fc806b6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Future of GBS prevention — impact gaps and surveillance needs for group B streptococcus (GBS) are identified: Universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis have had no measurable impact on late-onset GBS disease, prenatal-onset disease (including stillbirths and miscarriages), or GBS disease among nonpregnant adults, and the burden of prenatal-onset GBS disease has not been assessed adequately with no effective prevention tools identified before the intrapartum period. Until a safe and efficacious vaccine achieves licensure, continued monitoring for potential unintended consequences of intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is needed, including tracking sentinel events such as the emergence of penicillin resistance among GBS isolates and an increase in the incidence of disease or deaths due to neonatal pathogens other than GBS, and monitoring for the latter will require long-term surveillance of a large population of term and preterm births.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^10627108]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) bacteriuria in pregnancy — prevalence, risk, colony counts, and screening — includes that GBS is found in the urine of 2%–7% of pregnant women, and maternal GBS bacteriuria is a marker for heavy genital tract colonization with an increased risk for early-onset disease in the newborn; antibiotics do not eliminate GBS and recolonization after a course of antibiotics is typical. Some women with GBS bacteriuria during the first trimester might not have vaginal-rectal colonization detected at 35–37 weeks' gestation or at the time of delivery, yet maternal GBS bacteriuria at any point during pregnancy is a recognized risk factor for early-onset GBS disease and has been included as an indication for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis since 1996. Most risk data concern significant GBS bacteriuria (generally > 10⁵ colony-forming units per milliliter of urine); lower concentrations (< 10⁴ cfu/ mL) can be associated with vaginal-rectal colonization, but relatively few data address risk among women with low-colony-count bacteriuria. Routine screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended in pregnant women, and identification of GBS through this screening represents an opportunity to detect women at high risk; however, in the context of universal late antenatal GBS screening, it is unclear how much additional disease is prevented by screening for low colony-count GBS bacteriuria and whether identification of low colony-count bacteriuria is cost-effective.

### Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease [^b233c37f]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease — Group B streptococcal (GBS) infection is described as the most common cause of neonatal early-onset sepsis and a significant cause of late-onset sepsis among young infants. The report states that administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) is the only currently available effective strategy for prevention of perinatal GBS early-onset disease (EOD), and that there is no effective approach for prevention of late-onset disease. It joins with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to "reaffirm the use of universal antenatal microbiologic-based testing for the detection of maternal GBS colonization to facilitate appropriate administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis". Background guideline history notes that the 1996 consensus guidelines recommended either an antenatal culture–based or risk factor–based approach for IAP, and that 2002 updates reflected data that universal screening "was ≥ 50% more effective at preventing the disease compared to a risk-based approach".

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^8ef453e7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

CDC 2010 prevention of perinatal group B Streptococcus (GBS) disease — key updates and prevention approach: GBS remains the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States, and initial case series reported case-fatality ratios as high as 50%. Universal screening at 35–37 weeks' gestation for maternal GBS colonization and use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has resulted in sustained reductions in early-onset disease, although rates of maternal GBS colonization remain unchanged since the 1970s. The key 2010 changes include expanded recommendations on laboratory methods, clarification of the colony-count threshold for reporting GBS bacteriuria in pregnancy, updated screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis algorithms for women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes, a change in the recommended dose of penicillin-G for chemoprophylaxis, updated prophylaxis regimens for women with penicillin allergy, and a revised algorithm for management of newborns with respect to risk for early-onset GBS disease. Colonization with GBS in the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tracts is identified as the primary risk factor, trials showed that administering intravenous antibiotics during labor to women at risk could prevent early-onset disease, and in the absence of a licensed GBS vaccine, universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the cornerstones of prevention.

- Help prevent early-onset GBS disease through intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.
- No effective strategy has yet been identified for how to prevent late-onset disease or adult disease. Risk factors Pregnancy-related risk factors The following groups are at increased risk for GBS disease:

- Pregnant and postpartum women
- Fetuses
- Neonates For neonatal disease, risk is higher among infants born to women with

- Prolonged rupture of membranes
- Preterm delivery. How it spreads Asymptomatic carriage in gastrointestinal and genital tracts is common. Intrapartum transmission via ascending spread from the vagina occurs. Mode of transmission of disease in men and non-pregnant women is not completely known.

Disease rates and trends Since its introduction, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has decreased disease in neonates in the first week of life. However, GBS bacteria remain a leading cause of meningitis and bloodstream infections in neonates younger than 3 months old. Keep Reading: Surveillance and Trends. Prevention Early-onset GBS disease can be prevented through intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. However, no effective strategy has yet been identified for how to prevent late-onset disease or adult disease. Keep Reading: Clinical Guidelines Complications Neurologic sequelae include sight or hearing loss and cerebral palsy. Death occurs in about 5% of infants and adults. Drug resistance There has been widespread use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS disease. This antibiotic use has raised concern about the development of antibiotic resistance among GBS isolates.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^822deaa3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcal (GBS) intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis — risk-based versus culture-based selection criteria and CDC recommendations are described. Early guidelines used either a risk-based approach or culture-based screening. Risk-based criteria included any of: delivery at < 37 weeks' gestation, intrapartum temperature ≥ 100.4°F (≥ 38.0°C), or rupture of membranes for ≥ 18 hours. Culture-based screening entailed vaginal and rectal GBS cultures between 35 and 37 weeks' gestation, with colonized women offered intrapartum antibiotics at labor onset or with rupture of membranes if before labor. Under both strategies, prophylaxis was recommended for women with GBS bacteriuria during the current pregnancy or a previous infant with invasive early-onset GBS disease. A large population-based study during 1998–1999 demonstrated superiority of culture-based screening; in 2002 CDC updated guidelines to recommend universal culture-based screening and recommended that women with unknown GBS colonization status at delivery be managed according to intrapartum risk factors.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^00910133]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) prevention in pregnancy — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation, and all women whose vaginal–rectal cultures at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation are positive for GBS should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed in the setting of intact membranes. Although a shorter duration of recommended intrapartum antibiotics is less effective than 4 or more hours of prophylaxis, 2 hours of antibiotic exposure has been shown to reduce GBS vaginal colony counts and decrease the frequency of a clinical neonatal sepsis diagnosis, and obstetric interventions, when necessary, should not be delayed solely to provide 4 hours of antibiotic administration before birth. Key obstetric measures include universal prenatal screening by vaginal–rectal culture and appropriate implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and targeted intravenous intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has demonstrated efficacy, whereas neither antepartum nor intrapartum oral or intramuscular regimens have been shown to be comparably effective in reducing GBS early-onset disease (EOD).

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^97643eed]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of newborn infection. The primary risk factor for neonatal GBS early-onset disease (EOD) is maternal colonization of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Approximately 50% of women who are colonized with GBS will transmit the bacteria to their newborns. Vertical transmission usually occurs during labor or after rupture of membranes. In the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, 1–2% of those newborns will develop GBS EOD. Other risk factors include gestational age of less than 37 weeks, very low birth weight, prolonged rupture of membranes, intraamniotic infection, young maternal age, and maternal black race. The key obstetric measures necessary for effective prevention of GBS EOD continue to include universal prenatal screening by vaginal-rectal culture, correct specimen collection and processing, appropriate implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and coordination with pediatric care providers.

### Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis policies for the prevention of group B streptococcal disease worldwide: systematic review [^29e76645]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis (IAP) prevents most early-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. However, there is no description of how IAP is used around the world. This article is the sixth in a series estimating the burden of GBS disease. Here we aimed to review GBS screening policies and IAP implementation worldwide.

Methods

We identified data through (1) systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean [LILACS], World Health Organization library database [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and unpublished data from professional societies and (2) an online survey and searches of policies from medical societies and professionals. We included data on whether an IAP policy was in use, and if so whether it was based on microbiological or clinical risk factors and how these were applied, as well as the estimated coverage (percentage of women receiving IAP where indicated).

Results

We received policy information from 95 of 195 (49%) countries. Of these, 60 of 95 (63%) had an IAP policy; 35 of 60 (58%) used microbiological screening, 25 of 60 (42%) used clinical risk factors. Two of 15 (13%) low-income, 4 of 16 (25%) lower-middle-income, 14 of 20 (70%) upper-middle-income, and 40 of 44 (91%) high-income countries had any IAP policy. The remaining 35 of 95 (37%) had no national policy (25/33 from low-income and lower-middle-income countries). Coverage varied considerably; for microbiological screening, median coverage was 80% (range, 20%-95%); for clinical risk factor-based screening, coverage was 29% (range, 10%-50%). Although there were differences in the microbiological screening methods employed, the individual clinical risk factors used were similar.

Conclusions

There is considerable heterogeneity in IAP screening policies and coverage worldwide. Alternative global strategies, such as maternal vaccination, are needed to enhance the scope of global prevention of GBS disease.

### Intrapartum antibiotics for known maternal group B streptococcal colonization [^51479eb8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Maternal colonization with group B streptococcus (GBS) during pregnancy increases the risk of neonatal infection by vertical transmission. Administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) during labor has been associated with a reduction in early onset GBS disease (EOGBSD). However, treating all colonized women during labor exposes a large number of women and infants to possible adverse effects without benefit.

Objectives

To assess the effect of intrapartum antibiotics for maternal Group B haemolytic streptococci (GBS) colonization on mortality from any cause, from GBS infection and from organisms other than GBS.

Search Methods

We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 11 March 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials assessing the impact of maternal IAP on neonatal GBS infections were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed eligibility and quality of the studies.

Main Results

We did not identify any new trials from the updated search so the results remain unchanged as follows. We included four trials involving 852 women. Three trials (involving 500 women) evaluating the effects of IAP versus no treatment were included. The use of IAP did not significantly reduce the incidence of all cause mortality, mortality from GBS infection or from infections caused by bacteria other than GBS. The incidence of early GBS infection was reduced with IAP compared to no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.74, three trials, 488 infants; risk difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01; number needed to treat to benefit 25, 95% CI 14 to 100, I² 0%). The incidence of LOD or sepsis from organisms other than GBS and puerperal infection was not significantly different between groups. One trial (involving 352 women) compared intrapartum ampicillin versus penicillin and reported no significant difference in neonatal or maternal outcomes. We found a high risk of bias for one or more key domains in the study methodology and execution.

Authors' Conclusions

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis appeared to reduce EOGBSD, but this result may well be due to bias as we found a high risk of bias for one or more key domains in the study methodology and execution. There is lack of evidence from well designed and conducted trials to recommend IAP to reduce neonatal EOGBSD. Ideally the effectiveness of IAP to reduce neonatal GBS infections should be studied in adequately sized double-blind controlled trials. The opportunity to conduct such trials has likely been lost, as practice guidelines (albeit without good evidence) have been introduced in many jurisdictions.

### Neonatal group B streptococcal disease: from pathogenesis to preventive strategies [^8aff2160]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Streptococcus agalactiae, or group B streptococcus (GBS), remains the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis, as early-onset or late-onset diseases (EOD, LOD). Where consensus guidelines to detect and treat intrapartum women with GBS colonization have been widely adopted, incidence of neonatal EOD has dramatically declined. In response to both successful impacts on the incidence of GBS-EOD and analyses of missed opportunities, the first American guidelines for prevention issued in the 1990s have since been adapted in several stages to improve their efficacy. In some countries in Europe, nationwide guidelines, whether screening-based or risk-based, for the prevention of neonatal GBS diseases have also been issued and adopted, with the expected impact on incidence of GBS-EOD. In spite of universal screening, in spite of the great progress that has been made, GBS-EOD continues to occur and the GBS burden remains a significant public health issue. Continuous efforts to improve screening for GBS status continue to be important and may be able to take advantage of new rapid diagnostic technologies. The current screening-based strategy for prevention is highly effective but imperfect. Given the challenges, limitations and potential complications of maternal intrapartum prophylaxis, a new approach is still needed. Maternal immunization against GBS is an attractive alternative for the prevention of not only neonatal diseases but also stillbirths and maternal diseases. Vaccines against GBS may become the most effective and sustainable long-term preventive strategy.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: a public health perspective… [^8dd04b0e]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

CDC recommends use of one of two prevention strategies. In the first strategy, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is offered to women identified as GBS carriers through prenatal screening cultures collected at 35–37 weeks' gestation and to women who develop premature onset of labor or rupture of membranes at less than 37 weeks' gestation. In the second strategy, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is provided to women who develop one or more risk conditions at the time of labor or membrane rupture. Issues addressed by these prevention guidelines include the following: the appropriate clinical and laboratory methods required for prenatal screening programs designed to identify GBS carriers; risk conditions that indicate the need for intrapartum antibiotics; management of newborns whose mothers receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS disease; and education of prenatal patients regarding GBS disease and the available prevention policy.

Immunization Several studies have indicated that susceptibility to neonatal GBS disease is caused by a deficiency of maternal anticapsular antibody. Active maternal immunization may prevent peripartum maternal disease and neonatal disease by transplacental transfer of protective IgG antibodies. Several vaccines designed to induce antibodies against the polysaccharide capsule of GBS are being developed. Because the majority of neonatal GBS infections are acquired in utero, antimicrobial agents administered to neonates, although useful for treatment, are unlikely to prevent the majority of GBS disease. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis is the most likely method of preventing both early-onset disease and maternal illness resulting from GBS; several antimicrobial regimens have been used for intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

A combination of the features of a screening-based strategy and a strategy focused on prematurity offers a comprehensive approach to perinatal GBS prevention. This combination strategy relies on detection of GBS by rectovaginal cultures collected at 35–37 weeks' gestation; because some preterm deliveries will occur before culture results are available, the strategy also provides for intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for women who begin labor and/or membrane rupture before 37 completed weeks' gestation. In particular, one study evaluated the combination strategy (i.e., prophylaxis for all women with preterm membrane rupture or labor whose culture.

### Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis policies for the prevention of group B streptococcal disease worldwide: systematic review [^60915ba9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) is a leading cause of early-onset disease in infants (EOGBS), defined as disease occurring on days 0–6 after birth. Colonization of the maternal genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract is a prerequisite for EOGBS disease, with vertical transmission of GBS to babies occurring at or just before birth. The administration of intrapartum antibiotics aims to prevent EOGBS and is traditionally targeted based on known GBS colonization and/or the presence of peripartum clinical risk factors. The potential mechanisms for prevention of EOGBS include reduction or suppression of maternal vaginal GBS colonization and thereby reduction of vertical transmission. In addition, intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis (IAP) may allow the early treatment of GBS chorioamnionitis or fetal infection.

IAP has been recommended in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Society for Microbiology, and American College of Nurse-Midwives since the early 1990s, with the first consensus policy in 1996. Initially the United States recommended both risk-based and microbiological screening. However, a large multicenter cohort study in 2002 found microbiological screening to be superior in this setting. Subsequently, policy was changed to recommend microbiologic screening (using a rectovaginal swab) for GBS colonization at 35–37 weeks' gestation or among women with threatened preterm delivery and unknown colonization status, and administration of high-dose intravenous benzylpenicillin or ampicillin in labor among those GBS colonized. Additionally, women with GBS bacteriuria or a previous infant with GBS disease as well as women with unknown colonization status and intrapartum risk factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes or maternal fever, are offered IAP in labor. A significant reduction in the incidence of EOGBS has been reported since the introduction of IAP policies; EOGBS disease in the United States declined from 1.7 per 1000 live births in the 1990s to 0.21 per 1000 live births in 2015. However, a recent Cochrane review found that although IAP may reduce the incidence of EOGBS, it did not result in a significant reduction in the mortality associated with EOGBS. The review was critical of the quality of the studies included and considered there to be a high risk of bias in their methodology and execution.

### Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis policies for the prevention of group B streptococcal disease worldwide: systematic review [^64618056]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Other countries such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have introduced IAP polices based on the presence of clinical risk factors. Risk factors used include preterm labor (< 37 weeks) or premature or prolonged preterm rupture of membranes, GBS bacteriuria, previous infant with GBS disease, and maternal pyrexia (temperature > 38°C). The use of clinical risk factor–based IAP strategies rather than microbiological screening is based on the assessment that the introduction of routine microbiological screening may not be cost-effective and that clinical risk factor–based IAP may result in fewer women being exposed to the potential risks associated with widespread antibiotic use. There is currently no international consensus as to whether IAP is best achieved through microbiological screening or based on the presence of clinical risk factors. There is evidence from the United States that the incidence of EOGBS has declined since the introduction of clinical screening strategies, although a larger proportion of women are treated with IAP using clinical as opposed to risk-based strategies. Any consensus regarding IAP strategies should take potentially opposing points into consideration.

This review is part of a supplement estimating the burden of GBS disease in pregnant women, stillbirths, and infants, an important topic that has important implications for public health policy as well as for future vaccine development. The supplement includes systematic reviews and meta-analyses on GBS colonization, and adverse outcomes associated with GBS around birth, which form input parameters to a compartmental model (Figure 1). These are reported individually and according to international guidelines.

Figure 1.
Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis in disease schema for group B streptococcal (GBS) disease, as described by Lawn et al.

The objectives of this review are:

1. To undertake a comprehensive and systematic literature review, and a survey of national obstetric and gynecological societies, to assess the presence of IAP policies worldwide, the strategies and methods used, and where possible, coverage or the status of implementation;
2. To assess these data for input into estimating the global burden of GBS in pregnancy, stillbirth, and infants;
3. To summarize the data gaps to inform future strategies for the prevention of GBS disease, including maternal vaccination, globally.

### Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent group B streptococcal infections in newborn infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing various strategies [^9e1b3ef6]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses reported that universal strategies were associated with a lower incidence of EOGBS infection compared to risk-based strategies or having no strategy. However, IAP strategies still vary considerably around the world and are largely absent in developing countries. Reasons for the variation in IAP strategies include discussion concerning increased antibiotic use, antimicrobial resistance development and risk of a possible increase in non-GBS early-onset sepsis (EOS), caused by pathogens like Escherichia coli. Moreover, even when implementing universal strategies, there is no consensus of timing of GBS determination, though most guidelines recommend determination between 35 and 37 weeks' gestation.

In order to contribute to consensus on GBS prevention strategies, this review elaborates on previous work, while incorporating up-to-date evidence on a variety of outcomes needed for evidence-based and nuanced policy-making. We evaluated the effectiveness of different prevention strategies, by comparing maternal and neonatal infectious morbidity and mortality, the frequency of IAP administration, and the presence of antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, we evaluated timing of GBS determination in universal strategies to prevent EOGBS infection in newborns.

### Antibiotic choice for group B. streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^9a06e111]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vertical transmission of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection is the most common cause of early onset neonatal sepsis and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in the newborn. To date, the only effective strategy to reduce the risk of early onset neonatal GBS disease is intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis in mothers who are known or suspected to be colonized with GBS. Implementation of national guidelines has led to a drastic decline of early onset neonatal GBS sepsis, with a nearly 8-fold decrease since 1990. Beta-lactam antibiotics, specifically penicillin and cephalosporins, are considered first-line for GBS prophylaxis because they are highly effective, have a narrow spectrum of activity, and are less likely to result in antibiotic-related complications. Unfortunately, a penicillin allergy is commonly reported with roughly 10% of the U.S. population reporting a history of a penicillin allergy, although most are unverified. The existing literature shows that there is significant variability in appropriate antibiotic selection for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis, particularly for pregnant individuals who report a penicillin allergy. Alternative antibiotics, such as clindamycin and vancomycin, are often used for patients who report a penicillin allergy even though most have a low-risk allergy or do not have a confirmed true allergy. Inappropriate use of beta-lactam alternatives has been associated with worse outcomes for non-pregnant patients and increased healthcare utilization costs. In pregnant patients, being labeled with a penicillin allergy has been associated with increased maternal morbidities and longer length of hospital stay. However, less is known about the impact of a maternal beta-lactam allergy label on the neonate in the setting of GBS prophylaxis.

While studies have shown that alternative antibiotics such as clindamycin and vancomycin can reach therapeutic levels in the fetus, they have not been demonstrated to effectively prevent neonatal GBS disease and may in fact be associated with increased rates of neonatal early-onset GBS disease. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not consider these antibiotics to be adequate prophylaxis. If a pregnant mother receives alternative antibiotics and then experiences any risk factors for neonatal GBS infection, such as fever, preterm labor or prolonged rupture of membranes, the neonate must be considered at higher risk of early onset GBS infection. During the time of our data collection (2005–2018), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that this subset of higher risk infants should undergo laboratory testing to assess for infection, with some of these infants going on to receive empiric antibiotics if labs were abnormal.

### A novel hexavalent capsular polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (GBS6) for the prevention of neonatal group B streptococcal infections by maternal immunization [^ca9ee7ed]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus agalactiae, or group B streptococcus (GBS), is an encapsulated gram-positive opportunistic pathogen associated with lower intestinal and rectovaginal colonization in 11%–35% of women. In pregnant women, the species causes ascending infections ranging from relatively benign urinary tract infections to chorioamnionitis, potentially resulting in stillbirth, preterm delivery, and puerperal sepsis. In infants, the disease most commonly occurs within the first week of life (hereafter, "early onset disease") and less commonly occurs between 7 and 90 days of life (hereafter, "late-onset disease"). Neonatal GBS disease generally manifests as sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. The global mortality rate is 8.4%, with rates in the United States and Africa of 7% and 19%, respectively. Infants surviving GBS meningitis can experience severe neurological consequences, including cognitive delay, cerebral palsy, blindness, or hearing loss.

In the United States, universal screening for rectovaginal GBS colonization is recommended for pregnant women between 35 and 37 weeks of gestation, and carriers receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis during delivery, to prevent disease. After introduction of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, the incidence of early onset disease decreased from 1.7 to 0.22 cases/1000 live births. Late-onset disease rates, however, have remained unaffected, at 0.25 cases/1000 live births. In addition, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis will not affect GBS infections before delivery, either in pregnant women or the developing fetus. Furthermore, as prophylaxis to prevent GBS diseases and infections following cesarean section has led to administration of antibiotics in approximately 40% of all labor and delivery procedures in the United States, apprehension about overuse of antibiotics is growing because of the propensity for development of antimicrobial resistance. Particularly concerning is exposure to antibiotics when the neonate's microbiome becomes established, which may lead to health consequences later in life. Finally, implementation of prenatal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis requires a well-developed infrastructure that is not available in most low-to-middle-income countries, where healthcare access and standards of prenatal care vary greatly.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^bdf81eba]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcal (GBS) prevention — universal screening strategy specifies that women with GBS isolated from the urine at any time during the current pregnancy or who had a previous infant with invasive GBS disease should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and do not need third trimester screening for GBS colonization (AII). Women with symptomatic or asymptomatic GBS urinary tract infection detected during pregnancy should be treated according to current standards of care for urinary tract infection during pregnancy and should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS disease (AIII). All other pregnant women should be screened at 35–37 weeks' gestation for vaginal and rectal GBS colonization (AII). At the time of labor or rupture of membranes, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be given to all pregnant women who tested positive for GBS colonization (AII), except in the instance of cesarean delivery performed before onset of labor on a woman with intact amniotic membranes. For circumstances in which screening results are not available at the time of labor and delivery, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be given to women who are < 37 weeks' gestation, have a duration of membrane rupture ≥ 18 hours, or have a temperature ≥ 100.4°F (≥ 38.0°C) (AII).

Preterm (at < 37 weeks and 0 days' gestation) delivery is noted as a risk factor, and colonization status is often unknown when labor or rupture of membranes occur before 35–37 weeks' gestation. Clinical trials have demonstrated that certain antibiotic regimens prolong latency, yet other data suggest harms including necrotizing enterocolitis in the neonate and adverse neonatal outcomes such as increased need for supplementary oxygen or cerebral palsy. The 2002 guidelines recommended that if GBS colonization status from the current pregnancy is not known and labor or rupture of membranes occurred before 37 weeks' gestation with substantial risk for preterm delivery, then GBS screening should be performed and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS should be provided pending culture results. When penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin prophylaxis was administered for ≥ 4 hours before delivery to women delivering at < 37 weeks' gestation, effectiveness against early-onset GBS disease was 78% (95% confidence interval: 44%–91%).

Algorithm for secondary prevention of early-onset GBS disease — prophylaxis-based management specifies the branch GBS prophylaxis indicated for mother?; if not, provide Routine clinical care, but if indicated assess whether the Mother received intravenous penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin for ≥ 4 hours before delivery? If yes, provide Observation for ≥ 48 hours, and for infants ≥ 37 weeks' gestation observation may occur at home after 24 hours if discharge criteria and supports are met; if maternal prophylaxis was inadequate and the infant is ≥ 37 weeks and duration of membrane rupture < 18 hours, provide Observation for ≥ 48 hours (some experts recommend a CBC with differential and platelets at age 6–12 hours), and if either < 37 weeks or duration of membrane rupture ≥ 18 hours, perform Limited evaluation and Observation for ≥ 48 hours.

### Laboratory practices for prenatal group B streptococcal screening – seven states, 2003 [^c1cbe4b7]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2004). Low credibility.

In the United States, group B streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of serious bacterial infections in newborns. In 1996, consensus guidelines for use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to prevent perinatal GBS disease recommended either of two methods for identifying candidates for chemoprophylaxis: 1) late prenatal culture-based screening for GBS colonization or 2) monitoring of women intrapartum for particular risk factors associated with early-onset GBS disease. Evidence that culture-based screening was substantially more effective than the risk-based approach led to revised guidelines in 2002 recommending late prenatal GBS screening for all pregnant women. Although methods for isolation and identification of GBS from prenatal specimens remained the same as those recommended in 1996, the 2002 guidelines recommended that laboratories perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing on prenatal GBS isolates from women at high risk for penicillin anaphylaxis and clarified that laboratories should report the presence of any GBS in urine specimens from pregnant women. To assess laboratory adherence to recommendations in the 2002 guidelines, CDC's Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs)/Emerging Infections Program Network surveyed clinical laboratories about prenatal culture-processing practices in 2003. This report summarizes the results of that survey, which indicated that, although adherence to GBS isolation procedures was high, opportunities exist to improve implementation of recommendations related to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and GBS bacteriuria.

### Trends in perinatal group B streptococcal disease-United States, 2000–2006 [^165bf8b3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2009). Low credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading infectious cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the United States. The bacterium, a common colonizer of the maternal genital tract, can infect the fetus during gestation, causing fetal death. GBS also can be acquired by the fetus during passage through the birth canal or after delivery. Infection commonly manifests as meningitis, pneumonia, or sepsis. In 2002, CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics issued revised guidelines for prevention of early-onset GBS disease (i.e., in infants aged < 7 days). These guidelines recommended universal screening of all pregnant women for rectovaginal GBS colonization at 35–37 weeks' gestation and administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to carriers. A report published in 2007 indicated that, during 2003–2005, the overall rate of early-onset GBS disease increased, whereas incidence of late-onset GBS disease (i.e., in infants aged 7–89 days) remained stable. This report updates the 2007 report by incorporating 2006 data from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) system. The updated analysis revealed an increase in the overall rate of early-onset GBS disease from 2003 to 2006, driven by an increasing incidence among black term infants. Late-onset GBS disease incidence among black infants, which had increased during 2003–2005, declined in 2006. Continued monitoring is needed to follow trends in early-onset GBS disease among black infants to determine whether additional interventions are warranted.

### Group B. streptococcus in pregnancy [^6ea444c4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

To decrease risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis from group B streptococcus (GBS), pregnant patients should undergo screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks' gestation. Patients with a positive vaginal-rectal culture, GBS bacteriuria, or history of newborn with GBS disease should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) with an agent targeting GBS. If GBS status is unknown at time of labor, IAP should be administered in cases of preterm birth, rupture of membranes for > 18 hours, or intrapartum fever. The antibiotic of choice is intravenous penicillin; alternatives should be considered in cases of penicillin allergy depending on allergy severity.

### Adverse events in women and children who have received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis treatment: a systematic review [^eb530a99]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Adverse events from intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) are poorly documented yet essential to inform clinical practice for neonatal group B Streptococcus (GBS) disease prevention. In this systematic review, we appraised and synthesised the evidence on the adverse events of IAP in the mother and/or her child.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Science Citation Index from date of inception until October 16th 2016. Reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews were hand-searched. We included primary studies in English that reported any adverse events from intrapartum antibiotics for any prophylactic purpose compared to controls. The search was not restricted to prophylaxis for GBS but excluded women with symptoms of infection or undergoing caesarean section. Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of studies, using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomised Studies. Results were synthesised narratively and displayed in text and tables.

Results

From 2364 unique records, 30 studies were included. Despite a wide range of adverse events reported in 17 observational studies and 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the evidence was inconsistent and at high risk of bias. Only one RCT investigated the long-term effects of IAP reporting potentially serious outcomes such as cerebral palsy; however, it had limited applicability and unclear biological plausibility. Seven observational studies showed that IAP for maternal GBS colonisation alters the infant microbiome. However, study populations were not followed through to clinical outcomes, therefore clinical significance is unknown. There was also observational evidence for increased antimicrobial resistance, however studies were at high or unclear risk of bias.

Conclusions

The evidence base to determine the frequency of adverse events from intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for neonatal GBS disease prevention is limited. As RCTs may not be possible, large, better quality, and longitudinal observational studies across countries with widespread IAP could fill this gap.

### Self-collection of samples for group B. streptococcus testing during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c57b0c8c]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a commensal bacterium that is generally found in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts of pregnant women and can be passed to their baby via maternal rectovaginal colonisation during labour, causing neonatal early-onset GBS disease (EOGBS). Maternal rectovaginal GBS colonisation varies between populations but is estimated to occur transiently in approximately 18% of pregnant women worldwide. GBS is a leading cause of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including maternal and neonatal sepsis, stillbirth, and infant death.

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) can prevent EOGBS. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends IAP administration to women with GBS colonisation, within the context of local policy and guidance on GBS screening. Some countries like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom recommend risk-based protocols, giving IAP only in the presence of peripartum clinical risk factors. Other countries, like the United States (US), recommend both risk-based and universal culture-based screening for GBS colonisation, so that IAP can be given in the case of known colonisation. Culture-based testing remains the standard for antepartum screening. There is currently no international consensus on whether to recommend risk-based or universal culture-based screening for GBS. The need for laboratory processing limits testing capabilities in low-resource settings. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis found that screening-based protocols were associated with a reduced risk of EOGBS compared to risk-based protocols, without an associated higher antibiotic administration rate. If pregnant women do screen for GBS colonisation, it is important that the sampling approach has reasonable test accuracy, as false positives can contribute to overtreatment and resultant risk of antibiotic resistance, as well as having adverse effects on neonatal microbiome development. Conversely, false negatives present a missed treatment opportunity to reduce the risk of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality.

### Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent group B streptococcal infections in newborn infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing various strategies [^826ded8e]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early-onset Group B Streptococcus (EOGBS) infection, comprising sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis, are a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, with a worldwide incidence of 0.41 per 1000 live births and a mortality rate of 4–10% in high-income countries. EOGBS infections are defined as the presence of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) within 7 days of birth in normally sterile fluids, such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Infants may be infected antenatally by vertical transmission in colonised pregnant women. Globally, GBS colonisation of the recto-vaginal tract is present in 10–30% of all pregnant women during pregnancy. Therefore, prevention of the sequelae of GBS colonisation contributes importantly to perinatal health.

Currently, prevention of vertical transmission consists of administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) at least 4 h before birth, which is associated with a reduced risk of EOGBS infection. IAP is administered according to various screening strategies applied in different settings. Risk-factor based screening ('risk-based') strategies are used in some settings, where IAP is administered according to the presence of any risk factor for EOGBS during pregnancy. In universal microbiology-based screening ('universal') strategies GBS colonisation is determined in all pregnant women antenatally and IAP is administered to women with GBS colonisation. In addition, IAP can be administered with any combination of elements from risk-based and universal strategies ('other').

### The risk factors for group B. streptococcus colonization during pregnancy and influences of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis on maternal and neonatal outcomes [^979467a2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

It was reported by a meta-analysis that estimates of maternal GBS colonization in the world vary by regions, with rates ranging from 11 to 35%. Annually, GBS infection causes high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The incidence rate of systemic invasive GBS diseases in pregnant women is 0.38 per 1000 pregnancies with case fatality rate of 0.2%. The invasive GBS disease rate in newborns is 0.49 per 1000 live births. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends pregnant women at 35–37 weeks of gestation should be screened for GBS carriage through culture-based strategy or risk-based approach. And culture-positive women or women with any risk factors for EOD should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP). According to the recommendation provided by CDC, GBS-colonized parturient women were offered IAP at the time of labor onset or rupture of membranes until their delivery, and penicillin, ampicillin and cefazolin were currently the agents of choice for IAP.

In China, universal prenatal screening for GBS carriage has not been carried out. Given the regional variations in GBS infection, it is necessary to develop a proper strategy to test GBS colonization status in women at late pregnancy. Since there are no available GBS vaccines, it is essential to evaluate the efficacy of IAP in preventing GBS-related adverse outcomes at different regions. We previously reported the combination of GBS chromogenic media with GBS carrot agar and β-γ detection agar enhanced the detection rate of GBS in vaginal and rectal swabs significantly, which was also used in this research to test GBS status among pregnant women. Wenjing Ji et al. found the incidence of invasive neonatal GBS diseases was 0.31 cases/1,000 live births and the case-fatality rate was 2.3% in China, suggesting enhanced surveillance and preventive strategies should be carried out in China. Moreover, Yao Zhu's group showed that IAP was effective in reducing GBS-EOD and recommended universal screening of maternal GBS and subsequent IAP intervention in China. In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of GBS among pregnant women in southern China, to find out the high risk-group of invasive GBS diseases and to calculate the efficacy of IAP treatment, which may aid in the development of intervention programs.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^6fedd05d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Prevention of early-onset group B streptococcal disease — Intravenous intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis reduced vertical transmission and disease, with early trials suggesting an efficacy of 100% to prevent early-onset disease among infants born to women with GBS colonization, and subsequent observational studies finding the effectiveness to be 86%–89% among infants born to women who received intrapartum GBS prophylaxis. Other strategies (intramuscular intrapartum prophylaxis, antenatal antibiotics, chlorhexidine vaginal wipes or douches) have been studied, but none has proven to be effective at preventing early-onset disease, and randomized clinical trials have found no protection against early-onset GBS disease or neonatal sepsis.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^88d5aaea]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) prevention — screening and intrapartum prophylaxis indications: All pregnant women should undergo antepartum screening for GBS at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation, providing a 5-week window that includes births up to at least 41 0/7 weeks; women with positive vaginal–rectal cultures at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed with intact membranes, and women with a positive prenatal GBS culture who have a cesarean before labor with intact membranes do not require prophylaxis; if the prenatal GBS culture is unknown when labor starts, prophylaxis is indicated for risk factors including a substantial risk of preterm birth, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), rupture of membranes for 18 or more hours at term, or intrapartum fever (temperature 100.4°F [38°C] or higher), and if intraamniotic infection is suspected, broad-spectrum therapy should replace GBS-specific prophylaxis; for term labor with unknown colonization but a prior history of GBS colonization in a previous pregnancy, it is reasonable to offer intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and clinicians may consider discussing empiric intrapartum prophylaxis as a shared decision-making process.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^4c1dcb11]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Implementation and impact of group B Streptococcus (GBS) prevention efforts — following the 2002 recommendation for universal culture screening, implementation was rapid and widespread. The proportion of infants whose mothers were screened before delivery increased from 48.1% during 1998–1999 to 85.0% during 2003–2004; among women screened during 2003–2004, 98.4% had a result available at labor and 24.2% were documented as GBS-positive. Among mothers with an indication for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, receipt increased from 73.8% during 1998–1999 to 85.1% during 2003–2004. Gaps persisted in preterm care: because antenatal screening is recommended at 35–37 weeks of gestation, only 50.3% of women delivering preterm had a known colonization status at admission; among women with unknown status who delivered preterm only 63.4% received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, 73.5% received prophylaxis for indications of GBS bacteriuria or a previous infant with GBS disease, and 84.5% received prophylaxis when the GBS screen was positive. Screening on admission among women with threatened preterm delivery and unknown colonization status was suboptimal, with only 18% who progressed to delivery and 31% who did not progress to delivery screened. Overall, the proportion of laboring women who received intrapartum antibiotics increased only slightly, from 26.8% to 31.7%, and penicillin and ampicillin remained the most common agents administered, with 76.7% of women receiving intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis receiving these agents.

### Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease [^b14ab37c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) — ACOG screening and indications specify that ACOG recommends universal antenatal testing of pregnant women for group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization using vaginal–rectal cultures obtained at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks' gestation, with testing also recommended for those in preterm labor and/or with PROM before 37 0/7 weeks' gestation. IAP at presentation for delivery is indicated for women with antenatal vaginal–rectal culture GBS colonization, GBS bacteriuria at any point during pregnancy, a history of a previous infant with GBS disease, and for women who present in preterm labor and/or with PROM at < 37 0/7 weeks' gestation. For women in labor at ≥ 37 0/7 weeks' gestation with unknown GBS status, IAP should be given if intrapartum risk factors develop — maternal intrapartum temperature ≥ 100.4°F [38°C] or duration of ROM ≥ 18 hours — or if a point-of-care NAAT is positive for group B streptococcus. If a woman with unknown status has a negative point-of-care NAAT but develops intrapartum risk factors, IAP should be administered because the sensitivity of the NAAT may be decreased without an enrichment incubation step. Women with GBS colonization in one pregnancy have an estimated 50% risk of colonization in a subsequent pregnancy, and if a woman with unknown GBS status presents in labor and is known to have had prior GBS colonization, IAP may be considered.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^84163a96]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis — antimicrobial agents and goals are defined, with agent selection prioritized. Prophylaxis to reduce risk of GBS early-onset disease (EOD) "is based on a two-pronged approach" of decreasing neonatal colonization and reducing neonatal sepsis by ensuring adequate maternal, fetal, and newborn drug levels. "Intravenous penicillin remains the agent of choice for intrapartum prophylaxis, with intravenous ampicillin as an acceptable alternative", and penicillin is preferred first line due to a narrower spectrum and lower resistance selection risk. Recommended dosages were developed to achieve levels "above the minimal inhibitory concentration for GBS" in fetal blood and amniotic fluid while minimizing maternal toxicity.

### Perinatal group B streptococcal disease after universal screening recommendations – United States, 2003–2005 [^ff3af3da]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the United States. In 2002, CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued revised guidelines for the prevention of perinatal GBS disease. These guidelines recommend universal screening of pregnant women by culture for rectovaginal GBS colonization at 35–37 weeks' gestation and the use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS carriers. To examine rates of neonatal and pregnancy-associated GBS disease after the revised guidelines were issued, CDC analyzed surveillance data from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) system from the period 2003–2005 and compared them with data from 2000–2001, the period immediately preceding the universal screening recommendations. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that annual incidence of early onset GBS disease (i.e., in infants aged 0–6 days) was 33% lower during 2003–2005 than during 2000–2001. However, although incidence among white infants decreased steadily during 2003–2005, incidence increased 70% among black infants. Incidence of GBS disease among infants aged 7–89 days (i.e., late-onset disease) and pregnant women remained stable after revised universal screening guidelines were issued. Continued surveillance is needed to monitor the impact of the guidelines on perinatal GBS disease and trends in racial disparities and to guide interventions to reduce disparities.

### Avoiding inadequate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for group B streptococci [^dab6bb36]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the frequency and reasons for inadequate group B streptococci (GBS) prophylaxis at our institution and to estimate what proportion of cases can be avoided with perfect protocol adherence.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of neonates born to GBS-colonized women who received inadequate prophylaxis between April 30, 2013, and May 1, 2014. The maternal chart was analyzed to categorize each case as avoidable (adequate time on labor and delivery to receive antibiotics 4 hours before birth and β-lactam antibiotic-eligible) or unavoidable and to determine whether a violation of the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol (delayed or incorrect antibiotics) occurred.

Results

A total of 197 of 488 (40.4%, 95% confidence interval 36.1–44.8%) newborns of group B-colonized women received inadequate prophylaxis. Of these, 157 cases (79.7%, 73.4–84.8%) were unavoidable and would have occurred even with perfect protocol adherence. The 40 (20.3%, 15.3–26.5%) avoidable cases due to protocol violations resulted from delayed antibiotic administration (first dose of antibiotics more than 1 hour after admission [median 9.33 hours, range 3.83–25 hours] in 25 patients; no antibiotics in four patients; total 29 patients, 72.5%) or incorrect antibiotic selection (11 patients, 27.5%).

Conclusions

Forty percent of patients received inadequate prophylaxis, and four of five cases are unavoidable with our current labor management and the 2010 CDC guidelines. Timeliness and selection of antibiotics remain areas for improvement, but the overall effects on sepsis prevention will be modest.

### Adherence to perinatal group B streptococcal prevention guidelines [^403da4fe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate compliance with the 2002 revised perinatal group B streptococci (GBS) prevention guidelines in Tennessee, which recommend universal GBS screening of pregnant women at 35–37 weeks of gestation and, when indicated, administration of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

Methods

Active Bacterial Core surveillance conducts active, population-based surveillance for invasive GBS disease in 11 Tennessee counties. A retrospective case-cohort study was conducted using a stratified random sample of all live births in surveillance hospitals during 2003–2004, including all early-onset GBS cases. Factors associated with GBS screening and lack of optimal GBS chemoprophylaxis were analyzed using logistic regression.

Results

Screening was performed for 84.7% of pregnant women, but 26.3% of prenatal tests with documented test dates were performed before 35 weeks of gestation. Among women with an indication for GBS prophylaxis, 61.2% received optimal chemoprophylaxis, defined as initiation of a recommended antibiotic 4 hours or more before delivery. When the analysis was restricted to women who were admitted 4 hours or more before delivery, 70.9% received optimal chemoprophylaxis. Women not receiving optimal chemoprophylaxis were more likely to have penicillin allergy (11.7% compared with 2.5%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 8.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57–47.04) or preterm delivery (45.5% compared with 13.2%, adjusted OR 5.52, 95% CI 2.29–13.30) and were less likely to have received the recommended prenatal serologic testing for other infectious diseases (77.9% compared with 91.1%, adjusted OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09–0.98). Forty cases of early-onset GBS were identified (0.36 per 1,000 live births); 25% of these neonates were born to women who received screening at 35 weeks of gestation or later and, when indicated, optimal chemoprophylaxis.

Conclusion

Universal prenatal GBS screening was implemented widely in Tennessee, although the timing of screening and administration of chemoprophylaxis often were not optimal. A substantial burden of early-onset GBS disease occurs despite optimal prenatal screening and chemoprophylaxis, suggesting that alternative strategies, such as vaccination, are needed.

### Early-onset group B streptococcal disease in the United States: potential for further reduction [^6fe11dc3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe lapses in adherence to group B streptococcus (GBS) prevention guidelines among cases of early-onset GBS disease in term and preterm neonates and to estimate the potential for further reduction in disease burden under current prevention strategies.

Methods

We reviewed labor and delivery and prenatal records of mothers of neonates with early-onset GBS disease (aged younger than 7 days with GBS isolated from a normally sterile site) identified at population-based surveillance sites in 2008–2009. We interviewed prenatal care providers about GBS screening practices and obtained relevant laboratory records. We evaluated the data for errors in prenatal screening, laboratory methods, communication of results, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Using published data on screening sensitivity and intrapartum prophylaxis effectiveness, we estimated the potential reduction in cases under optimal prevention implementation.

Results

Among 309 cases, 179 (57.9%) had one or more implementation errors. The most common error type in term and preterm case-patients was prenatal screening (80 of 222 [36.0%]) and intrapartum prophylaxis (46 of 85 [54.1%]), respectively. We estimated that under optimal implementation, cases of early-onset GBS disease could be reduced by 26–59% with the largest benefit from a single intervention coming from improved use of intrapartum prophylaxis (16% decrease).

Conclusion

Further reduction of early-onset GBS disease burden is possible under current prevention strategies, particularly with improved implementation of antibiotic prophylaxis. However, even with perfect adherence to recommended practices, the decline in cases may be modest. Therefore, novel prevention approaches such as improved intrapartum assays and vaccines are also needed.

### Challenges in reducing group B. streptococcus disease in African settings [^06b11a73]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in high-income settings and is associated with high rates of neonatal mortality and morbidity. There is now increasing evidence to suggest that there is a high GBS disease burden in resource-limited countries, and it is therefore critically important to identify suitable and practical preventive strategies. In Europe and North America, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) has led to a dramatic reduction of early-onset GBS disease. However, the methods for identifying pregnant women who should receive IAP and how to reduce late-onset GBS disease are not without controversy and are challenging for most sub-Saharan African countries. GBS vaccines are approaching phase III trials but are still under development. This review aims to explore the current evidence related to strategies for reducing invasive GBS disease in an African setting, the development of a GBS vaccine and whether preventative measures against GBS disease can be practically implemented.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal disease in the newborn [^fc70fe8f]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among newborns. Universal screening for GBS among women at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation is more effective than administration of intrapartum antibiotics based on risk factors. Lower vaginal and rectal cultures for GBS are collected at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation, and routine dindamycin and erythromycin susceptibility testing is performed in women allergic to penicillin. Women with GBS bacteriuria in the current pregnancy and those who previously delivered a GBS-septic newborn are not screened but automatically receive intrapartum antibiotics. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis is selected based on maternal allergy history and susceptibility of GBS isolates. Intravenous penicillin G is the preferred antibiotic, with ampicillin as an alternative. Penicillin G should be administered at least four hours before delivery for maximum effectiveness. Cefazolin is recommended in women allergic to penicillin who are at low risk of anaphylaxis. Clindamycin and erythromycin are options for women at high risk for anaphylaxis, and vancomycin should be used in women allergic to penicillin and whose cultures indicate resistance to clindamycin and erytbromycin or when susceptibility is unknown. Asymptomatic neonates born to GBS-colonized mothers should be observed for at least 24 hours for signs of sepsis. Newborns who appear septic should have diagnostic work-up including blood culture followed by initiation of ampicillin and gentamicin. Studies indicate that intrapartum prophylaxis of GBS carriers and selective administration of antibiotics to newborns reduce neonatal GBS sepsis by as much as 80 to 95 percent.

### Consequences of prophylaxis for group B streptococcal infections of the neonate [^a0f9d7de]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

In the 1970s, group B streptococci emerged as the leading cause of neonatal infections. The incidence ranged between 1.5 and 2 cases per 1000 in the U.S. in the 1980s up to the early 1990s. In the 1980s, selective treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics of mothers in labor turned out to be the most successful mode of prevention. In 1996, the CDC, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the use of one of two prevention strategies: the culture-based strategy or a risk-based strategy for mothers who did not have prenatal cultures. In 2002, the guidelines were updated to recommend as preferable the culture-based method, which was found to result in superior prevention compared with the risk-based method. Subsequent to the 1996 recommendations, early-onset GBS infection has been reduced by greater than 70% and racial inequalities have been narrowed. Whether exposure of millions of mothers to penicillin or ampicillin will have an undesirable effect of causing more Escherichia coli infections in neonates or will result in more ampicillin-resistant organisms being responsible for early-onset neonatal infections remains unclear.

### Perinatal infections due to group B streptococci [^232a5b4b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Group B streptococci (GBS) emerged dramatically in the 1970s as the leading cause of neonatal infection and as an important cause of maternal uterine infection. We review the epidemiology, diagnosis, and therapy of GBS perinatal infection. In 1996, the first national consensus guidelines were released. Since then, there has been a 70% reduction in early-onset neonatal GBS infection, but no decrease in late-onset neonatal GBS disease. In 2002, new national guidelines were released recommending 1) solely a screen-based prevention strategy, 2) a new algorithm for patients with penicillin allergy, and 3) more specific practices in certain clinical scenarios. Yet many clinical issues remain, including implementation of new diagnostic techniques, management of preterm rupture of membranes, use of alternative antibiotic approaches, improvement of compliance, prevention of low birth weight infants, emergence of resistant organisms, and vaccine development.

### Adverse events in women and children who have received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis treatment: a systematic review [^21da4f38]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This systematic review is reported according to PRISMA guidelines. As this was a secondary analysis of existing data, ethical consent was not required.

Search strategy

Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Cochrane Library: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, DARE and HTA databases, and Science Citation Index Expanded from date of inception until October 16th 2016. The search strategy combined both text words and MeSH terms for antibiotic prophylaxis, labour, and adverse events, and was limited to English and humans (see Additional file 1 for complete search strategy). We used recommended search filters for adverse events, and systematically included terms for known IAP adverse events from previous studies and expert opinion. We also hand-searched reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and experts cross-checked included studies.

Eligibility criteria and study selection

Two reviewers independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of all identified records. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, with involvement of a third reviewer if necessary. We included any full text randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, or case-control studies in English, reporting any adverse events experienced by mothers and/or their children after being exposed to antibiotics during labour for any prophylactic purpose, compared to an unexposed control group. As the evidence base on IAP for neonatal GBS disease prevention is limited, we included studies on IAP for any prophylactic indication. IAP studies for caesarean sections or symptomatic mothers, those in which women were given antibiotics before labour, or neonates given antibiotics after birth were excluded. Studies were included if 90% or more of the study population met the inclusion criteria, or if results for those who met the inclusion criteria were reported separately. We excluded case series, case reports, abstracts, editorials, letters, books, consensus statements, opinions, and reviews.

Quality appraisal

Two reviewers independently appraised the risk of bias for each included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool, and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomised Studies (RoBANS). Selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting biases were assessed and classified as low, high, and unclear risk of bias.

### Adverse events in women and children who have received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis treatment: a systematic review [^9b05a1a3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

A Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that despite an 83% reduction in EOGBS incidence from IAP, IAP for maternal GBS is not supported by conclusive evidence due to a high risk of bias across RCTs. Combining this uncertainty with the results of this review makes it increasingly difficult to ascertain whether the benefits of administering IAP for EOGBS prevention outweigh the harms to mothers and children. Large, well-designed RCTs required to answer this question may no longer be feasible as IAP is now the recommended treatment. Instead, large, better quality, and longitudinal observational studies across countries with widespread IAP may be an alternative to understand the adverse events occurring in participants treated with IAP. Expanding EOGBS prevention from risk-based strategies to universal antenatal screening introduces the risk of increasing the number of low risk women treated with IAP. Up to 30% of mothers positive in pregnancy may become negative by birth, and less than 1% of mothers colonised in labour have a baby with EOGBS, all of whom could be unnecessarily exposed to potential harms. As observational evidence on universal GBS screening effectiveness is limited due to inherent biases, an RCT could inform on both the effectiveness and harms of screening and IAP treatment for neonatal GBS disease prevention.

### Perinatal group B streptococcal disease prevention, Minnesota [^660938fb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Group B streptococci (GBS) emerged as the leading cause of invasive bacterial infections in newborns in the United States in the 1970s. Although the incidence of GBS disease has declined substantially, it remains the leading cause of serious infection in newborns. Perinatal GBS transmission can be reduced dramatically by diagnosing maternal GBS colonization and administering intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis (IAP) during labor and delivery.

In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published consensus guidelines recommending 2 methods of perinatal GBS disease prevention. The screening-based approach recommends obtaining vaginal and rectal cultures at 35–37 weeks of gestation. Women with GBS-positive cultures are offered IAP during labor. The risk-based approach recommends administering IAP to women with GBS risk factors when they go into labor. These guidelines are believed to have increased use of GBS disease prevention approaches by prenatal care providers, which has led to a decrease in the incidence of GBS disease. A 2002 study further indicated that routine screening for GBS would prevent ≈50% more newborn GBS infections than would a risk-based approach. This study, along with other data, led CDC to publish revised guidelines in August 2002 recommending universal prenatal screening.

As part of the Minnesota Department of Health Emerging Infections Program, prenatal care providers in Minnesota were surveyed in April 1998 to determine strategies to prevent perinatal GBS disease. In November 2002, a similar survey was undertaken to determine the extent to which Minnesota providers have adopted the revised 2002 CDC guidelines.

### Uncertainties in screening and prevention of group B. streptococcus disease [^55447e57]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In autumn 2016, the UK Department of Health (now Department of Health and Social Care) convened 2 meetings to discuss how to address research evidence gaps in order to minimize the impact of infant group B streptococcus (GBS) disease in the United Kingdom. At that meeting, a number of research priorities were highlighted, including improving the screening for GBS colonization in pregnant women, offering intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and point-of-care testing, and understanding the effect of widespread intrapartum antibiotic use on long-term infant health. Further discussions involved investigating the feasibility of a large prospective study of pregnant women and their infants in order to understand the role of antibodies in the protection against GBS disease in infancy following maternal exposure to GBS colonization. Here, we summarize the research uncertainties identified at that meeting.

### Maternal colonization with group B. streptococcus and serotype distribution worldwide: systematic review and meta-analyses [^9fa8fa27]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Our comprehensive review of GBS maternal colonization and serotype distribution highlights the important gaps in data that still exist. Future research on maternal GBS colonization should prioritize high-quality data from low-income contexts, especially rural populations and regions where there are large data gaps, such as South and Central Asia, Central and Western Africa, and Oceania. More phylogenetic data, including sequence type clonal complex and serotype distributions, are also needed to understand the emergence and relationship between colonization and disease.

Despite data gaps, it is clear that GBS is present in all regions of the world as a pathogen colonizing pregnant women, and this finding has important implications for public health policy. The myths that GBS is only a pathogen in high-income contexts are no longer tenable. The associated burden would be amenable to prevention by intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis or maternal immunization. Improved data, including on serotypes, are important to guide effective decision making, and also monitor the impact of intervention (Table 3).

### Every country, every family: time to act for group B streptococcal disease worldwide [^b1cb1f90]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

To reduce the burden of GBS, high-income countries have primarily relied on intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), with either risk-based screening or universal screening in the third trimester. However, even with high coverage of IAP, this strategy is ineffective to reduce GBS-associated stillbirths, preterm birth, or late-onset GBS, and some cases of early-onset GBS still occur. Crucially, IAP is challenging in LMICs, which bear the highest burden of disease, and if all women colonized with GBS in pregnancy were given antibiotics, this would add millions of doses in an era with concern of rising antimicrobial resistance.

Cesarean delivery and group B streptococcal (GBS) prophylaxis — Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS disease is not recommended as a routine practice for cesarean deliveries performed before labor onset on women with intact amniotic membranes, regardless of GBS colonization status or gestational age (CIII), and perioperative prophylactic antibiotics for cesarean delivery should not be altered by GBS status; however, women expected to undergo cesarean deliveries should undergo routine vaginal and rectal screening for GBS at 35–37 weeks' gestation because labor or membrane rupture can occur before the planned cesarean, and under those circumstances GBS-colonized women should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (AII). Health-care providers should inform women of their GBS screening test result and the recommended interventions (BIII).

Group B streptococcal (GBS) intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis — indications and nonindications are listed as follows. Indications include previous infant with invasive GBS disease, GBS bacteriuria during any trimester of the current pregnancy, positive GBS vaginal-rectal screening culture in late gestation during current pregnancy, and unknown GBS status at the onset of labor with any of: delivery at < 37 weeks' gestation, amniotic membrane rupture ≥ 18 hours, intrapartum temperature ≥ 100.4°F (≥ 38.0°C), or intrapartum NAAT positive for GBS. Prophylaxis is not indicated for colonization with GBS during a previous pregnancy or GBS bacteriuria during previous pregnancy unless an indication is present for the current pregnancy, for a negative vaginal and rectal GBS screening culture in late gestation during the current pregnancy regardless of intrapartum risk factors, or for cesarean delivery performed before onset of labor on a woman with intact amniotic membranes regardless of GBS colonization status or gestational age.

Intrapartum group B streptococcus (GBS) prophylaxis — alternatives for penicillin-allergic mothers and timing are described as follows: The efficacy of alternatives to penicillin or ampicillin used for prevention among infants of penicillin-allergic mothers has not been measured in controlled trials, and an estimated 10% of persons with penicillin allergy have immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins. Available data suggest that erythromycin and clindamycin provided to pregnant women do not reach fetal tissues reliably, and colonization data suggest durations of ≥ 2 hours before delivery might confer some protection.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^fa1842bf]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Invasive group B streptococcal (GBS) disease — definitions and transmission are outlined: Infections in newborns occurring within the first week of life are designated early-onset disease, whereas late-onset infections occur in infants aged > 1 week, with most infections evident during the first 3 months of life. These guidelines concern only early-onset disease, and measures used to prevent early-onset GBS disease also might prevent some perinatal maternal infections; however, they do not prevent late-onset infant disease. Early-onset infections are acquired vertically through exposure to GBS from the vagina of a colonized woman, primarily when GBS ascends from the vagina to the amniotic fluid after onset of labor or rupture of membranes, although it also can invade through intact membranes; organisms can be aspirated into the fetal lungs, leading to bacteremia. Infants can also become infected during passage through the birth canal and become colonized at mucous membrane sites in the gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts, but these colonized infants most commonly remain healthy.

### Interpretation of 2002 centers for disease control guidelines for group B. streptococcus and evolving provider practice patterns [^9362f3ea]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

We investigated if clinicians were altering their care of group B streptococcus (GBS)-positive women in labor to achieve 4 hours of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis based on their interpretation of the 2002 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines on prevention of perinatal GBS disease. We surveyed all clinicians with privileges on the labor floor at our institution about their interpretation and clinical application of the 2002 CDC guidelines. Seventy of 96 eligible clinicians (72.9%) completed our survey. In our survey, only 22.9% of clinicians reported not altering their management of labor in GBS-positive pregnancies that achieved less than 4 hours of prophylaxis. These alterations included "laboring down" or delaying pushing; turning off or decrease an oxytocin infusion; or delaying or avoiding artificial rupture of membranes. Clinicians are altering their management of labor to attempt to achieve 4 hours of intrapartum prophylaxis. The 2002 CDC guidelines do not specifically recommend prolonging labor and are being interpreted differently in the clinical setting than the authors may have intended. The effects and consequences of this interpretation are unknown.

### ACOG committee opinion: number 279, December 2002. prevention of early-onset group B streptococcal disease in newborns [^dfdfed80]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

During the past two decades, group B streptococci (GBS), or Streptococcus agalactiae, has emerged as an important cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Intrapartum administration of antibiotics to the woman (during labor or after rupture of membranes, but before delivery) has been demonstrated to reduce early-onset neonatal GBS disease. In 1996, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that obstetric providers adopt either a culture-based or a risk-based approach for the prevention of early-onset GBS. A recent multistate retrospective cohort study of live births in 1998 and 1999 of residents from eight areas of the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance/Emerging Infections Program network suggests that the culture-based approach is superior to the risk-based approach. The Committee on Obstetric Practice supports the new CDC recommendations that obstetric providers adopt a culture-based strategy for the prevention of early-onset GBS disease in the newborn. It is important to acknowledge that complete implementation of this complex strategy will not eliminate all cases of early-onset GBS.

### Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis policies for the prevention of group B streptococcal disease worldwide: systematic review [^44ae0a21]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This review of IAP policies to prevent EOGBS disease represents the first systematic review and survey of GBS screening policies to date, with data from 95 countries of the 195 United Nations member states. It clearly demonstrates that IAP policy, strategy, and implementation are heterogeneous and different disease burden estimates and healthcare systems have led to a range of IAP approaches. This may imply that opportunities for prevention of EOGBS are being missed in some settings.

Whereas the WHO advocates screening for GBS during pregnancy, it also recognizes that screening for all pregnant women — especially in settings with known low maternal colonization prevalence, low-resource countries, and/or countries where provision of care is limited — is difficult to implement. The WHO therefore recommends that IAP should be implemented within the context of local policy and guidance on screening for GBS colonization. In our study, low- and middle-income countries more frequently reported having no IAP policy as compared to high-income countries. There were exceptions to this; for example, both Kenya and South Africa had national IAP policies, although the survey suggested that implementation and coverage were low. In countries where access to skilled care is limited, or where the majority of births occur at home (eg, in some low-income countries where up to 80% of births are at home), implementation of IAP will always pose a challenge.

### Adverse events in women and children who have received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis treatment: a systematic review [^ac7d5618]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Group B Streptococcus (GBS), or Streptococcus agalactiae, a gram-positive bacterium, is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity from neonatal sepsis. GBS colonises the gastrointestinal and/or genitourinary tract in 10 to 30% of pregnant women, with a recent global rate of 17.9%. If a pregnant woman is vaginally colonised with GBS when she is in labour, there is a 36% chance that GBS will be transmitted to her neonate. Most GBS colonised neonates will be asymptomatic, however less than 1% may suffer from invasive early-onset GBS disease (less than seven days, EOGBS). Globally, culture-confirmed EOGBS has an estimated incidence of 0.43 per 1000 live births and a case fatality rate of 12.1%, which may be an underestimate.

To prevent EOGBS, the currently available prevention is intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), administered to mothers identified at risk of vertically transmitting GBS bacteria. The current recommendation for IAP in Western Europe, North America, and Australasia is intravenous penicillin (or ampicillin) given as soon as possible after the onset of labour and then every four hours until delivery, with intravenous cefazolin in the US, or clindamycin in the UK, for mothers allergic to penicillin. Pregnant women are selected to be offered IAP using different policies. In some countries, women are offered IAP if they present with known risk factors for GBS, such as intrapartum fever or GBS bacteriuria, and in many other countries, women are actively screened for GBS colonisation at 35–37 weeks of pregnancy and treated in labour if they are positive. Screening for GBS maternal colonisation is controversial as up to 30% of women with positive results at 35–37 weeks revert to negative by labour, and the large majority of women who are colonised with GBS during labour have healthy neonates who will not suffer from EOGBS.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a second dose of an investigational maternal trivalent group B. streptococcus vaccine in nonpregnant women 4–6 years after a first dose: results from a phase 2 trial [^293448f2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and young infants, with an incidence of 0.49/1000 live births. Each year, more than 300 000 infants younger than 3 months are estimated to develop invasive GBS disease worldwide, resulting in 90 000 infant deaths. Furthermore, an estimated 1%–4% of stillbirths are associated with GBS, and there is evidence of a possible link with preterm births. GBS can be transmitted vertically from the mother's rectovaginal tract to the fetus during pregnancy or parturition, making maternal colonization a major risk factor for infant GBS disease. An estimated 11%–35% of pregnant women are colonized with GBS (totaling 21.7 million women).

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) in GBS-colonized pregnant women has substantially reduced the incidence of early-onset disease (onset during the first 7 days of life). However, IAP has not reduced the rate of late-onset disease (onset between 7 and 90 days), does not prevent GBS-associated preterm or stillbirths, and its implementation is logistically challenging in low- and middle-income countries. An effective prophylactic vaccine administered during pregnancy could complement IAP. For several GBS serotypes, an inverse relation has been shown between antibody levels against the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) in pregnant women and the risk of invasive GBS disease in their infants. This led to the use of serotype-specific GBS CPS for vaccine development. An investigational trivalent vaccine that contains CPS from GBS serotypes Ia, Ib, and III, which together cause > 85% of infant invasive GBS disease, conjugated to the CRM 197 carrier protein (nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin) was well tolerated and immunogenic in nonpregnant and pregnant women. Studies have also shown that anti-CPS antibodies induced by maternal immunization with this vaccine were transferred transplacentally to infants and persisted through a minimum of 3 months of age.

The World Health Organization has articulated a preference for a single-dose maternal regimen, while acknowledging that a 2-dose regimen may need to be considered and that additional doses in subsequent pregnancies should be investigated. The current study (an extension of a previous trivalent GBS vaccine trial in nonpregnant women) was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a second dose of the trivalent GBS vaccine administered 4–6 years after the initial dose.

### A phase 2b trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 6-valent group B. streptococcus vaccine administered concomitantly with tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine in healthy nonpregnant female individuals [^b20162fa]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause serious disease such as sepsis, pneumonia, and, less frequently, meningitis. GBS infection of the maternal urinary tract is associated with chorioamnionitis and can cause preterm labor, miscarriage, and stillbirth. Annually, invasive GBS disease is associated with approximately 392 000 cases, 91 000 infant deaths, and 46 000 stillbirths. Additionally, up to 3.5 million preterm births annually are thought to be attributable to GBS.

The primary risk factor for early-onset GBS disease in neonates (characterized as infection within 7 days of birth) is maternal rectovaginal GBS colonization. Global prevalence of rectovaginal GBS colonization in pregnant individuals is about 18%, although there is considerable regional variation (11%–35%). A recent meta-analysis estimated that 19.7 million pregnant individuals in 2020 had maternal GBS colonization, with approximately 231 800 neonates developing early-onset invasive GBS disease and 162 200 infants developing late-onset invasive GBS disease (7‒89 days after birth).

Prophylactic antibiotic treatment from onset of labor is effective at preventing early-onset GBS disease in infants born to individuals with positive GBS cultures following screening between 35 and 37 weeks of each pregnancy, since colonization in individuals can vary over time, or in those who have other risk factors for intrapartum GBS colonization, including a previous infant with GBS disease, preterm labor, prolonged rupture of membranes > 18 hours, age ≥ 35 years, and diabetes mellitus. Limitations with intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) include potential availability issues and variable implementation policies, potential contribution to antimicrobial resistance (ie, non-GBS pathogens, including Escherichia coli), and potential adverse effects such as disruption of the microbiome. IAP also does not prevent GBS-associated stillbirth or maternal peripartum infections and is not effective against late-onset GBS disease in infants.

They "held regular telephone conference calls to identify potential areas of change" and identified topics for in‑depth review, with "a thorough review… of the published literature through PubMed searches, other sources… and unpublished data", and when "several sources of data were available, evidence was summarized in tables". "In June 2009, an in-person meeting" developed updated recommendations using "an evidence-based approach when possible and relying on expert scientific opinion when sufficient data were lacking", and "These updated guidelines replace CDC's 2002 guidelines. They are intended for providers of prenatal, obstetric, and neonatal care".

Preterm PROM — group B streptococcus (GBS) screening and intrapartum prophylaxis — Revised guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend women with preterm PROM to be screened for GBS on admission. If the patient completes the full 7-day course of latency antibiotics and remains without evidence of infection or labor, intrapartum GBS prophylaxis should then be managed by the results of the baseline GBS test at the time of preterm PROM. If the patient remains pregnant 5 or more weeks after a negative baseline GBS test, then GBS screening should be repeated; a positive baseline test does not have to be repeated and the patient should receive GBS prophylaxis.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) unknown culture status at term — candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis may be identified using maternal risk factors, nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), or prior pregnancy colonization history, and specific thresholds and actions are defined. When culture status is unknown, "a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher, or rupture of membranes for 18 hours or more, is independently associated with an increased risk of neonatal GBS EOD", and if intraamniotic infection is suspected or confirmed, prophylaxis "should be converted to a more broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen… (generally ampicillin and an aminoglycoside)". NAAT "can be considered", and "Women with a positive intrapartum NAAT result for GBS should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis", whereas those with a negative NAAT and no intrapartum risk factors "do not need intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis"; if risk factors develop, "GBS prophylaxis should be administered", and negative NAATs are superseded because results "are not 100% sensitive". For women at term with unknown status but a prior pregnancy history of GBS colonization, recurrence has been demonstrated "(50.2% compared with 14.1%… [OR, 6.05; 95% CI, 4.84–7.55])", and "it is reasonable to offer intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis" and clinicians "may consider discussing the option of empiric intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis" given increased neonatal risk.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) prophylaxis — antibiotic selection and penicillin allergy management: Intravenous penicillin remains the agent of choice for intrapartum prophylaxis, with intravenous ampicillin as an acceptable alternative, and first-generation cephalosporins (cefazolin) are recommended for penicillin allergy with low risk of anaphylaxis or uncertain severity; for women with a high risk of anaphylaxis, clindamycin is the recommended alternative only if the GBS isolate is known to be susceptible, penicillin allergy testing is safe during pregnancy and can be beneficial for all women reporting allergy and expansion of its use is encouraged, and laboratory requisitions should indicate clearly the presence of penicillin allergy; for high-risk penicillin allergy with clindamycin-nonsusceptible isolates, intravenous vancomycin remains the only validated option and the dosage should be weight- and renal-based (20 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours, with a maximum of 2 g per single dose.)

### Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease [^9b5c106f]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Categorical risk assessment for group B streptococcal (GBS) early-onset disease (EOD) — In this approach, maternal intrapartum temperature ≥ 38.0°C is used as a surrogate for intraamniotic infection, and penicillin G, ampicillin, or cefazolin ≥ 4 hours before delivery is considered adequate GBS intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), whereas other antibiotics or treatment durations < 4 hours are considered inadequate. Risk among newborns recommended for empirical treatment is highly variable by gestational age, duration of rupture of membranes, and timing/content of intrapartum antibiotics, and categorical management will result in empirical treatment of many relatively low-risk newborn infants.

Key points
- Group B Streptococcus disease can be very serious, even deadly, for babies.
- Learn about the steps healthcare providers can take to prevent GBS disease during the first week of a newborn's life. Overview The best way to prevent GBS disease during the first week of life is to give antibiotics, during labor, to women at increased risk. All pregnant women should get screened for GBS bacteria. Keep Reading: GBS Screening During Pregnancy. Antibiotics during labor Healthcare providers give antibiotics to women who are at increased risk of having a baby who will develop GBS disease. The antibiotics help protect babies from infection, but only if given during labor. Antibiotics can't be given before labor begins because the bacteria can grow back quickly. Healthcare providers give the antibiotic by IV. Beta-lactams are the type of antibiotic prescribed the most during labor to prevent GBS disease.

Penicillin and ampicillin are examples of beta-lactams. However, healthcare providers can give other antibiotics to women who are severely allergic to these antibiotics. Why prevention is important Antibiotics are very safe About 1 in 10 women have mild side effects from receiving penicillin. There's a rare chance of having a severe allergic reaction that requires emergency treatment. Antibiotics are very effective Antibiotics are very effective at preventing GBS disease in newborns. Consider the following examples: Treated with antibiotics got antibioticsduring labor. well protectedfrom GBS disease. No antibiotics didn't get antibioticsduring labor. 20 times more likelyto get GBS disease compared to Tanya's baby.

In settings without a policy of providing IAP for GBS colonization, the risk of EOGBS in newborns of GBS colonized mothers was 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI].6%–1.5%) (Figure 3). Among the studies in this review where there was a policy of providing IAP for GBS colonization (including women who received IAP, as well those who missed IAP), the overall risk of EOGBS was much lower (0.03% [95% CI, 0–.07%]; Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1), with a mean IAP coverage of 75%. When all studies were included, regardless of IAP policy, with increasing IAP coverage the risk of EOGBS decreased. Figure 4 shows IAP coverage against risk of EOGBS. This graph (linear regression line) can be used to estimate the risk of EOGBS based on different estimates of IAP coverage. Table 2 shows the varying expected risk of EOGBS with different coverage levels of IAP based on the linear association. For example, with coverage of IAP of 80%, the risk of EOGBS would be expected to be 0.3% (95% CI, 0–0.9%). Note that where "no coverage" is reported, this does not imply no antibiotics during labor, as antibiotics may have been administered for other indications.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^5cc4ff12]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM) algorithm for group B streptococcal (GBS) screening and intrapartum prophylaxis — at < 37 weeks and 0 days' gestation, obtain a vaginal-rectal swab for GBS culture and start antibiotics for latency or GBS prophylaxis. If the patient is entering labor, continue antibiotics until delivery; if not entering labor, continue antibiotics per standard of care if receiving for latency or continue antibiotics for 48 hours if receiving for GBS prophylaxis, then obtain GBS culture results. With a positive culture, the action is GBS prophylaxis at onset of true labor; if results are not available prior to labor onset, the action is also GBS prophylaxis at onset of true labor. With a negative culture, the action is no GBS prophylaxis at onset of true labor and to repeat the vaginal-rectal culture if the patient reaches 35–37 weeks' gestation and has not yet delivered.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^23c99cc2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis — indications and exceptions include that women whose vaginal–rectal culture at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation are positive for GBS should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed with intact membranes, and women with a positive prenatal GBS culture who undergo a cesarean birth before labor with intact membranes do not require GBS antibiotic prophylaxis. In the current pregnancy, intrapartum GBS prophylaxis is indicated for a positive GBS culture obtained at 36 0/7 weeks of gestation or more, for GBS bacteriuria during any trimester, and based on maternal history of a previous neonate with invasive GBS disease; it is not indicated after a negative vaginal–rectal GBS culture obtained at 36 0/7 weeks of gestation or more or when cesarean birth is performed before onset of labor on a woman with intact amniotic membranes. When GBS status is unknown at labor onset, intrapartum GBS prophylaxis is indicated if any of the following are present: birth at less than 37 0/7 weeks of gestation, amniotic membrane rupture 18 hours or more, intrapartum temperature 100.4°F (38.0°C) or higher, intrapartum nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) positive for GBS, or NAAT negative but risk factors develop; prophylaxis is not indicated if NAAT is negative and no intrapartum risk factors are present. If intraamniotic infection is suspected, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy that includes an agent known to be active against GBS should replace GBS prophylaxis.

### CDC updates guidelines for the prevention of perinatal… [^5a57d1ab]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Screening Based on the updated CDC guidelines, women who have previously given birth to an infant with invasive GBS disease should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Universal culture-based screening is recommended for all other pregnant women to identify candidates for intrapartum prophylaxis. Women with unknown GBS colonization status at the time of delivery should be treated based on the presence of intrapartum risk factors. Candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis can be identified using the indications and nonindications provided in. However, patients who at any time during their current pregnancy have had a GBS-related urinary tract infection or GBS bacteria isolated from the urine should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and do not need third-trimester screening for GBS colonization. The use of antimicrobial agents should be avoided before the intrapartum period unless GBS urinary tract infection occurs during the pregnancy.

Intrapartum Antibiotic Prophylaxis Figure 1 provides an algorithm for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS disease. The recommended antibiotic for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis is penicillin, although ampicillin is an acceptable alternative. The dosing regimen for penicillin G should be 5 million units intravenously, followed by 2. 5 to
3. 0 million units intravenously every four hours. GBS prophylaxis should be given at hospital admission in patients with threatened preterm delivery if their colonization status is unknown or if they had a positive screen within the preceding five weeks. Women who have not had vaginal-rectal GBS screening within the preceding five weeks should be screened for colonization at hospital admission. If admission screening results are negative for GBS or if, at any point, it is determined that a patient admitted with preterm labor is not in true labor, antibiotics given for GBS prophylaxis should be discontinued immediately.

The administration of antibiotics for other indications should not be affected by negative GBS culture results. In patients who had a positive GBS admission screen from a threatened preterm delivery that did not result in true labor at the time, prophylaxis is indicated when true labor begins. Patients who had a negative GBS admission screen from a threatened preterm delivery that did not result in true labor should have repeat screening at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation. Screening also should be repeated in such patients if they are readmitted with threatened preterm delivery more than five weeks after their previous GBS screen.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^e61f1f03]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Bacteriuria in pregnancy — treatment thresholds and intrapartum prophylaxis are specified as follows: If GBS bacteriuria at any colony count is detected during pregnancy, the woman is at increased risk of GBS colonization during labor and antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered empirically during labor; treatment is recommended for women who are symptomatic, and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is defined as 105 colony forming units (CFU)/mL or more, has been shown to reduce the risks of pyelonephritis, birth weight less than 2,500 grams, and preterm birth (less than 37 weeks of gestation); in asymptomatic women, treatment of GBS bacteriuria is recommended only if test results indicate a level of 105 CFU/mL or higher; although laboratories may report concentrations of GBS in urine at 104 CFU/mL or lower, no correlation has been found between concentrations of less than 105 CFU/mL and preterm birth, and there is no evidence that prenatal treatment of asymptomatic women with GBS bacteriuria less than 105 CFU/mL provides better maternal or neonatal outcomes; however, any GBS colony count, even one less than 105 CFU/mL, still indicates a higher level of anogenital colonization and is established as an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis in the intrapartum period.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 485: prevention of early-onset group B streptococcal disease in newborns [^c41ac320]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease. Although universal screening at 35–37 weeks of gestation and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the basis of the prevention strategy, these new guidelines contain important changes for clinical practice. The Committee on Obstetric Practice endorses the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, and recognizes that even complete implementation of this complex strategy will not eliminate all cases of early-onset group B streptococcal disease.

### Clindamycin-resistant group B. streptococcus and failure of intrapartum prophylaxis to prevent early-onset disease [^76980a38]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for parturient women who have a screen positive for group B Streptococcus (GBS). Clindamycin should be used for IAP only if the maternal GBS isolate is susceptible. We report a case of clindamycin-resistant GBS disease in a newborn infant whose mother received clindamycin IAP, and we review clindamycin susceptibility testing.

### Antibiotic choice for group B. streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^4ef6fd45]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite the CDC's recommendation to treat penicillin allergic pregnant individuals with cefazolin for GBS prophylaxis, the majority (73.7%) of patients with a documented penicillin allergy in our cohort were treated with clindamycin or vancomycin, both considered alternative treatment for GBS prophylaxis. This is consistent with prior smaller studies that have showed obstetric care providers have an insufficient understanding of appropriate antibiotic selection for GBS prophylaxis in penicillin allergic patients. Our findings in this large study demonstrates a notable deviation from a well-established best practice guideline and has several concerning implications, particularly relating to effects of poor antibiotic stewardship and rising antimicrobial resistance rates. GBS resistance to clindamycin is already a significant problem, with the CDC reporting 47.3% of isolates to be resistant. The most recent update in 2019 to the ACOG guideline addresses this by now only recommending the use of clindamycin for GBS prophylaxis when a culture is obtained and shows a susceptible strain. This illustrates how effective antibiotic choices and reliability of empiric therapy are decreasing over time. The improper use of clindamycin and vancomycin also leads to broader antimicrobial coverage than indicated (e.g. anaerobic coverage with clindamycin) and may have effects on the maternal and perhaps perinatally-acquired neonatal microbiome. Broader coverage may also lead to increased antibiotic resistance among other common colonizing bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (rising clindamycin resistance rates) and enterococcus species (e.g. vancomycin resistant enterococcus). Furthermore, compared to beta-lactam antibiotics, alternative antibiotics are more costly and more toxic, with increased risks for maternal nephrotoxicity and Clostridium difficile infections.

Our study also showed that the use of clindamycin and vancomycin for GBS prophylaxis had consequences for the newborn during the study period. Neonates of mothers who received clindamycin or vancomycin had an increased rate of blood draws (specifically, CBC and blood culture) compared to neonates of mothers who received penicillin or cefazolin. These lab draws would likely not have been medically indicated if their mothers had received first-line GBS prophylaxis during labor. Venous blood draws are distressing both to the infant and parents and should be avoided whenever possible. Although as of 2019, enhanced clinical is recommended for infants born > 35 weeks gestational age to mothers who received inadequate antibiotic prophylaxis rather than routine laboratory evaluation, the study illustrates deviation from "routine neonatal care" if alternative antibiotics without equal efficacy data for neonatal sepsis prevention are utilized.

### Uncertainties in screening and prevention of group B. streptococcus disease [^b85b7e0d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic review concluded that the evidence base that addresses the potential impact of widespread use of IAP for the mother (anaphylaxis, antimicrobial resistance, medicalization of labor) and baby (short- and long-term effects on the gut microbiome, longer stay in hospital, antimicrobial resistance) was limited and that additional large, high-quality, and longitudinal observational studies across countries would improve our understanding in this area. Given that in the United Kingdom approximately 20% of women are colonized yet only 1 in 100 infants born to women carrying GBS develop invasive GBS disease, there is a need to understand other factors that contribute to natural protection from infection, such as antibody concentrations. Such data would also facilitate vaccine development and licensure.

A recently published collection of articles highlights the potential global burden and the scale of the problem. Independently (though with overlap with some of the experts), the UK Department of Health (now Department of Health and Social Care) convened a working group to examine some of the research uncertainties that could be tackled in the United Kingdom with appropriately commissioned funding. Here, we present a consensus view on current research gaps in evidence on screening, diagnostic tests, and vaccination, with the aim of stimulating research in this area.

### A novel hexavalent capsular polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (GBS6) for the prevention of neonatal group B streptococcal infections by maternal immunization [^1a12d1e9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Shortly after the protective effect of maternal GBS anti-CP IgG antibodies was recognized, efforts to develop a vaccine followed, culminating in testing of the safety and immunogenicity of serotype Ia, Ib, II, III, and V CPs individually conjugated to tetanus toxoid in human. Although these monovalent vaccines were demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic in pregnant and nonpregnant women, further advancement to late-stage clinical testing was halted for 2 reasons. First, coincident with the attempted development of a vaccine, guidance for GBS carriage screening during pregnancy and subsequent intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for colonized mothers were introduced, which reduced the rate of early onset disease in the United States and thereby diminished the perceived need for a GBS vaccine. Second, manufacturers were cautious about the development of maternal vaccines, given that there was and still is no precedent for a vaccine licensed for maternal use. More recently, however, a number of factors changed that encouraged the development of vaccines for maternal use. While intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has been effective at reducing early onset disease, remaining rates are still substantial, and such prophylaxis has not decreased rates of late-onset disease. Furthermore, the continuous emergence of novel influenza virus strains and the resurgence of pertussis have led to the recommendation of influenza and tetanus/diphtheria/acellular pertussis vaccines for US women during each pregnancy. The substantial health benefit to the infant and the pregnant mother, combined with a more robust safety database for maternal immunization, have established a precedent for vaccinating pregnant women and lowered the hurdle to develop a maternal vaccine such as GBS6.

### The risk factors for group B. streptococcus colonization during pregnancy and influences of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis on maternal and neonatal outcomes [^5d795581]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Group B Streptococcus (GBS), also known as Streptococcus agalactiae, is a Gram-positive bacterium which asymptomatically colonizes in women rectovaginal areas and could result in adult and neonatal invasive diseases under certain conditions. GBS infection can lead to invasive diseases such as bacteremia and skin/soft tissue infection in nonpregnant adults, the burden of which has been increased significantly during the past few years. The GBS carriage of pregnant women can be chronic, intermittent or transient and is implicated in urinary tract infection, premature rupture of membranes, and preterm birth. According to a literature, the prevalence of GBS invasive diseases in pregnant women was twice as much as that in nonpregnant women. GBS could be transmitted vertically from colonized mothers to their offspring through genital tract at or just before delivery, which may cause early-onset invasive neonatal GBS disease (EOD) that occurs < 7 days of life, often manifesting as bacteremia and pneumonia. The incidence of EOD among infants born to women with GBS colonization was 29 times higher than that of infants born to women without GBS colonization. Invasive neonatal GBS disease that appears from 7 to 90 days of life is referred as late-onset disease (LOD), the common manifestations of which are bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and meningitis. Newborns with LOD are exposed to GBS by horizontal transmission. Although the risk factors of LOD are not as well understood as EOD, it was suggested that babies usually acquired the same serotype of GBS as their mothers' colonized strains, and GBS-positive breast milk was implicated in heavy neonatal infection that GBS could be isolated from their throat, ear and rectum at least once.

IAP administration

Pregnant women with threatened preterm labor, risks of preterm delivery such as multiple births or premature rupture of membranes could be collected vaginal-rectal swabs for GBS culture before 35 weeks of gestation. And all other pregnant women were screened for GBS at 35–37 weeks of gestation. At the time of labor or rupture of membranes, IAP should be given to women who tested positive for GBS colonization. If GBS culture results were unknown at the time of delivery onset, women at < 37 weeks and 0 days' gestation, had a duration of membrane rupture ≥ 18 h, or had a temperature of ≥ 100.4º F (≥ 38.0ºC) were also treated with IAP. Once the GBS status were available prior to delivery and were negative, the GBS prophylaxis would be discontinued, otherwise IAP administration would be continued until their delivery. However, there were 90 culture-confirmed GBS-positive pregnant women were not administrated with IAP in time or more than 4 h. IAP agents and dosage were applied to patients according to the guidelines released by the CDC. An initial dose of 4.8 million U of penicillin were given to GBS culture-positive women at the time of labor onset via intravenous injection, followed by 2.4 million U of penicillin at an interval of 4 h. Pregnant women with premature rupture of membranes were intravenously injected with an initial dose of 2 g ampicillin, followed by 1 g ampicillin at an interval of 4 h. Penicillin-allergic women could be administrated with cefazolin or clindamycin.

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis agents — The efficacy of both penicillin and ampicillin as intravenously administered intrapartum agents for prevention of early-onset neonatal GBS disease was demonstrated in clinical trials, and beta-lactam antibiotics for GBS prophylaxis administered for ≥ 4 hours before delivery have been found to be highly effective at preventing vertical transmission of GBS and early-onset GBS disease. One clinical trial found that penicillin and ampicillin administered intravenously intrapartum were associated equally with the presence of ampicillin-resistant gram-negative organisms on postpartum vaginal-perineal culture.
