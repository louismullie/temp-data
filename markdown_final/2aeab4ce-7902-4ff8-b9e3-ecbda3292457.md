## Question

Propylthiouracil to manage hyperparathyroidism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using propylthiouracil to manage hyperparathyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about propylthiouracil's pharmacology and labeled indications. Then, I should define hyperparathyroidism and review its guideline-supported treatments. Next, I will cross-check whether any major guidelines mention propylthiouracil for hyperparathyroidism. After that, I need to consider any plausible off-label rationale and weigh risks. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation with appropriate alternatives and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the drug facts so I don't misattribute mechanisms. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is an antithyroid thioamide that inhibits thyroid peroxidase–mediated organification of iodine and coupling, thereby reducing T4/T3 synthesis, and it also inhibits peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion; it is indicated for hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease, toxic nodular goiter, and as part of thyroid storm management, not for parathyroid disorders [^115CtzdW] [^116WwBdD] [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should define the target disease precisely. Hyperparathyroidism is a parathyroid gland disorder with excessive parathyroid hormone leading to hypercalcemia, and evidence-based management centers on parathyroidectomy for cure when criteria are met, or cinacalcet to reduce serum calcium when surgery is not an option, with antiresorptives reserved for bone density indications [^116tzkNS] [^1152z3aX] [^116MBJih] [^113LsBWi].

> Next, I should review whether any authoritative guideline lists PTU for hyperparathyroidism. I need to check the Fifth International Workshop, AAES surgical guidelines, and the Sensipar label for any mention of PTU. Wait, let me verify carefully — there are no recommendations or even mentions of PTU in hyperparathyroidism algorithms; instead, surgery is the definitive therapy and cinacalcet is the medical option for lowering calcium in select primary hyperparathyroidism cases unable to undergo parathyroidectomy [^1152z3aX] [^111RbJRd] [^117254cz].

> I will now examine the endocrine axis mismatch to be certain I'm not missing a mechanistic link. PTU acts on thyroid hormone synthesis and peripheral conversion in the thyroid axis, whereas hyperparathyroidism is driven by PTH excess from parathyroid tissue and is pharmacologically modulated by calcimimetics acting on the calcium-sensing receptor, not by thyroid peroxidase inhibition; there is no plausible mechanism by which PTU would lower PTH or correct hypercalcemia in this context [^115CtzdW] [^116MBJih].

> But wait, what if there is an unusual off-label precedent or case series? Let me consider and double-check the major consensus documents and labeling once more. There are no guideline endorsements, no label statements, and no cited clinical studies supporting PTU for hyperparathyroidism in the documents at hand; the consistent theme is surgery for cure and cinacalcet for calcium lowering when surgery is not feasible, often complemented by antiresorptives to improve bone density if indicated [^1152z3aX] [^111RbJRd] [^113LsBWi].

> I should also weigh harms, because using a drug without benefit could expose patients to risk. PTU carries serious safety concerns including severe hepatotoxicity, liver failure, and agranulocytosis, with additional pregnancy-specific cautions; exposing a patient with hyperparathyroidism to PTU would add risk without any expected therapeutic effect on PTH or serum calcium [^114stPbk] [^116KgFPQ].

> Let me synthesize the conclusion carefully, and I will double-check that I'm not overlooking an exception. Propylthiouracil is not indicated, not mechanistically appropriate, and not guideline-supported for managing hyperparathyroidism; appropriate management prioritizes parathyroidectomy when criteria are met and uses cinacalcet to reduce serum calcium when surgery is not an option, with antiresorptives for low bone density and guideline-directed monitoring if observation is chosen [^116tzkNS] [^111RbJRd] [^116MBJih] [^113LsBWi].

> Clinical recommendation: Propylthiouracil should never be used to treat hypErparathyroidism. Hmm, wait a minute — that was a typographical slip; to be precise, PTU should not be used for hyperparathyroidism because it lacks efficacy for the parathyroid axis and carries nontrivial toxicity, whereas parathyroidectomy or cinacalcet represent evidence-based options depending on operability and goals of care [^1152z3aX] [^111RbJRd] [^116MBJih].

> One more check for special situations so I don't conflate overlapping endocrine problems. If a patient has coexisting hyperthyroidism and hyperparathyroidism, PTU may be used for the thyroid disease (for example, thyroid storm dosing per ATA), but it still does not treat hyperparathyroidism; in that scenario, manage each disorder on its own evidence-based pathway: PTU or alternative thioamides for thyrotoxicosis, and parathyroidectomy or cinacalcet for primary hyperparathyroidism as indicated [^116BsELq] [^111RbJRd] [^116MBJih].

---

Propylthiouracil (PTU) is **not indicated for hyperparathyroidism** [^116WwBdD] because it does not affect parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion or calcium metabolism. PTU is an antithyroid drug used for hyperthyroidism, not hyperparathyroidism [^115CtzdW] [^116WwBdD]. The recommended medical therapy for hyperparathyroidism is **cinacalcet** [^1152z3aX], which lowers serum calcium by activating the calcium-sensing receptor [^116MBJih]. PTU should not be used for hyperparathyroidism due to lack of efficacy and risk of serious adverse effects, including severe liver injury and agranulocytosis [^116KgFPQ] [^114stPbk].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of propylthiouracil

PTU **inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis** by blocking thyroid peroxidase and peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 [^115CtzdW], thereby reducing thyroid hormone levels and the symptoms of hyperthyroidism [^112HRce1]. It has no effect on PTH secretion or calcium metabolism and is therefore not appropriate for hyperparathyroidism.

---

## Clinical indications for propylthiouracil

PTU is indicated for:

- **Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goiter** [^116WwBdD] when methimazole is not tolerated or surgery/RAI is not appropriate [^116u3PPR].
- **Preoperative preparation** for thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy [^116WwBdD] in methimazole-intolerant patients [^112HRce1].
- **First trimester of pregnancy** when antithyroid therapy is needed [^112fq8aj] [^114V7ZVK].

PTU is **not indicated** for hyperparathyroidism [^116WwBdD].

---

## Current medical management of hyperparathyroidism

Medical management of hyperparathyroidism focuses on reducing serum calcium and PTH levels [^111Gy74C]. The primary pharmacological agent is **cinacalcet**, a calcimimetic that activates the calcium-sensing receptor, thereby reducing PTH secretion and serum calcium [^1152z3aX] [^116MBJih]. Cinacalcet is recommended for patients who are not surgical candidates or as adjunctive therapy [^113LsBWi].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines do **not recommend PTU** for hyperparathyroidism [^1152z3aX]. PTU is indicated for hyperthyroidism, not hyperparathyroidism; instead, cinacalcet [^116MBJih] is recommended to lower serum calcium and PTH levels [^111Gy74C].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of propylthiouracil

PTU has **significant adverse effects**, including:

- **Severe liver injury**, liver failure, and death [^114stPbk].
- **Agranulocytosis** and severe infections [^116KgFPQ].
- **Vasculitis** and other serious complications [^116KgFPQ].

Given these risks and lack of efficacy, **PTU should not be used for hyperparathyroidism** [^114stPbk].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

PTU is **not indicated** for hyperparathyroidism because it does not affect PTH secretion or calcium metabolism. Cinacalcet is the **recommended medical therapy** [^1152z3aX], which effectively lowers serum calcium and PTH levels. Given its lack of efficacy and significant adverse effects, PTU should not be used for hyperparathyroidism [^116KgFPQ].

### Propylthiouracil [^116KgFPQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

If you miss a dose of propylthiouracil, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at your regular time. Do not double your dose.

- **What to avoid while taking propylthiouracil**: Propylthiouracil can cause dizziness, drowsiness, or sleepiness. If you experience these symptoms, do not drive, operate machinery, or engage in other dangerous activities until you know how propylthiouracil affects you.

- **Possible side effects of propylthiouracil**: Propylthiouracil may cause serious side effects, including low white blood cell counts. This usually occurs within the first three months of treatment and can be life-threatening. You may have a higher risk of infection when your white blood cell count is low. Call your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms of infection or illness, such as fever, chills, or sore throat.

	- Swelling (inflammation) of the small blood vessels in the body (vasculitis) is another potential side effect. Some individuals have developed vasculitis, a serious complication during treatment with propylthiouracil, which can be fatal. Vasculitis can affect the small blood vessels in the skin, kidneys, or lungs. Symptoms may vary depending on which blood vessels are affected. Inform your healthcare provider immediately if you notice changes in your condition.

### Propylthiouracil [^115CtzdW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Propylthiouracil inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones and is therefore effective in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. The drug does not inactivate existing thyroxine and triiodothyronine stored in the thyroid or circulating in the blood, nor does it interfere with the effectiveness of thyroid hormones administered orally or by injection. It inhibits the conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine in peripheral tissues and may thus be an effective treatment for thyroid storm.

Propylthiouracil is readily absorbed and extensively metabolized. Approximately 35% of the drug is excreted in the urine, in both intact and conjugated forms, within 24 hours.

### Sensipar [^116MBJih]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sensipar is a positive modulator of the calcium-sensing receptor and is indicated for:

- **Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT)**: In adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].
	- **Limitations of use**: Sensipar is not indicated for use in patients with CKD who are not on dialysis due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Hypercalcemia associated with parathyroid carcinoma**: In adult patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

- **Primary hyperparathyroidism**: In adult patients with primary HPT, where parathyroidectomy would be indicated based on serum calcium levels, but who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

---

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^1138aANe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Natpara is a parathyroid hormone indicated as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D, aiming to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the potential risk of osteosarcoma, Natpara is recommended only for patients who cannot be well-controlled on calcium supplements and active forms of vitamin D alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Natpara was not studied in patients with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations. Similarly, Natpara was not studied in patients with acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^113r2BDi]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly concerning thyroid replacement therapy (choice of agent and dosing), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering levothyroxine for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. It is suggested to start at generally lower doses (25–75 mcg/day depending on the degree of TSH elevation) than required for overt hypothyroidism. Further adjustments should be guided by clinical response and follow-up laboratory determinations, including TSH values.

### New perspectives in the management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^1116jEy2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a biochemical syndrome caused by the inappropriate or unregulated overproduction of parathyroid hormone, leading to hypercalcemia. It was previously considered a relatively rare disorder, with clinical manifestations dominated by renal and/or bone disease. However, in modern times, the diagnosis is most frequently recognized coincidentally on biochemical testing in patients evaluated for unrelated complaints. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative treatment for PHPT, with improved outcomes in symptomatic patients following this procedure. However, surgical intervention in patients with no clear clinical features remains controversial. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have developed consensus guidelines giving specific indications for when surgery is recommended in patients with asymptomatic PHPT.

This article examines the impact of treatment on asymptomatic PHPT, focusing on bone disease, neurocognitive function, quality of life, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Medical treatment options, including bisphosphonates and cinacalcet, are also discussed.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115b2HTc]. JAMA Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically parathyroidectomy (minimally invasive surgery), the AAES 2016 guidelines recommend converting to bilateral exploration in the following cases during minimally invasive parathyroidectomy:

- **Discovery of multigland disease**: This necessitates a more comprehensive surgical approach.
- **Inability to identify an abnormal gland**: Conversion is advised to ensure effective treatment.
- **Failure to achieve appropriate intraoperative PTH monitoring decrease**: Adequate decrease in PTH levels is critical for surgical success.

### The management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114h1XPC]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Recent improvements in parathyroid imaging have led to renewed interest in the criteria for and the surgical approach to parathyroidectomy. It therefore seemed appropriate to review evidence relating to the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism for those working within a general endocrine service. The recommendations are based on an electronic search spanning the past decade using the search terms hyperparathyroidism, management, and parathyroidectomy/surgery, but key publications outside this period have also been included. The findings have been graded systematically (Appendix), according to the quality of the information available, to indicate the level of evidence on which they are based.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: What is the role of parathyroid surgery [^117UPCBt]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

A key question remains as to whether normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism (nPHPT) should be considered a different entity from hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism (hPHPT) or if they can be managed using a single approach. While studies have reported that nPHPT presents differently than hPHPT, such as with a higher incidence of multiglandular disease, studies have also shown that a proportion of normocalcaemic patients will progress to hypercalcaemia. In line with this, a standardized approach to managing primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) irrespective of serum calcium appears appropriate, and the aforementioned NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral remains applicable for nPHPT. However, it is important that discussions regarding surgery are individualized and patient expectations are comprehensively explored. This involves counseling the patient to ensure adequate understanding of both the positive effects (a reduction in end-organ effects) and adverse outcomes (risk of surgical complications) that may occur following surgery.

For clinicians, it is also important to avoid routinely screening parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels unless there is evidence to suggest measurement would be appropriate. This includes evidence of calcium homeostasis disturbance, renal dysfunction, and occasionally, if there is vitamin D deficiency.

- **Limitations of the literature**: Many of the studies investigating the role of surgery in the treatment of nPHPT consist of a relatively small cohort of patients. This is compounded by comparative studies in the field generally having a significantly larger number of hPHPT patients relative to nPHPT patients. Future studies should address this discrepancy.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114YZidV]. JAMA Surgery (2016). High credibility.

The guidelines from the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) in 2016 recommend performing a parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism when the serum calcium level exceeds 1 mg/dL above the normal range. This recommendation holds regardless of whether objective symptoms are present or absent.

### Thyroid disease in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletin, number 223 [^114V7ZVK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

The ACOG 2020 guidelines for medical management of thyroid disease in pregnancy, specifically for hyperthyroidism, recommend the initiation of antithyroid drugs such as thioamides. Pregnant patients with overt hyperthyroidism should be treated with either propylthiouracil or methimazole, depending on the trimester, response to prior therapy, and whether thyrotoxicosis is predominantly T4 or T3. The strength of this recommendation is Level A, with the choice of medication specific to the aforementioned factors, characterized as Level B.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^116tzkNS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically parathyroidectomy, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend performing surgery in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism when at least one of the following conditions is present, including in asymptomatic individuals, if no contraindications exist:

- **Serum calcium level**: ≥ 1 mg/dL (≥ 0.25 mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal (ULN).

- **Skeletal involvement**: This includes a fracture identified by vertebral fracture assessment or vertebral X-ray, or bone mineral density with a T-score ≤ -2.5 at any site.

- **Renal involvement**: For example, creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 60 mL/min or the presence of nephrolithiasis with 24-hour urine calcium excretion > 250 mg/day in women or > 300 mg/day in men.

- **Age factor**: Patients under the age of 50 (age < 50 years is considered a sufficient indication without the necessity of other factors).

### Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement from the fourth international workshop [^111dqGvZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is routinely encountered in clinical practices of endocrinology throughout the world. This report distills updated information about diagnostics, clinical features, and management of this disease into a set of revised guidelines.

- **Participants**: Participants representing an international constituency with interest and expertise in various facets of asymptomatic PHPT constituted four Workshop Panels that developed key questions to be addressed. They then convened in an open 3-day conference from September 19–21, 2013, in Florence, Italy, where a series of presentations and discussions addressed these questions. A smaller subcommittee, the Expert Panel, then met in closed session to reach an evidence-based consensus on how to address the questions and data that were aired in the open forum.

- **Evidence**: Preceding the conference, each question was addressed by a relevant, extensive literature search. All presentations and deliberations of the Workshop Panels and the Expert Panel were based upon the latest information gleaned from this literature search.

- **Consensus process**: The Expert Panel considered all the evidence provided by the individual Workshop Panels and then came to a consensus.

- **Conclusion**: In view of new findings since the last International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic PHPT, guidelines for management have been revised. The revised guidelines include: 1) recommendations for more extensive evaluation of the skeletal and renal systems; 2) skeletal and/or renal involvement as determined by further studies.

### Propylthiouracil [^112HRce1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Propylthiouracil is administered orally, with the total daily dosage usually divided into three equal doses at approximately 8-hour intervals.

- **Adults**: The initial dose is 300 mg daily. For patients with severe hyperthyroidism, very large goiters, or both, the initial dose may be increased to 400 mg daily. Occasionally, some patients may require 600 to 900 mg daily initially. The usual maintenance dose is 100 to 150 mg daily.

- **Pediatric patients**: Propylthiouracil is generally not recommended for use in the pediatric patient population, except in rare instances where other alternative therapies are not appropriate options. Studies evaluating appropriate dosing regimens have not been conducted in the pediatric population. However, general practice suggests initiating therapy in patients 6 years or older at a dosage of 50 mg daily, with careful upward titration based on clinical response and evaluation of TSH and free T4 levels. Although cases of severe liver injury have been reported with doses as low as 50 mg/day, most cases were associated with doses of 300 mg/day and higher.

- **Geriatric patients**: Clinical studies of propylthiouracil did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 or over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^116VHx2w]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Our meta-analysis of the largest available number of treated patients demonstrates that PTH replacement therapy is well-tolerated, safe, and effective in the management of hypoparathyroidism. Unlike conventional supplementation, it has beneficial effects on serum phosphate, calcium-phosphate product, and urinary calcium excretion, which are currently unmet needs in chronic hypoparathyroidism. Based on available data, no significant differences between PTH 1–34 and PTH 1–84 have been demonstrated in most outcomes, except for a beneficial effect of PTH 1–84 only in reducing calcium-phosphate product. It also improves several extrarenal outcomes, such as quality of life (QoL) and bone turnover. In addition to its indication as second-line treatment in patients with refractory hypocalcaemia, our results support the use of PTH replacement therapy in patients for whom hyperphosphatemia and increased urinary calcium excretion are clinical concerns.

### Sensipar [^117254cz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sixty-seven patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) who met criteria for parathyroidectomy on the basis of corrected total serum calcium (> 11.3 mg/dL [2.82 mmol/L] and ≤ 12.5 mg/dL [3.12 mmol/L]), but who were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy, participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 33 patients were randomized to receive Sensipar, and 34 patients were randomized to receive a placebo. The mean age of the patients was 72 years; 52% were female, 61% were Caucasian, and 5% were Black.

The study started with a 12-week titration phase followed by a 16-week efficacy-assessment phase. Cinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and titrated to maintain a corrected total serum calcium concentration within the normal range. During the efficacy period, a significantly higher percentage of cinacalcet-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients achieved a mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (≤ 10.3 mg/dL [2.57 mmol/L], 75.8% versus 0%, p < 0.001) and a ≥ 1 mg/dL [0.25 mmol/L] decrease from baseline in mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (84.8% versus 5.9%, p < 0.001). The median dose of Sensipar at the completion of the study was 60 mg/day.

### When would I use medical therapies for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112DEB6V]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Although there may be controversy surrounding the indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism, it remains the only accepted definitive therapy. However, even if parathyroidectomy is indicated, some patients refuse surgery, are medically unfit, or have residual disease inaccessible to further surgery. Some of these patients may be suitable for long-term observation, but others require intervention for the management of symptomatic or moderate to severe hypercalcemia, loss of bone mineral density, or renal calculi. The selection of a suitable therapy for each patient should be individualized.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines [^111L7Zex]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and absent or deficient PTH. This report presents a summary of information about epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, clinical features, and management, and proposes guidelines to help clinicians diagnose, evaluate, and manage this disorder.

- **Participants**: Participants in the First International Conference on the Management of Hypoparathyroidism represented a worldwide constituency with acknowledged interest and expertise in key basic, translational, and clinical aspects of hypoparathyroidism. Three workshop panels were constituted to address questions for presentation and discussion at the conference held in Florence, Italy, May 7–9, 2015. At that time, a series of presentations were made, followed by in-depth discussions in an open forum. Each workshop panel also met in closed sessions to formulate the three evidence-based reports that accompany this summary statement. An Expert Panel then considered this information, developing summaries, guidelines, and a research agenda that constitute this summary statement.

- **Evidence**: Preceding the conference, each workshop panel conducted an extensive literature search, as noted in the individual manuscripts accompanying this report. All presentations were based upon the best peer-reviewed information, taking into account the historical and literature context.

- **Consensus process**: This report represents the Expert Panel's synthesis of the conference material, placed in a context designed to be relevant to clinicians and those engaged in cutting-edge practice.

### Propylthiouracil [^111MWTt5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Storage instructions**: Store propylthiouracil at room temperature between 68ºF to 77ºF (20º to 25ºC). Keep propylthiouracil and all medicines out of the reach of children.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage that progresses over time. Some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcemia or organ damage, yet there is no current method to predict which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT.

A study at a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcemic patients as in those with hypercalcemia, although bone density was higher in the normocalcemic patients. In a group of 52 patients with pHPT, who did not meet any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of those managed conservatively developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period. Surgery also normalized serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, as well as self-reported symptoms, regardless of whether patients were normocalcemic or hypercalcemic before surgery. One study indicated that the effect of parathyroidectomy on quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as beneficial as in hypercalcemic patients.

Based on these findings, international guidelines recommend a careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery, whereas those not meeting indications for treatment should have regular checks of serum calcium and monitoring for the development of organ damage.

### Clinical and practical use of calcimimetics in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [^113mZBwt]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD-related mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBDs) are associated with high cardiovascular and mortality risks. In randomized clinical trials (RCTs), no single drug intervention has been shown to reduce the high mortality risk in dialysis patients. However, several robust secondary analyses point toward important potential benefits of controlling CKD-MBD-related factors and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

The advent of cinacalcet, with its unique mode of action at the calcium-sensing receptor, marked a significant advancement in controlling CKD-MBD. New RCTs have conclusively shown that cinacalcet improves the achievement of target levels for all metabolic abnormalities associated with CKD-MBD and may also attenuate the progression of vascular and valvular calcifications in dialysis patients. However, a final conclusion on the effect of cinacalcet on hard outcomes remains elusive.

Tolerance of cinacalcet is limited by frequent secondary side effects such as nausea, vomiting, hypocalcemia, and oversuppression of parathyroid hormone. These side effects can pose management challenges, particularly for those without extensive experience with the drug.

In this context, this review aims to summarize the results of studies on cinacalcet, up to and including the publication of the recent ADVANCE and EVOLVE RCTs, as well as recent post hoc analyses. It also offers practical guidance on improving the clinical management of the most frequent adverse events associated with cinacalcet, based on both currently available information and personal experience.

### Cinacalcet to prevent parathyrotoxic crises in hypercalcaemic patients awaiting parathyroidectomy [^112wvLUB]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disorder. Hypercalcemia exceeding 3 mmol/L is a major risk factor for parathyrotoxic crises, and management of patients at risk remains a medical challenge. The authors recently managed three such patients referred for severe nephrolithiasis. All had severe hypercalcemia (at least 3 mmol/L). Instead of the usual management, which involves hospitalization in an intensive care environment (for about 5–7 days) for rehydration and infusion of intravenous bisphosphonates, followed by emergency parathyroidectomy, the three patients received ambulatory cinacalcet (not an approved indication), 30 mg twice a day. The serum calcium normalized in two cases and declined to a safe level in the third case, allowing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy to be performed at a date chosen according to the patients' and surgeon's respective schedules. The authors consider that cinacalcet may benefit severely hypercalcaemic patients awaiting surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: An update on diagnostic and management challenges [^114Tu7pc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood because of a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism.

Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism. Given the available data and overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^112cGVE2]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

HypoPTH most commonly occurs after irreversible damage or removal of parathyroid glands during neck surgery for thyroid goiter, head and neck cancer, or hyperparathyroidism. There are multiple definitions of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism (HypoPTH) reported in the literature. According to Asari et al, the term refers to a decrease of PTH with or without symptoms related to hypocalcemia, or to the neuromuscular symptoms related to postoperative calcium levels between 1.9 and 2.1 mmol/L. However, it is best defined as an undetectable or inappropriately low postoperative PTH combined with hypocalcemia, with or without hypocalcemic symptoms.

- **Classification of hypoparathyroidism**: It is classified into two subtypes, depending on the duration of symptoms. The transient HypoPTH persists for a period of ≤ 12 months and appears within 48 hours of surgery, while the permanent HypoPTH persists for > 12 months, accounting for the minority of cases. If PTH values are > 10 pg/mL 12–24 hours postoperatively, the development of permanent HypoPTH is very unlikely. Although it usually occurs early postoperatively, cases of HypoPTH presentation years after neck surgery have been described.

- **Incidence of hypocalcemia**: Hypocalcemia is the most frequent complication after thyroidectomy, and it is estimated that transient HypoPTH occurs in 25.4–83% of patients worldwide after neck surgery, whereas permanent HypoPTH occurs in 0.12–4.6% of patients. The profound variation in incidence highlights the need for increased awareness of the condition. Extensive or repeated neck operations, history of Graves' disease, total thyroidectomy, and bilateral…

### Propylthiouracil [^116u3PPR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

If you become pregnant while taking propylthiouracil, contact your doctor immediately to discuss your therapy.

Propylthiouracil is a prescription medicine used to treat individuals with Graves' disease exhibiting hyperthyroidism or toxic multinodular goiter. Propylthiouracil is utilized under the following conditions: when specific other antithyroid medicines are not effective; when thyroid surgery or radioactive iodine therapy is not an option; and to reduce symptoms of hyperthyroidism in preparation for a thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy. It is important to note that propylthiouracil is not recommended for use in children.

- **Who should not take propylthiouracil**: Do not take propylthiouracil if you are allergic to either propylthiouracil or any of its ingredients. Refer to the end of this medication guide for a comprehensive list of the ingredients in propylthiouracil.

- **What should I tell my doctor before taking propylthiouracil**: Prior to taking propylthiouracil, inform your doctor if you plan to undergo surgery, have any other medical conditions, are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant. If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, it is crucial to consult with your doctor immediately as propylthiouracil may harm or potentially cause the death of your unborn baby. If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, be aware that propylthiouracil can pass into your breast milk. Discuss with your doctor the best way to feed your baby while taking propylthiouracil.

Measurement of the size of the parathyroid glands is mandatory for the selection of the optimal therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Surgical parathyroidectomy or parathyroid intervention is indicated for patients with nodular hyperplasia, as this form is seldom responsive to medical therapy. The selection of the intervention should be determined by the number, size, and location of the parathyroid glands with nodular hyperplasia, including ectopic glands.

### Modern trends for primary hyperparathyroidism: Intervening on less biochemically severe disease [^117LTAW7]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is defined by autonomous parathyroid hormone secretion, which has broad physiologic effects. Parathyroidectomy is the only cure and is recommended for patients demonstrating symptomatic disease and/or end organ damage. However, there may be a benefit to intervening before the development of complications. We sought to characterize institutional trends in the biochemical and symptomatic presentation of PHPT and the associated cure and complication rates.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1,087 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for PHPT, evaluating patients at two-year intervals between 2002 and 2019. We identified signs and symptoms of PHPT based on the 2016 American Association of Endocrine Surgery Guidelines. Trends were evaluated with Kruskal Wallis, Chi-square tests, and Fisher's exact tests.

- **Results**: Patients with PHPT are presenting with lower parathyroid hormone (P = 0.0001) and calcium (P = 0.001) levels in the era. Parathyroidectomy is more commonly performed for borderline guideline-concordant patients with osteopenia (40.2%) and modest calciuria (median 246 mg/dL/24 h). 93.7% are cured, with no difference over time or between groups by guideline concordance.

- **Conclusions**: Parathyroidectomy is increasingly performed for patients who demonstrate modest bone and renal dysfunction. Patients experience excellent cure rates and rarely experience postoperative hypocalcemia, suggesting a role for broader surgical indications.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: New issues and new questions — bridging the past with the future [^11266dkG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. Now, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines, PHPT does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients remain asymptomatic over many years of observation. In individuals with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common, and in these patients, surgery is clearly indicated.

Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation and monitoring process, as there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with the skeletal X-ray, which is invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton that is more than two standard deviations below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and urinary calcium excretion per se can show evidence for progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT.

There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard. Unanswered questions include whether the lower bone density in milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy, and whether fracture risk will therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium, parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery?

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

In this review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured.

In addition to mild hypercalcemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria, as well as with vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcemic PHPT, are less common. Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended for patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduction in nephrolithiasis.

Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy: options for localization and surgical therapy [^116Y9uwP]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy is a threat to the health of both the mother and fetus. Mothers commonly suffer from nephrolithiasis, hyperemesis, or even hypercalcemic crisis. Untreated disease can complicate fetal development, and fetal death is a significant risk. Treatment options, including medical and surgical therapy, are debated in the literature.

- **Methods**: This is a case series comprising seven patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy. Data collected included symptoms at diagnosis, biochemical abnormalities, pathologic findings, treatment regimes, and subsequent maternal and fetal outcomes.

- **Results**: Seven women, aged 20 to 39 years, presented with hyperparathyroidism during pregnancy. The earliest presentation was at 8 weeks and the latest at 38 weeks. Four of the seven patients experienced renal calculi. Calcium levels ranged from 2.7 to 3.5 mmol/l. All were found to have solitary parathyroid adenomas, with two in ectopic locations. Fetal complications included three preterm deliveries and one fetal death, with no cases of neonatal tetany. Maternal and fetal complications could not be predicted based on the duration or severity of hypercalcemia. Three patients were treated during pregnancy with surgery; two of these had ectopic glands that required reoperations with a novel approach using Tc-99m sestamibi scanning during pregnancy to assist in localizing the abnormal gland. Four cases were treated postpartum with a combination of open and minimally invasive approaches after localization. No operative complications or fetal loss related to surgery were reported.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: What is the role of parathyroid surgery [^111JjFxX]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Patient work-up and assessment with regard to candidates for surgery involve referral for surgery. At present, for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) as a whole, referral for surgery is deemed necessary if patients are symptomatic, if there is end-organ involvement, or if serum calcium is greater than 2.85 mmol/l. NICE also recommends considering surgery for those who do not fulfill the above criteria. This appears to be a reasonable starting point for normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism (nPHPT) patients, as those who may stand to benefit from the prevention of progression of end-organ effects can be referred for surgery. Questions remain, however, on whether surgery is of benefit to reduce the risk of a number of non-skeletal and renal outcomes in nPHPT and whether alternative criteria should be developed.

- **Localisation studies**: Prior to surgery, ultrasonography and radionuclide scanning are utilized in an attempt to localize a parathyroid adenoma. However, studies have shown that imaging in nPHPT is less successful compared with hypercalcaemic PHPT (hPHPT); this poses an additional challenge from a surgical perspective. In their case series of 616 patients, Trinh et al. reported a significantly higher incidence of multi-glandular disease (p = 0.002) in nPHPT patients, with 12% of nPHPT patients having multi-glandular disease compared with 4% of hPHPT patients. Moreover, Gómez-Ramírez et al. reported that parathyroid adenomas of nPHPT patients weighed on average 656 mg less than those of hPHPT patients (p = 0.058). These findings suggest a greater incidence of multi-glandular disease and smaller adenomas in nPHPT.

	- For secondary hyperparathyroidism patients with CKD on dialysis, if serum calcium falls below 8.4 mg/dL but remains above 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia occur, calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D sterols can be used to raise serum calcium. If serum calcium falls below 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia persist and the dose of vitamin D cannot be increased, withhold administration of Sensipar until serum calcium levels reach 8.0 mg/dL and/or symptoms of hypocalcemia have resolved. Treatment should be reinitiated using the next lowest dose of Sensipar [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Hemodialysis patients' preferences for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism [^113BgLLJ]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The study employed discrete choice experiments (DCEs) which require patients to choose among hypothetical treatment options. These options are defined by different attributes that can take on various levels. By analyzing responses to these treatment-choice questions, researchers can deduce the tradeoffs patients are willing to make among treatment attributes.

- **Survey instrument development**: Five steps were involved in developing the DCE survey instrument: a literature review, a review of patient resources issued by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), nephrologist input, and a focus group coupled with qualitative pretest interviews with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients suffering from secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). This process ensured that the survey questions were clear and comprehensible and identified necessary refinements before survey administration. The first three steps assisted in the preliminary selection of potentially relevant SHPT attributes. The appendix in Additional file 1 provides further details about the focus group, qualitative pretests, and presents the final survey instrument.

The DCE survey instrument was developed in line with good research practices to elicit respondents' preferences for three hypothetical treatment options: surgery and two medication alternatives. These options were presented in a series of questions. The hypothetical treatments were defined by attributes such as efficacy, safety and tolerability, mode of administration, and out-of-pocket costs. These attributes and levels were carefully chosen to represent significant features of SHPT management.

- **Hypocalcemia**: In 26-week studies of patients with secondary HPT and CKD on dialysis, 66% of patients receiving Sensipar, compared with 25% of patients receiving placebo, developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8.4 mg/dL. Additionally, 29% of patients receiving Sensipar, compared with 11% of patients receiving placebo, developed at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL. Less than 1% of patients in each group permanently discontinued study drug due to hypocalcemia.

- In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with secondary HPT and CKD receiving dialysis, where patients were treated for up to 64 months (mean duration of treatment was 21 months in the cinacalcet group), 75% of patients receiving Sensipar, compared with 29% of patients receiving placebo, developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8.4 mg/dL. Also, 33% of cinacalcet patients, compared with 12% of patients receiving placebo, had at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL. Most of the cases of severe hypocalcemia less than 7.5 mg/dL (21/33 = 64%) occurred during the first 6 months. In this trial, 1.1% of patients receiving Sensipar and 0.1% of patients receiving placebo permanently discontinued study drug due to hypocalcemia.

### Safety and efficacy of 5 years of treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone in adults with hypoparathyroidism [^111hiVMH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays a central role in mineral homeostasis by stimulating renal reabsorption of calcium, promoting renal phosphate excretion, and stimulating conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D), the fully active form of vitamin D. Moreover, 1,25[OH]2D enhances absorption of calcium and phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, PTH is a potent regulator of bone turnover, the coupled process of bone resorption and bone formation; deficiency of PTH results in decreased bone turnover.

Conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism includes oral calcium and active vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol), as well as thiazide diuretics and magnesium supplementation as needed. Although this approach can correct the hypocalcemia associated with hypoparathyroidism, it does not replace other functions of PTH and can lead to or worsen hypercalciuria. Other concerns with conventional therapy include unpredictable episodes of hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia; increased serum calcium-phosphorus (Ca × P) product; and complications such as extraskeletal calcifications, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and decreased kidney function. Reduced quality of life and symptoms of hypocalcemia are consistent findings among patients with hypoparathyroidism receiving conventional treatment.

### The treatment of renal hyperparathyroidism [^116D1XNZ]. Endocrine-related Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

Renal hyperparathyroidism (rHPT) is a complex and challenging disorder. It develops early in the course of renal failure and is associated with increased risks of fractures, cardiovascular disease, and death. It is treated medically, but when medical therapy cannot control the hyperparathyroidism, surgical parathyroidectomy is an option.

In this review, we summarize the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and medical treatment. We describe the effects of renal transplantation and discuss the indications and strategies in parathyroidectomy for rHPT. Renal hyperparathyroidism develops early in renal failure, mainly as a consequence of lower levels of vitamin D, hypocalcemia, diminished excretion of phosphate, and inability to activate vitamin D.

Treatment consists of supplying vitamin D and reducing phosphate intake. In later stages, calcimimetics might be added. RHPT refractory to medical treatment can be managed surgically with parathyroidectomy. Risks of surgery are small but not negligible. Parathyroidectomy should likely not be too radical, especially if the patient is a candidate for future renal transplantation. Subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation are recognized surgical options. Renal transplantation improves rHPT but does not cure it.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^111Xmf47]. JAMA Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically in connection with parathyroidectomy, the AAES 2016 guidelines recommend performing parathyroidectomy in patients with objective evidence of renal involvement, including:

- **Silent nephrolithiasis**: Detected via renal imaging.
- **Nephrocalcinosis**.
- **Hypercalciuria**: A 24-hour urine calcium level > 400 mg/dL, with increased stone risk.
- **Impaired renal function**: A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min.

### Methodology for the guidelines on evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism [^114jRBXb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

To develop guidelines for hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism, the panel assembled a group of experts in parathyroid disorders, general endocrinologists, representatives of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and systematic review and guideline methodologists. The guideline panel referred to a formal process following the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methodology to issue GRADEd recommendations.

In this approach, panelists and methodologists formatted the questions, conducted systematic reviews, evaluated the risk of bias, assessed the certainty of evidence, and presented a summary of findings in a transparent fashion. For most recommendations, the task forces used a less structured approach, largely based on narrative reviews, to issue non-GRADEd recommendations.

The panel issued eight GRADEd recommendations (seven for hypoparathyroidism and one for hyperparathyroidism). Each GRADEd recommendation is linked to the underlying body of evidence and judgments regarding the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. This includes considerations of values and preferences, costs, feasibility, acceptability, and equity.

This article summarizes the methodology for issuing GRADEd and non-GRADEd recommendations for patients with hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism.

### Approach to the patient: Management of parathyroid diseases across pregnancy [^112GUCcN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Parathyroid disorders during pregnancy are relatively rare and are characterized by disturbances in calcium and mineral metabolism. In primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), elevated or inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels increase serum calcium concentrations, while in hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), reduced or inadequately low PTH levels lead to hypocalcemia. PHPT is a common endocrine disease with a female predominance and an age-dependent increase in prevalence. In contrast, HypoPT is a rare condition primarily caused by anterior neck surgery.

Management of parathyroid disorders during pregnancy can be challenging and significantly differs in various ways from management in nonpregnant patients. Scientific evidence from systematic evaluations regarding this issue is very limited, particularly concerning maternal management and fetal outcomes. Clinicians caring for pregnant patients with parathyroid disorders need sufficient knowledge of the pathophysiology of the diseases and the physiology of pregnancy. Pregnancy induces fundamental changes in bone and mineral metabolism in women during pregnancy and lactation, which have been summarized in Fig. 1.

### Medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Proceedings of the fourth international workshop on the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^1163j2zS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). High credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The only available definitive therapy is parathyroidectomy, which is appropriate to consider in all patients. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on calcium and vitamin D supplementation and medical management for those patients with PHPT who cannot or do not want to undergo surgery.

- **Methods**: Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and relevant articles published between 2008 and 2013 were reviewed in detail. The questions were addressed by the panel of experts, and consensus was established at the time of the workshop.

- **Conclusions**: The recommended calcium intake in patients with PHPT should follow guidelines established for all individuals. It is not recommended to limit calcium intake in patients with PHPT who do not undergo surgery. Patients with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be repleted with doses of vitamin D, aiming to bring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to ≥ 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) at a minimum, but a goal of ≥ 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) is also reasonable. Pharmacological approaches are available and should be reserved for those patients in whom it is desirable to lower the serum calcium, increase BMD, or both. For the control of hypercalcemia, cinacalcet is the treatment of choice. Cinacalcet reduces serum calcium concentrations to normal in many cases but has only a modest effect on serum PTH levels. However, bone mineral density (BMD) does not change. To improve BMD, bisphosphonate therapy is recommended for further exploration.

### Calcium citrate versus calcium carbonate in the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism: A randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial [^116jzWQ6]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, crossover, single-center study was conducted from October 2019 to April 2020. Subjects with postsurgical chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) were consecutively screened at the bone outpatient clinic of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico. The diagnosis of postsurgical chronic HypoPT was established at least six months after surgery based on clinical and biochemical features, such as low or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels with low calcium levels on at least two prior occasions separated by an interval of at least 30 days.

All patients underwent thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, nontoxic goiter, or Graves' disease. Subjects who were initially included met the following criteria: they were men or women, aged 18 to 75 years, with no change of treatment (calcium supplements: calcium carbonate and active vitamin D) over a three-month period before enrollment, stable serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations, and an absence of hypocalcemic symptoms over the three months before enrollment. Additionally, they required active vitamin D (calcitriol ≥ 0.25 mcg daily) and oral calcium (≥ 1000 mg daily). All subjects had 25OHD values higher than 20 ng/mL, as suggested by the European Society of Endocrinology guidelines for the management of hypoparathyroidism.

Patients with a clinical history and/or ultrasound evidence of kidney stones, liver or renal failure (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30 mL/min), hypercalcemia detected in the last year, hyperthyroidism from any cause, other calcium metabolism disorders, and/or using therapeutic interventions contrary to study protocols were excluded.

### Propylthiouracil [^114stPbk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Read this Medication Guide before you start taking propylthiouracil and each time you get a refill, as there may be new information. This guide does not replace consulting your doctor about your medical condition or treatment.

- **Important information**:
	- Propylthiouracil can cause serious side effects, including severe liver problems. In some cases, liver issues such as liver failure, the need for a liver transplant, or death can occur in individuals taking propylthiouracil. Stop taking propylthiouracil and contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:

	- Fever
	- Loss of appetite
	- Nausea
	- Vomiting
	- Tiredness
	- Itchiness
	- Pain or tenderness in your right upper stomach area (abdomen)
	- Dark (tea-colored) urine
	- Pale or light-colored bowel movements (stools)
	- Yellowing of your skin or whites of your eyes

- **Serious risks during pregnancy**:
	- Propylthiouracil may cause liver problems, liver failure, and death in pregnant women, and it may harm your unborn baby. It may also cause liver issues or death in infants born to women who take propylthiouracil during certain trimesters of pregnancy. Propylthiouracil may be used when an antithyroid drug is necessary during or just before the first trimester of pregnancy.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: A literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of the pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, and they can present a challenge for diagnosis and management.

The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that are found to improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high-volume centers.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^112Euznm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs and symptoms of high or low blood calcium levels.

Natpara is a prescription parathyroid hormone (PTH) used with calcium and vitamin D to control low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) in people with low PTH blood levels (hypoparathyroidism). It is only for people who do not respond well to treatment with calcium and active forms of vitamin D alone, as it may increase the risk of bone cancer (osteosarcoma). Natpara was not studied in people with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations, nor in those who develop sudden hypoparathyroidism after surgery.

It is not known if Natpara is safe and effective for children 18 years of age and younger. Therefore, it should not be used in children and young adults whose bones are still growing. Avoid using Natpara if you are allergic to parathyroid hormone or any of its ingredients. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in Natpara.

Before you start using Natpara, inform your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions.

### Imaging techniques in parathyroid surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism [^117SAzJp]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

As more patients present with the incidental diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism due to biochemical screening, treatment guidelines have been developed for the condition. The management of primary hyperparathyroidism has evolved in recent years, with considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches. Successful localization of the diseased gland(s) by nuclear imaging and anatomical studies, along with rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay, has allowed for focused and minimally invasive surgical techniques. Patients in whom localization studies have identified single-gland adenoma or unilateral disease are candidates for such focused approaches instead of the traditional approach of bilateral exploration. These imaging techniques have also been critical in the successful management of patients with persistent disease.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112EhSbW]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Since the last international guidelines were published in 2014 on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), new information has become available regarding evaluation, diagnosis, epidemiology, genetics, classical and nonclassical manifestations, surgical and nonsurgical approaches, and natural history. An international group, consisting of over 50 experts in these various aspects of PHPT, was convened to summarize these developments. This paper provides the results of the task force assigned to review information on the management of PHPT.

For this task force, two questions were the subject of systematic reviews using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. The full report addressing surgical and nonsurgical management of PHPT, utilizing the GRADE methodology, is published separately in this series. In this report, we summarize the results of that methodological review and expand them to encompass a broader body of new knowledge that did not specifically fit the criteria of the GRADE methodology. Together, both the systematic and narrative reviews of the literature, summarized in this paper, provide the most complete information available at the time of writing.

A panel of experts considered the last set of international guidelines in light of the newer data and assessed the need for their revision. This report provides the evidentiary background to the guidelines report, where evidence from all task forces is synthesized.

### Skeletal effects of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112xV9qE]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review the effect of primary hyperparathyroidism on bone mass and fracture occurrence, as well as the advances in medical management of this relatively common condition.

- **Methods**: We conducted a MEDLINE search of peer-reviewed publications covering the period from 1960 to 1999. The studies reviewed evaluated bone mass and fracture risk in primary hyperparathyroidism for both male and female populations. We also reviewed studies assessing the impact of hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonates, calcimimetic agents, and surgical treatment on bone mass and fracture risk. Preference was given to prospective studies, though retrospective, cross-sectional, and case-control studies were also evaluated.

- **Results**: Most densitometry studies available at that time were limited in their design. Some cross-sectional studies using both single-photon absorptiometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry demonstrated preferential bone loss at cortical skeletal sites. In contrast, bone density appeared relatively well preserved at cancellous bone sites. The absence of large prospective controlled trials makes it challenging to determine fracture incidence associated with hyperparathyroidism. Retrospective and case-control studies have offered conflicting results regarding fracture incidence in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy has shown value in improving bone mineral density at both the lumbar spine and the femoral neck. Additionally, hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with primary hyperparathyroidism has shown potential benefits.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^111yQyJ6]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common clinical problem for which the only definitive management is surgery. Surgical management has evolved considerably during the last several decades. The objective of these guidelines is to develop evidence-based practices that enhance the appropriate, safe, and effective practice of parathyroidectomy.

A multidisciplinary panel reviewed medical literature from January 1, 1985, to July 1, 2015, using PubMed. Levels of evidence were determined according to the American College of Physicians grading system, and recommendations were discussed until a consensus was reached.

Initial evaluations should include 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, 24-hour urine calcium measurement, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and supplementation for vitamin D deficiency. Parathyroidectomy is indicated for all symptomatic patients and should be considered for most asymptomatic patients, as it is more cost-effective than observation or pharmacologic therapy. Cervical ultrasonography or other high-resolution imaging is recommended for operative planning. Patients with nonlocalizing imaging remain suitable candidates for surgery. Preoperative parathyroid biopsy should be avoided. Surgeons who perform high volumes of operations have better outcomes. The possibility of multigland disease should be routinely considered. Both focused, image-guided surgery (minimally invasive parathyroidectomy) and bilateral exploration are appropriate operations that achieve high cure rates. For minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring via a reliable protocol is important.

### Is minimally invasive parathyroid surgery an option for patients with gestational primary hyperparathyroidism [^115hxD6v]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive parathyroid surgery (MIPS) has been evaluated as a potential treatment for patients suffering from gestational primary hyperparathyroidism. The study's design encompassed the collection, analysis, and interpretation of relevant data. The manuscript, subsequently drafted and revised, reflects the contributions of all authors, who have approved the final version. The investigation provides insights into whether MIPS can be considered a viable option for this specific patient population.

### What medical options should be considered for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Ndujv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia in the face of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For those with symptomatic disease or who meet surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. However, patients who do not meet surgical criteria or who cannot undergo or refuse surgery must be managed medically.

Medical management of PHPT involves the continual assessment to determine who will benefit from surgical intervention, replacement of vitamin D, treatment of parathyroid bone disease, and management of hypercalcemia and renal stone disease.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114xjQLs]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines. The methods involved searching the laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, which serves 127,000 inhabitants, for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. In 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, new blood tests, and clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

- **Results**: Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists, and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some form of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

The conclusion emphasizes that primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a significant number of patients in the clinical setting. It is crucial to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to research.

### Management of thyroid disorders in pregnancy: Green-top guideline no. 76 [^112fq8aj]. BJOG (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for thyroid disease in pregnancy, specifically concerning hyperthyroidism, the RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend initiating propylthiouracil as the preferred antithyroid drug during early pregnancy if treatment is required. If conception occurs while on carbimazole, it is advised to switch to propylthiouracil as soon as possible before 10 weeks of gestation, using a dose ratio of 1:20 (carbimazole:propylthiouracil). Do not switch to propylthiouracil if presentation occurs after 10 weeks of gestation.
