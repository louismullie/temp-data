## Question

Treatments for bromohidrosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatments for bromhidrosis (axillary malodor). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining bromhidrosis and confirming diagnosis and severity. Then, I should verify differential diagnoses and contributors that can mimic or worsen odor. Next, I will review first‑line and adjunctive noninvasive therapies, followed by energy‑based options and surgical approaches for refractory or severe cases. Finally, I need to outline monitoring, durability, and shared decision‑making considerations to individualize care.

> Let me consider the pathophysiology and clinical impact first. Bromhidrosis typically arises when apocrine (and sometimes eccrine) secretions are degraded by cutaneous bacteria, generating malodor that can substantially impair social and emotional well‑being, so any plan must address both sweat production and microbiome‑odor interactions to reduce substrate and odor formation [^114ZvJ4M] [^114j42Cv].

> Wait, let me verify how to grade severity before I recommend treatments. Although there is no universally accepted malodor scale, a pragmatic approach uses a patient‑reported malodor rating together with quality‑of‑life tools; the pivotal side‑by‑side RCT of botulinum toxin A (BTX‑A) for bromhidrosis used subjective malodor ratings and gravimetric sweat measures, and I should be careful not to overstate the exact numeric scale used there, but the concept of patient‑rated malodor reduction is sound. In practice, I can adapt hyperhidrosis instruments such as HDSS and DLQI to track change, acknowledging this is extrapolated for bromhidrosis but correlates with meaningful clinical improvement in axillary sweat disorders [^117WH8Wt] [^114t9BSF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I exclude mimics and contributors. I should confirm there is no secondary hyperhidrosis pattern or systemic driver, because generalized or later‑onset sweating suggests secondary causes that warrant targeted evaluation and could alter management. I also need to consider intertriginous conditions that amplify bacterial overgrowth, and importantly, I must keep olfactory reference syndrome on my radar because patients with ORS may report malodor without objective findings and are best helped by early psychiatric care rather than procedural interventions [^1118MAeV] [^114ZvJ4M] [^1112c1J1].

> Now, about first‑line therapy, I initially thought to start with aluminum salt antiperspirants as is common in hyperhidrosis, but wait, I should verify whether bromhidrosis evidence points elsewhere. The most direct, higher‑quality evidence for bromhidrosis supports intradermal BTX‑A as a preferred initial option for mild‑to‑moderate disease because it reduces both odor ratings and sweat, with histologic atrophy of apocrine glands, and contemporary reviews position BTX‑A as the anchor of a severity‑based algorithm for bromhidrosis, while acknowledging the need for repeat treatments over time [^117WH8Wt] [^111ENQpv] [^114j42Cv] [^116o1MSB].

> I need to check dosing, technique, durability, and what to tell patients. Typical axillary dosing falls in the 50–200 unit per axilla range for BoNT‑A products using a grid of superficial intradermal injections spaced 1–2 cm apart; ultrasound guidance can improve placement in selected cases, and histology confirms apocrine gland hypoplasia after treatment. Effects generally last about 3–6 months before retreatment, although individual duration varies by serotype, dose, and disease burden, so setting expectations up front is essential [^114t9BSF] [^1146rr7U] [^117WH8Wt] [^113caSqu].

> Let me verify safety and product selection. BoNT‑A has an excellent safety profile in axillary use with mostly local injection‑site pain or bruising and no consistent signal for serious adverse events in systematic reviews, whereas BoNT‑B may be more immunogenic and thus less favored for chronic indications requiring repeated dosing, which matters for long‑term bromhidrosis control [^114g9BsC] [^111ENQpv].

> Next, I should review noninvasive adjuncts when injections are not desired or as bridge therapy. Aluminum salt antiperspirants reduce sweat delivery to the skin surface and can meaningfully decrease substrate for odor; practical application at night to dry skin and rinsing in the morning reduces irritant dermatitis risk. Evidence comes primarily from hyperhidrosis cohorts and open‑label trials but is a rational, low‑cost option for milder presentations or as adjunctive care [^115yKt5g] [^116SsF8M].

> I will now examine topical anticholinergics, but I should confirm that data are mostly for hyperhidrosis and extrapolated to odor reduction by decreasing sweat. Glycopyrronium bromide 1% cream and glycopyrronium tosylate cloths improve objective sweat reduction and patient‑reported outcomes, while sofpironium bromide gel demonstrates efficacy across phase II/III programs; these can be considered when BTX‑A is declined or contraindicated, with counseling on local anticholinergic effects and the off‑label nature for bromhidrosis per se [^111cNvKx] [^114XCM3a] [^111imcD7] [^115dTr5X] [^1127Zvyr].

> But wait, what if BTX‑A is insufficient or the patient prefers device‑based therapy? Energy‑based options such as microwave thermolysis, lasers, and radiofrequency target sweat glands with variable durability; the literature suggests promise for bromhidrosis but emphasizes heterogeneity and the need for larger studies, so I should frame them as reasonable second‑line choices with shared decision‑making about re‑treatments and skin‑related adverse effects. A newer noninvasive targeted alkali thermolysis patch shows short‑term sweat reduction in axillary hyperhidrosis and may evolve as an option to lower sweat substrate for odor, though bromhidrosis‑specific data are pending [^114j42Cv] [^116o1MSB] [^113Dc7Hr].

> Let me consider when surgery is appropriate, and I should double‑check complication profiles. For severe, refractory bromhidrosis, surgical reduction of apocrine glands via suction‑curettage or related techniques can provide durable control but carries risks of hematoma, wound issues, and scarring; understanding factors associated with complications helps in patient selection and technique planning. Limited series also describe ultrasound‑assisted approaches and VASER methods with variable success, and in adolescents, combining gland‑targeted procedures with ultrasound‑guided BTX may enhance outcomes while minimizing scarring, though high‑quality comparative data are sparse [^115a4H6B] [^115GPsDu] [^116Ri9oU] [^1146rr7U].

> I should confirm how to monitor response and set retreatment intervals. Use consistent patient‑reported malodor ratings, adapted HDSS where sweat contribution is significant, and QoL instruments such as DLQI or validated axillary hyperhidrosis PROs to track meaningful change; BTX‑A trials and hyperhidrosis meta‑analyses show that a two‑point HDSS improvement and DLQI reductions around 5 points align with clinically important benefit, which can anchor shared decisions about repeating or escalating therapy as effects wane [^117WH8Wt] [^114t9BSF] [^114XCM3a].

> Hmm, wait a minute, am I overlooking odor‑directed antimicrobial strategies. While not bromhidrosis‑specific in high‑quality trials, reducing bacterial load can logically mitigate malodor; in other odor conditions, topical antiseptics or metronidazole have been used to reduce odor, so a cautious, short‑course trial alongside sweat‑reducing measures may help selected patients with prominent intertriginous colonization, provided skin tolerability is monitored closely [^114ayvHG] [^114ZvJ4M].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure the plan is individualized and evidence‑aligned. After confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics, I prioritize BTX‑A for mild‑to‑moderate bromhidrosis given direct RCT evidence and favorable safety, supported by adjunctive aluminum salts or topical anticholinergics for patients desiring noninvasive options; for refractory cases, I discuss energy‑based devices and, if severe, carefully selected surgical gland‑reduction approaches, all framed within shared decision‑making about durability, costs, and adverse effects, with structured PRO‑based follow‑up to guide retreatment timing [^117WH8Wt] [^111ENQpv] [^114j42Cv] [^116o1MSB].

---

Bromhidrosis management should be **stepwise** and tailored to severity and patient preference [^114j42Cv]. Start with **topical antiperspirants** (aluminum chloride or glycopyrronium) and hygiene [^116SsF8M] [^114XCM3a]; escalate to botulinum toxin A for moderate cases [^111ENQpv] [^117WH8Wt], and consider microwave thermolysis or laser for longer-lasting results. Reserve surgery (suction-curettage, ultrasound-assisted liposuction, or apocrine excision) for severe or refractory cases, with high efficacy but higher complication risk [^115a4H6B] [^115GPsDu]. Combination therapies and patient education improve outcomes, and treatment choice should balance efficacy, safety, and durability [^1146rr7U] [^116o1MSB].

---

## Topical treatments

Topical therapies are **first-line** because they are easy to use, safe, and accessible [^115qmASq].

- **Aluminum chloride hexahydrate**: 15–20% solutions block ducts and reduce sweat; effective for mild-to-moderate bromhidrosis, but can cause irritation [^116SsF8M] [^114j42Cv].

- **Glycopyrronium tosylate**: topical anticholinergic that reduces sweat; effective and well tolerated, with mild local irritation or dry mouth [^114XCM3a] [^11459iiL].

- **Hygiene measures**: regular washing, antibacterial soaps, and hair removal reduce bacterial load and odor [^114ZvJ4M].

---

## Botulinum toxin injections

Botulinum toxin A is a minimally invasive, **highly effective** option for moderate-to-severe bromhidrosis [^117WH8Wt]. It inhibits acetylcholine release, reducing sweat and bacterial breakdown [^111ENQpv]. Effectiveness exceeds 90%, with a 3–8-month duration of effect, necessitating repeat injections [^116o1MSB] [^114g9BsC]. It is generally safe; transient injection-site pain or mild weakness may occur [^116HaxPr].

---

## Energy-based therapies

Energy-based devices offer minimally invasive, **longer-lasting alternatives**. Microwave thermolysis (**miraDry**) uses microwave energy to destroy sweat glands and is effective with minimal downtime, though temporary numbness or swelling can occur. Laser therapy targets and destroys sweat glands and is effective, but **long-term durability remains uncertain**.

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for **severe or refractory cases**, offering high efficacy but carrying a higher complication risk [^115a4H6B].

- **Suction-curettage**: removes apocrine glands via small incisions; effective with low recurrence, but hematoma or delayed healing can occur [^115a4H6B].

- **Ultrasound-assisted liposuction**: emulsifies and removes glands; effective with low recurrence, but risks include hematoma or skin sloughing [^115GPsDu].

- **Apocrine gland excision**: direct removal of glands; highly effective but higher risk of scarring and infection.

---

## Combination therapies

Combining modalities can **enhance outcomes** and reduce recurrence. Botulinum toxin plus electrocauterization provides **superior odor control and satisfaction** compared with single modalities [^1146rr7U]. Similarly, a **topical plus surgical** approach (using topical agents before or after surgery) can improve results and reduce recurrence.

---

## Patient education and lifestyle modifications

Education and lifestyle changes are **essential adjuncts**. Regular washing, antibacterial soaps, and hair removal reduce odor; avoiding spicy foods, alcohol, and strong-smelling foods may help; and wearing breathable fabrics and changing clothes frequently further reduces odor [^114ZvJ4M].

---

## Comparative effectiveness and safety

| **Treatment modality** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Duration** | **Recurrence** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Topical antiperspirants | Moderate | High | Short-term | High [^115qmASq] |
| Botulinum toxin | High | High | 3–8 months | Moderate |
| Microwave thermolysis | High | Moderate | Long-term | Low |
| Laser therapy | Moderate | Moderate | Unknown | Moderate [^114j42Cv] |
| Surgical interventions | High | Moderate-low | Permanent | Low [^115a4H6B] |

---

## Emerging treatments and research

Emerging options include topical anticholinergics such as **sofpironium bromide**, which show promise in trials [^1127Zvyr] [^115dTr5X]. Research is evaluating the durability and safety of energy-based devices and exploring multimodal combination strategies to optimize outcomes [^114j42Cv] [^1146rr7U].

---

A **stepwise approach** — topical agents and hygiene first, then botulinum toxin, energy-based devices, and surgery for refractory cases — balances efficacy, safety, and durability [^116o1MSB]. Combination therapies and patient education further improve outcomes [^1146rr7U] [^114ZvJ4M].

### Treatment of axillary bromhidrosis in adolescents by combining electrocauterization with ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin type A injection [^1146rr7U]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of combining electrocauterization with ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin type A (BOTOX) injection for adolescents with axillary bromhidrosis. From January 2015 to January 2018, 90 adolescents with axillary bromhidrosis were recruited and randomly divided into three groups: group A, group B, and group C.

- **Procedure details**:
	- Patients in group A underwent electrocauterization after the removal of apocrine sweat glands. Patients in group B received an ultrasound-guided BOTOX injection. Patients in group C had electrocauterization after the removal of apocrine sweat glands followed by ultrasound-guided BOTOX administration two weeks later.

- **Follow-up and results**:
	- All patients were followed up for one year. The percentages of axillary malodor score at twelve months after treatments compared with pre-operation for group A, group B, and group C were 20.2%, 27.5%, and 12.5%, respectively. Significant statistical differences were observed in the changes of axillary malodor score among the three groups at three, six, nine, and twelve months postoperatively. Satisfaction rates for group A, group B, and group C were 90.0%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively. The side effects after surgery in group A were similar to those in group C, and no side effect was observed in group B. The one-year postoperative scar formation rate for group A was 16.7%, significantly higher than group B (0) and group C (6.66%).

The combination of electrocauterization after the removal of apocrine sweat glands with ultrasound-guided BOTOX injection showed better treatment effects.

### Bromhidrosis treatment modalities: A literature review [^114j42Cv]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Treatment options for bromhidrosis include botulinum toxin therapy, microwave-based therapy, laser therapy, and surgical intervention. Limited studies compare their efficacies.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this literature review is to compare the efficacy and safety of these treatments for bromhidrosis.

- **Methods**: A PubMed search included the terms bromhidrosis and bromhidrosis AND treatment.

- **Results**: A total of 25 articles were reviewed. Botulinum toxin therapy shows consistent benefit but requires repeated therapies. Microwave therapies have shown promising results but require larger cohort sizes with bromhidrosis. Similarly, laser therapy has shown promise with biopsy-proven results, but long-lasting effects remain unknown. Surgery has the best long-term prognosis, but the ideal surgical method remains unknown.

- **Limitations**: Each study varied in their treatment interval and method of assessing bromhidrosis, making direct comparisons difficult.

- **Conclusions**: Managing bromhidrosis requires shared decision-making with the patient. Mild-to-moderate symptoms may be treated initially with botulinum toxin therapy. In cases that are refractory, laser therapy should be considered, as it is better studied than microwave therapy currently. Lastly, if the condition is severe and refractory to other options, surgery can be considered, although the ideal method remains unknown.

### Contemporary algorithm for treating bromhidrosis: A review of treatment available [^116o1MSB]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Bromhidrosis significantly impacts individuals' social, professional, and emotional well-being. Traditional treatments, such as en bloc excision and alcohol injections, are now less favored due to associated complications and suboptimal outcomes. Evidence identifies botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) as the first-line treatment for mild to moderate cases (Grade 0–2) due to its high efficacy, excellent safety profile, and minimally invasive nature. BTX-A achieves effectiveness rates exceeding 90%, with results persisting for 3–8 months.

A standardized grading system guides treatment selection, reserving surgical interventions for severe cases (Grade 3) or situations where BTX-A is contraindicated. Modern surgical approaches, such as hydrosurgery and endoscopic-assisted procedures, have shown improved outcomes and significantly fewer complications compared to traditional methods.

Energy-based therapies, including laser, radiofrequency, and microwave treatments, also provide viable alternatives for patients unsuitable for BTX-A, demonstrating documented efficacy and minimal invasiveness. This review proposes an evidence-based treatment algorithm for bromhidrosis management, highlighting the central role of BTX-A while detailing alternative strategies.

The framework integrates disease severity assessment, patient preferences, and cost considerations to support optimal clinical decision-making. By adopting this systematic approach, clinicians can enhance treatment selection and improve patient outcomes.

### Using neuromodulators for salivary, eccrine, and apocrine gland disorders [^111ENQpv]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Sialorrhea, hyperhidrosis, bromhidrosis, and chromhidrosis are common glandular disorders that substantially impact patients' health and quality of life. Botulinum toxin can safely and temporarily decrease gland secretions by targeting the parasympathetic cholinergic neurons, resulting in diminished saliva and sweat production.

- **Objective**: The objective of this article is to describe the applications of neuromodulators for the treatment of salivary, eccrine, and apocrine glands.

- **Methods**: PubMed was searched from inception to February 1, 2024, using search terms "neurotoxin", "botulinum toxin", "sialorrhea", "hyperhidrosis", "bromhidrosis", and "chromhidrosis".

- **Results**: Incobotulinumtoxin A and Rimabotulinumtoxin B are approved by the FDA for the treatment of sialorrhea. Onabotulinumtoxin A is the only FDA-approved botulinum toxin for axillary hyperhidrosis and is used off-label for hyperhidrosis of nonaxillary sites, bromhidrosis, and chromhidrosis. Compared to botulinum toxin serotype A, serotype B has been associated with more immunogenicity, which may have implications for patients requiring long-term treatment for chronic glandular disorders.

- **Conclusion**: Neuromodulators are safe and effective for the noninvasive treatment of excess gland activity and can improve patients' quality of life. While substantial literature supports botulinum toxin treatments for hyperhidrosis, further studies are needed to characterize standard dosing and administration techniques for sialorrhea, bromhidrosis, and chromhidrosis.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: A meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^114t9BSF]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The efficacy of BTX injections was analyzed in eight studies that described the effect of these injections for the treatment of focal hyperhidrosis. The serotype used in the trials varied, with six studies using BTX A and two studies using BTX B, with a dose range of 50–200 units and 2,250–20,000 units, respectively.

Placebo treatments using 0.9% sodium chloride solution were compared to BTX injections for axillary hyperhidrosis in six studies, and for craniofacial and lower limb hyperhidrosis in one study. The following outcome parameters were evaluated in the comparative meta-analysis with placebo:

- **Sweat reduction**: A > 50% sweat reduction from baseline at weeks 2–6 in gravimetric analysis was expressed as a risk difference (RD) for axillary hyperhidrosis (RD: 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.51, 0.76], Z = 9.93, P < 0.0001, I² = 83%, five studies) and for craniofacial and lower limb hyperhidrosis (RD: 0.60, 95% CI [0.23, 0.96], Z = 3.21, P < 0.001, I² = 0%, two studies).

- **Disease severity scale reduction**: A reduction of ≥ 2 points on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale at weeks 2–8 was expressed as RD (RD: 0.56, 95% CI [0.42, 0.69], Z = 8.16, P < 0.00001, I² = 56%, four studies).

- **Life quality index change**: The mean change in the Dermatology Life Quality Index at weeks 2–8 from baseline was expressed as mean difference (MD) (MD: −5.55, 95% CI [−7.11, −3.98], Z = 6.95, P < 0.00001, I² = 70%, four studies).

These findings are illustrated in the figures, including the comparison of botulinum toxin versus placebo in terms of gravimetric sweat reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline at weeks 2–6 and the reduction of ≥ 2 points in Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale.

### A phase 3, 52-week, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^115jGv6L]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The median duration of sofpironium treatment, from the initial treatment day plus 1 day to the final treatment day, was 361 days. The usage rate of the study treatment in individual patients was 100.0% across all periods. Of the 185 patients in the FAS, 84 (45.4%) applied all doses of sofpironium at bedtime. The remaining 101 patients (54.6%) applied at least one dose at a time other than bedtime, with the most common reason being forgetting to take medication (91 patients, 49.2%), followed by inconvenient scheduling (37 patients, 20.0%), and poor health condition (22 patients, 11.9%).

- **Concomitant medication/therapy status**: When evaluation at week 52 might be affected, three patients (1.6%) received systemic or topical anticholinergics concomitantly. One patient (0.5%) received oral cholinergic agonists, serotonin agonists, β‐blockers, α‐adrenergic agonists, dopamine partial agonists, or tricyclic antidepressants. Five patients (2.7%) received aluminum chloride or medications for hyperhidrosis approved outside Japan. Four patients (2.2%) received botulinum toxin (axillary administration), five patients (2.7%) received styptic‐containing antiperspirant OTC medications, quasi-pharmaceutical products, or cosmetics, and one patient (0.5%) received axillary laser therapy, surgical therapy, or thoracic sympathectomy.

### Efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin A in axillary bromhidrosis and associated histological changes in sweat glands: A prospective randomized double-blind side-by-side comparison clinical study [^117WH8Wt]. Dermatologic Surgery (2019). High credibility.

The efficacy of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) therapy in axillary hyperhidrosis has been documented; however, few studies report the efficacy of BTX-A in treating axillary bromhidrosis. The histological changes occurring in sweat glands after BTX-A treatment are also unknown.

- **Objective**: The authors report on the efficacy and safety of BTX-A in the treatment of axillary bromhidrosis and on the histological changes in sweat glands after BTX-A treatment.

- **Materials and methods**: Nineteen patients were included in this study. The patients were administered BTX-A injection in one axilla and sterile normal saline as placebo in the other axilla. The degree of malodor was evaluated subjectively by the patients before and three months after treatment. Sweat secretion was quantified by the gravimetric method. All patients underwent standard apocrinectomy in both axillary regions.

- **Results**: The mean degree of malodor and mean sweat production in the BTX-A-treated axilla were significantly lower than in the control axilla (2.42 vs. 8.00; p < .0001 and 13.33 vs. 33.75 mg/min; p = .0028, respectively) at three months after therapy. The histological studies showed apocrine sweat glands with atrophic changes and hypoplasia in the treated axilla.

- **Conclusion**: BTX-A injection is an easy, fast, noninvasive method of treating axillary bromhidrosis.

### A glycopyrronium bromide 1% cream for topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: Efficacy and safety results from a phase IIIa randomized controlled trial [^11459iiL]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Hyperhidrosis (HH) is a chronic condition characterized by disproportionate and excessive sweating. It can be primary or secondary to diseases or medication use. Typically, sweating in primary HH is bilaterally symmetrical and localized, and patients do not sweat during sleep. The prevalence of primary HH has been reported to be 16.3% in Germany, 4.8% in the United States, and 12.8% in Japan.

The disproportionate sweating experienced by patients with HH has severe and pervasive impacts on patients' quality of life (QoL). Barely tolerable or intolerable severe sweating affects 70% of patients and frequently or always interferes with their daily activities. Patients with HH suffer from high rates of anxiety and depression, yet more than 50% of all patients with HH receive no treatment.

Patients with primary axillary HH (PAHH) suffer from an excessive amount of sweat production in the armpits beyond what is needed for thermoregulation. There is no dysfunction of the sweat glands, but rather a dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system with pathological hyperactivity of the sympathetic system and decoupling of hyperhidrotic regions from central thermoregulation.

Eccrine sweat glands express various muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subtypes and can therefore be activated by ACh and effectively blocked by muscarinic antagonists.

Topical, oral, and injectable medications are available for the treatment of HH. First-line treatments are antiperspirants containing aluminium salts (in concentrations ranging from 10% to 35%), the use of which is associated with dermatitis. Other possible treatments include…

### Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: The results of the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership [^113QDuzD]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

The interim priority setting stage involved a second survey that listed all the indicative questions in a random order and was open for eight weeks. Participants were asked to select up to ten uncertainties they considered most important for research to address. After the survey closed, the uncertainties were ranked according to the frequency of selection. The rankings were conducted separately for healthcare professionals (HCPs) and for individuals with hyperhidrosis and their family and friends, to determine if the priorities differed between these groups. Ultimately, a total of 23 uncertainties, encompassing the top ten priorities from each group, were brought to the final workshop.

In the final workshop, participants were invited to De Montfort University, Leicester, UK, on November 30, 2018. Eighteen participants were divided into two groups, each including both people with hyperhidrosis and HCPs. A trained facilitator from the James Lind Alliance facilitated each group using a nominal group technique, setting ground rules that included maintaining confidentiality and respecting diverse opinions. The 23 questions were randomized and labeled with a letter. Cards representing each question were provided, and participants collaborated to rank them by priority. Rankings were scored from 1 (top priority) to 23 (lowest priority) and combined to produce a total score, where the lowest score denoted the highest priority. The groups were then shuffled, provided with the combined rankings, and asked to repeat the process.

### A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^111rkpYQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a skin disease involving excessive sweating beyond what is physiologically required for thermoregulation. It is clinically diagnosed when it leads to emotional, physical, or social distress and impairs patients' quality of life (QOL). Hyperhidrosis can be primary or secondary, with approximately 93% of cases being primary. More than 90% of primary hyperhidrosis cases are focal, affecting areas such as the axillae, palms, soles, and craniofacial regions.

An epidemiological study conducted in Japan from 2009 to 2010, which involved 5807 respondents, found that the prevalence of hyperhidrosis was 13.95% (810 persons). Of these, 741 individuals had primary focal hyperhidrosis. The specific prevalence of primary axillary hyperhidrosis was 5.75% (334 persons), with a mean onset age of 19.5 years. Notably, while only 6.3% of patients with primary focal hyperhidrosis, including axillary hyperhidrosis, consulted a physician, 47.8% relied on non-antiperspirant deodorants. This underscores the need for an appropriate treatment environment and better patient education.

### Treatment of hyperhidrosis with botulinum toxin [^115xA99r]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin type A is a safe and effective method for treating focal hyperhidrosis, providing longer-lasting results than topical treatments without the necessity of invasive surgical procedures. Although more useful for axillary hyperhidrosis, botulinum toxin injections can also be effective in treating palmar and plantar disease. The effects of botulinum toxin last for six to nine months on average, and treatment is associated with a high satisfaction rate among patients.

- **Guide for treatment**: In this article, the authors discuss their preferred methods for treating axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis. This article serves as a guide for pretreatment evaluation, injection techniques, and posttreatment care.

### Current therapeutic options for treating primary hyperhidrosis [^11258ZTG]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Severe hyperhidrosis can cause extreme embarrassment that may lead to social and professional isolation. Therapeutic strategies for hyperhidrosis should employ the least invasive treatment that provides effective symptom control. The treatment options available for the control of hyperhidrosis, whether non-surgical or surgical, differ in their invasiveness and efficacy. This paper reviews the mechanisms of action of antiperspirants, iontophoresis, cholinergic inhibitor drugs, botulinum toxin, and surgical sympathectomy.

There is little published evidence in the form of comparative randomized trials to support the use of one treatment over another. However, authors have tended to recommend therapies available to their specialty. Specific therapies should be tailored to the patient's symptoms to achieve maximum symptomatic improvement with minimum invasiveness and side effects. To achieve this, the full range of treatment options should be available to, or accessible by, the consulting doctor to provide the patient with a meaningful choice.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: A meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^1177Dfre]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Literature selection and basic information**: The literature screening process is portrayed in the PRISMA flowchart (Fig. 1). A total of 410 articles were identified upon initial literature search. A total of 134 duplicate entries were recognized and eliminated, resulting in 276 studies. From these, 262 articles were excluded after title and abstract evaluation, and six articles were excluded after full-text screening based on given exclusion criteria. In total, eight studies were included in our meta-analysis for final evaluation. A total of 937 patients were comprised in the included studies. All subjects suffered from focal hyperhidrosis affecting the axillae, the craniofacial, or the lower limb areas. The treatment modalities employed in the included studies were BTX-A injections in six trials and BTX-B injections in two trials. All analyses were conducted in comparison with placebo injections.

- **Quality assessment**: All studies were assessed with the help of Cochrane's Collaboration's tool. Allocation concealment was only described in three of the included studies. Other domain assessments revealed a significant bias regarding allocation concealment and selective reporting. Most studies did not allow for complete assessment of reporting bias due to insufficient information provided. A low total risk of bias seemed to be valid for only half of the included studies, aligning with a low risk of bias overall.

### Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: The results of the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership [^114GuYYj]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

At the final workshop, the top 10 research priorities were agreed upon. Minor changes to the wording of questions were made by consensus to improve clarity. The ranking of the remaining questions from 11 to 23 from the final workshop is shown in Supplementary Table S2.

- **Top 10 research priorities for the treatment and management of hyperhidrosis**: Most questions are related to safe and effective treatments of hyperhidrosis. One question addresses quality of life (QoL), and another explores how hormones affect the condition. Question 8 concerns eligibility and is most relevant in countries with government-funded healthcare systems.

### Botulinum toxin for hyperhidrosis: a review [^1149iAMv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Primary focal hyperhidrosis is a disorder characterized by idiopathic excessive sweating that typically affects the axillae, palms, soles, and face. The disorder, which affects up to 2.8% of the US population, is associated with considerable physical, psychosocial, and occupational impairments.

Therapeutic strategies include topical aluminum salts, tap-water iontophoresis, oral anticholinergic agents, local surgical approaches, and sympathectomies. However, these treatments have been limited by a relatively high incidence of adverse effects and complications. Non-surgical treatment complications are typically transient, whereas those of surgical therapies may be permanent and significant.

Recently, considerable evidence suggests that botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injections into hyperhidrotic areas can significantly reduce focal sweating in multiple areas without major adverse effects. BTX-A has, therefore, shown promise as a potential replacement for more invasive treatments after topical aluminum salts have failed. This article reviews the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of primary focal hyperhidrosis, with an emphasis on recent research evidence supporting the use of BTX-A injections for this indication.

### Hyperhidrosis: Management options [^115qmASq]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweating that affects patients' quality of life, resulting in social and work impairment and emotional distress. Primary hyperhidrosis is characterized by bilaterally symmetric, focal, excessive sweating of the axillae, palms, soles, or craniofacial region, not caused by other underlying conditions. Secondary hyperhidrosis may be focal or generalized and is caused by an underlying medical condition or medication use.

The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale is a validated survey used to grade the tolerability of sweating and its impact on quality of life. The score can be used to guide treatment. Topical aluminum chloride solution is the initial treatment in most cases of primary focal hyperhidrosis. Topical glycopyrrolate is the first-line treatment for craniofacial sweating. Botulinum toxin injection (onabotulinumtoxinA) is considered a first- or second-line treatment for axillary, palmar, plantar, or craniofacial hyperhidrosis. Iontophoresis should be considered for treating hyperhidrosis of the palms and soles. Oral anticholinergics are useful adjuncts in severe cases of hyperhidrosis when other treatments fail. Local microwave therapy is a newer treatment option for axillary hyperhidrosis. Local surgery and endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy should be considered in severe cases of hyperhidrosis that have not responded to topical or medical therapies.

### A phase III, 52-week, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^116gRQ9v]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The efficacy end-points were assessed through various criteria. These included the proportion of patients who satisfied both a Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS) of 1 or 2 and experienced a 50% or more reduction in the total gravimetric weight of sweat; the proportion of patients with an HDSS of 1 or 2; the proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in the total gravimetric weight of sweat; changes in total gravimetric weight of sweat; changes in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score specifically adapted for axillary hyperhidrosis; and the proportion of patients with an improvement of 1.5 or more in the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Measure – Axillary (HDSM-Ax) score. Lastly, changes in the HDSM-Ax score were evaluated.

The gravimetric weight of sweat was measured by the difference in filter paper weight before and after 5 minutes of contact with the affected area (axilla). The HDSS classifies the severity of primary focal hyperhidrosis through subjective symptoms, which are defined as follows:

- Sweating is never noticeable and never interferes with daily activities.
- Sweating is tolerable, but sometimes interferes with daily activities.
- Sweating is barely tolerable and frequently interferes with daily activities.
- Sweating is intolerable and always interferes with daily activities.

The DLQI, originally designed to evaluate skin disease-related quality of life, was tailored into a DLQI specific for axillary hyperhidrosis to enhance its suitability for assessing primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Responses to 10 questions were scored and summed to obtain the DLQI score for axillary hyperhidrosis. The HDSM-Ax is a severity scale specifically for axillary hyperhidrosis.

### Topical glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: Patient-reported outcomes from the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 phase III randomized controlled trials [^114XCM3a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

The Axillary Sweating Daily Diary (ASDD) was developed in consultation with the US FDA and in consideration of FDA PRO guidance to assess the severity, impact, and bothersomeness of axillary hyperhidrosis. Evidence supporting the validity of the ASDD has been reported, along with a description of other PRO measures, which are collectively referred to as the Axillary Hyperhidrosis Patient Measures (AHPM).

The AHPM includes:

- **The 4-item Axillary Sweating Daily Diary (ASDD)**: Patients aged ≥ 16 years.
- **ASDD-C**: Child-specific 2-item version for patients aged ≥ 9 to < 16 years.
- **Six Weekly Impact (WI) items**: Patients aged ≥ 16 years.
- **A single-item PGIC**: Patients aged ≥ 16 years.

ASDD/ASDD-C Item 2 is a numeric rating scale (0–10) for assessing axillary sweating severity and has demonstrated validity, reliability, and responsiveness to axillary hyperhidrosis treatment effect in clinical trials. ASDD/ASDD-C Item 2, combined with the other components of the AHPM, provides a comprehensive assessment of treatment efficacy and patients' experience in axillary hyperhidrosis clinical trials.

### Unnecessary surgical treatment in a case of olfactory reference syndrome [^1112c1J1]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

We present a case of olfactory reference syndrome (ORS) with complaints of bromhidrosis. This patient underwent a lumbar sympathectomy to correct the imagined body odor problem. Although the patient reported experiencing an improvement after surgery, the olfactory symptoms returned later. The primary objective with ORS patients should be to begin psychiatric treatment early, as other treatments usually appear to be ineffective and cause great dissatisfaction.

### Interventional management of hyperhidrosis in secondary care: A systematic review [^111187Bv]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is uncontrollable excessive sweating, which occurs at rest, regardless of temperature. The symptoms of hyperhidrosis can significantly affect quality of life.

- **Objectives**: To undertake a systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and safety of treatments available in secondary care for the management of primary hyperhidrosis.

- **Methods**: Fifteen databases (including trial registers) were searched up to July 2016 to identify studies of secondary-care treatments for primary hyperhidrosis. For each intervention, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included where available; where RCT evidence was lacking, nonrandomized trials or large prospective case series were included. Outcomes of interest included disease severity, sweat rate, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and adverse events. Trial quality was assessed using a modified version of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results were pooled in pairwise meta-analyses where appropriate; otherwise, a narrative synthesis was presented.

- **Results**: Fifty studies were included in the review: 32 RCTs, 17 nonrandomized trials, and one case series. The studies varied in terms of population, intervention, and methods of outcome assessment. Most studies were small, at high risk of bias, and poorly reported. The interventions assessed were iontophoresis, botulinum toxin (BTX) injections, anticholinergic medications, curettage, and newer energy-based technologies that damage the sweat gland.

- **Conclusions**: The evidence for the effectiveness and safety of treatments for primary hyperhidrosis is limited overall.

### Management of primary hyperhidrosis: A summary of the different treatment modalities [^113EVwb4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a common and distressing condition involving increased production of sweat. Various treatment modalities are employed to control or reduce sweating. Sweat is secreted by eccrine glands innervated by cholinergic fibers from the sympathetic nervous system. Primary hyperhidrosis most commonly affects the palms, axillae, and soles.

Secondary hyperhidrosis is caused by an underlying condition, and treatment involves the removal or control of this condition. The treatment options for primary hyperhidrosis include a range of topical or systemic medications, psychotherapy, and surgical or non-surgical invasive techniques.

- **Topical antiperspirants**: Quick and easy to apply but may cause skin irritation and have a short half-life.

- **Systemic medications**: Particularly anticholinergics, they reduce sweating, but the dose required can lead to significant adverse effects, limiting their effectiveness.

- **Iontophoresis**: A simple and well-tolerated method for treating hyperhidrosis without long-term adverse effects; however, long-term maintenance treatments are required to keep patients symptom-free.

- **Botulinum toxin A**: This treatment has emerged over the past 5–6 years with studies showing good results. However, it is not a permanent solution, and patients require repeat injections every 6–8 months to maintain benefits.

- **Psychotherapy**: Has been beneficial in a small number of cases.

- **Percutaneous computed tomography-guided phenol sympathicolysis**: Achieved good results but has a high long-term failure rate.

### A review of the etiologies and key clinical features of secondary hyperhidrosis [^1118MAeV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Secondary hyperhidrosis is a multifactorial condition that poses unique diagnostic and management challenges. Distinguishing secondary from primary hyperhidrosis remains difficult due to overlapping symptoms. This review consolidates existing evidence on the numerous underlying causes and pathophysiologic mechanisms of secondary hyperhidrosis across various disciplines. Secondary hyperhidrosis typically manifests in the fourth decade of life or later, whereas primary hyperhidrosis usually begins earlier. Generalized hyperhidrosis often suggests a secondary cause, though the distribution can vary, including focal symmetric/asymmetric or regional patterns depending on the underlying condition. Key clinical features, such as the lack of family history and associated symptoms, provide additional clues favoring a secondary etiology. Recognizing these distinct characteristics is crucial for accurate differentiation between secondary and primary hyperhidrosis, thereby guiding the appropriate evaluation and management of the underlying cause.

### Hyperhidrosis: A review of current management [^113Kbxw1]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Primary hyperhidrosis is a troublesome disorder characterized by excessive perspiration, affecting up to 1 percent of the population. Sufferers are usually young and often experience related social, professional, and psychological issues. Many methods for treating hyperhidrosis are available; however, no single treatment is without its weaknesses or complications. This article aims to clarify the issues related to the use of each treatment modality, including the most recently proposed method using botulinum toxin.

### Hyperhidrosis and botulinum toxin A: Patient selection and techniques [^111HNHPs]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Focal idiopathic excessive eccrine sweating presents most commonly as an affliction of three anatomically distinct areas: the axillae, the palms and soles, and the upper face. The true incidence is not known, but about half of the patients referred to us with this condition have at least one first-degree relative similarly affected. Only a fraction of afflicted patients are thought to seek medical care due to the social stigma, a lack of understanding on the part of medical providers as to the cause and nature of the problem, and, until now, a lack of effective nonsurgical therapy. A large social sample is required to accurately measure both the incidence and the exact nature of the genetic influence.

### Factors affecting postoperative complications of suction-curettage by arthroscopic shaver for bromhidrosis [^115a4H6B]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Bromhidrosis is a clinical disorder characterized by excessive or abnormally foul-smelling axillary odor. The condition is further aggravated by poor hygiene or underlying disorders that promote bacterial overgrowth, including diabetes, intertrigo, erythrasma, and a high body mass index (≥ 24 kg/m²) or being overweight.

Several treatments are available for axillary bromhidrosis, including topical drying or antibacterial agents, injected botulinum toxin A, iontophoresis, surgical approaches, laser treatment, and noninvasive microwave technology (miraDry) treatment. However, the effects of noninvasive treatments are temporary, and invasive treatments are limited by their complications. In the last 10 years, suction-curettage has offered a safe procedure with few adverse effects, a low complication rate, the shortest possible time away from daily activities, and reduced postoperative pain. High efficiency is associated with a high incidence of complications such as subcutaneous hematoma, wound necrosis, and delayed wound healing, which are associated with a high risk of hypertrophic scar formation. No studies exist in the literature that discuss the factors affecting complications in suction-curettage treatment of bromhidrosis. Our study looked at factors related to complications and how to reduce complications.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: A meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^114Ztfj7]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Our data suggest that botulinum toxin (BTX) effectively yields superior results for patients with hyperhidrosis in terms of subjective and quantitative analysis compared to placebo. However, the limited quality of evidence needs to be considered.

Despite there being no gold standard in the treatment of hyperhidrosis, the recommended therapy scheme advocates the use of BTX after the failure of conventional therapy. Given its significant anhidrotic superiority over placebo injections, initial BTX treatment may be a good option in clinically severe cases to improve treatment response and avoid unwarranted patient dissatisfaction. General downsides to consider, in comparison with treatment alternatives, include the discomfort resulting from injection pain and substantially higher treatment costs.

### Treatment approaches and outcomes associated with the use of abobotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of hyperhidrosis: A systematic review [^114g9BsC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Botulinum neurotoxin type A has been used for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.

- **Objective**: To perform a systematic review of the literature to identify evidence on the treatment approaches and outcomes associated with abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A) treatment of hyperhidrosis.

- **Methods**: EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and nonrandomized controlled trials. There were no date or country restrictions. Bibliographies of review articles and recent congress proceedings (2017–2019) were also searched. Articles were screened using predefined eligibility criteria and relevant data were extracted.

- **Results**: Of 191 unique articles identified, 23 were considered relevant (3 observational studies, 10 nonrandomized controlled trials, and 10 randomized controlled trials). These articles provided data on axillary (13), palmar (7), and forehead (1) hyperhidrosis, compensatory hyperhidrosis of the back (1), Frey syndrome (1), and diabetic gustatory sweating (1). All studies reported that aboBoNT-A reduced sweating and no serious adverse events were observed. Patient satisfaction was high and improvements to quality of life were observed after aboBoNT-A treatment.

- **Limitations**: Variability in the injection technique when data were compared across studies.

- **Conclusion**: This study describes a range of treatment approaches and demonstrates positive outcomes of aboBoNT-A treatment for multiple types of hyperhidrosis.

### A phase 3, 52-week, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^111sGnhU]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel over a period of 52 weeks in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis.

- **Figure 1**: Timing of evaluation on the confirmatory study and long-term study. Abbreviations used include DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index), HDSM-Ax (Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Measure-Axillary), and HDSS (Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score).

- **Safety end-points**: These included adverse events (AEs), local tolerability (assessed by both the physician and patients), vital signs, and laboratory values encompassing hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis. AEs were coded by Systemic Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) in accordance with MedDRA/J version 21.1. An ADR was defined as an AE reasonably considered at least possibly related to the study drug, for which a causal relationship with the study drug could not be ruled out. An AE potentially attributable to an anticholinergic effect was considered an anticholinergic AE if agreed upon by the medical expert. Multiple episodes of the same AE in a single patient were counted as one in the incidence calculation. For local tolerability, the physician assessed dryness, erythema, and scaling using a 5-point scale (0: none, 1: minimal, 2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: severe). Patients assessed burning sensation and itching on a similar 5-point scale (0: none, 1: very mild, 2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: severe).

- **Analysis**: The analysis involved calculating the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum to maximum values, proportion (%) of patients, and 95% confidence interval (CI) at each assessment time point for each treatment group. Values at baseline in the confirmatory study were used for comparison.

### Treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis/bromidrosis using VASER ultrasound [^116Ri9oU]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Methods of treatment for axillary hyperhidrosis and/or bromidrosis are either palliative, such as the use of topical aluminum chloride or injections of botulinum toxin type A, or surgically based for more permanent results, including excisional surgery, endoscopic transthoracic sympathectomy, and liposuction/curettage. The efficacy of surgical approaches varies, and they present the risk of significant side effects and complications.

- **Methods**: Thirteen patients (3 males, 10 females) were recruited, all with significant axillary hyperhidrosis and/or bromidrosis. They were treated with the VASER ultrasound and followed for six months. Preoperative assessments evaluated the impact of the condition on lifestyle and the degree of sweat/odor. Postoperative assessments measured changes in lifestyle impact and degree of sweat/odor reduction, as well as patient and surgeon satisfaction.

- **Results**: Eleven out of thirteen patients experienced a significant reduction in sweat and odor, with no recurrence of significant symptoms at six months. Two patients experienced a reduction in sweat/odor, but not to their satisfaction. No significant complications were noted. A simple amplitude and time protocol was established, providing consistent and predictable therapy. The complete procedure takes less than one hour to treat both axillae using local anesthetic.

- **Conclusion**: The VASER ultrasound is safe and effective for treating axillary hyperhidrosis/bromidrosis. The method is minimally invasive, allowing immediate return to basic activities and only temporarily restricting arm movement. At six months, the treatment appears to be effective.

### A refined surgical treatment modality for bromhidrosis: Subcutaneous scissor with micropore [^11458WM9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Axillary bromhidrosis has a strong negative effect on one's social life. A high success rate and few complications are critical criteria for a surgical treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate a new surgical treatment modality for bromhidrosis, specifically the use of subcutaneous scissors with micropore. Twenty patients with bromhidrosis were treated. Patients were placed in a supine position with their arms abducted to 110°.

After the injection of 60 mL of tumescent solution into each axilla, a small incision was made in the middle of the axillary hair-bearing area. The hair-bearing skin was undermined at the level of superficial fat to achieve adequate skin eversion. Flaps were everted to fully expose the apocrine glands, allowing meticulous excision of each gland. Both sides were punctured with a scalpel, and micropore, which was just 3 mm wide, was used for drainage. Finally, the incisions were re-approximated, and bulky compressive dressings were applied to the area for 72 hours.

Out of 40 axillae (20 patients), 34 (85.0%) showed excellent results, and six (15.0%) had good results. Malodor was significantly decreased, with no serious complications reported. This technique can produce excellent results with a lower complication rate than most other surgical modalities and can be performed without costly equipment.

### A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^115dTr5X]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

The study "Sofpironium for Axillary Hyperhidrosis" was published by Hiroo Yokozeki and colleagues in 2021 in the Journal of Dermatology. This study is related to the disease hyperhidrosis and investigates the role of sofpironium bromide gel in patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. The study was designed as a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving a population of 281 patients, consisting of 197 females and 84 males.

The inclusion criteria focused on patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Key exclusion criteria included secondary hyperhidrosis, heavy sweating triggered or worsened by menopause, indication for thoracic sympathectomy, and any previous disease or treatment that might affect efficacy and/or safety evaluation.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Sofpironium group**: n = 141 received 5% sofpironium bromide applied to both axillae once daily at bedtime for six weeks.
	- **Vehicle group**: n = 140 received the vehicle alone applied in the same manner.

- **Primary outcome**: The study observed a significant increase in the proportion of patients with a Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score of 1–2 at the end of treatment and a ≥ 50% reduction in total gravimetric weight of sweat at the end of treatment, based on an intention-to-treat analysis (53.9% vs. 36.4%; AD 17.5%, 95% CI 6.02 to 28.93).

The secondary outcome information is not provided.

### Topical glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: Patient-reported outcomes from the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 Phase III randomized controlled trials [^114r7sGh]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a condition characterized by sweat production exceeding that which is necessary to maintain thermal homeostasis. It affects approximately 15.3 million people in the United States, with a prevalence of 4.8%, and adversely impacts quality of life to an extent comparable to, or greater than, the impact of psoriasis or eczema. Approximately half of those with hyperhidrosis experience excessive underarm sweating (i.e. axillary hyperhidrosis), which is the most commonly affected area.

- **Available treatments**: Treatments for hyperhidrosis have included over-the-counter and prescription antiperspirants, oral anticholinergic drugs, onabotulinumtoxinA, iontophoresis (application of mild electrical currents through water), and ablation or removal of the sweat glands. These treatments differ in efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost. The more invasive procedures carry a risk of serious and/or irreversible side effects. Reports indicate that hyperhidrosis may be underdiagnosed, that patients often delay or avoid seeking treatment, and that patients are dissatisfied with currently available treatments. This suggests that greater awareness of hyperhidrosis as a medical condition and new treatment options are needed.

- **Measurement challenges**: Objective measures of sweat production, including gravimetric measurements at discrete time points, can be highly variable due to temperature, humidity, and the sometimes-episodic nature of sweating, which can vary with time of day, emotional state, and daily activities. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which capture a patient's treatment experience, should accompany these objective measures.

### Bilateral one-stage single-port sympathicotomy in primary focal hyperhidrosis, a prospective cohort study: treat earlier [^1144kEMF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Instead of true sympathectomy, which involves surgically removing a part of the sympathetic chain including one or more ganglia, a sympathicotomy, in which the ganglia are left unaffected, is now performed. Although the pathogenic mechanism of compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH) is poorly understood, it is hypothesized that severing sympathetic reflex arcs that run through the ganglia to the hypothalamus leads to CH through dysfunctional sweat regulation in the affected body parts. This finding corroborates with earlier studies, showing higher rates of dissatisfaction and severe CH in patients treated for axillary primary focal hyperhidrosis (PFH) when compared to patients treated for palmar PFH, and thus adds to the understanding that the ganglia should be left untouched.

CH remains the only lasting cause for discontent postoperatively. It is of interest to note that CH is still preferred by most patients over the distress experienced from PFH. Only 8 out of the 48 patients (17%) experiencing severe CH at any moment after surgery were not satisfied with the obtained result. It must be stressed that CH is a side effect of surgery on the sympathetic nerve and not a complication of the surgery. The key to accepting and living with CH after bilateral one-stage single-port sympathicotomy (BOSS) lies in thorough and accurate pre-operative information about its risk. The importance of thorough pre-operative counseling and consent cannot be overstated.

### Ultrasound-assisted lipoplasty treatment for axillary bromidrosis: clinical experience of 375 cases [^115GPsDu]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Bromidrosis is a condition of abnormal offensive body odor caused mostly by apocrine gland secretion from the axilla. Although no morbid sequelae are known, the odor can be disturbing enough to cause social impairment and psychological distress. Medical care is available but is temporary and yields limited clinical benefit. Surgical treatment may provide a more definite remedy through reduction of the apocrine gland. However, there are risks for complications following surgical treatment such as subdermal excision, subcutaneous shaving, en bloc excision, and liposuction.

The search for a less invasive but still effective procedure has led the authors to use ultrasound-assisted liposuction, which has reduced the risk of complications and recurrence. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the long-term outcome of ultrasound-assisted liposuction for the treatment of bromidrosis. From August 1998 to September 2002, 375 consecutive patients underwent ultrasound-assisted liposuction for bromidrosis of the axilla. The average age of the patients was 25.7 years (range, 15 to 55 years) and the average follow-up period was 18.8 months (range, 7 to 56 months). Subjective complaints of recurrences were noted in 22 patients (5.9 percent), and secondary ultrasound-assisted liposuction was performed, resulting in no further complaints.

Complications other than recurrences were mild skin sloughing (3.2 percent), hematoma (1.3 percent), subcutaneous band (0.3 percent), and hypesthesia of the hand (0.3 percent), all of which healed spontaneously. Through a questionnaire that was answered by patients, further insights into the procedure's outcomes were gathered.

### Oxybutynin treatment for buprenorphine-naloxone-induced hyperhidrosis [^113dYVDe]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

According to recent statistics, 128 people in the United States die from opioid overdose every day. A new report suggests that caring for patients with opioid use disorder has become even more of an emergency during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, as more patients will experience withdrawal due to changing drug markets, while those already receiving treatment may struggle to maintain critical access to care.

Treatment for opioid use disorder includes partial opioid agonist and opioid antagonist therapies such as buprenorphine-naloxone. While hyperhidrosis related to opioid agonist therapies has been reported, literature surrounding potential treatment for buprenorphine-naloxone-induced hyperhidrosis is sparse. Hong et al. reported a case of methadone-induced hyperhidrosis where a patient receiving methadone maintenance therapy exhibited excessive sweating immediately after beginning methadone. Similar to our patient, he did not experience any other symptoms of withdrawal, and his hyperhidrosis also resolved from treatment with oral oxybutynin.

Topical therapies, including aluminum chloride and glycopyrronium tosylate, are often used as first-line treatments for hyperhidrosis. However, since our patient's symptoms were widespread, oral oxybutynin was chosen due to its systemic distribution, low levels of adverse side effects, and efficacy in the treatment of a patient with methadone-induced hyperhidrosis. Oxybutynin has traditionally been used as an anticholinergic medication for the treatment of overactive bladder.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: A meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^117A7D2w]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Given guidelines on the treatment of hyperhidrosis, botulinum toxin (BTX) therapy remains one of the most well-studied treatment options for focal hyperhidrosis and continues to be a solid treatment modality following unsuccessful initial topical treatment. Notably, a total of three BTX A products are cleared for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis, whereas the treatment of other focal sites has yet to be approved, rendering any such treatment currently off-label. Further research on the efficacy of BTX injections is warranted to extend its approval and broader application for various focal sites affected by hyperhidrosis.

Regarding the limitations of this meta-analysis, a large-scale and adequately powered randomized controlled trial analyzing the effectiveness of BTX in comparison with established treatment modalities such as topical treatments, iontophoresis, and surgical options would be warranted. Additionally, further comparative studies with radiofrequency thermotherapy and fractional microneedle radiofrequency in hyperhidrosis may also be warranted.

Rummaneethorn et al. demonstrated in a prospective, randomized, split-side comparative study between BTX A injections and fractional microneedle radiofrequency in axillary hyperhidrosis a significantly superior reduction of mean HDSS scores and significantly better participant satisfaction scores for the BTX injections 12 weeks after the intervention. However, given that thermotherapeutic options allow the maintenance of the skin's integrity and a reduction of patient discomfort and downtime, they may be a valid alternative.

### Palmoplantar hyperhidrosis: A therapeutic challenge [^115rAif4]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Excessive sweating from the palms and soles, known as palmoplantar hyperhidrosis, affects both children and adults. Diagnosis of this potentially embarrassing and socially disabling condition is based on the patient's history and visible signs of sweating. The condition usually is idiopathic. Treatment remains a challenge, with options including topical and systemic agents, iontophoresis, and botulinum toxin type A injections, with surgical sympathectomy as a last resort. None of the treatments is without limitations or associated complications.

- **Topical treatments**: Topical aluminum chloride hexahydrate therapy and iontophoresis are simple, safe, and inexpensive therapies. However, continuous application is required because results are often short-lived and may be insufficient.

- **Systemic agents**: Systemic agents such as anticholinergic drugs are poorly tolerated at the dosages required for efficacy and usually are not an option because of their associated toxicity.

- **Botulinum toxin**: While botulinum toxin can be used in treatment-resistant cases, numerous painful injections are required, and effects are limited to a few months.

- **Surgical sympathectomy**: Surgical sympathectomy should be reserved for the most severe cases and should be performed only after all other treatments have failed.

Although the safety and reliability of treatments for palmoplantar hyperhidrosis have improved dramatically, side effects and compensatory sweating are still common, potentially severe problems.

### A comprehensive approach to the recognition, diagnosis, and severity-based treatment of focal hyperhidrosis: Recommendations of the Canadian Hyperhidrosis Advisory Committee [^116cu34D]. Dermatologic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis can have profound effects on a patient's quality of life. Treatment guidelines often overlook disease severity.

- **Objective**: The objective was to establish clinical guidelines for the recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of primary focal hyperhidrosis.

- **Methods and materials**: A working group of eight nationally recognized experts was convened to develop the consensus statement using an evidence-based approach.

- **Recommendations**: An algorithm was designed to consider both disease severity and location. The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) provides a qualitative measure that allows tailoring of treatment.
	- Mild axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis (HDSS score of 2) should initially be treated with topical aluminum chloride (AC). If the patient fails to respond to AC therapy, botulinum toxin A (BTX-A; axillae, palms, soles) and iontophoresis (palms, soles) should be the second-line therapy.
	- In severe cases of axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis (HDSS score of 3 or 4), both BTX-A and topical AC are first-line therapy. Iontophoresis is also first-line therapy for palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis.
	- Craniofacial hyperhidrosis should be treated with oral medications, BTX-A, or topical AC as first-line therapy.
	- Local surgery (axillary) and endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (palms and soles) should only be considered after the failure of all other treatment options.

- **Conclusions**: These guidelines offer a rapid method to assess disease severity and to treat primary focal hyperhidrosis according to severity.

### A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^116AgKhw]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The Clinical Guidelines for Primary Focal Hyperhidrosis (2015 revised edition) published by the Japanese Dermatological Association recommend botulinum toxin type A and topical aluminum chloride for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Botulinum toxin type A, which was shown to be effective and safe in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized study in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis, is a treatment for primary axillary hyperhidrosis with evidence of well‐controlled study. However, injection of high‐molecular‐weight botulinum toxin type A at 20–30 sites is painful, and its use in primary axillary hyperhidrosis is covered by health insurance only in severe cases in Japan.

On the other hand, topical aluminum chloride, the most common topical preparation for the treatment of hyperhidrosis, has not been studied in randomized controlled studies for primary axillary hyperhidrosis and is not covered by health insurance in Japan. Propantheline, an oral anticholinergic, is covered by health insurance for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in Japan, but one‐third of patients treated with oral anticholinergics are withdrawn from treatment because of adverse drug reactions. Therefore, there are unmet medical needs in the treatment of primary focal hyperhidrosis, and a treatment that is safe, effective, backed by well‐controlled studies, and less likely to cause injection pain or systemic anticholinergic adverse drug reactions is necessary.

### Botulinum A toxin improves life quality in severe primary focal hyperhidrosis [^111vpzxR]. European Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Focal hyperhidrosis is a condition that can disrupt emotional, social, and professional life. Treatment options for severe cases include surgical sympathectomy and local chemical sweat gland denervation through intradermal injections of botulinum toxin A (Btx A). The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a simple, validated questionnaire designed to measure and compare disability in different skin diseases.

This study aimed to assess quality of life with the DLQI before and after treatment with botulinum toxin injections in patients suffering from severe hyperhidrosis. The DLQI was administered to 58 randomly chosen patients before and after treatment. All patients completed the DLQI questionnaire prior to treatment, and 53 out of 58 patients completed it again at an average of 5.2 months post-treatment.

The mean DLQI score among the 58 patients prior to treatment was 10.3 (range 2–23). In the subset of 16 out of 53 patients who experienced a relapse of sweating when completing the DLQI a second time, no significant improvement was observed, with scores of 10.6 before and 8.8 after treatment (P = 0.21). However, in patients without relapse, a 76% improvement was observed, with the DLQI score reduced from 9.9 to 2.4 (P < 0.0001). The study demonstrated that focal hyperhidrosis significantly diminishes life quality, and the disability experienced by patients can be significantly alleviated with botulinum toxin injections.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: A meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^116HaxPr]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

This study aims to assess the treatment effect, disease severity, and quality-of-life outcomes of botulinum toxin (BTX) injections for focal hyperhidrosis. We included randomized controlled trials of BTX injections compared with placebo for patients with primary or secondary focal hyperhidrosis. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to August 2020. The outcomes of interest were the gravimetric sweat rate reduction, disease severity measured by the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale, and quality-of-life assessment measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index. Cochrane risk-of-bias tools were employed for quality assessment of the given randomized controlled trials.

Eight studies met our inclusion criteria (n = 937). Overall, the risk of bias was mixed and mostly moderate. BTX injections showed reduced risk in comparison with placebo for the gravimetric quantitative sweat reduction of > 50% from baseline (risk difference: 0.63, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.74). Additionally, improvements were seen for disease severity and quality-of-life assessments evaluated by a Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score reduction of ≥ 2 points (risk difference: 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.69) and mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (mean difference: −5.55, 95% CI −7.11 to −3.98). The acquired data were insufficient to assess long-term outcomes and were limited to an eight-week follow-up period.

In focal axillary hyperhidrosis, BTX significantly reduces sweat production and yields superior outcomes in assessments of disease severity and quality-of-life. However, the data…

### An open-label tolerability and efficacy study of an aluminum sesquichlorohydrate topical foam in axillary and palmar primary hyperhidrosis [^115yKt5g]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Primary hyperhidrosis (PH) is a disorder characterized by excessive eccrine sweat gland production that primarily involves the axillae as well as palms and soles. Common first-line topical treatment for PH consists of aluminum salts (AS) which act by physically blocking eccrine sweat gland ducts. However, primary irritant contact dermatitis is a frequent side effect of AS treatment.

Recently, a new low-residue, thermophobic foam formulation containing 20% aluminum sesquichlorohydrate has been developed (Nidrox, Mipharm S.p. A.) to evaluate its local tolerability and efficacy in the treatment of axillary and palmar PH. Twenty subjects affected by PH were enrolled in a multicenter, open-label study. Local tolerability was evaluated by physicians assessing itching, burning, and skin irritation using a four-point score (from 0: no symptoms to 3: severe symptoms). Skin irritation was quantified with a visual score.

Efficacy was assessed by means of the Minor test score using a four-point scale (range 0–3). The foam was applied to clean, dry skin every night during the first two weeks and three times a week during the following two weeks. Clinical evaluations were performed at baseline, on day 14, and on day 28. Patients were monitored throughout the study for adverse events. All 20 subjects completed the study.

The foam induced a significant reduction in the Minor score compared to baseline values (p = 0.0002) both at day 14 and at day 28. At the end of the four-week treatment period, the foam reduced eccrine sweating by 61% (Minor score: 3.3 vs. baseline).

### A pivotal study on the safety and effectiveness of a targeted alkali thermolysis patch for treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis or excessive axillary sweating [^113Dc7Hr]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

One-third of US adults are bothered by excessive sweating, and approximately 5% are diagnosed with hyperhidrosis. A topical patch using targeted alkali thermolysis (TAT) was developed for treatment of this condition. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the TAT patch for axillary sweat reduction.

- **Materials and methods**: A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, sham-controlled, pivotal trial enrolled 120 subjects for bilateral axillary treatment with a TAT patch (63 subjects) or a sham patch (57 subjects).

- **Results**: The primary endpoint was achieved; 64% of TAT-treated versus 44% of sham-treated subjects (p = .0332) improved from Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) 3/4 to HDSS 1/2 at 4 weeks. The treatment also showed statistically significant improvement over sham treatment for all secondary endpoints, including gravimetric sweat production and subject-reported quality-of-life (QoL) assessments. The duration of effect is approximately 3 months, as determined by the time to return to baseline HDSS. Mild-to-moderate treatment-site adverse events (AEs) were reported in 22% of TAT patch subjects. No serious or severe AEs were reported.

- **Conclusion**: HDSS, GSP, and QoL findings confirm clinically meaningful sweat reduction and a significant improvement in quality of life following a single TAT patch treatment. This device has the potential to offer a new, noninvasive treatment option that is well tolerated with minimal downtime.

### An open-label trial of the efficacy of 15% aluminum chloride in 2% salicylic acid gel base in the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^116SsF8M]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Primary focal hyperhidrosis (HH) is a chronic disorder characterized by excessive sweating. A single-center, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 15% aluminum chloride (AC) in a 2% salicylic acid gel base (SAGB), branded as Hydrosal, for adults with moderate-to-severe primary axillary HH. Thirty subjects were instructed to apply the 15% AC in 2% SAGB to their bilateral axillae nightly during the first week, followed by twice-weekly applications as tolerated. The primary objective was to measure the change in the mean Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS) from baseline to week 4. Participants who achieved an HDSS score of less than 2 were classified as "responders".

The mean change in HDSS from baseline to week 4 was 1.32 (p = 0.0001). At week 4, 21 out of 29 participants (72%) were responders, and at week 12, 18 out of 25 participants (72%) continued to be responders. These results suggest that 15% AC in 2% SAGB might be an effective, high-strength topical therapy for treating patients with moderate-to-severe axillary HH.

### A phase III, 52-week, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^112hgM9p]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The proportion of patients with a Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS) of 1 or 2 was 67.0% (63/94 patients) in the switching group and 71.4% (65/91 patients) in the extension group at week 2; 83.0% (78/94 patients) in the switching group and 85.7% (78/91 patients) in the extension group at week 6; 87.2% (82/94 patients) in the switching group and 83.5% (76/91 patients) in the extension group at week 24; and 76.6% (72/94 patients) in the switching group and 71.4% (65/91 patients) in the extension group at week 52 (Table 2 and Figure 3). The proportion of patients increased from the baseline of the long-term study to week 6 and remained almost the same thereafter. In the aforementioned analysis in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), patients for whom data were missing due to factors like study withdrawal were handled as patients who failed to meet the criteria (HDSS was not 1 or 2). When calculated post-hoc using an observed case approach, the proportion of patients with a HDSS of 1 or 2 at week 52 was 84.7% (72/85 patients) in the switching group and 86.7% (65/75 patients) in the extension group.

### Hyperhidrosis, bromhidrosis, and chromhidrosis: Fold (intertriginous) dermatoses [^114ZvJ4M]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Human sweat gland disorders are common and can significantly impact quality of life, including professional, social, and emotional burdens. It is crucial to diagnose and treat these conditions properly to ensure optimal patient care. Hyperhidrosis is characterized by increased sweat secretion, which can be idiopathic or secondary to other systemic conditions. Numerous therapeutic options have been introduced with variable success. Novel methods, such as microwave-based and ultrasound devices, have been developed and are currently being tested in comparison to conventional approaches. All treatment options for hyperhidrosis require frequent monitoring by a dermatologist to evaluate therapeutic progress.

Bromhidrosis and chromhidrosis are rare disorders but are equally disabling as hyperhidrosis. Bromhidrosis occurs due to excessive secretion from either apocrine or eccrine glands, which become malodorous upon bacterial breakdown. The condition is further aggravated by poor hygiene or underlying disorders promoting bacterial overgrowth, including diabetes, intertrigo, erythrasma, and obesity. Chromhidrosis is a rare dermatologic disorder characterized by the secretion of colored sweat, with a predilection for the axillary area and face. Treatment is challenging because the condition usually recurs after discontinuation of therapy and persists until the age-related regression of the sweat glands.

### Botulinum toxin: Pharmacology and injectable administration for the treatment of primary hyperhidrosis [^113caSqu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a dermatological condition defined by excessive sweating beyond thermoregulatory needs, with significant effects on patients' quality of life. It is categorized as primary or secondary: primary hyperhidrosis is mostly focal and idiopathic, whereas secondary hyperhidrosis is commonly generalized and caused by an underlying medical condition or the use of medications. Various surgical and nonsurgical therapies exist for primary hyperhidrosis. Although botulinum toxin is one of the deadliest toxins known, when used in small doses, it is one of the most effective therapies for primary hyperhidrosis.

Botulinum toxin injections are widely used as a second-line treatment option for primary hyperhidrosis once topical treatment strategies have failed. This article provides an overview of the commercially available botulinum toxin formulations and their applications in the treatment of primary hyperhidrosis.

### Effective treatment of frontal hyperhidrosis with botulinum toxin A [^1146hyGZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Focal hyperhidrosis is a common condition mostly confined to the axillae, palms, and soles. In some individuals, predominantly men, increased sweating of the forehead may be the major complaint and may interfere with the person's quality of life. Botulinum toxin A has been shown to be a very effective treatment for focal hyperhidrosis of the axillae and palms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the response in 10 men suffering from frontal hyperhidrosis treated with botulinum toxin A.

- **Methods**: Botulinum toxin A (Botox) was injected at multiple sites evenly distributed over the forehead (mean dose 86 mouse units).

- **Results**: The mean ± SEM amount of sweat was significantly reduced, four weeks after treatment, from 173.8 ± 38.6 mg min(-1) to 53.7 ± 17.6 mg min(-1). The effect lasted at least five months in nine of the 10 patients. All patients subjectively judged the treatment as very effective. Minor side effects included painful injections and transient weakness of forehead muscles without ptosis.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, we provide evidence that botulinum toxin A is an effective and safe treatment for frontal hyperhidrosis.

### Topical glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: Patient-reported outcomes from the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 Phase III randomized controlled trials [^111imcD7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

For the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), no patients in either the ATMOS-1 or ATMOS-2 trials rated their change as "moderately worse" (score = 6) or "much worse" (score = 7); therefore, these categories were combined with the category of "a little worse" (score = 5).

Improvement in scores related to the impact (ASDD Item 3) and bothersomeness (ASDD Item 4) of axillary sweating on daily activities was greater for GT-treated patients than for vehicle-treated patients at every study week (see Table 3 and Fig. 2b, c). In the pooled population at week 4, ASDD Item 3 scores improved by 65.5% (GT) versus 40.3% (vehicle), and ASDD Item 4 scores improved by 65.4% (GT) versus 39.0% (vehicle).

- **WI items**: The proportion of patients whose lives were adversely impacted by sweating decreased at week 4 for all patients across trials and regardless of treatment; however, a greater proportion of patients receiving GT versus vehicle improved in all WI items across trials (see Table 3 and Fig. 1). These results indicate greater improvement and less disruption in daily life due to hyperhidrosis with GT treatment.

Pooled PGIC results at week 4 showed that 77.1% of GT-treated patients rated underarm sweating as much better or moderately better, compared with 39.4% of vehicle-treated patients (see Fig. 3).

- **Patient Global Impression of Change at week 4 (pooled population)**: No patients in either the ATMOS-1 or the ATMOS-2 trial rated their change as "moderately worse" (score = 6) or "much worse" (score = 7); therefore, these categories were combined with the category of "a little worse" (score = 5).

### A glycopyrronium bromide 1% cream for topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: Efficacy and safety results from a phase IIIa randomized controlled trial [^111cNvKx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

The proportion of responders to treatment was determined based on gravimetrically measured sweat production, as well as on the HDSS and HidroQoL questionnaires. At day 29, significantly more patients achieved a reduction in sweat production of > 50%, 75%, or 90% with GPB 1% cream than with placebo. More than half of the patients achieved a 50% reduction in sweating with the GPB 1% cream [57% (n = 50) vs. 34% (n = 29) with placebo], while nearly one in four achieved a reduction in sweat of 90% [23% (n = 20) vs. 10% (n = 8) with placebo]. Overall, the proportion of patients achieving a certain degree of sweat reduction was approximately twofold higher for the GPB 1% cream than for placebo (1.7-fold for a 50% reduction and 2.4-fold for a 90% reduction). Based on the HDSS (a key secondary endpoint), more patients in the GPB 1% group experienced a response to treatment by day 29. At day 15, there was a significantly higher proportion of patients with an improvement of ≥ 2 points than for placebo [25% (n = 22) vs. 9% (n = 8); P = 0.007], while at day 29 the responder rate was similar [23% (n = 20) vs. 12% (n = 10)] and the difference between groups approached statistical significance (P = 0.054). The proportion of HidroQoL responders with GPB 1% cream [60% (n = 52)] vs. placebo [26% (n = 22); P < 0.001] was significant, as determined in a post hoc analysis (MCID ≥ 4).

### Causes and management of hypertrichosis [^112mSsVQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertrichosis is the term used for the growth of hair on any part of the body in excess of the amount usually present in persons of the same age, race, and sex, excluding androgen-induced hair growth. In its generalized and circumscribed forms, hypertrichosis may either be an isolated finding or be associated with other abnormalities. Therefore, accurate classification of hypertrichosis is mandatory. Excessive hair may cause cosmetic embarrassment, resulting in a significant emotional burden, particularly if extensive. Treatment options are limited, and the results of therapy are not always satisfactory. Patients should, therefore, be adequately advised of the available treatment modalities for temporary or permanent hair removal.

No single method of hair removal is appropriate for all body locations or patients. The method adopted will depend on the character, area, and amount of hair growth, as well as on the age of the patient and their personal preference. The currently available treatment methods include cosmetic procedures, such as bleaching, trimming, shaving, plucking, waxing, chemical depilatories, and electrosurgical epilation. Hair removal using light sources and lasers is also available. Laser-assisted hair removal is the most efficient method of long-term hair removal currently available. The lack of comparative data makes it difficult to choose the most effective system, although the color contrast between the epidermis and the hair shaft will determine the type of laser to favor.

A novel treatment for slowing excessive hair growth is topical eflornithine, an inhibitor of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase.

### Efficacy and safety of topical sofpironium bromide gel for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis: A phase II, randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial [^1127Zvyr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Primary axillary hyperhidrosis has limited noninvasive, effective, and well-tolerated treatment options. This study aimed to evaluate the topical treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis with the novel anticholinergic, sofpironium bromide.

- **Methods**: A phase II, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blinded study was conducted. Participants were randomized to one of three dosages or a vehicle, with daily treatment for 42 days. Coprimary endpoints included the percentage of participants exhibiting at least one-point improvement in the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Measure-Axillary (HDSM-Ax) score by logistic regression and change in HDSM-Ax as a continuous measure by analysis of covariance. Pairwise comparisons were one-sided with α = 0.10.

- **Results**: At the end of therapy, 70%, 79%, 76%, and 54% of participants in the 5%, 10%, 15%, and vehicle groups respectively exhibited at least one-point improvement in HDSM-Ax (P < .05). Least-square mean (SE) changes in HDSM-Ax were -2.02 (0.14), -2.09 (0.14), 2.10 (0.14), and -1.30 (0.14), all highly significant with P ≤ .0001. Most treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate.

- **Limitations**: The study was not powered to detect changes in gravimetric sweat production.

In conclusion, sofpironium bromide gel produced meaningful reductions in hyperhidrosis severity and had an acceptable safety profile.
