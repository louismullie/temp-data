## Question

Why alprazolam isn't the drug of choise

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why alprazolam is not the drug of choice for anxiety disorders and what the evidence-based rationale is for avoiding it as a first-line agent. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic properties that make alprazolam uniquely risky. Then, I should verify the dependence and withdrawal profile, including tapering challenges. Next, I will examine safety concerns, especially overdose risk with opioids and other CNS depressants. After that, I need to review real-world misuse and mortality data. I will then assess comparative efficacy and guideline positions. Finally, I should consider special populations and synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated approach to prescribing if it is used at all.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic liabilities. Alprazolam is a short-acting, high-potency triazolobenzodiazepine with rapid onset and no active metabolites, which accelerates tolerance and interdose withdrawal. Its mean half-life around 11 hours masks substantial interindividual variability, and its CYP3A4 metabolism creates clinically important drug–drug interactions that can markedly elevate exposure and toxicity risk [^11276jHZ] [^1127tdfC] [^112n3R4i].

> Wait, let me verify the dependence and withdrawal dynamics. Because of its short half-life and high potency, dependence can emerge within 2–4 weeks of daily use, and abrupt discontinuation can precipitate life-threatening seizures. Tapering is often prolonged and difficult, with interdose anxiety and rebound phenomena complicating discontinuation, and guidelines emphasize that even brief daily use may warrant a taper plan for alprazolam specifically [^116FJAqX] [^112JUD4L] [^11276jHZ].

> I need to check the overdose and respiratory risk profile. The FDA boxed warning highlights profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death when benzodiazepines are combined with opioids; observational data show increased drug-related mortality with benzodiazepine–opioid co-exposure, and although alprazolam alone rarely causes death, polysubstance toxicity is common in fatalities, underscoring a narrow therapeutic margin in real-world use [^114zmw1u] [^116Yepy7] [^112Z6awo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without reviewing misuse and mortality signals. Multiple national datasets show disproportionate representation of alprazolam in drug-poisoning deaths, with most cases involving other CNS depressants; in Scotland, alprazolam-related deaths peaked in 2018 and remained elevated relative to other benzodiazepines, and policy interventions that restricted access shifted prescribing but did not eliminate harm, indicating persistent misuse liability and diversion risk [^112Z6awo] [^115bugNw] [^113qScSZ].

> Next, I should review comparative efficacy and guideline positions. For PTSD, high-quality guidelines recommend against alprazolam due to interference with fear extinction and potential to worsen stress symptoms. For depression, short-term RCTs suggest symptom improvement but no durable antidepressant benefit and inferior response versus standard antidepressants, reinforcing that alprazolam lacks disease-modifying efficacy and carries disproportionate risk relative to alternatives [^111SXNo2] [^113bX2zK] [^112cwr2w].

> Let me consider special populations and practical prescribing constraints. In older adults, benzodiazepines increase falls, cognitive impairment, and delirium, and the Beers Criteria recommend non-benzodiazepine strategies. In hepatic impairment, alprazolam exposure increases and dose reductions are advised. In pregnancy, neonatal sedation and withdrawal are concerns. And in patients with substance use disorders, misuse liability is heightened, all of which further erode alprazolam's risk–benefit balance as a first-line option [^113tCfdJ] [^116MjwAS] [^114jfuiM].

> I should double-check the comparative pharmacology and tapering logistics. Relative to longer-acting benzodiazepines, alprazolam's short action and lack of active metabolites drive more frequent withdrawal cycles and greater tapering difficulty; switching to a longer-acting agent can help some patients, but cross-tolerance is imperfect and transitions may destabilize symptoms, reinforcing that alprazolam is uniquely challenging to discontinue once dependence develops [^114H6ebV] [^11276jHZ].

> But wait, what if the indication is panic disorder where alprazolam has historical RCT support. Even there, publication bias appears to inflate the apparent efficacy of alprazolam XR, and contemporary guidance favors SSRIs/SNRIs and CBT as first-line, reserving benzodiazepines, if at all, for short-term rescue with explicit exit strategies due to dependence and withdrawal risks [^1126DbMw].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit conclusion. Alprazolam's rapid onset and short half-life create a pharmacologic profile that accelerates tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal, its interaction with opioids and other CNS depressants elevates overdose risk, real-world data demonstrate disproportionate harm, and guideline bodies increasingly advise against its routine use. Therefore, alprazolam is not the drug of choice for anxiety disorders, and safer, evidence-based alternatives such as SSRIs/SNRIs, buspirone, or longer-acting benzodiazepines with clearer tapering profiles should be prioritized when pharmacotherapy is indicated [^116FJAqX] [^112cwr2w] [^114jfuiM].

---

Alprazolam is not the drug of choice because of its **high abuse and dependence potential** [^112ZXMcg], **severe withdrawal syndrome** (including seizures) [^112JUD4L], and **dangerous interactions with opioids and alcohol** that increase the risk of respiratory depression and death [^114zmw1u] [^112VGPfH]. It is short-acting, which promotes rebound anxiety and interdose withdrawal, and tolerance develops quickly, limiting long-term efficacy [^11276jHZ] [^112JUD4L] [^1127v5ch]. Safer, non-addictive alternatives like SSRIs, SNRIs, buspirone, and CBT are preferred for anxiety management [^114jfuiM]. Alprazolam should be reserved for short-term, second-line use with close monitoring [^112cwr2w].

---

## Pharmacological properties contributing to risk

- **Rapid onset and short half-life**: Alprazolam's quick onset and short half-life (6–12 hours) [^114BQHjt] cause rapid peaks and troughs, leading to rebound anxiety, interdose withdrawal, and increased misuse risk [^112JUD4L].

- **High potency**: Alprazolam is more potent than many benzodiazepines, increasing the risk of dependence and withdrawal severity even at therapeutic doses [^1129xsY3].

- **Metabolism**: Alprazolam is metabolized by CYP3A4 [^112n3R4i], and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) can markedly increase its levels, raising toxicity risk [^116MjwAS].

---

## Clinical risks and adverse effects

- **Dependence and withdrawal**: Alprazolam causes significant physical and psychological dependence; withdrawal can include seizures, severe anxiety, and protracted symptoms [^112JUD4L] [^116FJAqX].

- **Abuse and misuse**: Alprazolam has high abuse liability, with frequent misuse, diversion, and overdose, especially when combined with opioids or alcohol [^112ZXMcg] [^112Z6awo].

- **Respiratory depression**: Combined use with opioids or alcohol can cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [^114zmw1u] [^116Yepy7].

- **Cognitive impairment**: Alprazolam impairs memory, attention, and coordination, increasing accident risk, especially with alcohol [^113dk8CB] [^116UAi4k].

## Comparison with alternative anxiolytic medications

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SSRIs | - Sertraline <br/> - Escitalopram | - Effective for anxiety and depression <br/> - Lower abuse potential <br/> - No withdrawal seizures | - Delayed onset (2–4 weeks) <br/> - Initial anxiety increase |
| SNRIs | - Venlafaxine <br/> - Duloxetine | - Effective for anxiety and depression <br/> - Lower abuse potential | - Similar delayed onset <br/> - Hypertension risk |
| Buspirone | Buspirone | - Non-sedating <br/> - Non-addictive <br/> - No withdrawal seizures | - Less effective for severe anxiety <br/> - Delayed onset |
| CBT | CBT | - No pharmacological risks <br/> - Long-lasting benefits | - Requires patient engagement <br/> - Delayed onset |

---

SSRIs, SNRIs, buspirone, and CBT are preferred for anxiety because they are effective, have lower abuse potential, and do not cause withdrawal seizures [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Short-term use only**: Alprazolam is recommended for short-term (≤ 2–4 weeks) use only, with close monitoring for dependence and withdrawal [^116FJAqX] [^112cwr2w].

- **Second-line therapy**: Alprazolam is reserved for refractory cases when first-line treatments (SSRIs, SNRIs, buspirone, CBT) fail or are contraindicated [^notfound].

- **Avoidance in certain populations**: Alprazolam is not recommended for patients with substance use disorders, severe depression, or those requiring long-term anxiolytic therapy [^112cwr2w].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Alprazolam is not the drug of choice for anxiety because of its **high abuse and dependence potential**, **severe withdrawal syndrome**, and **dangerous interactions with opioids and alcohol**. Safer, non-addictive alternatives like SSRIs, SNRIs, buspirone, and CBT are preferred for anxiety management [^114jfuiM] [^111Gf1Zh]. Alprazolam should be reserved for short-term, second-line use with close monitoring [^112cwr2w] [^112ZXMcg].

Adverse Events Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation in Treatment of Panic Disorder in Placebo-Controlled Trials

In a larger database comprised of both controlled and uncontrolled studies in which 641 patients received alprazolam, discontinuation-emergent symptoms which occurred at a rate of over 5% in patients treated with alprazolam and at a greater rate than the placebo-treated group were as follows:

From the studies cited, it has not been determined whether these symptoms are clearly related to the dose and duration of therapy with alprazolam in patients with panic disorder. There have also been reports of withdrawal seizures upon rapid decrease or abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam (see WARNINGS).

To discontinue treatment in patients taking NIRAVAM®, the dosage should be reduced slowly in keeping with good medical practice. It is suggested that the daily dosage of NIRAVAM®be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Some patients may benefit from an even slower dosage reduction. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.

Alprazolam Interaction with Drugs that Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3A

The initial step in alprazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Drugs that inhibit this metabolic pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam. Consequently, alprazolam should be avoided in patients receiving very potent inhibitors of CYP3A. With drugs inhibiting CYP3A to a lesser but still significant degree, alprazolam should be used only with caution and consideration of appropriate dosage reduction. For some drugs, an interaction with alprazolam has been quantified with clinical data; for other drugs, interactions are predicted from in vitro data and/or experience with similar drugs in the same pharmacologic class.

The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of alprazolam and/or related benzodiazepines, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A.

Potent CYP3A Inhibitors

Azole antifungal agents — Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent CYP3A inhibitors and have been shown in vivo to increase plasma alprazolam concentrations 3.98 fold and 2.70 fold, respectively. The coadministration of alprazolam with these agents is not recommended. Other azole-type antifungal agents should also be considered potent CYP3A inhibitors and the coadministration of alprazolam with them is not recommended (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Drugs demonstrated to be CYP3A inhibitors on the basis of clinical studies involving alprazolam (caution and consideration of appropriate alprazolam dose reduction are recommended during coadministration with the following drugs)

Nefazodone — Coadministration of nefazodone increased alprazolam concentration two-fold.

Fluvoxamine — Coadministration of fluvoxamine approximately doubled the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam, decreased clearance by 49%, increased half-life by 71%, and decreased measured psychomotor performance.

Cimetidine — Coadministration of cimetidine increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 86%, decreased clearance by 42%, and increased half-life by 16%.

Other drugs possibly affecting alprazolam metabolism

Other drugs possibly affecting alprazolam metabolism by inhibition of CYP3A are discussed in the PRECAUTIONS section (see PRECAUTIONS–Drug Interactions).

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Clinical Experience

Manifestations of alprazolam overdosage include somnolence, confusion, impaired coordination, diminished reflexes, and coma. Death has been reported in association with overdoses of alprazolam by itself, as it has with other benzodiazepines. In addition, fatalities have been reported in patients who have overdosed with a combination of a single benzodiazepine, including alprazolam, and alcohol; alcohol levels seen in some of these patients have been lower than those usually associated with alcohol-induced fatality.

10.2 Management of Overdose

In case of an overdosage, consult a Certified Poison Control Center at 1–800–222–1222 for latest recommendations.

As in all cases of drug overdosage, respiration, pulse rate, and blood pressure should be monitored. General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids should be administered and an adequate airway maintained. As with the management of intentional overdosing with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been ingested.

Flumazenil may be useful in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for re-sedation, respiratory depression, and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose. The complete flumazenil package insert should be consulted prior to use.

### Risk of suicide attempts and intentional self-harm on alprazolam [^111Gf1Zh]. Psychiatry Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

From 2000–2021, U.S. suicide deaths have risen 36%. Identification of pharmacological agents associated with increased suicide risk and safer alternatives may help reduce this trend.

Methods

An exposure-only within-subject time-to-event pharmacoepidemiologic study of the dynamic association between alprazolam treatment and suicide attempts over 2-years. Parallel analyses were conducted for diazepam, lorazepam and buspirone. Data for 2,495,520 patients were obtained from U.S. private insurance medical claims MarketScan from 2010 to 2019.

Findings

Alprazolam was associated with over a doubling of risk of suicide attempts (HR = 2.21, 95% CI = 2.06,2.38). A duration-response analysis for the modal dose (0.5 mg) revealed a 5% increase in suicidal events per additional month of treatment (HR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.04,1.07). Parallel analyses with long-acting (diazepam) and short-acting (lorazepam), found similar associations (diazepam HR = 2.87, 95% CI = 2.56,3.21; lorazepam HR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.69,2.00), whereas the non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, buspirone, showed significantly less risk (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.13,1.38), and no increased risk in patients with an attempt history (HR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.70,1.59).

Interpretation

This study confirmed an earlier signal linking alprazolam to increased suicide attempt risk. The increased risk extends to benzodiazepines in general, regardless of half-life and risk of withdrawal seizure. Buspirone appears to be a safer treatment than benzodiazepines, particularly in patients at increased risk for suicide.

Special Populations

Changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of benzodiazepines have been reported in a variety of disease states including alcoholism, impaired hepatic function and impaired renal function. Changes have also been demonstrated in geriatric patients. A mean half-life of alprazolam of 16.3 hours has been observed in healthy elderly subjects (range: 9.0–26.9 hours, n = 16) compared to 11.0 hours (range: 6.3–15.8 hours, n = 16) in healthy adult subjects. In patients with alcoholic liver disease, the half-life of alprazolam ranged between 5.8 and 65.3 hours (mean: 19.7 hours, n = 17) as compared to between 6.3 and 26.9 hours (mean = 11.4 hours, n = 17) in healthy subjects. In an obese group of subjects, the half-life of alprazolam ranged between 9.9 and 40.4 hours (mean = 21.8 hours, n = 12) as compared to between 6.3 and 15.8 hours (mean = 10.6 hours, n = 12) in healthy subjects.

Because of its similarity to other benzodiazepines, it is assumed that alprazolam undergoes transplacental passage and that it is excreted in human milk.

Race — Maximal concentrations and half-life of alprazolam are approximately 15% and 25% higher in Asians compared to Caucasians.

Pediatrics — The pharmacokinetics of alprazolam in pediatric patients have not been studied.

Gender — Gender has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam.

Cigarette Smoking — Alprazolam concentrations may be reduced by up to 50% in smokers compared to non-smokers.

Physical and Psychological Dependence

Withdrawal symptoms similar in character to those noted with sedative/hypnotics and alcohol have occurred following discontinuance of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam. The symptoms can range from mild dysphoria and insomnia to a major syndrome that may include abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, tremors and convulsions. Distinguishing between withdrawal emergent signs and symptoms and the recurrence of illness is often difficult in patients undergoing dose reduction. The long term strategy for treatment of these phenomena will vary with their cause and the therapeutic goal. When necessary, immediate management of withdrawal symptoms requires re-institution of treatment at doses of alprazolam sufficient to suppress symptoms. There have been reports of failure of other benzodiazepines to fully suppress these withdrawal symptoms. These failures have been attributed to incomplete cross-tolerance but may also reflect the use of an inadequate dosing regimen of the substituted benzodiazepine or the effects of concomitant medications.

While it is difficult to distinguish withdrawal and recurrence for certain patients, the time course and the nature of the symptoms may be helpful. A withdrawal syndrome typically includes the occurrence of new symptoms, tends to appear toward the end of taper or shortly after discontinuation, and will decrease with time. In recurring panic disorder, symptoms similar to those observed before treatment may recur either early or late, and they will persist.

5.1 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam tablets, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe alprazolam tablets concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of alprazolam tablets than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking alprazolam tablets, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when alprazolam tablets is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Differential metabolism of alprazolam by liver and brain cytochrome (P4503A) to pharmacologically active metabolite [^116euyhH]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Cytochrome P450 (P450) is a superfamily of enzymes which mediates metabolism of xenobiotics including drugs. Alprazolam, an anti-anxiety agent, is metabolized in rat and human liver by P4503A1 and P4503A4 respectively, to 4-hydroxy alprazolam (4-OHALP, pharmacologically less active) and alpha-hydroxy alprazolam (alpha-OHALP, pharmacologically more active). We examined P450 mediated metabolism of alprazolam by rat and human brain microsomes and observed that the relative amount of alpha-OHALP formed in brain was higher than liver. This biotransformation was mediated by a P450 isoform belonging to P4503A subfamily, which is constitutively expressed in neuronal cells in rat and human brain. The formation of larger amounts of alpha-OHALP in neurons points to local modulation of pharmacological activity in brain, at the site of action of the anti-anxiety drug. Since hydroxy metabolites of alprazolam are hydrophilic and not easily cleared through blood-CSF barrier, alpha-OHALP would potentially have a longer half-life in brain.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113XGstc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — risk factors for severe withdrawal and implications for taper pace — "The development of more severe BZD withdrawal symptoms is associated with use of BZDs with a shorter half-life and fewer active metabolites (e.g., alprazolam), daily use, higher total daily dose, longer duration of use, and history of severe withdrawal". Accordingly, "A slower initial pace of BZD tapering is likely to be safer and more effective for patients who have a high likelihood of physical dependence and significant risk of withdrawal", and "patients should be involved in determining the initial and ongoing tapering pace with clinicians, with the pace ideally agreed upon in a shared decision-making process". The guideline also notes that psychiatric comorbidity complicates tapering: "The presence of certain psychiatric symptoms has been associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing more severe withdrawal symptoms", with examples including "higher levels of anxiety" and personality disorder traits that "often experience considerable difficulty discontinuing BZDs".

### Alprazolam [^112n3R4i]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Alprazolam is a 1,4 benzodiazepine. Alprazolam exerts its effect for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder through binding to the benzodiazepine site of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors in the brain and enhances GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Plasma levels of alprazolam increase proportionally to the dose over the range of 0.5 to 3.0 mg.

Absorption

Following oral administration, peak plasma concentration of alprazolam (Cmax) occurs in 1 to 2 hours post dose.

Distribution

Alprazolam is 80% bound to human serum protein, and albumin accounts for the majority of the binding.

Elimination

The mean plasma elimination half-life (T1/2) of alprazolam is approximately 11.2 hours (range: 6.3 to 26.9 hours) in healthy adults.

Metabolism

Alprazolam is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), to 2 major active metabolites in the plasma: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. The plasma circulation levels of the two active metabolites are less than 4% of the parent. The reported relative potencies in benzodiazepine receptor binding experiments and in animal models of induced seizure inhibition are 0.20 and 0.66, respectively, for 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they unlikely contribute much to the effects of alprazolam. A benzophenone derived from alprazolam is also found in humans. Their half-lives appear to be similar to that of alprazolam.

Excretion

Alprazolam and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine.

### Part I. benzodiazepines-side effects, abuse risk and alternatives… [^112CESqv]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed, with four of them — alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam and lorazepam — listed among the top 100 most commonly prescribed medications. Benzodiazepines are also widely prescribed for other reasons, such as muscle spasticity, convulsive disorders, presurgical sedation, involuntary movement disorders, detoxification from alcohol and other substances, and anxiety associated with cardiovascular or gastrointestinal conditions 3. That benzodiazepines, barbiturates and ethanol all have related actions on a common receptor type, which explains their pharmacologic synergy and cross tolerance. Thus, benzodiazepines are used during alcohol detoxification. With long-term high-dose use of benzodiazepines, there is an apparent decrease in the efficacy of GABA-A receptors, presumably a mechanism of tolerance.

DEPENDENCE Benzodiazepine therapy can give rise to physiologic and psychologic dependence based on the drug's dosage, duration of therapy and potency. 1 Thus, dependence will develop sooner in a patient who is taking a high dosage of a high-potency agent such as alprazolam than in a patient who is receiving a relatively low dosage of a long-acting, low-potency agent such as chlordiazepoxide. As a result of physiologic dependence, withdrawal symptoms emerge with rapid dose reduction or abrupt discontinuation of the drug. Medical prescriptions constitute the primary source of supply for people who abuse benzodiazepines. Prescriptions may also have a street value, which encourages rerouting to illicit sources.

Benzodiazepines have multiple uses for polydrug addicts: they are used to enhance the euphoriant effects of opioids, to alleviate withdrawal or abstinence syndromes, to temper cocaine highs, to augment alcohol synergistically and to modulate withdrawal states. 31 Data suggest that highly lipophilic benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, and agents with a short half-life and high potency, such as lorazepam or alprazolam, are the most reinforcing benzodiazepines and, therefore, the ones most likely to be associated with abuse. 30.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. (5.1, 7.1)
The use of benzodiazepines, including XANAX, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Before prescribing XANAX and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. (5.2)
Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of XANAX after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue XANAX or reduce the dosage. (2.2, 5.3)

### Alprazolam-related deaths in scotland, 2004–2020 [^11748FUi]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

NMU of alprazolam appears to be on the increase globally. Factors playing a role in this development include: a known history of drug abuse; NMU of prescription drugs. These changes need to be seen against increasing trends in the NMU of benzodiazepines globally and 'designer benzo' use in the United Kingdom. This has been well recognised in Scotland.

Unparalleled levels of deaths involving such benzodiazepines are occurring in UK, especially in Scotland (e.g. etizolam) and, more recently, in Northern Ireland, because of NMU.

Recreational drug users are attracted to alprazolam because of its high lipophilicity which leads to faster bioavailability, especially in the context of crossing the bloodbrain barrier and thus a quicker 'hit'. Compared to other benzodiazepines, alprazolam has a greater potency.

Strengths and limitations of the study

This is the first UK study to look at the nature and extent of alprazolam-related deaths, and it also provides the first and most up-to-date overview of research into alprazolam-related deaths. Furthermore, it highlights the need for healthcare professionals to be aware of the scale of illicit use of alprazolam.

There are several limitations to the Scottish data here which precludes further in-depth analyses. The NRS does not receive detailed toxicological information, only an indication from the relevant pathologist as to what were the substances considered to have been implicated in and/or contributing to death, as well as an indication of other substances found at post-mortem. No levels in body tissues are provided. The equivalent agencies that cover England and Wales (ONS) and Northern Ireland (NISRA) do not receive any toxicological information. The number of deaths presented in Figure 1 and Table 1 only relate to deaths due to drug poisonings. Whilst National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths (NPSAD) data would be complementary, this is outside the remit of the current paper as NPSAD has not received Scottish data since 2011. A future study could be carried out to compare/contrast Scottish trends with English/Welsh/Northern Irish trends using NPSAD data.

### A review of alprazolam use, misuse, and withdrawal [^116UrGCE]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Alprazolam is one of the most widely prescribed benzodiazepines for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Its clinical use has been a point of contention as most addiction specialists consider it to be highly addictive, given its unique psychodynamic properties which limit its clinical usefulness, whereas many primary care physicians continue to prescribe it for longer periods than recommended. Clinical research data has not fully shed light on its "abuse liability", yet it is one of the most frequently prescribed benzodiazepines. "Abuse liability" is the degree to which a psychoactive drug has properties that facilitate people misusing it, or becoming addicted to it, and is commonly used in the literature. We have replaced it in our manuscript with "misuse liability" as it reflects a more updated terminology consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). In this paper, we have reviewed alprazolam's indications for use, its effect on pregnant women, misuse liability, withdrawal syndrome, pharmacodynamic properties, and suggest better clinical prescription practice of alprazolam by presenting an indepth theory of its clinical effects with use and withdrawal.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116FJAqX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk and determining physical dependence: when discontinuation is appropriate, clinicians "need to first determine if patients are likely to be physically dependent on the medication, and therefore at risk of withdrawal". The risk of severe withdrawal has "been recognized since the 1960 s", and factors increasing risk include "use of shorter acting BZD, higher dose, and longer duration of treatment". Many patients using BZDs for a short time "(e.g., less than a month)" may stop without withdrawal, but those using low doses for an intermediate time "(e.g., 6 weeks)" may not be dependent. For alprazolam, which has "a very short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no active metabolites", dependence can occur more rapidly; therefore, "a taper may be appropriate" even for daily use of short duration "(e.g., 2–4 weeks)". If dependence is uncertain, clinicians "should elicit information from patients" about concerns and preferences, and strict thresholds are difficult because risk is influenced by multiple patient and drug factors.

Recreational use in the UK

As alprazolam is not usually asked about in regular surveys of drug use, it is difficult to ascertain the extent of its recreational use. However, in the UK context, some limited information is available.suggest that the estimated national prevalence rate for UK adults for non-medical use (NMU) of alprazolam was 0.08 (range 0.01–0.15)% with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.898) between males and females. NMU rates in the last 90 days were higher amongst those aged 16–24 (0.37%) compared to those aged 25–34 (0.14%) and those aged 35 or more (0.01%), p < 0.001. This suggests that about 26,000 individuals aged 16–24 had used alprazolam non-medically in the last 90-day period across the UK. The main reasons for NMU were: to treat a medical condition (54.9%), to get high (39.1%), to come down (26.8%), to prevent withdrawal (11.3%).

Greater use in younger age groups is also evident in the results of two other studies. The VICE website reported that an opportunistic survey about Xanax conducted using its VICE UK Snapchat channel (aimed mostly at 13- to 24-year-olds) received 85,000 UK responses, of whom 35% reported that they had friends who had taken Xanax. The Tab 's 2020 Drugs Survey of students at 14 different UK universities revealed that Xanax was the 'drug of choice' for 3.7% (n = 576) of the 16,017 respondents.

OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Experience

Manifestations of alprazolam overdosage include somnolence, confusion, impaired coordination, diminished reflexes and coma. Death has been reported in association with overdoses of alprazolam by itself, as it has with other benzodiazepines. In addition, fatalities have been reported in patients who have overdosed with a combination of a single benzodiazepine, including alprazolam, and alcohol; alcohol levels seen in some of these patients have been lower than those usually associated with alcohol-induced fatality.

The acute oral LD₅₀in rats is 331–2171 mg/kg. Other experiments in animals have indicated that cardiopulmonary collapse can occur following massive intravenous doses of alprazolam (over 195 mg/kg; 975 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 10 mg/day). Animals could be resuscitated with positive mechanical ventilation and the intravenous infusion of norepinephrine bitartrate.

Animal experiments have suggested that forced diuresis or hemodialysis are probably of little value in treating overdosage.

General Treatment of Overdose

Overdosage reports with alprazolam are limited. As in all cases of drug overdosage, respiration, pulse rate, and blood pressure should be monitored. General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids should be administered and an adequate airway maintained. If hypotension occurs, it may be combated by the use of vasopressors. Dialysis is of limited value. As with the management of intentional overdosing with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been ingested.

Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for re-sedation, respiratory depression, and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose. The complete flumazenil package insert including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS should be consulted prior to use.

2.3	Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of XANAX

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue XANAX or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Reduced the dosage by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens.

In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared the recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.

2.4	Dosage Recommendations in Geriatric Patients

In geriatric patients, the recommended starting oral dosage of XANAX is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. Geriatric patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dosage, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5	Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with hepatic impairment, the recommended starting oral dosage of XANAX is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dose, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.6	Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions

XANAX should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage when a patient is started on ritonavir and XANAX together, or when ritonavir administered to a patient treated with XANAX. Increase the XANAX dosage to the target dose after 10 to 14 days of dosing ritonavir and XANAX together. It is not necessary to reduce XANAX dose in patients who have been taking ritonavir for more than 10 to 14 days.

XANAX is contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome

In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Certain adverse clinical events, some life-threatening, are a direct consequence of physical dependence to alprazolam tablets. These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms; the most important is seizure [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. Even after relatively short-term use at doses of ≤ 4 mg/day, there is some risk of dependence. Spontaneous reporting system data suggest that the risk of dependence and its severity appear to be greater in patients treated with doses greater than 4 mg/day and for long periods (more than 12 weeks). However, in a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients who received alprazolam tablets, the duration of treatment (3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose. In contrast, patients treated with doses of alprazolam tablets greater than 4 mg/day had more difficulty tapering to zero dose than those treated with less than 4 mg/day.

In a controlled clinical trial in which 63 patients were randomized to alprazolam tablets and where withdrawal symptoms were specifically sought, the following were identified as symptoms of withdrawal: heightened sensory perception, impaired concentration, dysosmia, clouded sensorium, paresthesias, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, diarrhea, blurred vision, appetite decrease, and weight loss. Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation, but it could not be determined if they were due to return of illness, rebound, or withdrawal.

Interdose Symptoms

Early morning anxiety and emergence of anxiety symptoms between doses of alprazolam tablets have been reported in patients with panic disorder taking prescribed maintenance doses. These symptoms may reflect the development of tolerance or a time interval between doses which is longer than the duration of clinical action of the administered dose. In either case, it is presumed that the prescribed dose is not sufficient to maintain plasma levels above those needed to prevent relapse, rebound, or withdrawal symptoms over the entire course of the interdosing interval.

Tolerance

Tolerance to alprazolam tablets may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of alprazolam tablets may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.

### Unpublished trials of alprazolam XR and their influence on its apparent efficacy for panic disorder [^1126DbMw]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To test for publication bias with alprazolam, the most widely prescribed benzodiazepine, by comparing its efficacy for panic disorder using trial results from (1) the published literature and (2) the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Methods

From FDA reviews, we included data from all phase 2/3 efficacy trials of alprazolam extended-release (Xanax XR) for the treatment of panic disorder. A search for matching publications was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. Publication bias was examined by comparing: (1) overall trial results (positive or not) according to the FDA v. corresponding publications; (2) effect size (Hedges's g) based on FDA data v. published data.

Results

The FDA review showed that five trials were conducted, only one of which (20%) was positive. Of the four not-positive trials, two were published conveying a positive outcome; the other two were not published. Thus, according to the published literature, three trials were conducted and all (100%) were positive. Alprazolam's effect size calculated using FDA data was 0.33 (CI 95% 0.07–0.60) v. 0.47 (CI 95% 0.30–0.65) using published data, an increase of 0.14, or 42%.

Conclusions

Publication bias substantially inflates the apparent efficacy of alprazolam XR.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing alprazolam tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of alprazolam tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam tablets or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Comparison of prescribing patterns before and after implementation of a national policy to reduce inappropriate alprazolam prescribing in Australia [^113qScSZ]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Benzodiazepines have been a common target for policy interventions to curtail inappropriate use, with mixed results. To reduce alprazolam misuse, in February 2017, Australia delisted the 2-mg tablet strength from public subsidy, eliminated refills, and reduced the pack size from 50 tablets to 10 tablets.

Objective

To describe changes in alprazolam dispensing, prescribing, and poisonings associated with the implementation of a new policy to reduce inappropriate prescription of alprazolam in Australia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study included data from a 10% sample of Australian people who received publicly subsidized dispensing claims and prescribing approvals for alprazolam from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018, and all calls to a poison information service involving alprazolam from February 1, 2015, to October 31, 2018. Autoregressive error models were used to quantify changes over time and compare patterns of use before and after the intervention. Data analyses were conducted from November 2018 to May 2019.

Exposure

Implementation of the policy change on February 1, 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monthly trends in alprazolam prescribing approvals and dispensings, quarterly trends in telephone calls involving alprazolam to a poison information service, and patterns of prescribing and dispensing before and after the intervention.

Results

From 2015 to 2018, there were 71 481 alprazolam dispensings to 6772 people. After the intervention, overall dispensing decreased by 51.2% (95% CI, 50.5%-51.9%) and prescribing approvals increased by 17.5% (95% CI, 13.0%-22.2%). Overall, the proportion of dispensing of packs of 51 to 100 tablets increased from 5776 of 24 282 dispensings (23.8%) to 4888 of 10 676 dispensings (45.8%) (risk difference [RD], 22.0% [95% CI, 19.4%-24.6%]) and dispensing of packs of more than 100 tablets increased from 1029 of 24 282 dispensings (4.2%) to 1774 of 10 676 dispensings (16.6%) (RD, 12.4% [95% CI, 10.6%-14.2%]). Among people receiving their first alprazolam prescription, initiation with packs of 10 tablets or fewer increased from 16 of 1127 people (1.4%) before the intervention to 139 of 589 people (23.6%) after the intervention (RD, 22.2% [95% CI, 18.7%-25.7%]). Alprazolam treatment initiation with packs of more than 50 tablets also increased from 63 of 1127 people (5.6%) before the intervention to 144 of 589 people (24.4%) after the intervention (RD, 18.9% [95% CI, 15.1%-22.6%]). During 1 year before the intervention, patients received a median (interquartile range [IQR]) total of 250 (50–600) tablets and median (IQR) total combined tablet strength of 188 (50–550) mg. During 1 year after the intervention, people were dispensed less alprazolam, with a median (IQR) total of 200 (50–500) tablets and median (IQR) total combined tablet strength of 120 (30–360) mg. There was little change in poisoning calls involving alprazolam.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that after the policy intervention, subsidized alprazolam use decreased, but the increase in prescribing approvals placed additional burden on prescribers. Even after the intervention, most people who were dispensed alprazolam were still receiving treatment contrary to best-practice recommendations. Furthermore, the poison information center data suggested that people were still being dispensed the 2-mg tablet strength, presumably as nonsubsidized (ie, private) prescriptions.

### Alprazolam for essential tremor [^115TXSyk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders. Treatment is based primarily on pharmacological agents. On this basis, although primidone and propranolol are well-established treatments in clinical practice, they could be ineffective in 25% to 55% of patients and can produce serious adverse events (AEs) in a large percentage of individuals. For these reasons, evaluating treatment alternatives for ET may be a worthwhile pursuit. Alprazolam has been suggested as a potentially useful agent for treatment of individuals with ET, but its efficacy and safety are uncertain.

Objectives

PrimaryTo assess the efficacy and safety of alprazolam in the treatment of individuals with ET. SecondaryTo examine effects of alprazolam treatment on the quality of life of people with ET.

Search Methods

We carried out a systematic search without language restrictions to identify all relevant trials. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2015), EMBASE (January 1988 to September 2015), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (1999 to September 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (1997 to September 2015) and the World Health Organiza tion (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (2004 to September 2015). We handsearched grey literature and examined the reference lists of identified studies and reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of alprazolam versus placebo or any other treatment. We included studies in which ET was diagnosed according to accepted and validated diagnostic criteria. We excluded studies that included patients presenting with secondary forms of tremor or reporting only neurophysiological parameters for the pur p ose of assessing outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and extracted data using a data collection form. We assessed risk of bias and the body of evidence. We used inverse variance methods for continuous outcomes and measurement scales. We compared differences between treatment groups as mean differences. We used Review Manager software for management and analysis of data.

Main Results

We included in this review one trial that compared alprazolam versus placebo (24 participants). It was judged to have high overall risk of bias. We graded the overall quality of evidence as very low. Compared with those given placebo, participants treated with alprazolam showed a significant reduction in tremor severity (mean difference (MD) -0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.83 to -0.67). Nine alprazolam-treated participants (75%) developed AEs, mainly represented by sedation (50%), constipation (17%) and dry mouth (9%). No participants in the alprazolam group and no p articipants in the placebo group discontinued treatment and dropped out of the study.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently available data reveal evidence insufficient for assessment of the efficacy and safety of alprazolam treatment for individuals with ET.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Side effects to alprazolam, if they occur, are generally observed at the beginning of therapy and usually disappear upon continued medication. In the usual patient, the most frequent side effects are likely to be an extension of the pharmacological activity of alprazolam, eg, drowsiness or light-headedness.

The data cited in the two tables below are estimates of untoward clinical event incidence among patients who participated under the following clinical conditions: relatively short duration (ie, four weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 4 mg/day of alprazolam (for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety) and short-term (up to ten weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 10 mg/day of alprazolam in patients with panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.

These data cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics, and other factors often differ from those in clinical trials. These figures cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products and placebo as each group of drug trials are conducted under a different set of conditions.

5.1	Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including XANAX, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe XANAX concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of XANAX than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking XANAX, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when XANAX is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including XANAX, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing XANAX and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of XANAX, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of XANAX along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

### Alprazolam (Xanax) [^111wZeEG]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Alprazolam is a 1,4 benzodiazepine. Alprazolam exerts its effect for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder through binding to the benzodiazepine site of gamma‑aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors in the brain and enhances GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Plasma levels of alprazolam increase proportionally to the dose over the range of 0.5 to 3.0 mg.

Absorption

Following oral administration, peak plasma concentration of alprazolam (Cmax) occurs in 1 to 2 hours post dose.

Distribution

Alprazolam is 80% bound to human serum protein, and albumin accounts for the majority of the binding.

Elimination

The mean plasma elimination half-life (T1/2) of alprazolam is approximately 11.2 hours (range: 6.3 to 26.9 hours) in healthy adults.

Metabolism

Alprazolam is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), to 2 major active metabolites in the plasma: 4‑hydroxyalprazolam and α‑hydroxyalprazolam. The plasma circulation levels of the two active metabolites are less than 4% of the parent. The reported relative potencies in benzodiazepine receptor binding experiments and in animal models of induced seizure inhibition are 0.20 and 0.66, respectively, for 4‑hydroxyalprazolam and α‑hydroxyalprazolam. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they unlikely contribute much to the effects of alprazolam. A benzophenone derived from alprazolam is also found in humans. Their half-lives appear to be similar to that of alprazolam.

Excretion

Alprazolam and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine.

### Cognitive effects, pharmacokinetics, and safety of zuranolone administered alone or with alprazolam or ethanol in healthy adults in a phase 1 trial [^112EfgWH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study has some limitations. It was conducted in a relatively small population of healthy adults, which may limit its generalizability to adults with PPD. In addition, while the doses of alprazolam and ethanol used in the study were consistent with those that previously demonstrated negative cognitive effects and are considered safe to administer to healthy participants, doses of these agents may be larger in therapeutic or recreational settings. Therefore, the effects of coadministration with zuranolone may differ from those observed in this study. The absence of statistical significance for some of the main treatment comparisons may have arisen because these experimental effects were truly small, and therefore, the sample size included in the study did not provide sufficient statistical power to reject the relevant null hypotheses. However, because this study was the first to investigate the cognitive effects of a new drug therapy, conclusions about the effects were considered with respect to the effect sizes reflecting the comparisons of interest. Furthermore, any interpretations are tempered by reference to outcomes from the tests of statistical significance uncorrected for familywise error. These effect sizes can also be integrated directly into future meta-analyses of the effects of zuranolone on cognition. Finally, while efforts were made to ensure participants and clinical site staff were blinded to the treatment, physical effects of zuranolone, ethanol, or alprazolam may have compromised blinding, similar to studies with psychoactive substances in which participants were able to guess whether they received the active drug.

Of note, the design of the present study does not reflect how zuranolone is intended for clinical use, given that zuranolone was administered in the morning while the US prescribing information for zuranolone recommends it be administered in the evening. The maximal effect coincided with the time of peak plasma concentrations (5–6 h postdose for zuranolone), which should therefore occur late at night or during sleep hours. By 8–12 h postdose, there was a reduction in the systemic concentrations and dissipation of cognitive decline. This suggests that the cognitive decline observed with zuranolone, alone or in combination with alprazolam or ethanol, is temporary and fully reversible. Regardless, prescribers and patients should be aware of the potential risks from the combined use of zuranolone with other CNS-depressant medications.

Whilst data are lacking for Scotland in terms of the availability of illicit supplies of alprazolam, which might partially explain the increase in deaths, data from the rest of the UK do suggest large shipments being intercepted (Border Force responses on 25 January 2021 to FOI request 61791 and 24 March 2021 to FOI request 62855 by JC, and personal communication to JC from the Police Service of Northern Ireland on 27 November 2020). However, it should also be noted that the increase in alprazolam-related fatalities should be seen against the dramatic increase in numbers of deaths in Scotland involving benzodiazepines more generally.

### Incidence of and characteristics associated with long-term benzodiazepine use in Finland [^112hMLwM]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The clinical choice of the initial BZDR was associated with a differential risk for long-term use. Clonazepam was associated with a higher risk for development of long-term use, which is consistent with previous prevalence studies. Clonazepam is a high-potency benzodiazepine with a long elimination half-life, and it was used mainly for nonepilepsy indications in this study. However, its high potency may be associated with escalated development of tolerance and related adverse events. Use of clonazepam should be carefully considered, as its abuse liability has been documented. Also, starting treatment with lorazepam, temazepam, or polytherapy was associated with a higher risk for long-term use, whereas the drugs most often prescribed, oxazepam and Z-drugs, were associated with the lowest risk for long-term use, supporting the rationale for current BZDR treatment guidelines and recommendations.

This study's finding that alprazolam was associated with a lower risk for long-term use was somewhat surprising, as alprazolam has been associated with increased risk of long-term use in previous studies, and is suspected to be more likely to cause physical dependence because of its high potency and short half-life. It is possible that alprazolam was prescribed selectively or restrictively in the whole study population owing to concerns of dependence and was avoided in persons judged to have a high liability for dependence. This selection may also apply to other specific BZDRs, and thus, the association with relative safety does not imply that any BZDR would be resistant to misuse or abuse.

We identified multiple factors associated with development of long-term use, including male sex, older age, receipt of social benefits, psychiatric comorbidities, and substance abuse. Most of these factors have also been reported in previous studies, with some controversies, eg, regarding sex. These findings can be useful in clinical decision-making by identifying more precisely those patients who might be at risk of developing long-term use of BZDRs.

### Issues in the clinical use of benzodiazepines: potency, withdrawal, and rebound [^1129xsY3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Low and medium potency benzodiazepines were initially introduced for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. Their therapeutic actions as anxiolytics, sedative hypnotics, anticonvulsants, and muscle relaxants (with their low toxicity) have led to their use as first-line treatments, and they have become one of the most prescribed classes of drugs. Novel therapeutic uses of benzodiazepines were discovered with the introduction of the high-potency benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam). They were found to be effective in treating panic disorder and panic attacks with or without agoraphobia, as add-on therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorders, and as adjunctive therapy in treating patients with acute mania or acute agitation. High-potency benzodiazepines have replaced low and medium potency benzodiazepines in all benzodiazepine clinical indications due to their greater therapeutic effects and rapid onset of action. Differences in distribution, elimination half-life, and rate of absorption are important considerations when choosing a high-potency benzodiazepine. Typically, a benzodiazepine with long distribution and elimination half-lives is preferred. A maximum dose of 2 mg/day of any of the high-potency benzodiazepines when given for more than 1 week is recommended. Although as a class benzodiazepines act rapidly and are well tolerated, their use presents clinical issues such as dependence, rebound anxiety, memory impairment, and discontinuation syndrome.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^113qSUjW]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines in OCD — evidence for monotherapy benefit is limited to case reports, controlled data are inconsistent or negative, and modest doses may relieve anxiety without reducing obsessions/compulsions; among those with substance abuse histories they should be prescribed cautiously, and benzodiazepines cannot be recommended as monotherapy for OCD except in rare individuals unable or unwilling to take standard anti-OCD medication. Evidence for beneficial effects of benzodiazepines as monotherapy for OCD is primarily limited to case reports with clonazepam and alprazolam, and for clonazepam negative results from controlled trials cast doubt on earlier positive findings; case reports note an onset within 1–3 weeks.

### Alprazolam (Niravam) [^111AVyMN]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

CNS agents of the 1,4 benzodiazepine class presumably exert their effects by binding at stereo specific receptors at several sites within the central nervous system. Their exact mechanism of action is unknown. Clinically, all benzodiazepines cause a dose-related central nervous system depressant activity varying from mild impairment of task performance to hypnosis.

Absorption

Following oral administration, alprazolam is readily absorbed. The peak plasma concentration is reached about 1.5 to 2 hours after administration of NIRAVAM®given with or without water. When taken with water, mean Tmaxoccurs about 15 minutes earlier than when taken without water with no change in Cmaxor AUC. Plasma levels are proportional to the dose given; over the dose range of 0.5 to 3.0 mg, peak levels of 8.0 to 37 ng/mL are observed. The elimination half-life of alprazolam is approximately 12.5 hours (range 7.9–19.2 hours) after administration of NIRAVAM®in healthy adults.

Food decreased the mean Cmaxby about 25% and increased the mean Tmaxby 2 hours from

2.2 hours to 4.4 hours after the ingestion of a high-fat meal. Food did not affect the extent of absorption (AUC) or the elimination half-life.

Distribution

In vitro, alprazolam is bound (80 percent) to human serum protein. Serum albumin accounts for the majority of the binding.

### Comparison of prescribing patterns before and after implementation of a national policy to reduce inappropriate alprazolam prescribing in Australia [^113cgiVs]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Similar approaches have been used to restrict access to other commonly misused medications, such as opioids and quetiapine, with equally mixed results. In the United States, when prescription refills were no longer available for hydrocodone after its rescheduling, the amounts dispensed at the initiation of postsurgery treatment increased. When refills for low-dose quetiapine were eliminated in Australia to prevent prescribing outside its approved indications, subsidized dispensing decreased overall, but there was little impact on inappropriate use. Despite the reduction in subsidized alprazolam use, we cannot be certain to what extent prescribing decreased overall, as we did not have data on nonsubsidized (ie, private) prescriptions. Given alprazolam's low cost, a shift to the private market would not be surprising, as there is little price difference between private or PBS-subsidized prescriptions for many people. Likewise, in Ontario, Canada, after high-strength opioids were delisted from the public formulary, 1 in 3 people accessed them via private insurance or by paying for the medication out of pocket.

A 2013 study by Nielsen et alsuggested that most people who misuse benzodiazepines were prescribed them by a health care practitioner for the treatment of real symptoms, making prescribers an appropriate target for intervention. However, many prescribers are skeptical about certain policy interventions, such as requirements for authorities, to promote prescribing according to best-practice recommendations and safe use of medications. Moreover, discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine use can be difficult; thus, increasing restrictions on subsidized benzodiazepine prescribing on its own may have minimal effect on problematic long-term use, particularly in the context of a thriving private market. Imprecise interventions, such as withdrawing reimbursement, often have unintended consequences and are rarely sufficient on their own to promote safer use of medications.

### Alprazolam-related deaths in scotland, 2004–2020 [^113shF52]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The benzodiazepine drug alprazolam, a fast-acting tranquiliser, cannot be prescribed on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. Illicit alprazolam supply and consumption have increased. Concern about increasing numbers of alprazolam-related fatalities started circulating in 2018. However, statistics on this issue are very limited. This study examined patterns in such mortality in Scotland.

Methods

Statistics on deaths where alprazolam was mentioned in the 'cause of death' were obtained from official mortality registers. Anonymised Scottish case-level data were obtained. Data were examined in respect of the characteristics of decedents and deaths using descriptive statistics.

Results

Scotland registered 370 deaths in 2004–2020; 366 of these occurred in 2015–2020: most involved males (77.1%); mean age 39.0 (SD 12.6)years. The principal underlying cause of death was accidental poisoning: opiates/opioids (77.9%); sedatives/hypnotics (15.0%). Two deaths involved alprazolam alone. Main drug groups implicated: opiates/opioids (94.8%), 'other benzodiazepines' (67.2%), gabapentinoids (42.9%), stimulants (30.1%), antidepressants (15.0%). Two-thirds (64.2%) involved combinations of central nervous system (CNS) depressants.

Discussion

Alprazolam-related deaths are likely due to an increasing illicit supply. The fall in deaths in 2019–2020 is partially due to increased use of designer benzodiazepines. Treatment for alprazolam dependence is growing. Clinicians need to be aware of continuing recreational alprazolam use. When such consumption occurs with CNS depressants, overdose and death risks increase.

Conclusions

More awareness of alprazolam contributing to deaths, especially in conjunction with other CNS depressants, is needed by consumers and clinicians. Improved monitoring of illicit supplies could identify emerging issues of medicines' abuse.

### Alprazolam (Niravam) [^112rMNts]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Use with Imipramine and Desipramine

The steady state plasma concentrations of imipramine and desipramine have been reported to be increased an average of 31% and 20%, respectively, by the concomitant administration of alprazolam in doses up to 4 mg/day. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown.

Drugs that inhibit alprazolam metabolism via cytochrome P450 3A

The initial step in alprazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Drugs which inhibit this metabolic pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS for additional drugs of this type).

Drugs demonstrated to be CYP3A inhibitors of possible clinical significance on the basis of clinical studies involving alprazolam (caution is recommended during coadministration with alprazolam)

Fluoxetine — Coadministration of fluoxetine with alprazolam increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 46%, decreased clearance by 21%, increased half-life by 17%, and decreased measured psychomotor performance.

Propoxyphene — Coadministration of propoxyphene decreased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 6%, decreased clearance by 38%, and increased half-life by 58%.

Oral Contraceptives — Coadministration of oral contraceptives increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 18%, decreased clearance by 22%, and increased half-life by 29%.

### Alprazolam for depression [^113bX2zK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The 'off-label' effect of alprazolam on depression has not been systematically evaluated.

Objectives

To determine the antidepressant effect, including tolerability and acceptability, of alprazolam as monotherapy for major depression, when compared to placebo and conventional antidepressants in outpatients and patients in primary care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register, which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years to February 2012); EMBASE (1970 to February 2012); MEDLINE (1950 to February 2012) and PsycINFO (1960 to February 2012). Two review authors identified relevant trials by assessing the abstracts of all possible studies. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of alprazolam versus placebo or conventional antidepressants for depression in adults, excluding studies with inpatients only.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors performed the data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment independently with disagreements resolved through discussion with a third review author. Primary outcomes included the mean difference (MD) in reduction of depression on a continuous measure of depression symptoms, and the risk ratio (RR) of the clinical response based on a dichotomous measure, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We identified 21 alprazolam studies (22 reports) with a total of 2693 participants. Seven studies used a placebo (n = 771) and 20 used cyclic antidepressants (n = 1765). The typical duration of the studies was four to six weeks. We considered six studies to have a high risk of bias. When alprazolam was compared with placebo for reduction in symptoms all estimates indicated a positive effect for alprazolam. Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed a moderately large continuous mean difference (MD) at the end of trial (-5.34, 95% CI -7.48 to -3.20; I² = 68%). The risk difference (RD) for the dichotomous measure of clinical response (50% improvement) was 0.32 in favour of alprazolam (95% CI 0.22 to 0.42; I² = 0%), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 5). The RD of all-cause withdrawals did not differ between alprazolam and placebo. When depression severity was measured as a continuum the effect of alprazolam did not differ statistically or clinically from the effects of any of the conventional antidepressants combined (MD 0.25, 95% CI -0.93 to 1.43; I² = 55%). However, for dichotomised depression severity, alprazolam had less effect than antidepressants (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; I² = 37%; RD -0.11, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.01; I² = 58%; NNTB 9, 95% CI 4 to 100). The RD of all-cause withdrawals was -0.04 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.00; I(2) = 35%), in favour of alprazolam.

Authors' Conclusions

Alprazolam appears to reduce depressive symptoms more effectively than placebo and as effectively as tricyclic antidepressants. However, the studies included in the review were heterogeneous, of poor quality and only addressed short-term effects, thus limiting our confidence in the findings. Whilst the rate of all-cause withdrawals did not appear to differ between alprazolam and placebo, and withdrawals were less frequent in the alprazolam group than in any of the conventional antidepressants combined group, these findings should be interpreted with caution, given the dependency properties of benzodiazepines.

Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions, Including Seizures

Certain adverse clinical events, some life-threatening, are a direct consequence of physical dependence to alprazolam. These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms; the most important is seizure (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE). Even after relatively short-term use at the doses recommended for the treatment of transient anxiety and anxiety disorder

(ie, 0.75 to 4.0 mg per day), there is some risk of dependence. Spontaneous reporting system data suggest that the risk of dependence and its severity appear to be greater in patients treated with doses greater than 4 mg/day and for long periods (more than 12 weeks). However, in a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients, the duration of treatment

(3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose. In contrast, patients treated with doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day had more difficulty tapering to zero dose than those treated with less than 4 mg/day.

### Alprazolam (Niravam) [^115ky3Ka]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

While the severity and incidence of withdrawal phenomena appear to be related to dose and duration of treatment, withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, have been reported after only brief therapy with alprazolam at doses within the recommended range for the treatment of anxiety (eg, 0.75 to 4 mg/day). Signs and symptoms of withdrawal are often more prominent after rapid decrease of dosage or abrupt discontinuance. The risk of withdrawal seizures may be increased at doses above 4 mg/day (see WARNINGS).

Patients, especially individuals with a history of seizures or epilepsy, should not be abruptly discontinued from any CNS depressant agent, including alprazolam. It is recommended that all patients on NIRAVAM®who require a dosage reduction be gradually tapered under close supervision (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Psychological dependence is a risk with all benzodiazepines, including NIRAVAM®. The risk of psychological dependence may also be increased at doses greater than 4 mg/day and with longer term use, and this risk is further increased in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse. Some patients have experienced considerable difficulty in tapering and discontinuing from alprazolam, especially those receiving higher doses for extended periods. Addiction-prone individuals should be under careful surveillance when receiving NIRAVAM®. As with all anxiolytics, repeat prescriptions should be limited to those who are under medical supervision.

Controlled Substance Class

Alprazolam is a controlled substance under the Controlled Substance Act by the Drug Enforcement Administration and NIRAVAM®has been assigned to Schedule IV.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. (5.1, 7.1)
The use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Before prescribing alprazolam tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. (5.2)
Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of alprazolam tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam tablets or reduce the dosage. (2.2, 5.3)

The importance of dose and the risks of alprazolam as a treatment for panic disorder

Because the management of panic disorder often requires the use of average daily doses of alprazolam above 4 mg, the risk of dependence among panic disorder patients may be higher than that among those treated for less severe anxiety. Experience in randomized placebo-controlled discontinuation studies of patients with panic disorder showed a high rate of rebound and withdrawal symptoms in patients treated with alprazolam compared to placebo-treated patients.

Relapse or return of illness was defined as a return of symptoms characteristic of panic disorder (primarily panic attacks) to levels approximately equal to those seen at baseline before active treatment was initiated. Rebound refers to a return of symptoms of panic disorder to a level substantially greater in frequency, or more severe in intensity than seen at baseline. Withdrawal symptoms were identified as those which were generally not characteristic of panic disorder and which occurred for the first time more frequently during discontinuation than at baseline.

In a controlled clinical trial in which 63 patients were randomized to alprazolam and where withdrawal symptoms were specifically sought, the following were identified as symptoms of withdrawal: heightened sensory perception, impaired concentration, dysosmia, clouded sensorium, paresthesias, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, diarrhea, blurred vision, appetite decrease, and weight loss. Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation, but it could not be determined if they were due to return of illness, rebound, or withdrawal.

Metabolism/Elimination

Alprazolam is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), to two major metabolites in the plasma: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. A benzophenone derived from alprazolam is also found in humans. Their half-lives appear to be similar to that of alprazolam. The plasma concentrations of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam relative to unchanged alprazolam concentration were always less than 4%. The reported relative potencies in benzodiazepine receptor binding experiments and in animal models of induced seizure inhibition are 0.20 and 0.66, respectively, for 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. Such low concentrations and the lesser potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam suggest that they are unlikely to contribute much to the pharmacological effects of alprazolam. The benzophenone metabolite is essentially inactive.

Alprazolam and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^11276jHZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Alprazolam-specific considerations highlight that alprazolam tends to be more difficult to taper because it is short-acting and has no active metabolites; as such, clinicians may consider transitioning patients currently taking alprazolam to a longer-acting BZD for the taper, although alprazolam may exhibit higher cross-tolerance with other BZDs and some patients may have challenges with this transition; when patients have significant withdrawal symptoms in response to the transition to an alternative BZD, clinicians should typically transition patients back to their original BZD medication.

Conclusions

This paper reports the first study looking at alprazolam-related deaths in the UK. It provides hard facts about the number of alprazolam deaths, that is, as an indicator of the extent of the problem in terms of its worst outcome, and the ways in which alprazolam contributed to deaths. The main themes emerging are outlined below.

Misuse and recreational use of alprazolam are still prevalent. More individuals are becoming dependent on the drug and are seeking treatment. This phenomenon is reflected in the number of deaths where alprazolam is implicated with other substances. On the other hand, alprazolam is only rarely implicated as the sole substance in drug-poisoning death; it is a relatively safe medication when used as indicated. However, it would be helpful, in the UK context, if there was a mechanism in place to collate data on alprazolam scripts from second and tertiary care, as well as of private prescriptions.

There are several key messages emerging from this which, mainly, underline what some of the existing literature has suggested. When deciding whether to give a patient a script for alprazolam, prescribers should consider any history of substance abuse, especially of prescribed medications; polysubstance use; other medications prescribed, especially CNS depressants; suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Pharmacists dispensing the drug can monitor amounts supplied so that excessive quantities for those at risk of suicide are avoided and supervise consumption in in-patient settings. There is a clear need to improve the training of specialists and to highlight possible flaws in current teaching pathways, identify the main benefits and disadvantages regarding current use of benzodiazepines in clinical practice. More direct evidence of the extent of the deaths needs to be brought to the attention of prescribers, treatment providers, emergency department doctors and clinical toxicologists. This could be achieved through brief communications via professional journals or perhaps specific alerts/announcements/briefings from agencies such as Public Health Scotland, Public Health England, etc.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendations for Considerations for Tapering Benzodiazepines

Clinicians should ideally assess the risks and benefits of ongoing BZD prescribing at least every 3 months for each patient taking BZD medications (see Tables 2 and 3; Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a At a minimum, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits with each new BZD prescription or BZD prescription renewal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). b Clinicians should review the information in the relevant prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) as part of the risk–benefit assessment (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Table 2
Potential Benefits and Risks of Continued BZD Use and BZD Tapering

Numbers of drugs and substance types involved

The mean number of substances involved in Scottish alprazolam-related deaths was 4.77 (SD 1.821).reported the mean number of drugs implicated in alprazolam-related deaths was 2.9 (SD 1.0), higher than the 2.3 (SD 1.3) in non-alprazolam cases.reported an average of 2.3 additional drugs in alprazolam-related deaths.

There were only two (0.55%) Scottish deaths where alprazolam was the only substance involved in the death (Table 3). No deaths in Northern Ireland have involved alprazolam on its own, although in one instance in 2019 a death also implicated alcohol without any other substances (personal communication to JC from NISRA, 2 March 2022).recorded that alprazolam alone was implicated in only 5/193 (2.6%) alprazolam-related deaths.reported that only two deaths were attributed to alprazolam alone in 178 post-mortem findings.report that 95.5% of US alprazolam-related deaths involved both it and other drugs during 2010–2014; this increased to 96.2% in 2016. These findings confirm previous claims that alprazolam alone causes death very rarely.

Figure 1.
Study design.

Note: Participants enrolled in Part A received alprazolam and those in Part B received ethanol. Alprazolam 1 mg, ethanol (males: 0.7 g/kg; females: 0.6 g/kg), or matching placebo was administered as a single dose on days 1, 5, and 9 in each period.

The dose levels of alprazolam and ethanol administered in this study were consistent with those shown to impair performance across a range of cognitive tests in healthy adults. Alprazolam and ethanol (or matching placebos) were each administered so that the approximate time of maximum systemic concentrations would coincide with the time of zuranolone maximum systemic concentrations. For both parts, zuranolone or matching placebo was administered at baseline (0 h). In Part A, alprazolam (or matching placebo) was administered 4 h after zuranolone (or matching placebo), and in Part B, ethanol (or matching placebo) was administered 4.5 h following zuranolone (or matching placebo) administration.

Parts A and B were conducted at separate study sites. Participants, site personnel (except pharmacist or qualified designee), and the sponsor were blinded to the treatment sequence. Randomization schedules for each part were generated by an independent statistician and provided to the site pharmacist or designee to facilitate the preparation and dispensation of the study drug. The randomization schedules were kept confidential and accessible only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding. The study was unblinded after the database had been locked.

Participants

Participants could be enrolled in either Part A or Part B but not both. Following the screening and completion of the informed consent form, patients fulfilling prespecified eligibility criteria were randomized to the treatment sequence. Eligible participants were adults aged ⩾18 years for Part A (⩾21 years for Part B) and considered by the investigator to be in good general health. Key exclusion criteria included a history of suicidal behavior within 24 months or, in the opinion of the investigator, risk of suicide based on their answers to questions on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at screening. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in the.

Background:

The benzodiazepine drug alprazolam, a fast-acting tranquiliser, cannot be prescribed on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. Illicit alprazolam supply and consumption have increased. Concern about increasing numbers of alprazolam-related fatalities started circulating in 2018. However, statistics on this issue are very limited. This study examined patterns in such mortality in Scotland.

Methods:

Statistics on deaths where alprazolam was mentioned in the 'cause of death' were obtained from official mortality registers. Anonymised Scottish case-level data were obtained. Data were examined in respect of the characteristics of decedents and deaths using descriptive statistics.

Results:

Scotland registered 370 deaths in 2004–2020; 366 of these occurred in 2015–2020: most involved males (77.1%); mean age 39.0 (SD 12.6) years. The principal underlying cause of death was accidental poisoning: opiates/opioids (77.9%); sedatives/hypnotics (15.0%). Two deaths involved alprazolam alone. Main drug groups implicated: opiates/opioids (94.8%), 'other benzodiazepines' (67.2%), gabapentinoids (42.9%), stimulants (30.1%), antidepressants (15.0%). Two-thirds (64.2%) involved combinations of central nervous system (CNS) depressants.

Discussion:

Alprazolam-related deaths are likely due to an increasing illicit supply. The fall in deaths in 2019–2020 is partially due to increased use of designer benzodiazepines. Treatment for alprazolam dependence is growing. Clinicians need to be aware of continuing recreational alprazolam use. When such consumption occurs with CNS depressants, overdose and death risks increase.

Conclusions:

More awareness of alprazolam contributing to deaths, especially in conjunction with other CNS depressants, is needed by consumers and clinicians. Improved monitoring of illicit supplies could identify emerging issues of medicines' abuse.

ASCO antiemetics guideline — breakthrough nausea and vomiting: For breakthrough symptoms, clinicians should re-evaluate emetic risk, disease status, concurrent illnesses, and medications and ensure the best regimen for the emetic risk is being given (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Adults with persistent symptoms who did not receive olanzapine prophylactically should be offered olanzapine in addition to the standard antiemetic regimen (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). If symptoms persist despite prior olanzapine, adults may be offered a drug of a different class (eg, an NK1 receptor antagonist, lorazepam or alprazolam, a dopamine receptor antagonist, dronabinol, or nabilone) in addition to the standard regimen (Type: informal consensus; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate for dronabinol and nabilone, low otherwise; Strength of recommendation: moderate).

Abuse potential

Although typically taken orally, whether as tablets or crushed and swallowed as a 'bomb' or 'parachute' there are also some reports of alprazolam being taken in other ways: injection, snorted or sublingually on a blotter. Alprazolam is also offered for sale online in powder form and is even used in UK penal establishments.

Medically recommended therapeutic doses for short-term use in anxiety are 0.25–0.50 mg three times daily. Recreational doses suggested on drug user fora are typically much higher: light (0.25 mg), common (0.5–1.5 mg), strong (2 mg), heavy (3 mg).

Alprazolam is described by recreational users as less stimulating but more euphoric than etizolam, more stimulating and equally euphoric as diazepam, but shorter-acting and more sedating than either of them. Physical effects associated with the molecules use include "feelings of pleasure, relaxation and bodily comfort, disinhibition and reduction in anxiety".

Alprazolam may also be used to assist in dealing with dysphoria 'bad trips' resulting from hallucinogenic/psychedelic drug use (attendant distress or panic); 'come-down' effects of stimulant use (insomnia and agitation); enhancing the effects of other depressant drugs; enhancing the dissociative effects of drugs like ketamine or even generating a synergistic result with cannabis.

As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam has the potential for physical and psychological dependence and misuse amongst those prescribed it. Its high-binding affinity, rapid onset of effect and potency (up to 20 times that of diazepam) makes abuse more attractive to those not prescribed it. Alprazolam appears more likely to be misused by those prescribed it with a substance use disorder history. It is preferred over other benzodiazepines by those who use alcohol and opioids as it is considered more 'rewarding' and boosting their effects.

Discussion

This section looks at the main issues emerging from the above analyses. Comparisons are made, where possible, with other relevant research findings.

Trends in numbers of alprazolam-related deaths over time

There is no comprehensive international overview of alprazolam deaths over time. To see how Scotland and the United Kingdom fit more generally into the wider picture, we have attempted to provide an overview, based on published papers available to us.

The first death involving alprazolam reported in the international literature appears to have occurred in 1983–1984. This mention was followed by several papers in following years, usually dealing with a sole case report or small case-series reports (e.g.;). These were typically related to the use of alprazolam in conjunction with other substances (typically opioids), although one case report concerns a death associated with withdrawal from alprazolam.

The first large-scale studies identifying alprazolam-related deaths started in the early 2000s, but were chiefly concerned with documenting deaths from all drugs, other drug classes, psychotropic drugs or benzodiazepines, with such deaths being incidentally uncovered. On the other hand, some studies had alprazolam deaths as their primary focus. In addition, some studies have looked at the toxicity of alprazolam compared to other drugs, benzodiazepines, other antidepressants or 'z' drugs.

Overall, deaths from the consumption of alprazolam alone are thought to be rare. Consumption of the medication with other CNS depressants, such as alcohol, other benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids and opiates/opioids, increases the likelihood of overdose through respiratory depression.

### How high can patients get on CBD? [^113xrgps]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

The regulatory environment surrounding cannabidiol (CBD) has been particularly complex and confusing. As CBD is an extract of the Cannabis plant, it is a schedule I compound at the federal level and is illegal except for the one approved product (Epidiolex) that has been placed in schedule V. Cannabidiol is a phytocannabinoid, the same drug class as delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is a psychoactive constituent of marijuana. Cannabidiol is not thought to be psychotropic and has a different side effect profile compared to THC. These dissimilarities are thought to be attributed to differences in binding of THC and CBD to cannabinoid receptors.

The paper by Schoedel et al presents the results from a study that employs the typical design for a drug liability study. The design was a single-dose, randomized, double-blinded, crossover study consisting of 4 parts including a screening phase, qualification phase, treatment phase, and follow-up period. Interestingly, as most pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies exclude patients who are drug abusers, this is not the case for a study with a goal of determining the drug abuse potential of a particular compound. In fact, the goal of the qualification phase is to recruit known drug users using certain criteria that verify a minimum threshold of drug use. Inclusion of individuals with experience with particular classes of drugs allows a reliable comparison of the drug being tested to drugs already known to possess particular traits that are considered positive for drug users. For this study, the choices of positive control were based on drug class, with alprazolam being noted to have similarities in pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetic profile to CBD. Due to similarities of THC and CBD and presence of both in plant extracts, a synthetic THC was a logical choice for comparison in order to isolate effects of CBD only. For the qualification phase, enrolled patients were given single doses of positive control drug and placebo. Patients who rated these compounds above placebo in various tests were invited for the treatment phase of the study. Out of 95 patients taking part in the qualification phase, 43 were able to continue to the treatment phase.

Hot Topics Symposium: New and Emerging Treatments for Epilepsy and their Rational Approach

Michael R. Sperling, MD, Elinor Ben Menachem, MD, PhD

Emilio Perucca, MD, PhD, focused on the rational use of anticonvulsant medication and reviewed a systematic approach to sequencing and combining antiepileptic medications. Given the extensive choice of treatments, an evidence-based systematic approach is important when treating patients. The literature contains a number of comparative studies, though more evidence is needed, particularly when planning polytherapy. Different clinical scenarios were provided to illustrate his approach, and he highlighted areas in which further knowledge must be obtained. This approach to therapy, which is driven by data and experience, offers a masterful way to treat epilepsy.

The second lecture, given by Dennis Dlugos, MD, "What's in the Pipeline? Newly Approved and Almost Ready Antiepileptic Drugs" provided a review of both recently approved medications (stiripentol and cannabidiol) and drugs that are presently in the pipeline, but anticipated to enter the clinical arena. Professor Dlugos reviewed pivotal trial data, both with regard to efficacy and adverse effects. Pipeline drugs show promise for both generalized and focal epilepsy. It is hoped that the information provided in this lecture will enable the practicing physician to integrate the use of these agents into practice once they are available.

The third lecture, delivered by Barbara Dworetzky, MD, reviewed rescue therapy, with a particular focus on new and emerging treatments. Trials have been conducted employing several benzodiazepines, including diazepam, midazolam, and alprazolam. These new therapies may be administered intranasally, or in the case of alprazolam, by inhalation, though the latter agent has only recently entered the trial phase. Professor Dworetzky reviewed the pharmacology and trial results; these preparations do not require rectal administration and may prove a popular choice by patients and their families when rescue is needed.

The final lecture, given by Jukka Peltola, MD, reviewed deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for intractable epilepsy. This therapy was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, but has been in use in Europe since 2011. Professor Peltola reviewed both clinical trial data and the European clinical experience, and proposed suitable indications for employing this therapy.

### Acute administration of alprazolam, alcohol and their combination on cognitive performance and mood: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113dk8CB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

The current study presents some limitations. Firstly, our findings may have limited generalisability to clinical populations as we focused on investigating the effects of alcohol and alprazolam on cognitive performance in a non-clinical sample. Clinical populations, who are more likely to be prescribed alprazolam, may exhibit different effects due to underlying mental health conditions or variations in drug metabolism. Secondly, our study specifically focused on the immediate effects of alcohol and alprazolam without considering the long-term or cumulative effects of their combined usage on cognitive function. Research has shown that long-term users of benzodiazepines may experience cognitive impairment even after discontinuation of the medication. This suggests that the co-consumption of alcohol and benzodiazepines remains risky regardless of long-term use, due to the potential for drug–drug interactions that may not be readily anticipated by individuals engaging in such behaviour. In addition, it is worth noting that all of our individual tests were of short duration, lasting between one and a half to 4 min, which might have reduced sensitivity to the impact of alcohol. By contrast, more extended and complex cognitive assessments may better identify subtle alcohol-induced impairments or declines in vigilance that our chosen tasks did not capture.

A 1 mg therapeutic dose of alprazolam, whether taken alone or in combination with alcohol, significantly impaired cognitive function, with the most pronounced effects observed 100 min post-consumption. While laboratory tests may not directly reflect specific real-world task performance, they provide valuable insights into the effects of drugs on various cognitive and behavioural components involved in everyday tasks. It is important to assess different aspects of cognitive performance to identify critical cognitive processes vulnerable to impairment by commonly consumed substances. Future research should investigate varying doses and administration timings of alcohol and benzodiazepines on cognitive performance, as well as explore the potential impact of chronic alcohol and benzodiazepine use, including tolerance and sensitisation effects. Although we did not identify an interactive or additive effect of alcohol and alprazolam, our findings that a therapeutic or moderate dose of alprazolam impaired all aspects of cognitive performance holds valuable implications, especially considering the prevalence of non-medical use. This highlights the potential risks associated with the widespread use of alprazolam and the need for further research and awareness regarding its cognitive effects. These findings also have significant implications for public health and the development of policies and guidelines regarding the use of prescription medication and alcohol, considering their potential impact on cognitive impairment in daily activities.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111HaPj4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk by dose, duration, and frequency (Table 3) — clinical consensus estimates indicate that with any duration and ≤ 3 days per week the risk is no; with < 1 month and ≥ 4 days per week the risk is lower risk, but possible; with 1–3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at low total daily dose the risk is lower risk, but possible, whereas at moderate to high dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration; with ≥ 3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at any dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration. A low daily dose is estimated as 10 mg diazepam equivalents or less (e.g., ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam, ≤ 2 mg lorazepam, ≤ 1 mg alprazolam), a moderate daily dose is estimated as 10–15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., 0.5–1.5 mg clonazepam, 2–3 mg lorazepam, 1–2 mg alprazolam), and a high daily dose is estimated as more than 15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., > 1.5 mg clonazepam, > 3 mg lorazepam, > 2 mg alprazolam).

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^112cwr2w]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

When BZD are used for anxiety related disorders, there is a clear consensus among most documents to restrict their use to the 'short-term' (often unspecified in terms of duration) but most commonly for less than 4 weeks. Interestingly, alprazolam which has become noticeably more problematic in terms of misuse or harm based on real world data over the past two decades, is still over-represented as a BZD of choice in many guidance documents. This is no doubt attributable to the larger abundance of earlier randomised controlled trial data compared to some other BZDs for conditions such as PD. However, real world evidence of harm via overdose and diversion trends should be considered in framing future recommendations on BZD selection. For instance, some newer documents specifically advise against the use of alprazolam given its rapid onset and shorter-half life; pharmacokinetic properties that increase its potential for withdrawal and misuse. Other major BZD that were prominently represented were diazepam, lorazepam and, especially; clonazepam which has more long-term use data from clinical trials, particularly in PD.

Another area of clear heterogeneity in guidance was in the dosing pattern recommended. Some major guidelines advise regular scheduled dosing of BZD for common anxiety disorders. In contrast, other documents advise 'prn' use or intermittent dosing. How prescriptions are issued and used in real world medical practice can have profound effects on the development of tolerance or dependence for individuals with these conditions and so this is an area where further clarity could be achieved within future guidelines. This is especially important because recent observational research indicates potentially safer outcomes with intermittent compared to chronic dosing.

Guidance for OCD and PTSD were comparatively limited, based on lack of positive evidence of benefit, and no documents clearly advised their use as first line pharmacologic options. Furthermore, the use of BZD in PTSD has been controversial and frequently ill-advised based on their proposed propensity to interfere with fear extinction in exposure therapy as well as potentiate the development of ongoing stress symptomatology in the aftermath of a traumatic event.

### Alprazolam-related deaths in scotland, 2004–2020 [^115bugNw]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Whilst the overall mean proportion of all drug-poisoning deaths accounted for by alprazolam during the period 2015–2020 was 0.664% in England and 0.833% in Wales, the corresponding figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland were 5.203% and 12.239%, respectively (see Table 5). Indeed, at the peak of alprazolam-related deaths registered in 2018, 1 in 10 and 1 in 6 of all drug-poisoning deaths in Scotland and Northern Ireland, respectively, were accounted for by this drug. Moreover, in 2019 this proportion increased to more than one in four in respect of Northern Ireland. These national differences reflect already recognised patterns in terms of higher rates of benzodiazepines being implicated in drug-poisoning deaths in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the much higher drug-poisoning death rate per 100,000 population in Scotland compared to other parts of the United Kingdom and Europe. However, the proportion of deaths in Northern Ireland accounted for by alprazolam is unexpectedly higher than one might expect in comparison with Scotland.

Fatal toxicity levels for alprazolam

Although this study did not have access to post-mortem toxicology levels in the Scottish alprazolam-related fatalities described here, some information on Scottish alprazolam-positive cases is available. This is presented here so readers have easy access to it. The mean concentration of alprazolam in 232 cases screened in 2016–2018 by the Forensic Toxicology Service, University of Glasgow, was 0.179 mg/L. The cases had a mean age of 39 years; 77% were males.

Further limited information has been published on fatal levels of alprazolam (Table 7).

Table 7.
Published post-mortem alprazolam toxicology levels.

Blood levels vary according to the way the researchers have categorised the role of alprazolam in the reported cases and the units used to present data; this makes comparisons very difficult. However, what we can state is that in the few cases where alprazolam was the sole drug causing death, a median value of 0.30 μg/g or 31.8 mg/L (and 0.45 mg/L in one case) was reported. This contrasts to deaths in which alprazolam was implicated with other substances where levels were mean 43.0 (range 4–130) ng/mL; median 0.16 μg/g or 16.96 mg/L.

give ante-mortem blood levels of 32.8 and 13.0 ng/mL for two alprazolam toxicity cases. By comparison, the ante-mortem serum levels of two unsuccessful suicide attempts involving alprazolam were reported as 350 and 341 ng/mL. Steady-state plasma levels following alprazolam therapy have been reported as being in the range of 20–55 ng/mL.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^114H6ebV]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Transitioning to a Longer-Acting Benzodiazepine

Existing CPGs disagree on whether patients who are currently taking a short-acting BZD (e.g. alprazolam) should be transitioned to a longer-acting BZD (e.g. clonazepam, diazepam) for the taper. Some existing guidance suggests that switching to a longer-acting BZD allows the body "to adjust slowly to a decreasing concentration of the BZD" and, therefore, reduces withdrawal symptoms. Conversely, switching to a longer-acting BZD may not be appropriate for patients who have contraindications (e.g. significant liver dysfunction) and/or are taking multiple medications due to a risk of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. The CGC suggested that the decision to switch to a longer-acting BZD should be patient-specific, and that clinicians should consider patients' liver function and concurrent medication use before making a recommendation to switch to a longer-acting formulation (see Box 5).

Box 5
Note of Caution: Sedative–Hypnotic Medications

Alprazolam tends to be difficult to taper given that it is short-acting and has no active metabolites. As such, clinicians may consider transitioning patients currently taking alprazolam to a longer-acting BZD for the taper. However, alprazolam may exhibit higher cross-tolerance with other BZDs, and some patients may have challenges with this transition. When patients have significant withdrawal symptoms in response to the transition to an alternative BZD, clinicians should typically transition patients back to their original BZD medication.

Appendix B compiles dose equivalents in the existing literature. It is important to emphasize that determining the equivalent dose of an alternative BZD is inexact and can vary across patients. Many conversion tools exist (e.g. online, mobile apps, in EHRs); however, unlike with opioid medications, no precise strategies for conversion exist. The widely available equivalent doses which were established based on the average doses of diazepam that patients have reported provide similar symptom management as the previously used BZD. As these equivalent doses were initially based on patient perception, patient experience should be considered when converting between agents. Some patients may require higher doses than the reported equivalent, while others may require lower doses. Transition to an alternative BZD may be more successful if the doses are slowly transitioned over 1–2 weeks rather than 1–2 days.

### The role of extended-release benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety: a risk-benefit evaluation with a focus on extended-release alprazolam [^114y6iso]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Immediate-release (IR) benzodiazepines have a short duration of therapeutic effect and are generally less effective for anxiety than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in reducing concomitant depressive symptomatology. Common criticisms of benzodiazepines also include the patient's tendency to develop a tolerance to the anxiolytic effect and a dependence on the drug itself. The newer extended-release (XR) benzodiazepine formulation was designed to increase efficacy, duration of therapeutic effect, tolerance, compliance, and ease of discontinuation. The XR benzodiazepine alprazolam has shown efficacy in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder comparable to the older benzodiazepine formulations. Pharmacokinetic data show that the XR formulation has a longer therapeutic effect compared with IR formulations, which reduces the potential for breakthrough anxiety symptoms. Data also indicate that the XR formulation has less abuse liability than the IR formulation. This article reviews the efficacy, safety, and discontinuation data from clinical trials of IR and XR benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders and provides guidelines to minimize the risk of withdrawal syndrome during benzodiazepine discontinuation.

### Drug therapy for anxiety in palliative care [^1126pLAa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety is common among patients with advanced disease. It can be a natural response to impending death, but may also result from an underlying anxiety disorder, pain, or other untreated or poorly managed symptoms.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to identify and evaluate studies examining medications used to treat patients suffering from anxiety during the terminal phases of disease.

Search Strategy

We searched the following sources: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2003), EMBASE (1980 to July 2003), CINAHL (1982 to July 2003), PsycLit (1974 to July 2003), PsycInfo (1990 to July 2003), and the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2003) for literature pertaining to this topic published in any language using a detailed search strategy.

Selection Criteria

Prospective, randomized trials with or without blinding involving the use of pharmacological agents for the treatment of anxiety at the end of life were sought.

Data Collection and Analysis

Six potential studies were identified by the search strategy but none met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Two of these studies assessed the effectiveness of alprazolam in patients with a diagnosis of cancer, but who would not be considered in the end-stage of life.

Main Results

No data were available to enable an assessment to be made of the effectiveness of drugs to treat anxiety in palliative care patients.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There remains insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for anxiety in terminally ill patients. To date no studies were found that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Prospective controlled clinical trials are necessary in order to establish the benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of anxiety in palliative care.

### Does oral alprazolam affect ventilation? A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113MaESN]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

The respiratory effects of benzodiazepines have been controversial. This investigation aimed to study the effects of oral alprazolam on ventilation. In a randomised, double-blind cross-over protocol, 20 healthy men ingested 1 mg of alprazolam or placebo in random order, 1 week apart. Ventilation was unobtrusively monitored by inductance plethysmography along with end-tidal PCO₂ and pulse oximetry 60–160 min after drug intake. Subjects were encouraged to keep their eyes open. Mean ± SD minute ventilation 120 min after alprazolam and placebo was similar (6.21 ± 0.71 vs 6.41 ± 1.12 L/min, P = NS). End-tidal PCO(2) and oxygen saturation did also not differ between treatments. However, coefficients of variation of minute ventilation after alprazolam exceeded those after placebo (43 ± 23% vs 31 ± 13%, P < 0.05). More encouragements to keep the eyes open were required after alprazolam than after placebo (5.2 ± 5.7 vs 1.3 ± 2.3 calls, P < 0.05). In a multiple regression analysis, higher coefficients of variation of minute ventilation after alprazolam were related to a greater number of calls. Oral alprazolam in a mildly sedative dose has no clinically relevant effect on ventilation in healthy, awake men. The increased variability of ventilation on alprazolam seems related to vigilance fluctuations rather than to a direct drug effect on ventilation.

### Alprazolam (Niravam) [^116MXRoF]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Drug-Drug Interactions

Alprazolam is primarily eliminated by metabolism via cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Most of the interactions that have been documented with alprazolam are with drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A4.

Compounds that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A would be expected to increase plasma alprazolam concentrations. Drug products that have been studied in vivo, along with their effect on increasing alprazolam AUC, are as follows: ketoconazole, 3.98 fold; itraconazole, 2.70 fold; nefazodone, 1.98 fold; fluvoxamine, 1.96 fold; and erythromycin, 1.61 fold (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS–Drug Interactions).

CYP3A inducers would be expected to decrease alprazolam concentrations and this has been observed in vivo. The oral clearance of alprazolam (given in a 0.8 mg single dose) was increased from 0.90 ± 0.21 mL/min/kg to 2.13 ± 0.54 mL/min/kg and the elimination t₁/₂ was shortened (from 17.1 ± 4.9 to 7.7 ± 1.7 h) following administration of 300 mg/day carbamazepine for

10 days (see PRECAUTIONS–Drug Interactions). However, the carbamazepine dose used in this study was fairly low compared to the recommended doses (1000–1200 mg/day); the effect at usual carbamazepine doses is unknown.

The ability of alprazolam to induce or inhibit human hepatic enzyme systems has not been determined. However, this is not a property of benzodiazepines in general. Further, alprazolam did not affect the prothrombin or plasma warfarin levels in male volunteers administered sodium warfarin orally.

### Alprazolam-related deaths in scotland, 2004–2020 [^114z4JCm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Those prescribed alprazolam or individuals considering acquiring it illicitly for recreational purpose should be aware of the dangers of using the drug with other substances, especially opiates/opioids and other benzodiazepines. Recreational users should be aware that tablets sold as Xanax may contain a variable amount of alprazolam (if any) as well as potentially fatal cutting agents. Public health alerts by NHS agencies and the police were aimed at both clinicians and drug users. More targeted education of drug users via social media, treatment providers could be initiated. The benzodiazepine street market has been transformed, not just in Scotland but elsewhere, in less than 10 years from one based on diversion of prescription drugs to 'designer benzos'. This has increased the 'risk environment' for benzodiazepine users, making it more difficult to minimise harms.

Future research in the UK context should look at alprazolam-related deaths in relation to prescribing and treatment history, previous substance abuse and mental health history. This would entail using appropriate information from coronial investigations as employed by the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths or linked databases as in the case of the Scottish Drug-Related Deaths Database. Toxicological data would also be available from such sources to investigate what levels of alprazolam were considered fatal, on their own and in combination with other substances, and how that compares with other research findings outlined above.

It is also important to understand the factors that may have been at work in causing the fall in alprazolam-related deaths recorded in 2019 and 2020, and in the provisional data for 2021 available to the lead author. This would help public health officials, clinicians and others get an insight into what factors can be addressed for outbreaks that may happen with other drugs in the future.

Additional advice for panic disorder patients

The use of alprazolam at doses greater than 4 mg/day, often necessary to treat panic disorder, is accompanied by risks that you need to carefully consider. When used at doses greater than

4 mg/day, which may or may not be required for your treatment, alprazolam has the potential to cause severe emotional and physical dependence in some patients and these patients may find it exceedingly difficult to terminate treatment. In two controlled trials of 6 to 8 weeks duration where the ability of patients to discontinue medication was measured, 7 to 29% of patients treated with alprazolam did not completely taper off therapy. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients, the patients treated with doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day had more difficulty tapering to zero dose than patients treated with less than 4 mg/day. In all cases, it is important that your physician help you discontinue this medication in a careful and safe manner to avoid overly extended use of alprazolam.

In addition, the extended use at doses greater than 4 mg/day appears to increase the incidence and severity of withdrawal reactions when alprazolam is discontinued. These are generally minor but seizure can occur, especially if you reduce the dose too rapidly or discontinue the medication abruptly. Seizure can be life-threatening.

Laboratory Tests

Laboratory tests are not ordinarily required in otherwise healthy patients. However, when treatment is protracted, periodic blood counts, urinalysis, and blood chemistry analyses are advisable in keeping with good medical practice.

Use with Other CNS Depressants

If NIRAVAM®is to be combined with other psychotropic agents or anticonvulsant drugs, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed, particularly with compounds which might potentiate the action of benzodiazepines. The benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, produce additive CNS depressant effects when co-administered with other psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistaminics, ethanol and other drugs which themselves produce CNS depression.

Drugs Effecting Salivary Flow and Stomach pH

Because NIRAVAM®disintegrates in the presence of saliva and the formulation requires an acidic environment to dissolve, concomitant drugs or diseases that cause dry mouth or raise stomach pH might slow disintegration or dissolution, resulting in slowed or decreased absorption.

### Effects of antecedent GABAA activation with alprazolam on counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia in healthy humans [^115Ss7To]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

The dose of alprazolam (1 mg before each of two glucose clamps) used in the present study was relatively modest. In the U.S. the drug is approved to be used up to a dose of 10 mg daily. The present study dose of alprazolam was typical of usual starting doses, which range from 0.5 to 1 mg three times a day. However, we do want to point out that the present study was not a clinical outcomes study. We were using alprazolam as a specific pharmacologic probe for GABA A activation. As a result of to the present study design, we cannot comment whether higher (or lower) doses of day 1 alprazolam would have had greater or lesser effects on day 2 counterregulatory responses. It should also be noted that although alprazolam has a quick onset of action reaching maximum levels within 1–2 h, the plasma half-life is longer with a typical duration of 9–11 h. Thus, as day 2 hypoglycemia was induced ∼21 h after the last administration of alprazolam, it is possible that the day 1 administration of the drug still resulted in some acute effects during subsequent (day 2) hypoglycemia. However, what is clear from the present study is that submaximal activation of GABA A receptors can result in rapid and widespread downregulation of subsequent homeostatic responses to hypoglycemia in healthy man.

In summary, this study has demonstrated that prior activation of GABA A receptors by alprazolam can produce a spectrum of reduced ANS (adrenomedullary, direct sympathetic nerve activity, and parasympathetic nervous system), neuroendocrine (growth hormone and glucagon), and metabolic (endogenous glucose production, lipolysis, and glycogenolysis) counterregulatory responses during next-day hypoglycemia. We conclude that prior activation of GABA A pathways can play an important role in regulating a number of key physiologic responses to subsequent hypoglycemia in healthy man. Further studies are required to determine whether GABA A receptors exert similar effects in individuals with diabetes.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115x2gNR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g. less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, some will experience significant withdrawal symptoms. Similarly, some patients who have been taking BZDs at a low dose for an intermediate amount of time (e.g. 6 weeks) may not be physically dependent. Defining strict thresholds for the risk of physical dependence and withdrawal is difficult because many factors beyond the dose and duration of BZD use impact risk, including age, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, the pharmacological properties of the given BZD, other medication and substance use, and prior history of withdrawal, among others.

Table 3 summarizes the risk of withdrawal by dose, duration, and frequency of BZD use. While no direct evidence was found for predicting risk of withdrawal, the CGC agreed that these factors were most salient in the determination. Clinicians should consider this information in the context of each patient's presentation when determining if patients are likely to be physically dependent and tapering is indicated. It should be noted that alprazolam — which is unique in having a very short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no active metabolites — tends to be associated with a more rapid onset of physical dependence. Therefore, a taper may be appropriate for patients taking this medication daily, even for a short duration (e.g. 2–4 weeks).

If physical dependence is difficult to determine, clinicians should elicit information from patients regarding any concerns about discontinuation or preferences for tapering. Clinicians should gather information about each patient's likelihood for physical dependence and risk of withdrawal, including asking if they have experienced withdrawal symptoms following missed doses in the past. Clinicians should also ask patients about any past experiences with withdrawal symptoms associated with tapering or discontinuing BZDs, especially adverse events such as seizures. Determining use of alcohol is also important, particularly if patients engage in ongoing daily alcohol use or have experienced severe withdrawal from alcohol or other substances in the past; slower and/or alternate tapering strategies may be indicated in these situations. If SUD may be present, clinicians should consider consulting addiction specialists, when possible.

If physical dependence is unlikely and the decision is made to discontinue the BZD without a taper, clinicians should educate patients about potential withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms that may occur and encourage patients to report these symptoms. If patients report significant symptoms, clinicians can consider initiating a taper.

### Alprazolam-related deaths in scotland, 2004–2020 [^112HM3a8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Substantial falls occurred in both 2019 and 2020 (to 172 and 90, respectively). The number of deaths registered in England continued to rise in 2019, albeit at a slower rate, but fell back in 2020. Wales experienced a levelling-off in the last couple of years. The number of deaths in Northern Ireland reached a new peak in 2019 before falling back to 2017 levels in 2020. By contrast, Scotland has experienced rapid falls since 2018, although still above the level recorded in 2016.

The falls in the numbers of alprazolam-related deaths in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland may well have been offset by increasing number of cases registered in 2019 and 2020 involving flualprazolam and other designer benzodiazepines, especially etizolam (e.g. see). There have been some local initiatives in Scotland alerting prescribers, clinicians and users of alprazolam about its potential lethality, especially in conjunction with other CNS depressants. Examples include, with similar alerts issued in England. However, the timing of such releases is difficult to map onto the patterns in fatalities. These initiatives may have had an impact on drug users. That said, similar warnings about designer benzodiazepines do not appear to have had the desired impact. COVID-19 could have played a part in the decreasing role of alprazolam in drug-related deaths, for example, by lockdown measures limiting access to illicit supplies or to prescribed benzodiazepines, or reduced access to treatment leading to self-medication with substitute drugs. Further investigation is warranted into the fall in alprazolam-related deaths.

5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam tablets, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing alprazolam tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of alprazolam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of alprazolam tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

5.3 Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.

Acute Withdrawal Reactions

The continued use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of alprazolam tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including XANAX, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing XANAX and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including XANAX, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of XANAX after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life‑threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue XANAX or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Acute administration of alprazolam, alcohol and their combination on cognitive performance and mood: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115mkgHq]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Studies that have investigated their combined use offer inconsistent findings, with some studies suggesting an additive or possibly synergistic effect when used in combination while others have found no such interaction. Given that as many as 88% of benzodiazepine users report the additional consumption of alcohol, and 28% indicate intentional combined use, there is an urgent need for a more comprehensive understanding of the combined effects on cognitive functioning. This study aimed to build upon existing research by employing a robust within-subject, randomised, placebo-controlled design to directly compare the acute effects of a moderate dose of alcohol and 1 mg of alprazolam, alone and in combination, on cognitive performance. Addressing this gap is essential for informing clinical practise, public health policies and preventative interventions.

### High-potency benzodiazepines: recent clinical results [^113g5BCM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

As high-potency benzodiazepines, essentially alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam, have been used to treat anxiety disorders for almost 2 decades, most efficacy and safety data appeared several years ago. The release of new formulations of 2 of them, clonazepam and alprazolam, invites review of these broadly effective anxiolytics. Clonazepam has recently become available in a lyophilized wafer that disintegrates when exposed to saliva and enhances ease of administration without altering its pharmacology, as shown by bioequivalence studies. Two U.S. multicenter trials carried out in the 1990s, among others, have provided strong confirmatory evidence for the use of clonazepam in panic disorder. Other recently published data on clonazepam pertain to its use as augmentation therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and in the prevention of recurrences of major depressive disorder. A new, extended-release formulation of alprazolam now allows for once-daily rather than t.i.d. or q.i.d. dosing. With extended release, the blood drug concentrations of alprazolam remain within the therapeutic window for several hours, which should reduce fluctuation in therapeutic effect and curb the clock-watching phenomenon between doses. The literature concerning the use of this new formulation of alprazolam in panic disorder is reviewed.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^114ZMfVy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Anxiolytics — anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines, should not be used to treat tinnitus, because clinical trials do not consistently show benefit. These medications can have adverse effects, particularly in the elderly, unless dosing is carefully monitored and tailored with drug holidays. Evidence is mixed: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of alprazolam showed decreased tinnitus loudness, whereas another triple-blind randomized crossover trial using chlorpheniramine did not find a significant difference in THI or tinnitus loudness but did find a significant improvement on a visual analogue scale for tinnitus severity. A single-blind randomized study of 66 patients treated with diazepam, flurazepam, oxazepam, clonazepam, and carbamazepine showed improvement on a tinnitus visual analogue scale with oxazepam and clonazepam, but it did not assess tinnitus loudness or use validated questionnaires and subjects received more than 1 medication.

Effects of alprazolam

Bioavailability of alprazolam is high (80%), peak levels being achieved 1–2 h after oral administration. It is metabolised in the liver, largely by cytochrome P450 3A4. It has a half-life of 6–12 h; metabolites and remaining alprazolam being excreted in urine. Effects start within 20–40 min, with peak levels being achieved in 1–2 h. Recreational users report experiencing effects for 4–6 h, with residual effects lasting up to 12 h.

Alprazolam can cause a range of side-effects including central nervous system (CNS) depression, especially in conjunction with other substances such as opiates/opioids; withdrawal problems such as rebound anxiety, panic disorder and increased suicidal ideation and attempts. Alprazolam also gives rise to increased extracellular dopamine concentrations in the striatum and increased serotonin levels. Therefore, it appeals to recreational drug users. Xanax is the most counterfeited form of alprazolam.

### Comparison of prescribing patterns before and after implementation of a national policy to reduce inappropriate alprazolam prescribing in Australia [^116nKjn7]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Benzodiazepines have been a frequent target for policy interventions owing to long-standing evidence about overprescribing and misuse. A common approach used by third-party payers to reduce inappropriate use of prescribed medications is to restrict the conditions under which medications are reimbursed. While these policies have the potential to change the way in which medications are prescribed and used, they are relatively imprecise tools that can also lead to unintended consequences. Previous policy interventions targeting benzodiazepines have had mixed results, as they did not selectively target people who were inappropriately prescribing or misusing benzodiazepines. While policy interventions are often associated with a reduction in overall benzodiazepine use, these shifts in prescribing behavior often occur across the entire treated population and, in many cases, among people for whom use is considered appropriate. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in benzodiazepine harms due to their use in combination with opioids, which greatly increases the risk of fatal overdose.

Alprazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, is subsidized in Australia for treatment of panic disorder when other treatments have failed or are inappropriate. It is significantly more toxic than other benzodiazepinesbut with no demonstrable additional therapeutic benefit. It is also misused frequently by people who inject drugs, and commonly present in drug overdose. Concerns have been raised about inappropriately large pack sizes and tablet strengths, and in February 2017, in an attempt to reduce the inappropriate use of alprazolam, the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) delisted the 2-mg tablet strength from public subsidy, reduced the pack size from 50 tablets to 10 tablets, and eliminated refills. Therefore, we used an interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study to determine whether these changes to the public subsidy of alprazolam were associated with in changes in (1) overall prescribing and dispensing, (2) patterns of prescribing and person-level use, or (3) poisoning calls to a poison information center (PIC) involving alprazolam.

5.4 Effects on Driving and Operating Machinery

Because of its CNS depressant effects, patients receiving alprazolam tablets should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. For the same reason, patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs during treatment with alprazolam tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.5 Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome

Use of alprazolam tablets during later stages of pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate. Observe newborns for signs of sedation and neonatal withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.6 Interaction with Drugs that Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3A

The initial step in alprazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Drugs that inhibit this metabolic pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam.

Strong CYP3A Inhibitors

Alprazolam tablets are contraindicated in patients receiving strong inhibitors of CYP3A (such as azole antifungal agents), except ritonavir [see Contraindications (4)]. Ketoconazole and itraconazole have been shown in vivo to increase plasma alprazolam concentrations 3.98 fold and 2.70 fold, respectively.

Dosage adjustment is necessary when alprazolam tablets and ritonavir are initiated concomitantly or when ritonavir is added to a stable dosage of alprazolam tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Drugs demonstrated to be CYP3A inhibitors on the basis of clinical studies involving alprazolam: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, and cimetidine [see Drug Interaction (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and consider dose reduction of alprazolam tablets, as appropriate, during co-administration with these drugs.

5.7 Patients with Depression

Benzodiazepines may worsen depression. Panic disorder has been associated with primary and secondary major depressive disorders and increased reports of suicide among untreated patients. Consequently, appropriate precautions (e.g., limiting the total prescription size and increased monitoring for suicidal ideation) should be considered in patients with depression.
