## Question

A 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and recent abdominal surgery is admitted to the intensive care unit with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for the past week. On examination, he is confused and has a central venous catheter in place. Laboratory results show leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. The ICU team suspects sepsis, and invasive candidiasis is considered due to his risk factors.

According to current ESICM guidelines, what diagnostic steps should be taken to investigate invasive candidiasis in this patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic steps to investigate invasive candidiasis in a high-risk ICU patient, according to current ESICM-aligned guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical pretest probability and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the optimal blood culture strategy and its limitations. Next, I will examine non-culture biomarkers and molecular diagnostics, followed by targeted imaging for deep-seated disease. After that, I need to check ophthalmic screening and echocardiography. Finally, I will integrate antifungal stewardship and outline a practical, prioritized algorithm with explicit caveats and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the pretest probability and risk framing, because everything downstream depends on it. This patient has diabetes, recent abdominal surgery, a central venous catheter, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and is in septic shock with altered mentation, which together place him at high risk for invasive candidiasis and candidemia in the ICU setting, where mortality remains substantial and delays worsen outcomes [^04a68a81] [^fb4aaad4] [^62ed0a33].

> Wait, let me verify the blood culture strategy before jumping to non-culture tests. I should obtain 40–60 mL of blood across 2–3 sets from separate venipunctures, using lytic or mycosis bottles, and incubate for up to 5 days, because conventional cultures have limited sensitivity and slower time-to-positivity in ICU patients, and higher volume improves yield. I also need to ensure direct Gram staining of any positive bottle to visualize yeasts and guide early therapy [^b9b726a2] [^4b9d51a4] [^609f22c1].

> Hold on, I should verify species-level identification once yeast is recovered. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) is preferred for rapid, accurate species identification, with chromogenic agar as a useful adjunct to detect mixed infections and provide presumptive identification. If MALDI-TOF fails, sequencing can resolve identification, and all of this should be done promptly to inform antifungal selection and stewardship [^9a0f8f72] [^c2d4cc37] [^c6c8a8ee] [^95d97237].

> I need to check non-culture biomarkers next, but I must not overinterpret them. Serum β-D-glucan can be considered as an adjunct, yet multiple positives increase diagnostic certainty and a single positive should never trigger therapy alone. I should also remember that false positives occur and that serial testing can refine interpretation in the right clinical context [^62fecad0] [^963f4cea].

> Let me consider additional serologic tools cautiously. Mannan antigen and anti-mannan antibody can be considered in combination to improve diagnostic performance, but again, results must be integrated with clinical and microbiologic data rather than used in isolation, especially in ICU patients where specificity is imperfect [^6e89a2fb] [^963f4cea].

> Next, I should review molecular diagnostics. Direct-from-blood PCR assays, including T2Candida, can markedly shorten time-to-result and have higher sensitivity than culture in some settings, but I should confirm availability and local validation. Importantly, a negative T2Candida in a high-risk patient does not exclude disease, so results must be interpreted alongside cultures and clinical evolution [^8b1b0eb1] [^6154402c].

> I will now examine imaging for deep-seated disease, because candidemia often seeds organs. Abdominal ultrasound and contrast-enhanced CT are recommended to evaluate for hepatosplenic abscesses, intra-abdominal collections, and other foci. In patients with neurologic signs or persistent fever, brain MRI should be considered to assess for CNS involvement, and echocardiography is indicated to evaluate for endocarditis, particularly with persistent bacteremia or valvular disease [^77faf9a0] [^81144788] [^1170249d].

> But wait, what if ocular involvement is silently progressing? I should confirm that all patients with candidemia undergo a dilated fundoscopic examination within the first week to detect endophthalmitis, as early detection changes management and follow-up. This is a strong recommendation in current guidance and remains a key standard of care [^d7a5a028].

> Let me integrate antifungal stewardship principles, because diagnostic steps and therapy are intertwined. In septic shock with high-risk features, empiric echinocandin therapy is recommended while cultures are pending, with de-escalation or discontinuation if cultures and biomarkers are negative and the patient improves. I should also plan to remove or exchange the central venous catheter when feasible, as this reduces biofilm burden and persistent candidemia risk [^4e97552f] [^6eeeb74e].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical, prioritized algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Immediately obtain 2–3 high-volume blood culture sets with lytic bottles and request MALDI-TOF identification if yeast grows. Concurrently send serum β-D-glucan and consider mannan/anti-mannan if available. If the patient remains high risk with negative cultures, pursue T2Candida where available. Obtain abdominal imaging early for suspected intra-abdominal sources, add brain MRI for neurologic signs or persistent fever, and arrange echocardiography and fundoscopy for all with candidemia. Throughout, reassess daily and tailor therapy to culture and susceptibility results to support stewardship [^b9b726a2] [^62fecad0] [^77faf9a0] [^1170249d] [^d7a5a028].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to cite ESICM-specific guidance, but I should correct that. The most current, comprehensive recommendations for invasive candidiasis diagnostics come from the 2025 ECMM/ISHAM/ASM global guideline, which supersedes older ICU society statements and should be the primary reference for this diagnostic approach in critically ill adults [^4d937d69].

---

In a 56-year-old diabetic with recent abdominal surgery, sepsis, and a CVC, **obtain 2–3 sets of blood cultures (40–60 mL total) from separate venipunctures** [^b9b726a2] and **send serum β-D-glucan** [^62fecad0] to improve detection of candidemia. If cultures are negative but suspicion remains high, **consider T2Candida PCR** [^8b1b0eb1] for rapid species-level detection. Perform a **focused exam** for ocular involvement and **order an echocardiogram** to assess for endocarditis [^1170249d]. If deep-seated infection is suspected, obtain abdominal ultrasound or CT [^77faf9a0] and brain MRI as indicated [^notfound]. Do not rely on any single test; integrate clinical risk, cultures, β-D-glucan, and imaging to guide therapy [^963f4cea].

---

## Clinical assessment and risk stratification

A thorough clinical assessment and risk stratification are essential to guide diagnostic testing and management [^7b0db466]. The patient presents with **multiple risk factors** for invasive candidiasis, including diabetes mellitus, recent abdominal surgery, central venous catheterization, broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, and septic shock [^04a68a81]. These factors significantly increase the likelihood of invasive candidiasis and warrant a comprehensive diagnostic approach [^4e97552f].

---

## Blood cultures

Blood cultures remain the **gold standard** for diagnosing candidemia [^notfound]. The following steps are recommended:

- **Volume and number**: Obtain 2–3 sets of blood cultures, with a total volume of 40–60 mL, collected from separate venipunctures [^b9b726a2].

- **Incubation**: Incubate cultures for up to 5 days, as Candida species may require extended incubation for detection [^b9b726a2].

- **Direct microscopy**: Perform direct microscopy and Gram staining of positive blood cultures to visualize Candida organisms [^b9b726a2].

- **Species identification**: Identify Candida species using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) or other molecular methods to guide antifungal therapy [^9a0f8f72] [^95d97237].

---

## Non-culture-based diagnostic tests

Given the limited sensitivity of blood cultures (~40–50%) [^fb4aaad4], **non-culture-based tests** are recommended to improve diagnostic yield:

- **Beta-D-glucan assay**: Serum beta-D-glucan is a useful adjunctive test for candidemia and deep-seated invasive candidiasis. Multiple positive results increase diagnostic certainty, but results should be interpreted in clinical context and not used alone to initiate therapy [^62fecad0].

- **Mannan antigen and anti-mannan antibody**: These assays can provide additional diagnostic information, particularly in combination with clinical assessment and other biomarkers [^6e89a2fb].

- **T2Candida PCR**: This rapid molecular test can detect Candida species directly from whole blood within hours, offering high sensitivity and specificity. It is particularly useful in high-risk patients with negative blood cultures but persistent clinical suspicion [^8b1b0eb1].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is essential to detect deep-seated infections and complications. The following imaging modalities are recommended:

| **Clinical suspicion** | **Recommended imaging** |
|-|-|
| Hepatosplenic involvement | Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan [^77faf9a0] |
| CNS involvement | Brain MRI [^77faf9a0] |
| Endocarditis | Echocardiography (transthoracic or transesophageal) [^1170249d] |

---

## Ophthalmologic examination

All patients with suspected or confirmed candidemia should undergo a **dilated fundoscopic examination** within the first week of diagnosis to detect ocular involvement (endophthalmitis), which occurs in approximately 10–20% of cases [^d7a5a028].

---

## Sampling from suspected infection sites

If deep-seated infection is suspected, obtain samples from the affected site (e.g. abscess, peritoneal fluid, tissue) for **culture, histopathology, and molecular testing** to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy [^653c06d8] [^978cf0be].

---

## Integration of diagnostic findings

Diagnostic findings should be integrated with clinical assessment, risk factors, and patient response to therapy. No single diagnostic test is sufficient; a **multimodal approach** combining cultures, biomarkers, imaging, and clinical judgment is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^963f4cea].

---

## Summary of recommended diagnostic steps

- **Blood cultures**: 2–3 sets (40–60 mL total) from separate venipunctures, incubated for up to 5 days [^b9b726a2].

- **Beta-D-glucan assay**: Serum testing as adjunctive diagnostic tool [^62fecad0].

- **T2Candida PCR**: Consider in high-risk patients with negative cultures but persistent suspicion [^8b1b0eb1].

- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound or CT, brain MRI, and echocardiography as indicated [^77faf9a0] [^1170249d].

- **Ophthalmologic examination**: Dilated fundoscopy within the first week of diagnosis [^d7a5a028].

- **Site-specific sampling**: Obtain samples from suspected infection sites for culture and histopathology [^653c06d8].

---

The diagnostic approach to invasive candidiasis in this patient should be **multimodal**, integrating blood cultures, non-culture-based tests, imaging, and clinical assessment. This strategy ensures timely and accurate diagnosis, enabling prompt initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy and improving patient outcomes.

### Invasive candidiasis in intensive care medicine: shaping the future of diagnosis and therapy [^fb4aaad4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Invasive candidiasis (IC) remains one of the most challenging infections in critical care, contributing significantly to morbidity, prolonged organ support, and mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The clinical landscape of IC is evolving, with increasing recognition of Candida non-albicans species and other yeasts formerly classified as Candida spp., alongside emerging multidrug resistance and growing complexity in host immune profiles.

Objectives

This contemporary, multidisciplinary narrative review-authored by intensivists, infectious diseases specialists, clinical microbiologists, and pharmacologists-aims to provide ICU clinicians with practical, up-to-date insights into the diagnosis and management of IC. To maintain clinical focus, the review excludes non-IC fungal infections and non-ICU patient populations.

Methods

Relevant literature and expert consensus were critically reviewed to summarize current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for IC in critically ill patients. Emphasis was placed on pragmatic clinical application, diagnostic limitations, antifungal stewardship, and personalized therapeutic decision-making.

Results

Despite the availability of novel antifungal agents with improved pharmacokinetic properties, treatment success in IC depends equally on timely and accurate diagnosis and individualized, context-aware therapy. Blood cultures continue to demonstrate limited sensitivity (~40%). Non-culture assays, including β-D-glucan and molecular diagnostics, provide faster detection and high negative predictive value but suffer from low positive predictive value and inconsistent adoption in clinical practice. The absence of validated host-derived biomarkers further limits risk stratification, antifungal discontinuation decisions, and personalized care.

Conclusions

Emerging antifungal agents, stewardship strategies, and multidisciplinary care models are essential to improve clinical outcomes and reduce antifungal resistance. This review underscores the need for integrated, team-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to close persistent gaps in IC management, ultimately promoting more effective, timely, and individualized care for critically ill patients with Candida spp.

### Invasive fungal infections in patients with liver disease: immunological and clinical considerations for the intensive care unit [^04a68a81]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis and candidemia

Candida is a genus consisting of dimorphic fungi normally confined within human mucosal barriers but capable of causing invasive candidiasis in susceptible hosts, most commonly manifested clinically as candidemia. Historically, neutropenia has been the predisposing factor most tightly linked to invasive candidiasis, and cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia remain an especially high-risk category. Over time, numerous invasive candidiasis risk factors not involving quantitative immune cell deficiencies or therapeutic immunosuppression have emerged. The list of the most convincingly demonstrated risk factors includes receipt of antibacterial agents, receipt of total parenteral nutrition, abdominal surgery and pathology (e.g. necrotizing pancreatitis), central venous catheterization, and kidney failure, especially if requiring renal replacement therapy. These patient characteristics are very common among the critically ill, often in combination, so it is no surprise that invasive candidiasis is particularly prevalent in ICUs. Both ICU-specific and general clinical prediction rules for invasive candidiasis have been derived using identified risk factors, but none of them incorporates liver disease.

INTRODUCTION

Candida species are an important cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections, particularly among critically ill patients. In the intensive care unit (ICU), candidemia occurs at least 5–10 times more frequently than in non-ICU wards, potentiated by frequent pathological and iatrogenic disruptions in immunologic function and the host microbiome. Mortality rates associated with candidemia in the ICU exceed 40%, despite the advent of modern antifungal therapies. Moreover, the development of candidemia has been linked to increased ICU length of stay and substantial healthcare costs.

A key challenge in the management of candidemia is the timely identification of infection using conventional methods. Some data suggest blood cultures are approximately 50% sensitive for detecting invasive disease. If Candida is successfully recovered, blood cultures are further hampered by a median time to positivity of 2–3 days. The use of non-culture-based methods, such as (1→3)-β--glucan or anti-mannan antigen assays, is also limited by a lack of robust sensitivity and specificity, particularly among ICU patients. The empirical use of antifungal therapy in high-risk patients could overcome the limitations of these diagnostic tools; however, judicious use of these agents is required to limit unnecessary exposure that drives resistance and contributes to adverse drug effects. Although early initiation of antifungal therapy in patients with documented candidemia improves survival, the use of empirical antifungal therapy in high-risk non-neutropenic patients without culture-proven candidiasis has not demonstrated improved outcomes.

Candida species are the predominant cause of fungal infections in patients treated in hospital, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality. Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, recurrent infections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or in those taking immunosuppressive therapies. The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp, potentially causing confusion in clinical practice. Current management guidelines are limited in scope, with poor coverage of emerging pathogens and new treatment options. In this Review, we provide updated recommendations for managing Candida infections, with detailed evidence summaries available in the appendix.

Introduction

Critically ill patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) are at high risk of invasive Candida infections. Originating mostly from the digestive tract or the skin, vascular dissemination can occur after the adhesion and invasion of Candida yeast and hyphae, leading to candidemia that may be complicated by secondary localization (SL). The mortality rate was up to 40% in the multiple Candida multinational studies coordinated by the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM)), similar to previous multicenter studies, such as the EUCANDICU project, which included patients in 2015–2016 from 23 European ICUs.

The risk of SL is associated with longer episodes of candidemia and a higher number of positive blood culture bottles. Nonetheless, the debate on screening for SL is as intense as the question of catheter removal, with still no clear answers. Ocular examination during candidemia was even the subject of a recent controversy between the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), which promotes systematic screening of all patients with candidemia, and the American Academy of Ophthalmology, which recommends only screening patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of ocular infection. In the IDSA guidelines published in 2016, the systematic screening of ocular infection by fundoscopy, as well as screening of endocarditis by echocardiography, were ranked as B/II (strength of the recommendation/quality of the evidence). In the very recently published ECMM/ISHAM/ASM global guidelines, focused examination of potential SL is strongly recommended for all patients with candidemia throughout the course of disease.

For other sites of SL, such as vascular thrombosis and deep-seated tissue candidiasis, diagnosis in clinical practice is most often probable or possible when positive blood cultures for Candida are concomitant with evocative clinical signs or imaging.

Until now, the debated performance of biomarkers, such as serum (1–3)-β-D-glucan (BDG), to confirm the diagnosis and the difficulty of providing histological evidence of the infection foci have prompted clinicians to use fungicidal drugs as soon as SL is suspected. Indeed, the use of fungicidal drugs may be warranted against yeast biofilms, which are predictors of mortality for patients with candidemia.

In the large multicenter observational study CandidICU, we aimed to assess the prevalence, risk-factors, and mortality associated with SL in ICU patients presenting with a positive blood culture for Candida, along with exploring strategies for screening.

### Invasive fungal infections in patients with liver disease: immunological and clinical considerations for the intensive care unit [^ffd8a292]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Contemporary clinical practice guidelines aimed at the intensive care provider have covered the most salient questions pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of both invasive candidiasis and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in the critically ill. Since a detailed discussion of this subject matter is beyond the scope of the present article, the reader is referred to these guideline documents and to excellent recent reviews for more information. Of note, the guideline authors did not consider patients with liver disease separately because, fundamentally, the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to these patients is similar to what is recommended for other non-oncological patient types. In the special case of decompensated cirrhosis complicated by ascites, peritoneal fluid is available as a unique source of culture material for potential identification of fungi capable of causing spontaneous peritonitis, namely Candida and Cryptococcus. With respect to IPA diagnostics, it is important to be mindful of diminished sensitivity of the serum galactomannan assay in non-neutropenic hosts such as those with liver cirrhosis. The sensitivity of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid testing for galactomannan in critically ill cirrhotics, on the other hand, has been reported to be approximately 90%, which is not inferior to its performance in other populations. In terms of IPA treatment, older triazole antifungals such as voriconazole are associated with clinically significant hepatotoxicity, posing a possible hazard in the setting of cirrhosis (see below and Table 1). Echinocandins, the drugs of choice for invasive candidiasis in the ICU, are not known to be hepatotoxic and thus no special considerations are warranted in liver disease. The same holds true for Amphotericin B (AmB), the cornerstone of therapy for most manifestations of cryptococcosis. Flucytosine (5-FC), the preferred adjunct to AmB for synergy, can induce a transient transaminitis, but clinically apparent liver injury is exceedingly rare; therefore, the omission of 5-FC in the setting of underlying liver disease is not indicated.

Two hundred and fifty-six patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication. In ERAXIS-treated patients, the age range was 16–89 years, the gender distribution was 50% male and 50% female, and the race distribution was 71% White, 20% Black/African American, 7% Hispanic, 2% other races. The median duration of IV therapy was 14 and 11 days in the ERAXIS and fluconazole arms, respectively. For those who received oral fluconazole, the median duration of oral therapy was 7 days for the ERAXIS arm and 5 days for the fluconazole arm.

Patient disposition is presented in Table 9.

Two hundred and forty-five patients (127 ERAXIS, 118 fluconazole) met the criteria for inclusion in the MITT population. Of these, 219 patients (116 ERAXIS, 103 fluconazole) had candidemia only. Risk factors for candidemia among patients in both treatment arms in this study were: presence of a central venous catheter (78%), receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics (69%), recent surgery (42%), recent hyperalimentation (25%), and underlying malignancy (22%). The most frequent species isolated at baseline was C. albicans (62%), followed by C. glabrata (20%), C. parapsilosis (12%) and C. tropicalis (11%). The majority (97%) of patients were non-neutropenic (ANC >500) and 81% had APACHE II scores less than or equal to 20.

Global success rates in patients with candidemia and other Candida infections are summarized in Table 10.

Table 11 presents global response by patients with candidemia or multiple sites of Candida infection and mortality data for the MITT population.

### Candida albicans recovered from persistent candidemia exhibits enhanced virulence traits [^6eeeb74e]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Hematogenous candidiasis is a major cause of fungal infections in hospitalized patients globally. Key risk factors include broad-spectrum antibiotics, intensive care unit stays over 3 days, immunosuppression, and indwelling medical devices. The crude mortality rate associated with disseminated candidiasis is alarmingly high, often exceeding 50%. In addition to the mortality risk, candidemia significantly extends hospitalization duration, ranging from 3 to 30 additional days per episode. It burdens patients and imposes a financial strain on health care systems, with US candidiasis management costs estimated at $1–2 billion annually.

Persistent candidemia is defined as presence of candidemia at repeat blood cultures in patients who have received systemic antifungal agents for at least 3 days, while nonpersistent candidemia are those other than persistent ones with negative blood cultures after the first test. Besides the immune characteristics of patients, central venous catheters, metastatic infection foci, ineffective empirical treatment, long hospital stays, and severe sepsis are some of the risk factors for persistent candidemia. Biofilm formation is highly associated with development of persistent candidemia and an independent predictor of mortality among patients with candidemia.

The National Institutes of Health estimates that biofilms account for over 80% of microbial infections in the body. Candida is the third leading cause of intravascular catheter-related infections after coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus, with an overall highest crude mortality. Biofilm formation is a structured process with early, intermediate, and maturation stages. It begins with C. albicans adhesion to surfaces, facilitated by adhesins such as agglutinin-like sequence (ALS) proteins, followed by a yeast-to-hyphal transition that strengthens surface attachment, coordinated by a network of transcription factors and their effector genes. The biofilm matrix, rich in extracellular polymeric substances, provides resistance to drugs and immune evasion. Throughout this growth process, C. albicans biofilms shed yeast cells from the top-most hyphal layers of the biofilms. Crucially, dispersed cells from biofilm-infected catheters have direct access into the bloodstream, spread and attach to distal organs, and help sustain the cycle of infection. Biofilm-dispersed cells inherit drug resistance properties from the parent biofilm, evade the immune system, and cause damage to host tissues, leading to virulence in vivo. The persistence of candidemia is driven by a cyclical process involving biofilm formation— C. albicans cells from the initial bloodstream infection attach to the central venous catheter, where they form biofilms; these biofilms then release dispersed C. albicans cells into the bloodstream, enabling further dissemination and perpetuating the infection.

### Evaluating antimicrobial stewardship strategies in candidemia: a novel desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) analysis comparing blood culture versus T2Candida diagnostic approaches [^8b1b0eb1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although it is possible that false positives were included within our data set, we expect this to be minimally contributing to our findings. Blood cultures have limited sensitivity for Candida spp. ranging from 28% to 58% in patients with postmortem-confirmed invasive candidiasis, depending on the extent of deep tissue infection. The detection of candidemia by T2MR technology depends upon the presence of an organism and does not detect circulating Candida DNA (DNA-emia), thus minimizing contamination-driven false positive specimens. In the original study of the T2MR system, it reproducibly detected five Candida species in whole blood, with a lower limit of detection of one colony-forming unit/milliliter. Additionally, it had a 98% positive agreement and 100% negative agreement in comparison to spiked blood samples. This was further confirmed in the clinical trial setting where T2Candida demonstrated 91.1% sensitivity compared to contrived specimens. Attesting to the greater sensitivity of T2Candida in comparison to blood cultures, several studies have demonstrated a higher level of sensitivity for detection in cases of intra-abdominal candidiasis with negative blood culture. Other studies of T2Candida that have analyzed T2Candida positive/blood culture-negative cases with clinical adjudication have identified probable or possible invasive candidiasis in other sites.

### British society for medical mycology best practice recommendations for the diagnosis of serious fungal diseases: 2025 update [^3cb81834]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

The fungal diagnostic landscape is evolving; whereas previously, traditional culture-based methods dominated, most invasive fungal disease is now diagnosed with non-culture-based tests, including direct microscopy, antigen, antibody, and molecular assays, supported by histopathology and radiology. Access to and turnaround time of diagnostic tests and their clinical implementation varies across the UK. The British Society for Medical Mycology convened an expert group to update its 2015 best practice guidance. Guidance on histopathology and radiology investigations remain unchanged from the 2015 standards of care. For each mycological test, we include test-specific commentaries and accompanying tables, with expected turnaround times (sample collection to reporting). Based on recent evidence, new or stronger recommendations include use of Pneumocystis PCR; 1,3-β-D-glucan testing for suspected invasive candidiasis and Pneumocystis pneumonia; higher volume respiratory sample cultures; Aspergillus antigen or antibody-based testing in expanded clinically vulnerable populations, including patients in intensive care units and patients with chronic respiratory disease (including asthma); use of Candida PCR and Mucorales PCR in specific contexts; pan-fungal PCR and DNA sequencing for fungal identification from positive microscopy or histopathology specimens; and inclusion of posaconazole and isavuconazole in therapeutic antifungal monitoring recommendations. We discuss integration of diagnostic tests with antifungal stewardship and common clinical scenarios. Although recommendations focus on adults and UK practice, use in paediatric populations and worldwide applicability is discussed. Recommendations are presented as auditable standards to facilitate implementation and quality improvement measures. An emphasis on integration of combined diagnostics with antifungal stewardship and clinical pathways extends guideline relevance beyond microbiology laboratories to clinicians investigating patients with multimorbidity and suspected fungal disease within increasingly complex health-care systems.

Adults Candidemia and Other Candida Infections (Intra-abdominal Abscess and Peritonitis) Trial

The safety and efficacy of ERAXIS were evaluated in a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of patients with candidemia and/or other forms of invasive candidiasis. Patients were randomized to receive once daily IV ERAXIS (200 mg loading dose followed by 100 mg maintenance dose) or IV fluconazole (800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg maintenance dose). Patients were stratified by APACHE II score (≤20 and >20) and the presence or absence of neutropenia. Patients with Candida endocarditis, osteomyelitis or meningitis, or those with infection due to C. krusei, were excluded from the study. Treatment was administered for at least 14 and not more than 42 days. Patients in both study arms were permitted to switch to oral fluconazole after at least 10 days of intravenous therapy, provided that they were able to tolerate oral medication, were afebrile for at least 24 hours, and the last blood cultures were negative for Candida species.

Patients who received at least one dose of study medication and who had a positive culture for Candida species from a normally sterile site before entry into the study (modified intent-to-treat [MITT] population) were included in the analysis of global response at the end of IV therapy. A successful global response required clinical cure or improvement (significant, but incomplete resolution of signs and symptoms of the Candida infection and no additional antifungal treatment), and documented or presumed microbiological eradication. Patients with an indeterminate outcome were analyzed as failures in this population.

2.1	Recommended Dosage in Adults

Candidemia and other Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis)

The recommended dose is a single 200 mg loading dose of ERAXIS on Day 1, followed by a 100 mg once daily maintenance dose thereafter. Duration of treatment should be based on the patient's clinical response. In general, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture.

Esophageal Candidiasis

The recommended dose is a single 100 mg loading dose of ERAXIS on Day 1, followed by a 50 mg once daily maintenance dose thereafter. Patients should be treated for a minimum of 14 days and for at least 7 days following resolution of symptoms. Duration of treatment should be based on the patient's clinical response. Because of the risk of relapse of esophageal candidiasis in patients with HIV infection, suppressive antifungal therapy may be considered after a course of treatment.

2.2	Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients (1 Month of Age and Older)

Candidemia and other Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis)

The recommended dose is a single loading dose of 3 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) of ERAXIS on Day 1, followed by a once daily maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) of ERAXIS thereafter. Overall antifungal treatment should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture.

ASP management strategies

At the DMC, antifungal therapy was initiated in response to positive blood cultures or empirically based upon the discretion of the primary medical team. Real-time alerts were sent to DMC ASP pharmacists in response to positive blood cultures with identified yeasts, who reviewed and acted upon the information to ensure the patient was initiated or continued on appropriate antifungal therapy. Conversely, at HFH, patients admitted to an ICU who continued to have fever and/or clinical worsening after at least 72 h of broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated on echinocandin therapy, coupled with the attainment of T2Candida and blood cultures. Similar to the DMC, real-time alerts from T2Candida and blood culture results are sent to and enacted upon by ASP pharmacists. A negative T2Candida test prompted a reassessment of invasive candidiasis, potentially leading to the discontinuation of antifungal therapy if deemed appropriate. Follow-up T2Candida testing was discouraged if the purpose was to confirm infection clearance.

Laboratory procedures

At the DMC, blood cultures were incubated in the BD BACTEC automated blood culture system (BD Diagnostic Systems, Franklin Lakes, NJ). All positive blood cultures underwent Gram staining and rapid diagnostic testing with Verigene gram-negative and gram-positive panels (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX). Organism identification was performed with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Routine antifungal susceptibility testing was performed on all Candida species isolated from blood cultures using gradient diffusion strips (bioMérieux, Durham, NC). At HFH, blood cultures were incubated in VersaTREK (TREK Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH; January 2016 to January 2019) or BacT/Alert Virtuo BC System (bioMérieux, Durham, NC; February 2019 to December 2023). Positive blood cultures underwent Gram staining and testing with BioFire FilmArray Blood Culture Identification 2 (BCID2) Panel (bioMérieux). For yeast isolated from blood cultures, routine susceptibility was performed using Sensititre YeastOne (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

### Invasive fungal infections in patients with liver disease: immunological and clinical considerations for the intensive care unit [^532aa9e8]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future perspectives

Patients with liver disease present many characteristic challenges in the ICU environment. Among them is their unique susceptibility to infection in the absence of traditional risk factors of such susceptibility like neutropenia or receipt of immunosuppressive medications. Akin to the coagulopathy of liver disease, its associated immunocompromised state is multifactorial, rendering liver disease patients vulnerable to both bacterial and fungal infections. It is important, therefore, for the ICU clinician to be familiar with the immune functions of the liver and the myriad ways in which hepatic and immunological impairment are linked. In the present review, we have summarized the current knowledge about defects in antifungal immunity that accompany liver disease, with many important scientific contributions to this field having been published in recent years. However, much remains unknown, especially surrounding mechanisms of systemic immunosuppression that place patients with cirrhosis at increased risk not only for infections acquired via the gastrointestinal tract but also via the respiratory route, such as IPA and cryptococcosis. As is likely the case with ICU patients in general, IFIs in the liver disease patient population remain underrecognized. Part of the reason is lagging adoption of sensitive molecular tests with rapid turnaround times, such as the magnetic resonance-based T2Candida™ Panel and the sandwich immunochromatography-based lateral flow assay for IPA. Unfortunately, even the most sensitive diagnostic tools available at the point of care will not help if the diagnosis of IFIs is not suspected by the clinical team. One of the present review's objectives is to raise awareness in the intensive care community about the frequent occurrence of IFIs in liver disease patients admitted to the ICU. Another is to highlight the extremely high associated mortality, which could at least in part be due to delayed recognition of IFIs in this fragile patient cohort. Although there has been growing acknowledgment by expert groups that hepatic dysfunction constitutes a predisposing host factor for IFIs, uptake of this concept in clinical practice has been very incremental. In the case of Cryptococcus, it took the decline of AIDS as the dominant risk factor for disseminated infection to pave the way for greater recognition of patients with cirrhosis as an at-risk population. Owing to the availability of effective—and now also minimally hepatotoxic—antifungal agents, the combination of heightened clinical suspicion and broad access to rapid testing could hold the key to reducing the unacceptably high ICU mortality of IFIs in liver disease. Finally, when it comes to prevention, the utility of antifungal prophylaxis in the ICU remains a controversial topic, and in this regard patients with liver disease have not been specifically studied.

### Non-invasive diagnosis of invasive fungal disease with cell-free DNA PCR [^8192b87c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised population. Early diagnosis is challenging due to the low sensitivity and non-specificity of non-invasive fungal biomarkers, the need for invasive specimen collection, and the limitations of culture and histopathology. Detection of circulating fungal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma and serum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) represents a novel testing modality for rapid and accurate diagnosis of IFD. In this review, we summarize the performance characteristics of fungal cfDNA PCR for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and Pneumocystis pneumonia. We discuss a testing algorithm that incorporates fungal cfDNA and the added diagnostic value of invasive specimen collection when non-invasive mold cfDNA PCR is performed first. Lastly, we discuss the role of diagnostic stewardship in fungal cfDNA PCR testing.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of ERAXIS for the treatment of candidemia and the following Candida infections: intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis, have been established in pediatric patients 1 month of age and older. Use of ERAXIS for this indication in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic, safety data in pediatric patients 1 month of age and older [see Indications and Usage (1), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of ERAXIS in patients younger than 1 month of age with candidemia/invasive candidiasis has not been established.

Candidemia/invasive candidiasis in pediatric patients younger than 1 month of age has a higher rate of central nervous system (CNS) and multi-organ dissemination than in older patients. In addition, in patients younger than 1 month of age ERAXIS carries a potential risk of life-threatening toxicity associated with high doses of polysorbate 80, an inactive ingredient in ERAXIS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

The safety and effectiveness of ERAXIS in pediatric patients with esophageal candidiasis has not been established.

ERAXIS is contraindicated in adult and pediatric patients with HFI. Because a diagnosis of HFI may not yet be established in pediatric patients, obtain a careful history of HFI symptoms with fructose/sucrose exposure prior to administration of ERAXIS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] .

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects (N = 197) in the pivotal clinical studies of anidulafungin, 35% were 65 years and over, while 18% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Dosage adjustments are not required for geriatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

### Performance of the LIAISON PLEX yeast blood culture assay for identifying 16 invasive fungal pathogens in blood cultures [^a765af6d]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Assay performance was unaffected by the inclusion of high concentrations of all endogenous and nearly all exogenous chemical additives that were tested (Table S4). Only fluconazole at 25 mg/L caused interference with C. albicans identification, resulting in a false-negative call. While this concentration approximates the median serum levels observed with high-dosage fluconazole therapy (e.g. 34‒35 µg/mL at 600‒800 mg/day dosing), it is unlikely that these drug levels will be encountered in diluted blood culture broth tested by the BCY Assay. No interference was observed by fluconazole at lower concentrations (e.g. 8.3 mg/L; Table S4). No interference occurred for any of the 16 on-panel fungal pathogens by other common antifungal agents (e.g. amphotericin B and caspofungin) or antibacterial drugs tested (Table S4), suggesting good assay performance with blood culture broth samples derived from patients who may be receiving antimicrobial therapy.

Pediatric Candidemia/Invasive Candidiasis Trial

A prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multinational trial (National Clinical Trial (NCT) number 00761267) assessed the safety and efficacy of ERAXIS in 68 pediatric patients aged 1 month to <18 years with candidemia/invasive candidiasis. Patients were stratified by age (1 month to <2 years, 2 to <5 years, and 5 to <18 years) and received once daily intravenous ERAXIS (3 mg/kg loading dose on Day 1, and 1.5 mg/kg daily maintenance dose thereafter) followed by an optional switch to oral fluconazole (6–12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) up to Day 49. Patients were followed at 2 and 6 weeks after EOT.

Among 68 ERAXIS-treated patients, 64 had microbiologically confirmed Candida infection and were evaluated for efficacy in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population. Overall, 59 patients (92.2%) had Candida isolated from blood only. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Candida albicans (25 [39.1%] patients), followed by Candida parapsilosis (17 [26.6%] patients), and Candida tropicalis (9 [14.1%] patients). A successful global response was defined as having both successful clinical (cure or improvement) and microbiological (eradication or presumed eradication) response. The overall rates of successful global response in the MITT population are presented in Table 12 below.

### Foscarnet sodium [^07acb4c2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

VIROLOGY

Mechanism of Action

Foscarnet exerts its antiviral activity by a selective inhibition at the pyrophosphate binding site on virus-specific DNA polymerases at concentrations that do not affect cellular DNA polymerases. Foscarnet does not require activation (phosphorylation) by thymidine kinase or other kinases.

Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture

The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) to foscarnet and clinical response to therapy has not been established and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus in cell culture (EC50), vary greatly depending on the assay method used, cell type employed and the laboratory performing the test. A number of sensitive viruses and their EC50values are listed below (Table 1). The combination antiviral activity of foscarnet and ganciclovir or acyclovir are not antagonistic in cell culture.

Antiviral Activity in vivo

Statistically significant decreases in positive CMV cultures from blood and urine have been demonstrated in two studies (FOS-03 and ACTG-015/915) of subjects treated with foscarnet sodium injection. Although median time to progression of CMV retinitis was increased in subjects treated with foscarnet sodium injection, reductions in positive blood or urine cultures have not been shown to correlate with clinical efficacy in individual subjects (Table 2).

Resistance

Cell culture: CMV and HSV isolates with reduced susceptibility to foscarnet have been selected in cell culture by passage of wild type virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of the drug. All foscarnet resistant isolates are known to be generated through amino acid substitutions in the viral DNA polymerase pUL54 (CMV) or pUL30 (HSV) (Table 3).

In vivo: Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to foscarnet and many pathways to resistance likely exist. Substitutions documented in the literature in treated patients as associated with foscarnet resistance, are listed in Table 4.

The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy.

Cross-Resistance: The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to foscarnet and either ganciclovir, acyclovir and/or cidofovir are summarized in Tables 5 and 6.

### A nomogram-based clinical prediction model for adverse clinical outcomes in non-HIV Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia patients [^9c6cdf1d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study developed and validated a predictive nomogram for the early identification of adverse clinical outcomes in non-HIV PJP patients, integrating demographic, key clinical, and laboratory predictors. The nomogram exhibited robust predictive performance, with a C-index of 0.89 and an internally validated AUC of 0.80, suggesting high reliability and accuracy in risk stratification. These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse patient-specific features to improve risk stratification and prognosis in this heterogeneous population, addressing critical challenges in the management of non-HIV PJP.

The prevalence of immunosuppression among adults has increased significantly, rising from 2.7% in 2013 to 6.6% in 2021, driven by a notable rise in the incidence of immunosuppressive conditions and the expanded use of immunosuppressive therapies. These patients exhibit heightened vulnerability to a wide range of pathogens, including fungal infections. Recent estimates suggest PJP ranks among the top three most prevalent opportunistic fungal infections, alongside invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis, with affected patients frequently requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, and experiencing high mortality rates. Our findings are consistent with previous studies, further supporting the critical burden of PJP in immunocompromised patients and underscoring the need for timely identification and intervention in this high-risk population.

Currently, the assessment of disease severity in PJP patients largely relies on the Miller criteria, proposed in 1996, which primarily evaluate respiratory features, including respiratory symptoms, oxygenation status, and radiographic findings. However, this scoring system was originally developed for HIV-positive individuals, and is not universally accepted for grading disease severity in non-HIV PJP patients. Several studies have evaluated the performance of pneumonia severity scores such as A-DROP, CURB-65, and Pneumonia Severity Index in this context, but findings suggest limited applicability to non-HIV PJP populations. Other research has examined the prognostic value of ICU-based tools like SOFA and APACHE II scores, yet these remain suboptimal for risk stratification among general ward patients. To address this gap, our study developed and validated a concise, clinically applicable nomogram based on routinely available demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. This composite scoring approach leverages the synergistic prognostic value of key factors to enable the early identification of high-risk individuals and to inform personalized clinical management strategies in non-HIV PJP.

Non-Aspergillus molds (NAIMs) in hematopoietic cell transplantation—diagnostics utilize cultures, but non-culture methods, specifically panfungal PCR and MALDI-TOF, should be used whenever possible to improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, and contact with a fungal reference laboratory is recommended; because these rare molds have very specific resistance profiles, invasive procedures should be undertaken to obtain a deep tissue isolate for identification and AST, AST should be used as a rough guide, and blood cultures may be useful but results are often delayed by days or weeks. Cornerstones of management are: fungal speciation and AST results to inform antifungal therapy, careful clinical staging with attention to antifungal dosage, end-organ toxicity, drug-drug interactions, therapeutic drug monitoring, and antifungal drug distribution and penetration, surgical debridement is considered whenever feasible (especially for extrapulmonary foci), and immunosuppressive therapies should be reduced whenever possible; where possible, surgical debridement is recommended given observed survival association, and despite limited data, duration of therapy follows other molds according to site of infection. Prognosis is poor for disseminated infections; L. prolificans has a higher mortality rate (60% to 70% at 1 month) compared to that of Scedosporium spp. (20% to 50%), and overall mortality rates are 40% to 70%, except 20% to 30% for Purpureocillium and Paecilomyces infections.

### Micafungin [^f32c00b8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Treatment of Candidemia and Other Candida Infections in Adult and Pediatric Patients 4 Months of Age and Older

Two dose levels of micafungin were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study to determine the efficacy and safety versus caspofungin in patients with invasive candidiasis and candidemia. Patients were randomized to receive once daily intravenous infusions (IV) of micafungin, either 100 mg/day or 150 mg/day or caspofungin (70 mg loading dose followed by 50 mg maintenance dose). Patients in both study arms were permitted to switch to oral fluconazole after at least 10 days of intravenous therapy, provided they were non-neutropenic, had improvement or resolution of clinical signs and symptoms, had a Candida isolate which was susceptible to fluconazole and had documentation of 2 negative cultures drawn at least 24 hours apart. Patients were stratified by APACHE II score (20 or less or greater than 20) and by geographic region. Patients with Candida endocarditis were excluded from this analysis. Outcome was assessed by overall treatment success based on clinical (complete resolution or improvement in attributable signs and symptoms and radiographic abnormalities of the Candida infection and no additional antifungal therapy) and mycological (eradication or presumed eradication) response at the end of IV therapy. Deaths that occurred during IV study drug therapy were treated as failures.

In this study, 111/578 (19.2%) of the patients had baseline APACHE II scores of greater than 20 and 50/578 (8.7%) were neutropenic at baseline (absolute neutrophil count less than 500 cells/mm3). Outcome, relapse and mortality data are shown for the recommended dose of micafungin (100 mg/day) and caspofungin in Table 9.

In two cases of ophthalmic involvement assessed as failures in the above table due to missing evaluation at the end of IV treatment with micafungin, therapeutic success was documented during protocol-defined oral fluconazole therapy.

1.1 Invasive Aspergillosis

Voriconazole tablets are indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA). In clinical trials, the majority of isolates recovered were Aspergillus fumigatus . There was a small number of cases of culture-proven disease due to species of Aspergillus other than A. fumigatus [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.5) and Microbiology (12.4)].

1.2 Candidemia in Non-neutropenic Patients and Other Deep Tissue Candida Infections

Voriconazoletablets are indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) for the treatment of candidemia in non-neutropenic patients and the following Candida infections: disseminated infections in skin and infections in abdomen, kidney, bladder wall, and wounds [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.5) and Microbiology (12.4)].

### Performance of the LIAISON PLEX yeast blood culture assay for identifying 16 invasive fungal pathogens in blood cultures [^609f22c1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of invasive fungal disease remains challenging because of the overlap of clinical features with bacterial infections, reliance on blood culture assays with limited sensitivity that can take several days to yield positive results, and the often invasive nature of sampling required for histopathological evaluation. Standard blood culture has a sensitivity of 21%‒71% in identifying candidemia in autopsy-proven samples, trending lower in early disease and in patients who have begun prophylactic antifungal therapy. Blood culturing for Candida spp. typically has 72‒96 h turnaround times (longer for some species), which delays treatment initiation and leads to increased mortality. Initially, positive blood culture results often require detailed follow-up testing to confirm pathogen identity and characterize its resistance to different antifungal drug classes in the current medical armament. Alternative diagnostic approaches such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and non-culture techniques such as PCR analysis and beta-D-glucan testing may improve Candida detection.

The current study evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of a qualitative multiplexed molecular in vitro diagnostic test, the LIAISON PLEX Yeast Blood Culture (BCY) Assay (Luminex Corporation). Requiring only approximately 1 minute of hands-on time and 2 h from sample to result, this automated BCY Assay simultaneously evaluates positive blood culture samples for the presence of fungal nucleic acids to identify 14 pathogenic Candida spp. and 2 Cryptococcus spp. that cause most cases of systemic fungal infection.

### Voriconazole [^464c575e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Candidemia in Non-neutropenic Patients and Other Deep Tissue Candida Infections

Voriconazole was compared to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole in Study 608, an open label, comparative study in nonneutropenic patients with candidemia associated with clinical signs of infection. Patients were randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive either voriconazole (n=283) or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (n=139). Patients were treated with randomized study drug for a median of 15 days. Most of the candidemia in patients evaluated for efficacy was caused by C. albicans (46%), followed by C. tropicalis (19%), C. parapsilosis (17%), C. glabrata (15%), and C. krusei (1%).

An independent Data Review Committee (DRC), blinded to study treatment, reviewed the clinical and mycological data from this study, and generated one assessment of response for each patient. A successful response required all of the following: resolution or improvement in all clinical signs and symptoms of infection, blood cultures negative for Candida, infected deep tissue sites negative for Candida or resolution of all local signs of infection, and no systemic antifungal therapy other than study drug. The primary analysis, which counted DRC-assessed successes at the fixed time point (12 weeks after End of Therapy [EOT]), demonstrated that voriconazole was comparable to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (response rates of 41% and 41%, respectively) in the treatment of candidemia. Patients who did not have a 12-week assessment for any reason were considered a treatment failure.

### Performance of the LIAISON PLEX yeast blood culture assay for identifying 16 invasive fungal pathogens in blood cultures [^eb127d61]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The specific fungal pathogens responsible for bloodstream infection exhibit both geographic and temporal variance. For example, C. albicans was the causative pathogen for 70–80% of invasive candidiasis infections globally in the 1980s–1990s, but this proportion has now decreased to 40–60% in most areas. Also, susceptibility to infection by certain Candida spp. varies according to patient medical conditions and antimicrobial regimens; e.g. C. glabrata is more commonly isolated in patients with cancer, and C. krusei tends to affect patients with hematologic malignancy who receive prophylactic fluconazole. In our 69 prospective patient samples collected in the US, C. glabrata was the most frequently identified species (36%), followed by C. albicans (25%), and C. parapsilosis (16%). Cryptococcus neoformans / C. gattii was not identified in this cohort. The LIAISON PLEX BCY Assay offers clinicians a tailored diagnostic tool whereby fungal testing can be specified to evaluate only the pathogens most likely to be encountered, according to the Gram stain result.

As an adjunctive qualitative test, this assay is meant to provide rapid confirmation and clarification of positive continuous blood culture findings and not serve as a standalone diagnostic tool. While accurate identification was demonstrated for 5 tested sequence variants of each of the 16 assay targets, there still remains a risk of false-negative findings with other untested fungal sequence variants. A negative finding for all 16 BCY Assay targets does not preclude the possibility of infection by a fungus included in the test panel or of co-infection with other viruses and bacteria. It is possible that BCY Assay results may be affected by concurrent antimicrobial therapy or that levels of fungi in specimens are below the test’s limit of detection. Last, although this assay was shown to be compatible with pediatric culture bottles, it has not been validated for performance in pediatric patients, so test suitability for young patients is left to physician discretion. Strengths of this study included the multicenter prospective design and comprehensive performance assessment.

### Fluconazole [^ce7332e5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Resistance in Candida glabrata usually includes upregulation of CDR genes resulting in resistance to multiple azoles. For an isolate where the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is categorized as Intermediate (16 mcg/mL to 32 mcg/mL), the highest fluconazole dose is recommended.

Antimicrobial Activity

Fluconazole has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections.

Candida albicans

Candida glabrata (Many isolates are intermediately susceptible)

Candida parapsilosis

Candida tropicalis

Cryptococcus neoformans

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following fungi exhibit an in vitro MIC less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for fluconazole (https://www.fda.gov/STIC) against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the effectiveness of fluconazole in treating clinical infections due to these fungi has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Candida dubliniensis

Candida guilliermondii

Candida kefyr

Candida lusitaniae

Candida krusei should be considered to be resistant to fluconazole. Resistance in C. krusei appears to be mediated by reduced sensitivity of the target enzyme to inhibition by the agent.

Susceptibility Testing

Antifungal susceptibility testing among 1,740 Candida parapsilosis blood isolates submitted to a U.S. reference laboratory (2015-2024) revealed a significant increase in fluconazole resistance from 8.2% to 20.3% (odds ratio [OR] per year: 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.20; p<0.001), with notable acceleration since 2021. Voriconazole resistance remained stable over this period. Micafungin resistance was rare, but intermediate susceptibility significantly increased, especially after 2021 (OR per year: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.25-1.63; p<0.001). These findings highlight important recent shifts in antifungal susceptibility among C. parapsilosis isolates, emphasizing the need for ongoing surveillance and stewardship.

### Natalizumab (Tysabri) [^59085089]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Crohn's disease, the interaction of the α4β7 integrin with the endothelial receptor MAdCAM-1 has been implicated as an important contributor to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of the disease. MAdCAM-1 is mainly expressed on gut endothelial cells and plays a critical role in the homing of T lymphocytes to gut lymph tissue found in Peyer's patches. MAdCAM-1 expression has been found to be increased at active sites of inflammation in patients with CD, which suggests it may play a role in the recruitment of leukocytes to the mucosa and contribute to the inflammatory response characteristic of CD. The clinical effect of natalizumab in CD may therefore be secondary to blockade of the molecular interaction of the α4ß7-integrin receptor with MAdCAM-1 expressed on the venular endothelium at inflammatory foci. VCAM-1 expression has been found to be upregulated on colonic endothelial cells in a mouse model of IBD and appears to play a role in leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation. The role of VCAM-1 in CD, however, is not clear.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

TYSABRI administration increases the number of circulating leukocytes (including lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils) due to inhibition of transmigration out of the vascular space. TYSABRI does not affect the absolute count of circulating neutrophils [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Rapid diagnostic stewardship and blood culture use in a pediatric medical center [^15d1af57]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Our stewardship measures also included pooling catheter lumens from the same CVC. We observed a slight increase in the recovery of pathogens without an increase in contamination rates. The practice of pooling CVC cultures remains contentious in the literature. While 1 studydemonstrated comparable sensitivity between pooled and individual-lumen CVC cultures, another studyreported lower sensitivity with pooling. Unfortunately, prospective studies specifically evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of pooling CVC in pediatric populations are still lacking.

Another key aspect of our intervention was the reduction in the number of repeat blood cultures, with a 52.1% decrease in the median number of repeat orders. This decreased the number of additional blood cultures positive for the same pathogen without appearing to significantly impact patient outcomes. The role of repeat blood cultures in BSI remains debated., A recent pediatric study found that Staphylococcus aureus and yeast species were associated with persistent BSIs, while anaerobes and Streptococcus species were never recovered from repeat cultures.This evidence may inform future diagnostic stewardship guidelines, allowing for exceptions for repeat blood cultures within 48 hours when prior cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus or yeast species.

While contingency and crisis strategies are necessary during a shortage, they are often deimplemented when supply levels stabilize.The blood culture bottle shortage has provided a unique opportunity for us to reevaluate our pediatric center’s blood culture practices. Encouraged by the lack of safety signals emerging from our data, our pediatric quaternary care center decided to permanently enact these restrictive measures as of April 24, 2025. Given the most frequent reason for additional blood culture bottles was documentation of pathogen clearance (especially for Staphylococcus aureus and Candida species), we coordinated with our informatics department to lift all EMR restrictions when a patient had a documented positive blood culture in the last 7 days.

The shortage also allowed us to identify potential areas of improvement in our blood culture practices. Given the subpar proportion of blood culture bottles with appropriate blood volume before and after the intervention (<30%), we are now focusing on improving blood culture fill volumes in the context of a longitudinal quality improvement plan.

Finally, we would like to acknowledge that these stewardship practices were only possible because of the workforce available. The microbiology on-call team is composed of 2 microbiologists and 2 fellows that are available around the clock to promptly support clinical teams, such as in cases of suspected endocarditis where 3 blood cultures obtained from separate venipunctures are recommended.

Box 1: Case report—Past medical history of a 5-year-old girl with speech impairment—A child born 6 weeks preterm with hyperbilirubinemia and a month-long neonatal intensive care unit stay had language milestones that were significantly delayed, with no words at age 2 years. Evaluation showed nonverbal IQ 80 and, on a parent-report measure of 396 possible words, understanding of 100 words but only 3 spoken; by 40 months she said 15 words without phrases, and at 42 months she was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. With no fine or gross motor delays, the speech-language pathologist selected an adapted touchscreen tablet with a dynamic, changeable display after trials, including a loaner of a comprehensive but expensive augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) program; despite 2 appeals over 10 months, insurance refused payment and philanthropic funding enabled delivery within 2 weeks. Training involved school and family; at home the device was rarely used because parents understood 1- or 2-word phrases, but over time the child began saying 3-word phrases and, using the AAC device, communicated in 6- to 7-word sentences.

### Caspofungin acetate [^a254b53b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Esophageal Candidiasis (and information on oropharyngeal candidiasis)

The safety and efficacy of caspofungin acetate for injection in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis was evaluated in one large, controlled, noninferiority, clinical trial and two smaller dose-response studies.

In all 3 studies, patients were required to have symptoms and microbiological documentation of esophageal candidiasis; most patients had advanced AIDS (with CD4 counts <50/mm3).

Of the 166 patients in the large study who had culture-confirmed esophageal candidiasis at baseline, 120 had Candida albicans and 2 had Candida tropicalis as the sole baseline pathogen whereas 44 had mixed baseline cultures containing C. albicans and one or more additional Candida species .

In the large, randomized, double-blind study comparing caspofungin acetate for injection 50 mg/day versus intravenous fluconazole 200 mg/day for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, patients were treated for an average of 9 days (range 7-21 days). Favorable overall response at 5 to 7 days following discontinuation of study therapy required both complete resolution of symptoms and significant endoscopic improvement. The definition of endoscopic response was based on severity of disease at baseline using a 4-grade scale and required at least a two-grade reduction from baseline endoscopic score or reduction to grade 0 for patients with a baseline score of 2 or less.

### Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) [^04f855c7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 	Mechanism of Action

Ruxolitinib, a kinase inhibitor, inhibits Janus Associated Kinases (JAKs) JAK1 and JAK2 which mediate the signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for hematopoiesis and immune function. JAK signaling involves recruitment of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) to cytokine receptors, activation and subsequent localization of STATs to the nucleus leading to modulation of gene expression.

MF and PV are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) known to be associated with dysregulated JAK1 and JAK2 signaling. In a mouse model of JAK2V617F-positive MPN, oral administration of ruxolitinib prevented splenomegaly, preferentially decreased JAK2V617F mutant cells in the spleen and decreased circulating inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6).

JAK-STAT signaling pathways play a role in regulating the development, proliferation, and activation of several immune cell types important for GVHD pathogenesis. In a mouse model of aGVHD, oral administration of ruxolitinib was associated with decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines in colon homogenates and reduced immune-cell infiltration in the colon.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Jakafi inhibits cytokine induced STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood from patients with MF and PV. STAT3 phosphorylation reached maximal inhibition 2 hours after Jakafi dosing and returned to near baseline by 10 hours in patients with MF and PV.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At a dose of 1.25 to 10 times the highest recommended starting dosage, Jakafi does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

### Gastrointestinal colonization resistance: a host-microbiome balancing act [^ba2d23fe]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Despite fungi comprising only 0.1% of the microbes within the gastrointestinal microbiota, the importance of the mycobiome is increasingly recognized across several diseases beyond infections ranging from cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Candida albicans is a yeast that colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract in 50%–60% of adults. Under homeostatic conditions, it acts as a commensal opportunistic pathogen that can provide benefits to the host, including protection against Clostridioides difficile and other bacterial pathogens along with positive interactions in the immune system. Despite potential benefits to the host, there are many complications. C. albicans colonization is associated with exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease and serves as a reservoir for candidemia (Candida spp. in the bloodstream) in heavily immunocompromised patients, such as hematologic malignancy. Candidemia and invasive candidiasis carry a mortality approaching 50%, demonstrating the severity of this infection and importance of understanding the factors involved with C. albicans gastrointestinal colonization. For these reasons, in 2022, the World Health Organization designated C. albicans as a critical priority pathogen. Antibacterial use is a known risk factor for gastrointestinal colonization and expansion of C. albicans, arguing that the gastrointestinal microbiota serves a major function in protecting against colonization, a phenomenon known as colonization resistance. However, as more information related to the microbiome is discovered, it is becoming clearer that the interactions within the microbiome, metabolites produced by the microbiota, and host-microbiome interactions often play a larger role than the individual species of the microbiota. In this review, we will briefly explore the benefits and consequences of C. albicans gastrointestinal colonization followed by an in-depth review regarding gastrointestinal C. albicans colonization resistance with a focus on microbiota-host- C. albicans interactions and common external factors such as antimicrobials and diet.

### Daratumumab or active monitoring for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma [^7b33b747]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study AQUILA was published by Meletios A Dimopoulos and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Smoldering myeloma. In the AQUILA study, the trial question was: what is the role of daratumumab monotherapy in patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma? In the AQUILA study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the AQUILA study, the population was: 390 patients (202 female, 188 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma. The key exclusion criteria were multiple myeloma requiring treatment; primary systemic amyloid light-chain amyloidosis; prior exposure to daratumumab; ongoing treatment with other monoclonal antibodies; receipt of treatment for malignancy in the past 3 years; medical or psychiatric condition or disease. In the AQUILA study, the interventions were: n=194 daratumumab (subcutaneous dose of 1,800 mg on a weekly basis in cycles 1-2, every 2 weeks in cycles 3-6, and every 4 weeks thereafter in 28-day cycles continued for up to 39 cycles or for 36 months) n=196 active monitoring (no disease-specific treatment for 36 months or until confirmation of disease progression). In the AQUILA study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in progression-free survival (65.5% vs. 49.5%; HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.78). In the AQUILA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in overall survival (92.3% vs. 86.7%; HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.7) Significant decrease in initiation of first-line treatment (33.2% vs. 53.6%; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.62). In the AQUILA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in hypertension. In the AQUILA study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma, daratumumab was superior to active monitoring with respect to a progression-free survival.

### Commensalism and pathogenesis of Candida albicans at the mucosal interface [^4d7c2828]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Fungi are important and often underestimated human pathogens. Infections with fungi mostly originate from the environment, from soil or airborne spores. By contrast, Candida albicans, one of the most common and clinically important fungal pathogens, permanently exists in the vast majority of healthy individuals as a member of the human mucosal microbiota. Only under certain circumstances will these commensals cause infections. However, although the pathogenic behaviour and disease manifestation of C. albicans have been at the centre of research for many years, its asymptomatic colonization of mucosal surfaces remains surprisingly understudied. In this Review, we discuss the interplay of the fungus, the host and the microbiome on the dualism of commensal and pathogenic life of C. albicans, and how commensal growth is controlled and permitted. We explore hypotheses that could explain how the mucosal environment shapes C. albicans adaptations to its commensal lifestyle, while still maintaining or even increasing its pathogenic potential.

### Gastrointestinal colonization resistance: a host-microbiome balancing act [^741bc610]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

While Candida albicans is a common, commensal yeast colonizing 50%-60% of humans, it has the potential to expand in the gastrointestinal tract and enter the blood stream resulting in invasive candidiasis. Invasive candidiasis carries a mortality approaching 50%, especially in the most vulnerable, immunocompromised population. Antibacterial use causes an increase in C. albicans gastrointestinal colonization, indicating that the colonic microbiota plays a major role in preventing an uncontrolled expansion, a phenomenon known as colonization resistance. Antibacterials, medications, diet, and co-morbid conditions can all alter the microbiome, creating an altered environment known as dysbiosis. Our understanding of the microbiome continues to advance, and there is increasing evidence that the interactions that the microbiome has on the host are vital in maintaining colonization resistance to pathogens including C. albicans . This review will focus on colonization resistance to C. albicans within the gastrointestinal tract. The scope includes the benefits and consequences of C. albicans colonization, interkingdom interactions of the microbiome on C. albicans , microbiome-host interactions and how these modulate C. albicans colonization, and the impact of medications and diet on colonization resistance.

### Caspofungin acetate [^54c9feac]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.5 Pediatric Patients

The safety and efficacy of caspofungin acetate for injection were evaluated in pediatric patients 3 months to 17 years of age in two prospective, multicenter clinical trials.

The first study, which enrolled 82 patients between 2 to 17 years of age, was a randomized, double-blind study comparing caspofungin acetate for injection (50 mg/m2IV once daily following a 70-mg/m2loading dose on Day 1 [not to exceed 70 mg daily]) to AmBisome (3 mg/kg IV daily) in a 2:1 treatment fashion (56 on caspofungin, 26 on AmBisome) as empirical therapy in pediatric patients with persistent fever and neutropenia. The study design and criteria for efficacy assessment were similar to the study in adult patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients were stratified based on risk category (high-risk patients had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation or had relapsed acute leukemia). Twenty-seven percent of patients in both treatment groups were high risk. Favorable overall response rates of pediatric patients with persistent fever and neutropenia are presented in Table 15.

The second study was a prospective, open-label, non-comparative study estimating the safety and efficacy of caspofungin in pediatric patients (ages 3 months to 17 years) with candidemia and other Candida infections, esophageal candidiasis, and invasive aspergillosis (as salvage therapy). The study employed diagnostic criteria which were based on established EORTC/MSG criteria of proven or probable infection; these criteria were similar to those criteria employed in the adult studies for these various indications. Similarly, the efficacy time points and endpoints used in this study were similar to those employed in the corresponding adult studies [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3, and 14.4)]. All patients received caspofungin acetate for injection at 50 mg/m2IV once daily following a 70-mg/m2loading dose on Day 1 (not to exceed 70 mg daily). Among the 49 enrolled patients who received caspofungin acetate for injection, 48 were included in the efficacy analysis (one patient excluded due to not having a baseline Aspergillus or Candida infection). Of these 48 patients, 37 had candidemia or other Candida infections, 10 had invasive aspergillosis, and 1 patient had esophageal candidiasis. Most candidemia and other Candida infections were caused by C. albicans (35%), followed by C. parapsilosis (22%), C. tropicalis (14%), and C. glabrata (11%). The favorable response rate, by indication, at the end of caspofungin therapy was as follows: 30/37 (81%) in candidemia or other Candida infections, 5/10 (50%) in invasive aspergillosis, and 1/1 in esophageal candidiasis.

### Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) [^840d25e7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY

SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with CIMZIA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.

CIMZIA should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.

Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before CIMZIA use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to CIMZIA use.
Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.
Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.

The risks and benefits of treatment with CIMZIA should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

### Treatment, toxicity, and mortality after subsequent breast cancer in female survivors of childhood cancer [^b26efda2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Sex was considered in the design of this study and was based self-/proxy-report or information reported from the treating institution. Female survivors with a confirmed breast cancer diagnosis (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS], lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS], or invasive carcinoma) as of December 31, 2016 at age ≥18 years and ≥5 years after initial childhood cancer diagnosis were included. Six participants with ambiguous diagnoses were excluded (3 sarcoma, 1 benign fibroadenoma, 2 phyllodes tumors), leaving 431 females with subsequent breast cancer (in situ or invasive) for inclusion in this analysis.

Breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and toxicity data were collected from medical records using a standardized abstraction form. Breast cancer histology, stage, size, location, hormone receptor status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status were abstracted, along with treatments for the first breast cancer, including surgery type, cumulative radiation dose and site, cumulative chemotherapy doses, hormone modulating therapy, and HER2-targeted therapy. Prescribed breast cancer treatment information was reviewed against published national breast cancer treatment guidelines (National Comprehensive Cancer Network®)from the year of treatment for cancers diagnosed from the time the guidelines were established in 1995 through 2016. Consistency with guideline-concordant breast cancer treatment was defined by matches in treatments prescribed and guideline-listed treatments for the relevant time period, with consideration of treatments based on disease stage, hormone receptor and HER2 status, when applicable. If dose modifications were required due to toxicity, but the initial prescribed dose was appropriate, therapy was considered guideline-concordant. If individuals were documented as participating in a clinical trial, treatment was considered guideline-concordant. In situations of uncertainty regarding guideline concordance, or for cancers diagnosed before 1995, relevant contemporary breast cancer treatment literature was reviewed. If the standard of care could not be clearly established or treatment data was incomplete or unknown, guideline concordance was considered unknown.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (carbidopa-levodopa) [^ec86587d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperpyrexia and Confusion

Sporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported in association with dose reductions or withdrawal of certain antiparkinsonian agents such as levodopa, carbidopa and levodopa, or carbidopa and levodopa extended release. Therefore, patients should be observed carefully when the dosage of levodopa is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics.

NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia. Neurological findings, including muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, mental status changes; other disturbances, such as autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, hyper- or hypotension; laboratory findings, such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin have been reported.

The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. Considering NMS as a possible diagnosis and ruling out other acute illnesses (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) is essential. This may be especially complex if the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include: 1) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 2) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, and muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene, are often used in the treatment of NMS; however, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies.

### Anidulafungin (Eraxis) [^27b38156]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Anidulafungin is a semi-synthetic echinocandin with antifungal activity. Anidulafungin inhibits glucan synthase, an enzyme present in fungal, but not mammalian cells. This results in inhibition of the formation of 1,3-β-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall.

Resistance

Echinocandin resistance is due to point mutations within the genes (FKS1 and FKS2) encoding for subunits in the glucan synthase enzyme complex. There have been reports of Candida isolates with reduced susceptibility to anidulafungin, suggesting a potential for development of drug resistance. The clinical significance of this observation is not fully understood.

Antimicrobial Activity

Anidulafungin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections:

Candida albicans 

 Candida glabrata 

 Candida parapsilosis 

 Candida tropicalis

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following fungi exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for anidulafungin against isolates of the following Candida species. However, the effectiveness of anidulafungin in treating clinical infections due to these fungi has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials:

Candida guilliermondii 

 Candida krusei

Regarding specific circumstances for immunoglobulin A nephropathy, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, immunosuppressive agents, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using regimens including intravenous methylprednisolone on an individual basis in patients with higher clinical and histologic risk of progression, such as (i) children with acute onset of IgAN and worsening kidney function (eGFR < 90 ml/min per 1.73 m²) and/or protein-to-creatinine ratio > 1,000 mg/g (100 mg/mmol) with active severe MEST-C scores (≥ 2 of the following scores: M1, E1, S1 with podocyte lesions, and/or C1) or (ii) children with crescentic forms of IgAN (C2).

- consider the level of proteinuria in cases with C1 or C2 in the absence of any other MEST-C score > 0

- consider treating rapidly progressive IgAN in cases with C2, irrespective of proteinuria. Suggested dosing regimens include: 3 methylprednisolone intravenous pulses at 15 mg/kg/day each (maximum dose 500 mg) on 3 consecutive or alternate days, followed by oral prednisone/prednisolone as indicated above; alternatively, repeat the intravenous pulses 3 times at 2-month intervals, with oral prednisone/prednisolone at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 2 months between pulse cycles for a total of 6 months.

### Performance of the LIAISON PLEX yeast blood culture assay for identifying 16 invasive fungal pathogens in blood cultures [^41bd442e]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Fungi frequently cause potentially life-threatening bloodstream infections, particularly in immunocompromised and hospitalized individuals. Molecular methods can allow earlier pathogen identification for faster optimization of appropriate therapy. This multisite study evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of the automated multiplex LIAISON PLEX Yeast Blood Culture nucleic acid assay (Luminex Corporation, Northbrook, IL), which detects and identifies 14 Candida and 2 Cryptococcus pathogens from positive blood cultures. Samples included 69 prospectively collected specimens, 63 pre-selected samples, and 829 contrived specimens. The assay demonstrated 100% positivity in detecting target fungal pathogens and 0% positivity in negative blood cultures. All 13 tested bottle/matrix types gave 100% detection of six evaluated pathogens. Limits of detection ranged from 7.77 × 10 2 CFU/mL (Candida famata) to 2.83 × 10 5 CFU/mL (Candida albicans). The assay identified five strains tested for each of the 16 target species, indicating good inclusivity. No cross-reactivity occurred with 40 bacterial strains. Cross-reactivity with 2 of 37 off-target fungi (Candida [Yarrowia] deformans and Candida pseudohaemulonii) was predicted by in silico sequence analyses. Low concentrations of on-panel fungi were detectable alongside high concentrations of potential fungal and bacterial confounders. Reproducibility was 100% within-lab and 99.7% across sites. For combined prospective plus pre-selected specimens, sensitivity/positive percent agreement (PPA) was 100% for detected fungal pathogens, and specificity/negative percent agreement (NPA) was 97.6%‒100.0%. Common pathogens in prospective samples were Candida glabrata (36%) and C. albicans (25%). Contrived specimen PPA was 100%, and NPA was ≥99.6%. The LIAISON PLEX Yeast Blood Culture assay provides outstanding sensitivity and specificity for rapidly identifying and differentiating fungal pathogens in positive blood culture specimens.

IMPORTANCE

Bloodstream fungal infections have serious risks of illness and death. Optimal treatment requires early pathogen identification so appropriate antifungal therapy can be immediately started. Blood culture is standard for confirming fungal infection but takes several days for results and may not provide detailed pathogen information. The LIAISON PLEX Yeast Blood Culture assay quickly analyzes fungus-positive blood cultures to identify 16 pathogenic fungi, including multiple Candida spp. that are common causes of bloodstream infection. This study demonstrated a high degree of test accuracy and reliability in rapidly identifying the infective pathogen in blood cultures from 132 patients with demonstrated culture-positive fungal infections. Assay performance was confirmed in 829 contrived samples, whereby samples were spiked with different fungal pathogens.

### American Society of Transplantation and cellular therapy series: # 8-management and prevention of non-aspergillus molds in hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients [^10d39c0f]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). High credibility.

FAQ19—molecular diagnostics for NAIMIs emphasize PCR assays for mucormycosis (MCM) with defined performance and limitations. Molecular diagnostics continue to be refined and compared to conventional cultures and can offer earlier detection and a possible role in monitoring response, but their main limitations are lack of standardization and low availability with commercialized kits. A real-time multiplex PCR for the most frequent pathogenic Mucorales has >80% sensitivity for diagnosing MCM in blood or serum, while a recently commercialized assay has 75% sensitivity in serial blood samples of patients with proven MCM. Sensitivity of these PCRs in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was >90% and superior to culture, and both approaches mostly resulted in earlier diagnosis than by culture or histopathology and demonstrated some role in assessing therapeutic response. Detection for other rare molds remains limited, though an in-house pan-Fusarium PCR has >90% sensitivity.
