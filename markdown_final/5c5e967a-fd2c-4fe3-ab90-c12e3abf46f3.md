## Question

Hypoparathyroidism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hypoparathyroidism, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the disease and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and etiologies, especially postsurgical versus nonsurgical causes. Next, I will review clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria. After that, I need to examine conventional management, including dosing, monitoring, and limitations. Then, I should evaluate PTH replacement therapy, including rhPTH(1–84), palopegteriparatide, and transCon PTH, with efficacy and safety data. I will also consider special populations and surgical prevention. Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight knowledge gaps and future directions, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by inadequate PTH secretion or action, leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and often hypercalciuria due to loss of PTH's renal calcium-conserving and phosphaturic effects, with reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis and low bone turnover, which together drive multisystem manifestations and complications [^114tFU9o] [^115RQKfJ] [^113L92Lm].

> I need to check the epidemiology and etiologies carefully. Postsurgical injury or removal of parathyroid glands accounts for roughly 75% of cases, with transient hypoparathyroidism after thyroidectomy reported in 14–60% and permanent hypoparathyroidism in about 1–2.5% in contemporary series, though older literature cited higher ranges; I should reconcile this by noting evolving definitions and surgical technique improvements over time [^113XxZ3x] [^114UV221] [^111xV7xh]. Nonsurgical causes include autoimmune destruction, genetic syndromes, infiltrative disease, and magnesium disturbances; importantly, both hypo- and hypermagnesemia can cause functional hypoparathyroidism, so I should confirm magnesium status early in the evaluation [^115W82Ww] [^113iMJU9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical features without anchoring them to biochemistry. The hallmark is hypocalcemia with inappropriately low or undetectable PTH, accompanied by hyperphosphatemia; symptoms span neuromuscular excitability (paresthesias, tetany, seizures), neuropsychiatric complaints, and cardiac arrhythmias, and chronic disease carries risks of nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, basal ganglia calcifications, and reduced quality of life, so I should confirm these associations when assessing patients [^114tFU9o] [^111vBt9m] [^111u5q85].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria and thresholds. Diagnosis rests on low albumin-adjusted or ionized calcium with concurrently low or inappropriately normal PTH; distinguishing transient from permanent disease typically uses a 6–12 month window, with some consensus statements extending permanent to beyond 12 months and emphasizing attempts to wean supplements to confirm permanence; early postoperative PTH ≤ 15 pg/mL predicts higher risk of hypocalcemia and guides management decisions [^113iMJU9] [^112wvmxd] [^111yikpo].

> Next, I should review conventional therapy and ensure dosing aligns with guidelines. The cornerstone is oral calcium (commonly calcium carbonate 1–2 g elemental calcium in divided doses with meals, or calcium citrate in achlorhydria or PPI users) plus active vitamin D (calcitriol 0.25–0.5 mcg twice daily, or alfacalcidol with similar targets), titrated to maintain serum calcium in the low-normal range while avoiding hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria; thiazides and magnesium optimization are adjuncts when needed, and I should double-check that calcitriol dosing ranges match labeling and guideline practice [^112YeFM1] [^115DAeFG] [^112tScWT] [^111ToRts].

> I will now examine monitoring targets and cadence. Serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and creatinine/eGFR should be checked every 3–6 months; 24-hour urine calcium is typically targeted below 7.5 mmol/day and monitored periodically, with renal ultrasound considered if stones or rising creatinine occur; I should confirm that routine DXA is not recommended given low utility in this population, and that structured tapering of supplements is advised to avoid iatrogenic suppression of residual PTH [^1113mTDi] [^115H3AwN] [^112SGMJi] [^112BAwqV].

> But wait, what if conventional therapy fails or causes complications? Conventional therapy often leaves hyperphosphatemia, hypercalciuria, and ectopic calcifications unaddressed, and imposes a high pill burden that correlates with worse symptom severity and quality of life; I should verify these limitations and the evidence linking them to renal outcomes and patient-reported burden [^113uTUT8] [^114YU72m] [^111u5q85].

> Let me consider PTH replacement therapy and confirm the regulatory status. Recombinant human PTH(1–84) is FDA-approved as adjunct therapy for patients who cannot be adequately controlled with calcium and active vitamin D, with REPLACE showing that 53% achieved ≥ 50% reduction in calcium and active vitamin D while maintaining normocalcemia; long-term studies up to 4–6 years demonstrate sustained efficacy and acceptable safety, though hypercalcemia can occur and requires dose adjustment [^113a2EEe] [^1114jmwb] [^111hiVMH].

> I should double-check the comparative advantages of PTH therapy. Meta-analyses indicate PTH(1–34) and PTH(1–84) improve phosphate control, reduce urinary calcium, and enable marked reductions or discontinuation of oral calcium and active vitamin D, with modest improvements in physical health–related quality of life; however, hypercalcemia risk is increased and long-term fracture data remain limited, so patient selection and close monitoring are essential [^112CXA3p] [^114vaGkA] [^11783xD7].

> Hold on, I should verify the newest agent. Palopegteriparatide (transCon PTH), a long-acting PTH(1–34) prodrug with once-daily dosing, achieved independence from active vitamin D and reduction of calcium to ≤ 500 mg/day in 91% of participants by Week 26 in phase 2, with normalization of serum calcium and phosphate and a 57% reduction in 24-hour urine calcium; phase 3 data confirm sustained biochemical control and quality-of-life improvements, and the agent is now FDA- and EMA-approved, which addresses the unmet need for more physiologic PTH exposure and lower pill burden [^117APkuw] [^1145CpJK] [^114nyQnc].

> Let me think about special populations and surgical prevention. In pregnancy and lactation, calcium and active vitamin D require careful titration to mid–low normal calcium to avoid maternal and fetal complications; in post-thyroidectomy care, early PTH within 24 hours helps risk-stratify, with PTH ≤ 15 pg/mL prompting supplementation and closer follow-up, and parathyroid autotransplantation should be considered for devascularized glands; preoperative vitamin D optimization reduces hypocalcemia risk and should be pursued when feasible [^113XxZ3x] [^117Ks59L] [^112SJeYS] [^112yxzFk].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought routine DXA might help track skeletal effects, but I should correct that. Routine DXA is not recommended for hypoparathyroidism monitoring because BMD is often high despite abnormal bone quality; instead, clinical assessment and targeted imaging for complications are preferred, so I need to ensure my follow-up plan avoids unnecessary bone density testing [^1113mTDi] [^115RQKfJ].

> Next, I should review a practical management algorithm and verify alignment with consensus. Start with calcium plus active vitamin D, titrate to low-normal calcium, monitor phosphate, magnesium, and renal function, and add thiazide or optimize magnesium if hypercalciuria persists; if control remains suboptimal or complications emerge, consider PTH replacement with rhPTH(1–84) or palopegteriparatide, with explicit counseling on injection technique, hypercalcemia monitoring, and REMS where applicable; throughout, incorporate structured tapering of supplements to avoid suppressing residual parathyroid function [^113XxZ3x] [^113a2EEe] [^112BAwqV].

> I need to ensure I address knowledge gaps and future directions. Longer-term randomized data comparing PTH therapies head-to-head, cost-effectiveness analyses, and definitive fracture outcome studies are still needed; emerging agents such as eneboparatide and calcilytics may expand options, particularly for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, so I should acknowledge these pipelines and the importance of patient-reported outcomes in evaluating new therapies [^113L92Lm] [^114nyQnc].

> Finally, let me reconsider the core message to ensure coherence. Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine deficiency state in which conventional calcium and active vitamin D therapy, while life-saving, incompletely restores physiology and imposes burdens that degrade quality of life; PTH replacement, especially with palopegteriparatide, offers a more physiologic, durable, and patient-centered approach for those inadequately controlled or intolerant, but requires careful selection, monitoring, and integration with surgical prevention and structured follow-up to optimize outcomes [^114tFU9o] [^113L92Lm] [^113XxZ3x].

---

Hypoparathyroidism is defined by **low or inappropriately normal PTH** with hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia [^114tFU9o], most often due to neck surgery, autoimmune disease, or genetic causes [^114tFU9o]. Diagnosis relies on **low calcium with low or inappropriately normal PTH**, and management centers on calcium and active vitamin D to maintain low-normal calcium, avoid hypercalciuria, and prevent renal complications [^111L7Zex]. PTH replacement (rhPTH 1–84 or palopegteriparatide) is considered when conventional therapy fails or causes complications [^113XxZ3x] [^113L92Lm]. Lifelong monitoring is essential to balance hypocalcemia control with the risks of hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and ectopic calcifications [^11153Fxr].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Hypoparathyroidism results from **insufficient PTH secretion or action**, disrupting calcium and phosphate homeostasis [^114tFU9o]. The most common causes include:

- **Postsurgical**: Accidental removal or devascularization of parathyroid glands during thyroid or parathyroid surgery [^1115D53H] [^111G9gay].
- **Autoimmune**: Isolated autoimmune hypoparathyroidism or as part of autoimmune polyglandular syndromes [^115uX8aH].
- **Genetic**: Mutations in genes such as GCM2, PTH, CASR, or GNA11 [^notfound].
- **Magnesium disorders**: Hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesemia impairing PTH secretion or action [^115uX8aH].

PTH normally increases serum calcium by stimulating bone resorption, renal calcium reabsorption, and intestinal calcium absorption via 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis. PTH deficiency leads to **hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria** [^114tFU9o].

---

## Clinical presentation

Clinical manifestations are primarily due to **hypocalcemia** and include:

- **Neuromuscular**: Tetany, paresthesias, muscle cramps, seizures, Chvostek and Trousseau signs [^113Vbd5C].
- **Cardiac**: QT prolongation, arrhythmias [^113Vbd5C].
- **Renal**: Hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal impairment [^111u5q85].
- **Neuropsychiatric**: Anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment [^11153Fxr] [^113Vbd5C] [^113uTUT8].
- **Ocular**: Cataracts, ectopic calcifications [^11153Fxr].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is established by **biochemical criteria**:

- **Low serum calcium**: Total or ionized calcium below the lower limit of normal [^113iMJU9].
- **Low or inappropriately normal PTH**: PTH level not appropriately elevated for the degree of hypocalcemia [^113iMJU9].
- **Hyperphosphatemia**: Elevated serum phosphate [^114tFU9o].
- **Normal or low 25-hydroxyvitamin D**: Rules out secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency [^notfound].

Additional tests may include **magnesium, renal function, and genetic testing** when indicated [^113iMJU9].

---

## Management

### Conventional therapy

Conventional therapy aims to maintain serum calcium in the low-normal range, avoid hypercalciuria, and prevent renal complications [^113uTUT8]. Key elements include **oral calcium supplements** (calcium carbonate or citrate) in divided doses [^115DAeFG], **active vitamin D analogues** (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) to enhance intestinal calcium absorption [^112tScWT], and adjuncts such as **thiazide diuretics** to reduce urinary calcium excretion and **magnesium supplementation** if low [^112vxCH5].

---

### PTH replacement therapy

PTH replacement is indicated for patients who cannot achieve adequate control with conventional therapy or who experience complications. Options include **recombinant human PTH (1–84)**, approved as adjunctive therapy to reduce calcium and active vitamin D requirements [^1114jmwb] [^113a2EEe], and **palopegteriparatide**, a long-acting PTH analog that provides sustained PTH levels, reduces urinary calcium, and improves quality of life [^113L92Lm] [^1145CpJK].

---

## Monitoring and complications

Regular monitoring is essential to balance calcium control with the risk of complications. Recommended monitoring includes serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and renal function every 3–6 months, **24-hour urinary calcium excretion annually**, and renal imaging if hypercalciuria or renal impairment is suspected [^1113mTDi]. Long-term complications include nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal impairment, ectopic calcifications, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^11153Fxr].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Hypoparathyroidism significantly impairs quality of life due to chronic symptoms, medication side effects, and the risk of complications. PTH replacement therapy has been shown to **improve quality of life** and reduce the burden of conventional therapy [^112CXA3p] [^113L92Lm].

---

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by low PTH, **hypocalcemia**, and hyperphosphatemia. Management involves calcium and **active vitamin D** supplementation, with **PTH replacement** considered for refractory cases. Lifelong monitoring is necessary to prevent complications and maintain quality of life [^114tFU9o].

### Hypoparathyroidism [^114tFU9o]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a disease characterized by inadequately low circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) resulting in low calcium levels and increased phosphate levels in the blood. Symptoms of the disease result from increased neuromuscular irritability caused by hypocalcaemia and include tingling, muscle cramps and seizures. The most common cause of the disease is inadvertent removal of, or injury to, the parathyroid glands during neck surgery, followed by genetic, idiopathic and autoimmune aetiologies. Conventional treatment includes activated vitamin D and/or calcium supplements, but this treatment does not fully replace the functions of PTH and can lead to short-term problems (such as hypocalcaemia, hypercalcaemia and increased urinary calcium excretion) and long-term complications (which include nephrocalcinosis, kidney stones and brain calcifications). PTH replacement has emerged as a new treatment option. Clinical trials using human PTH(1–34) and PTH(1–84) showed that this treatment was safe and effective in studies lasting up to 6 years. Recombinant human PTH(1–84) has been approved in the United States and Europe for the management of hypoparathyroidism; however, its effect on long-term complications is still being evaluated. Clinical practice guidelines, which describe the consensus of experts in the field, have been published and recognize the need for more research to optimize care. In this Primer, we summarize current knowledge of the prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of hypoparathyroidism.

### Signs and symptoms of hypoparathyroidism [^111vBt9m]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is associated with a spectrum of clinical manifestations in the acute and chronic settings, from mild to debilitating. Although the acute symptoms of hypocalcemia are primarily due to neuromuscular irritability, the chronic manifestations of hypoparathyroidism may be due to the disease itself or to complications of therapy or to both. The chronic complications of hypoparathyroidism can affect multiple organ systems, including the renal, neurologic, neuropsychiatric, skeletal, and immune systems. Further research is needed to determine the pathophysiology of complications in hypoparathyroidism and whether interventions can decrease the risk of these complications.

### Postoperative hypoparathyroidism: medical and surgical therapeutic options [^111G9gay]. Thyroid (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism occurs when the parathyroid glands, through lack of secretion of or resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH), are unable to maintain calcium homeostasis. Transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism are most commonly seen as complications of neck surgery, resulting from devascularization of the parathyroids, unintentional resection, or accidental coagulation of the parathyroids.

Summary

Although strategies for treatment of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism differ, the classical approach involves supplementation with calcium and vitamin D or its analogues with the major goal of achieving low normal serum calcium and normal serum phosphorus. There are a variety of calcium and vitamin D preparations available for use in the treatment of symptomatic hypoparathyroidism. In selecting the appropriate vitamin D sterol for treatment, it is important to consider the pharmocodynamics, the potency at the tissue level, the rapidity of action, and ease of reversal of toxicity. Drawbacks to conventional therapy, including narrow therapeutic window and propensity for hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia, have prompted investigation into alternatives, namely PTH replacement and parathyroid gland autotransplantation.

Conclusion

Long-term supplementation with vitamin D or its analogues and oral calcium is the mainstay of management of postoperative hypoparathyroidism; however, PTH replacement strategies with either PTH or parathyroid gland autotransplantation are emerging as alternative strategies to avoid the complications of conventional therapy.

### Standardizing the reporting of postoperative hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy: consensus statement from the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons, the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, and the international association of endocrine surgeons [^115paQoX]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism remains the most frequent complication following thyroid surgery, with reported incidence rates ranging from 14% to 60%. While the majority of cases are transient and resolve within weeks, a substantial proportion (up to 25%) progress to persistent hypoparathyroidism, defined by sustained reductions in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum calcium levels beyond 6–12 months after surgery.

Despite its prevalence and clinical impact, postoperative hypoparathyroidism continues to be variably defined across studies and institutions. Terminology such as 'postoperative parathyroid failure', 'protracted hypoparathyroidism', and 'permanent hypoparathyroidism' has been proposed to reflect the temporal evolution of the condition. However, the lack of standardized definitions and reporting criteria has hindered meaningful comparisons across clinical studies and limited the development of consistent management strategies.

Current approaches to hypoparathyroidism management range from short-term calcium and activated vitamin D supplementation to long-term replacement therapy and monitoring protocols. These variations underscore the need for a unified framework to guide diagnosis, classification, and treatment.

In addition to harmonizing definitions, there is a critical need to identify and standardize core variables that should be reported in surgical research related to hypoparathyroidism. These include biochemical parameters (for example PTH and calcium levels), timing of measurements, patient symptoms, and therapeutic interventions. Consistent reporting of these variables is essential to improve data comparability, facilitate meta-analyses, and guide evidence-based practice.

Furthermore, hypoparathyroidism has emerged as a key quality marker in thyroid surgery. Its incidence and severity reflect not only surgical technique and intraoperative decision-making but also perioperative care and long-term follow-up. Establishing robust metrics for hypoparathyroidism, such as rates of transient versus permanent hypoparathyroidism, time to recovery, and need for chronic supplementation, can serve as benchmarks for surgical performance and institutional outcomes.

In response to this gap, the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons (ESES), the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES), and the International Association of Endocrine Surgeons (IAES) collaborated to develop a consensus statement using a structured Delphi methodology. This initiative aims to standardize the reporting of hypoparathyroidism in clinical research and publications (including definitions, core variables to be reported, and quality markers and metrics of thyroid surgery related to hypoparathyroidism) and provide a globally accepted reference for clinicians and researchers in endocrine surgery.

### Medical management of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism [^112VZcPv]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a clinical update on the management of hypoparathyroidism with focus on postsurgical hypoparathyroidism.

Methods

Using PubMed, English-language literature was searched related to management of hypoparathyroidism after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. We discuss the incidence, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, early diagnosis, and treatment of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism.

Results

Hypoparathyroidism is a well-recognized complication after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Transient hypoparathyroidism occurs in 10% of patients who undergo total thyroidectomy. Less than half of patients who develop transient hypoparathyroidism after thyroid surgery develop permanent hypoparathyroidism. Postsurgical hypocalcemia resulting from inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion could cause neurologic complications and respiratory compromise. Calcium supplements and vitamin D analogues effectively treat hypocalcemia associated with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. Measurement of PTH after thyroid and parathyroid surgery allows early identification of patients likely to require calcium supplements and vitamin D analogue therapy. Early identification and appropriate management of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism prevent hypocalcemia-related complications and allow patients to be discharged from the hospital earlier. Patients who develop permanent hypoparathyroidism should receive appropriate follow-up care to monitor for long-term complications related to supplemental therapy. PTH replacement therapy is currently being evaluated for the treatment of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach involving an endocrinologist and surgeon is imperative to reduce the morbidity associated with hypoparathyroidism after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Supplemental therapy with calcium and vitamin D analogues is standard. New drugs currently in clinical trials offer promising treatment options.

### Presentation of hypoparathyroidism: etiologies and clinical features [^111AQnC5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Understanding the etiology, diagnosis, and symptoms of hypoparathyroidism may help to improve quality of life and long-term disease outcomes. This paper summarizes the results of the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Presentation of Hypoparathyroidism.

Evidence Acquisition

Experts convened in Florence, Italy, in May 2015 and evaluated the literature and recent data on the presentation and long-term outcomes of patients with hypoparathyroidism.

Evidence Synthesis

The most frequent etiology is surgical removal or loss of viability of parathyroid glands. Despite precautions and expertise, about 20–30% of patients develop transient and 1–7% develop permanent postsurgical hypoparathyroidism after total thyroidectomy. Autoimmune destruction is the main reason for nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism. Severe magnesium deficiency is an uncommon but correctable cause of hypoparathyroidism. Several genetic etiologies can result in the loss of parathyroid function or action causing isolated hypoparathyroidism or a complex syndrome with other symptoms apart from those of hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism. Neuromuscular signs or symptoms due to hypocalcemia are the main characteristics of the disease. Hyperphosphatemia can contribute to major long-term complications such as ectopic calcifications in the kidney, brain, eye, or vasculature. Bone turnover is decreased, and bone mass is increased. Reduced quality of life and higher risk of renal stones, renal calcifications, and renal failure are seen. The risk of seizures and silent or symptomatic calcifications of basal ganglia is also increased.

Conclusions

Increased awareness of the etiology and presentation of the disease and new research efforts addressing specific questions formulated during the meeting should improve the diagnosis, care, and long-term outcome for patients.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^111xV7xh]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism — incidence variability and definitional criteria are outlined as follows: Hypoparathyroidism is the most common complication of bilateral and re-operative thyroid operations. Reported rates are influenced by different time points after surgery, diverse electrolyte supplementation protocols, variable operation aggressiveness and surgeon expertise, and by variable use of clinical criteria including symptomatic versus asymptomatic hypocalcemia, biochemical criteria (serum parathyroid hormone [PTH] and/or calcium and/or ionized calcium), and treatment criteria (requirement for calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation). According to a recent meta-analysis, the median incidence of temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy ranges from 19% to 38% and 0% to 3%, respectively.

### Is calcium supplementation always needed in patients with hypoparathyroidism? [^114dU9KF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Oral calcium salts are recommended for the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), although dosimetry is variable between individual patients and clinicians. However, patient feedback on calcium salts can be negative, particularly due to gastrointestinal side effects and hypercalciuria-related complications. We begin with a clinical case of a HypoPT patient taking oral calcium salts following thyroid surgery, who requested support in reducing her dose of these with a view to stopping entirely. To evaluate her request, we first describe the usual treatment of HypoPT according to current guidance and then present data from (a) a case note review of a cohort of 24 HypoPT patients managed with a "no calcium" treatment regimen by single physician (b) a comprehensive online survey of HypoPT patients' treatment and experiences (n = 330). The case note review found that target range serum calcium levels were successfully achieved in all 24 patients since transitioning to a "no calcium" regimen, without any breakthrough hypocalcaemia-related symptoms, the development of new renal stones, the occurrence of calcium-related hospital admissions or the finding of significant hypercalciuria. The online survey identified 36% of HypoPT patients who continued to take activated vitamin D, but had discontinued calcium supplements. HypoPT patients not currently taking calcium reported a significantly lower prevalence of adverse effects and outcomes, both compared with their previous experiences whilst taking calcium and also compared with the 64% of patients who continued to take oral calcium. We conclude that, subject to methodological limitations, there are significant issues of tolerability arising from conventional calcium-based treatment regimens for patients with chronic HypoPT. For selected patients, it may be reasonable to facilitate a managed therapeutic transition to "no calcium" regimen, and we also propose that calcium-based regimes be prospectively evaluated against calcium-free (or calcium-low) alternatives.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^115RQKfJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone.

Methods

This review is an evidence-based summary of hypoparathyroidism in terms of relevant pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic concepts.

Results

Many clinical manifestations of hypoparathyroidism are due to the lack of the physiological actions of parathyroid hormone on its 2 major target organs: the skeleton and the kidney. The skeleton is inactive, accruing bone without remodeling it. The kidneys lose the calcium-conserving actions of parathyroid hormone and, thus, excrete a greater fraction of calcium. Biochemical manifestations, besides hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone, include hyperphosphatemia and low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Calcifications in the kidney, brain, and other soft tissues are common. Removal of, or damage to, the parathyroid glands at the time of anterior neck surgery is, by far, the most likely etiology. Autoimmune destruction of the parathyroid glands and other genetic causes represent most of the other etiologies. Conventional treatment with calcium and active vitamin D can maintain the serum calcium level but high doses may be required, adding to the risk of long-term soft tissue calcifications. The advent of replacement therapy with recombinant human PTH(1–84) represents a major step in the therapeutics of this disease.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of hypoparathyroidism have led to greater understanding of the disease itself and our approach to it.

### Hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, management and emerging therapies [^113L92Lm]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion or action and results in hypocalcaemia, and can lead to hyperphosphataemia and hypercalciuria. Most cases of hypoparathyroidism occur as a complication of surgery, with the remainder due to causes including autoimmune disease, genetic causes, infiltrative diseases, mineral deposition or due to abnormalities in serum levels of magnesium. Hypoparathyroidism can cause multisystem disease, with long-term complications resulting from ectopic calcification as well as renal complications with nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and renal impairment in addition to respiratory, cardiac or neurological manifestations. Conventional therapy consists of oral calcium salts and active vitamin D but it has limitations, including fluctuations in serum levels of calcium and a high pill burden, and can increase the risk of long-term complications. By contrast, PTH replacement therapy can effectively achieve normal serum levels of calcium, and lower serum levels of phosphate. The long-acting PTH analogue, palopegteriparatide, has been shown to normalize urine levels of calcium. In addition, PTH replacement therapy reduces the pill burden. Palopegteriparatide is also associated with improved quality of life in comparison to conventional therapy. This Review summarizes current recommendations regarding the pathophysiology, evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and also references the 2022 international hypoparathyroidism guidelines. Palopegteriparatide has now been approved as PTH replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism. Emerging therapies will also be presented in this Review.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism [^113XxZ3x]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia in the presence of a low or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone level. HypoPT is most commonly seen after neck surgery, which accounts for approximately 75% of cases, whereas approximately 25% have HypoPT due to nonsurgical causes. In both groups of patients, conventional therapy includes calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy aiming to maintain serum calcium concentration in the low normal or just below the normal reference range and normalize serum phosphorus, magnesium concentrations, and urine calcium levels. The limitations of conventional therapy include wide fluctuations in serum calcium, high pill burden, poor quality of life, and renal complications. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) replacement therapy may improve the biochemical profile in those in whom conventional therapy proves unsatisfactory. Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature, the panel made a graded recommendation suggesting conventional therapy as first line therapy rather than administration of PTH (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers use of PTH. Because pregnancy and lactation are associated with changes in calcium homeostasis, close monitoring is required during these periods with appropriate adjustment of calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy to ensure that serum calcium remains in the mid to low normal reference range in order to avoid maternal and fetal complications. Emerging therapies include molecules with prolonged PTH action as well as different mechanisms of action that may significantly enhance drug efficacy and safety. © 2022 The Authors.

### Update on hypoparathyroidism [^111JQGEM]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by low or insufficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and markedly reduced bone turnover. Despite being a rare disease, hypoparathyroidism has a profound impact on affected patients.

Recent Findings

Recent epidemiologic surveys demonstrate a prevalence of between 5.3 and 40/100000, confirming the orphan status of this disease. There is a female predominance, and anterior neck surgery is the most common etiology. Recent studies have better elucidated the chronic manifestations of the disease, impacting quality of life and multiple organ systems including the renal, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems. There are now data on longer term use of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH analogs.

Summary

This review focuses on recent contributions to the literature on the prevalence and epidemiology of the disease, risk of chronic manifestations, and treatment with PTH(1–34) and rhPTH(1–84). Further research is needed to determine the pathophysiology of complications in hypoparathyroidism and whether interventions can decrease future risk of these complications. In addition, further data are needed with regards to more physiologic dosing regimens and long-term treatment with PTH and PTH analogs.

Introduction

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder resulting from undetectable or inappropriately low circulating levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is the principal regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The main biochemical abnormalities resulting from PTH deficiency are hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is neck surgery (approximately 75% of cases). Guidelines from the European Society of Endocrinology; the First International Conference on the Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment of Hypoparathyroidism; and the Canadian-led international working group provide recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of chronic hypoparathyroidism in adults. Patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who are treated with conventional therapy consisting of calcium and active vitamin D supplements may still be inadequately controlled and have symptoms and risks of complications and comorbidities. In a 13-country patient and caregiver survey, the magnitude of symptom severity experienced by patients whose hypoparathyroidism was not adequately controlled despite receiving conventional therapy was associated with decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health status assessments and with increased caregiver burden. Evaluation of HRQoL in patients with hypoparathyroidism has proved challenging because of variability of symptoms and differing types of study designs. Many but not all studies found there is a substantial burden of illness that adversely affects HRQoL in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. A spectrum of symptomatology varying from no symptoms to severe symptoms was reported by patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism; in 36-item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36) data transformed on a 0−100 scale (lower scores indicating poorer health states) the scores ranged from 20 to > 80 in different domains.

Practical dosing and adjuncts include: "Oral calcium carbonate is widely available without prescription, usually well tolerated, and a typical postoperative dose is 1–2 g, 2–3 times daily with prompt dose escalation as required for symptom relief (excess ingestion is readily excreted)". If symptoms persist with oral calcium, "oral calcitriol should also be initiated, at a typical dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mcg twice daily", and laboratory evaluation can guide management: "Phosphorus level can help to distinguish between bone hunger (normal PO4) and hypoparathyroidism (elevated PO4). Magnesium and 25-OH vitamin D levels should also be checked". For severe cases, infusion is preferred: "Intravenous boluses of calcium are not recommended due to their short-lived effect; infusions of calcium over several hours are more effective and preferred".

### Efficacy and safety of parathyroid hormone replacement with transCon PTH in hypoparathyroidism: 26-week results from the phase 3 paTHway trial [^113uTUT8]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypoparathyroidism is an endocrine disease caused by insufficient or absent production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) with multiorgan involvement. Under normal physiological conditions, PTH and its downstream hormone calcitriol are the primary regulators of calcium and phosphate and act on the bone, kidney, and intestine. Hypoparathyroidism can lead to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. As a result, individuals with hypoparathyroidism may experience a range of severe and potentially life‐threatening short‐term and long‐term complications, including neuromuscular irritability, renal complications, and vascular calcifications. Cognitive impairment, perhaps independent of abnormalities in calcium levels, is also common. All of these are associated with reduced health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). The negative impact of these hypoparathyroidism symptoms on daily life and work productivity is substantial and underrecognized, despite published studies highlighting them.

Current consensus guidelines for the long‐term management of chronic hypoparathyroidism have identified six therapeutic goals: (i) prevent signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia; (ii) maintain the serum calcium concentration within or slightly below the normal range; (iii) maintain the calcium × phosphate product below 55 mg 2 /dL 2 (4.4 mmol 2 /L 2); (iv) avoid hypercalciuria; (v) avoid hypercalcemia; and (vi) avoid renal (nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis) and other extraskeletal calcifications. Conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism consists of active vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol or its analog alfacalcidol) and large quantities of calcium, and is associated with a substantial pill burden. Although conventional therapy targets hypocalcemia and its acute symptoms, it fails to restore the normal physiological effects of PTH. Additionally, long‐term conventional therapy may increase the filtered load of calcium and further elevate serum phosphorus thereby increasing the risk of nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and chronic kidney disease. Conventional therapy also does not improve HRQoL or the functional and mental health status of individuals with hypoparathyroidism.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) — definitions and diagnostic thresholds — Biochemical hypoPT is defined as a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level below the laboratory lower limit (usually 12 pg/mL) with hypocalcemia, while clinical hypoPT adds symptoms or signs of hypocalcemia; hypocalcemia itself is a total serum calcium below the center-specific reference range. Transient or temporary hypoPT lasts for less than six months after surgery, and permanent hypoPT continues beyond six months. The short half-life of PTH (3–5 minutes) contributes to postoperative vulnerability of parathyroid function. Parathyroid insufficiency (relative hypoPT) can occur after central neck surgery with symptoms despite normal laboratory values.

### Parathyroid hormone therapy for managing chronic hypoparathyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112CXA3p]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The efficacy and safety of parathyroid hormone (PTH) therapy for managing long-term hypoparathyroidism is being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available randomized controlled trials to investigate the benefits and harms of PTH therapy and conventional therapy in the management of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. To identify eligible studies, published in English, we searched Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to May 2022. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We defined patients' important outcomes and used grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) to provide the structure for quantifying absolute effects and rating the quality of evidence. Seven randomized trials of 12 publications that enrolled a total of 386 patients proved eligible. The follow-up duration ranged from 1 to 36 months. Compared with conventional therapy, PTH therapy probably achieves a small improvement in physical health-related quality of life (mean difference [MD] 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–5.3, minimally important difference 3.0, moderate certainty). PTH therapy results in more patients reaching 50% or greater reduction in the dose of active vitamin D and calcium (relative risk [RR] = 6.5, 95% CI 2.5–16.4, 385 more per 1000 patients, high certainty). PTH therapy may increase hypercalcemia (RR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2–5.04, low certainty). The findings may support the use of PTH therapy in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. Because of limitations of short duration and small sample size, evidence from randomized trials is limited regarding important benefits of PTH therapy compared with conventional therapy. Establishing such benefits will require further studies. © 2022 The Authors.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: present and future [^112mCDFU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Conventional management of hypoparathyroidism has focused upon maintaining the serum calcium with oral calcium and active vitamin D, often requiring high doses and giving rise to concerns about long-term consequences including renal and brain calcifications. Replacement therapy with PTH has recently become available. This paper summarizes the results of the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Management of Hypoparathyroidism.

Evidence Acquisition

Contributing authors reviewed the literature regarding physiology, pathophysiology, and nutritional aspects of hypoparathyroidism, management of acute hypocalcemia, clinical aspects of chronic management, and replacement therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH peptides. PubMed and other literature search engines were utilized.

Evidence Synthesis

Under normal circumstances, interactions between PTH and active vitamin D along with the dynamics of calcium and phosphorus absorption, renal tubular handing of those ions, and skeletal responsiveness help to maintain calcium homeostasis and skeletal health. In the absence of PTH, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skeleton are all affected, leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, reduced bone remodeling, and an inability to conserve filtered calcium. Acute hypocalcemia can be a medical emergency presenting with neuromuscular irritability. The recent availability of recombinant human PTH (1–84) has given hope that management of hypoparathyroidism with the missing hormone in this disorder will provide better control and reduced needs for calcium and vitamin D.

Conclusions

Hypoparathyroidism is associated with abnormal calcium and skeletal homeostasis. Control with calcium and active vitamin D can be a challenge. The availability of PTH (1–84) replacement therapy may usher new opportunities for better control with reduced supplementation requirements.

### A delicate balance: the challenges of hypoparathyroidism [^1143riWe]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

A 38-yr-old woman with chronic non-surgical hypoparathyroidism, managed elsewhere, presented to our practice with symptomatic hypocalcemia. At the age of 17, she began to suffer from muscle cramps, paresthesia, and ongoing diffuse pain. It took years before she was correctly diagnosed with hypoparathyroidism. Her symptoms were severe enough that she required emergency room visits several times a year. After she was properly diagnosed and started on calcium and calcitriol therapy, she continued to experience frequent episodes of severe hypocalcemia. She saw multiple healthcare providers who each introduced a new regimen. In addition, poor communication led to her discontinuing her medications altogether. As a result, her calcium levels remained consistently low, and she lost confidence in her prospect for better health. At the time of her visit to our clinic, she had discontinued calcitriol, was taking a large amount of oral calcium daily all at once, and had hypocalcemia. We addressed her concerns, and the challenges she faces with adherence to her medication regimen. We provided her with detailed information about the disease and the reasoning behind her treatment plan. Treatment was initiated with calcium carbonate 600 mg 3 times daily and calcitriol 0.5 mcg once daily. One week after treatment initiation, her test results showed improvement in her albumin-adjusted calcium, phosphorus, and 24-h urine calcium which were all within target range.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic hypoparathyroidism is a rare disease with a prevalence of 37 per 100,000. It usually arises due to operative trauma to the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy or other anterior neck surgery although a range of other causes are also seen including autoimmune, genetic, mineral deposition disorders and others. Acute hypoparathyroidism is conventionally defined as that which lasts less than 6 months after surgery and is terminated by spontaneous recovery of parathyroid function and chronic hypoparathyroidism is that lasting longer than 6 months and which rarely recovers. The major clinical manifestations of chronic hypoparathyroidism relate to hypocalcaemia and include tetany, paraesthesia, carpopedal spasm and muscular cramps. Other symptoms include impaired cognition, neuropsychological manifestations and reduced quality of life. Clinical manifestations may also arise due to complications of treatment, especially where this is insufficiently or inexpertly monitored and managed and may include the occurrence of nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and impairment of renal function. Unlike management of other endocrine deficiency states where treatment with hormone replacement therapy is the norm, individuals with chronic hypoparathyroidism are conventionally managed with activated vitamin D compounds in the form of alfacalcidol or calcitriol and oral calcium salts including calcium carbonate and others. The main risks of these treatments arise from insufficient biochemical monitoring and include symptomatic hypocalcaemia, iatrogenic hypercalcaemia and renal manifestations as described above. Treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone as hormone replacement therapy is now licensed in some areas of the world although the field is very much at the dawn of this era and there are still shortcomings and limitations of this treatment in its current form and further development is still required. Individuals with chronic hypoparathyroidism may experience suboptimal care with a high frequency of unplanned hospitalisationand occurrence of iatrogenic harm. In 2015 the European Society for Endocrinology published authoritative, evidence base consensus guidelines on the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism. Since this time other consensus guidelines on the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism have also been published. Specifically, these are: a summary statement and guideline from Brandi and colleagues in 2016and a Canadian and international consensus paper by Khan et al.in 2019. The main difference between these three documents reflects the accumulating evidence base supporting the use of rhPTH1‐84 in that Bollerslev et al.recommend against its use where as Brandi et al.and Khan et al.promote its use under specific circumstances and both documents provide specific evidence based recommendations for when to consider its use. Other differences between the documents are that Brandi et al.suggest the use of phosphate binders when needed and also propose key objectives for a future research agenda in the management of hypoparathyroidism and Khan et al.include a very useful section on the management of hypoparathyroidism in pregnancy and a detailed section summarising the evidence base around complications of treatment.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^116U98iF]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association — Table 4 key recommendations for prevention and management of hypoparathyroidism: Conduct surgery so as to avoid removal or devascularization of parathyroid tissue. Autotransplant devascularized or inadvertently removed parathyroid glands. Either treat at-risk patients empirically with calcium, or measure calcium and/or PTH in the immediate postoperative period and treat according to evidence-based protocols. Titrate calcium with or without calcitriol to maintain eucalcemia, and wean calcium and/or calcitriol when appropriate. Communication between providers is critical, since hypoPT may be prolonged and can negatively affect multiple organ systems. Inability to achieve independence from calcium by six months indicates permanent hypoPT. Recombinant human PTH analogues may be considered for patients with permanent hypoPT. Avoiding hypoPT is much less costly than treating hypoPT. Teriparatide acetate (recombinant human PTH 1–34; rhPTH[1–34]) is an approved treatment for osteoporosis, but it is currently being studied as a possible off-label treatment for postoperative hypoPT.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^117Ks59L]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association postoperative hypoparathyroidism — risk factors, thresholds, and management are summarized as follows: Hypoparathyroidism occurs when a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is accompanied by hypocalcemia. Risk factors for post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism include bilateral thyroid operations, autoimmune thyroid disease, central neck dissection, substernal goiter, surgeon inexperience, and malabsorptive conditions. Measurement of intraoperative or early postoperative PTH levels following thyroidectomy can help guide patient management, and in general, a postoperative PTH level ≤ 15 pg/mL indicates increased risk for acute hypoparathyroidism. Effective management of mild to moderate potential or actual postoperative hypoparathyroidism can be achieved by administering either empiric/prophylactic oral calcium and vitamin D, selective oral calcium and vitamin D based on rapid postoperative PTH level(s), or serial serum calcium levels as a guide for supplementation; for more severe hypocalcemia, inpatient management may be necessary. Permanent hypoparathyroidism has long-term consequences for both objective and subjective well-being, and should be prevented whenever possible.

### Management of postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism and its effect on hypocalcemia-related complications: a meta-analysis [^111WTGw3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this Meta-analysis is to evaluate the impact of different treatment strategies for early postoperative hypoparathyroidism on hypocalcemia-related complications and long-term hypoparathyroidism.

Data Sources

Embase.com, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the top 100 references of Google Scholar were searched to September 20, 2022.

Review Methods

Articles reporting on adult patients who underwent total thyroidectomy which specified a treatment strategy for postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism were included. Random effect models were applied to obtain pooled proportions and 95% confidence intervals. Primary outcome was the occurrence of major hypocalcemia-related complications. Secondary outcome was long-term hypoparathyroidism.

Results

Sixty-six studies comprising 67 treatment protocols and 51,096 patients were included in this Meta-analysis. In 8 protocols (3806 patients), routine calcium and/or active vitamin D medication was given to all patients directly after thyroidectomy. In 49 protocols (44,012 patients), calcium and/or active vitamin D medication was only given to patients with biochemically proven postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. In 10 protocols (3278 patients), calcium and/or active vitamin D supplementation was only initiated in case of clinical symptoms of hypocalcemia. No patient had a major complication due to postoperative hypocalcemia. The pooled proportion of long-term hypoparathyroidism was 2.4% (95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.0). There was no significant difference in the incidence of long-term hypoparathyroidism between the 3 supplementation groups.

Conclusions

All treatment strategies for postoperative hypocalcemia prevent major complications of hypocalcemia. The early postoperative treatment protocol for postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism does not seem to influence recovery of parathyroid function in the long term.

The approach utilized a systematic review of the medical literature executed with specifically designed criteria that focused on the etiologies and pathogenesis of hypoparathyroidism. Enhanced attention by endocrine surgeons to new knowledge about parathyroid gland viability are reviewed along with the role of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) monitoring during and after neck surgery. Nonsurgical etiologies account for a significant proportion of cases of hypoparathyroidism (~25%), and among them, genetic etiologies are key. Given the pervasive nature of PTH deficiency across multiple organ systems, a detailed review of the skeletal, renal, neuromuscular, and ocular complications is provided. The burden of illness on affected patients and their caregivers contributes to reduced quality of life and social costs for this chronic endocrinopathy. © 2022 The Authors.

Post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism — early supplementation (Statement 4): Patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism within 24 h after surgery should have oral calcium supplementation with or without an active vitamin D analogue started before discharge to reduce the risk of developing clinical manifestations of hypocalcaemia, supported by consensus and a moderate evidence level.

### Conventional treatment of hypoparathyroidism [^115DAeFG]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Conventional therapy of hypoparathyroidism consists of oral calcium and either activated vitamin D or vitamin D supplements at varying doses. Although adjusting dosing of calcium and/or activated vitamin D or vitamin D itself, the serum calcium should be obtained weekly or monthly depending on the clinical situation. Calcium supplementation in hypoparathyroidism usually consists of calcium carbonate because it is 40% elemental calcium by weight. However, calcium citrate (21% elemental calcium) is indicated for patients with achlorhydria and proton pump inhibitor therapy. Many clinicians prefer to uptitrate the activated form of vitamin D to reduce the amount of calcium supplementation.

Post-thyroidectomy monitoring — calcium measurement and follow-up: Serum calcium levels (albumin-adjusted and/or ionized) should also be measured. In patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism and/or low serum calcium levels and/or manifestations of hypocalcaemia, measurements of calcium should be repeated as necessary to assure diagnosis and to allow tailoring of calcium and/or active vitamin D analogue supplements. To prevent iatrogenic suppression of PTH, excessive calcium intake, and potential renal complications, thyroid surgeons should proactively recommend a structured tapering strategy for supplementation.

### Safety and efficacy of 5 years of treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone in adults with hypoparathyroidism [^111hiVMH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

PTH plays a central role in mineral homeostasis by stimulating renal reabsorption of calcium, promoting renal phosphate excretion, and stimulating conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH] 2 D), the fully active form of vitamin D. Moreover, 1,25[OH] 2 D enhances absorption of calcium and phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, PTH is a potent regulator of bone turnover (i.e. the coupled process of bone resorption and bone formation); deficiency of PTH results in decreased bone turnover. Conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism includes oral calcium and active vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol), as well as thiazide diuretics and magnesium supplementation as needed. Although this approach can correct the hypocalcemia associated with hypoparathyroidism, it does not replace other functions of PTH and can lead to or worsen hypercalciuria. Other concerns with conventional therapy include unpredictable episodes of hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia; increased serum calcium-phosphorus (Ca × P) product; and complications such as extraskeletal calcifications, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and decreased kidney function (,–). Reduced quality of life and symptoms of hypocalcemia are consistent findings among patients with hypoparathyroidism receiving conventional treatment.

### Initial assessment and monitoring of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism: a systematic current practice survey [^112SGMJi]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is associated with significant morbidity and impaired quality of life (QoL). The goals of management for chronic HypoPT include improvement in QoL and the prevention of both hypo- and hypercalcemia symptoms and long-term complications. Several groups have provided consensus statements and guidelines on the management of HypoPT; however, due to limited evidence, these recommendations have largely been based on literature reviews, expert opinion, and consensus statements. The objective of this study was to use a systematic approach to describe current practice for the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with chronic HypoPT. We developed a survey asking experts in the field to select the responses that best reflect their current practice. The survey found no differences in responses between nonsurgical and postsurgical patient assessment. For new patients, respondents usually performed an assessment of serum lab profile (calcium [either albumin-adjusted or ionized], magnesium, creatinine, phosphate, 25-hydroxyvitamin D), 24-hour urine (creatinine, calcium), and a renal ultrasound to evaluate for the presence of nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. For follow-up patients, most respondents perform blood tests and urine tests every 6months or less frequently. The reported clinical practice patterns for monitoring for complications of chronic HypoPT vary considerably among respondents. Based on the responses in this systematic expert practice survey, we provide practice suggestions for initial assessment and follow-up of patients with chronic HypoPT. In addition, we highlight areas with significant variation in practice and identify important areas for future research. © 2022 The Authors.

### Hypoparathyroidism: genetics and diagnosis [^113iMJU9]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

This narrative report summarizes diagnostic criteria for hypoparathyroidism and describes the clinical presentation and underlying genetic causes of the nonsurgical forms. We conducted a comprehensive literature search from January 2000 to January 2021 and included landmark articles before 2000, presenting a comprehensive update of these topics and suggesting a research agenda to improve diagnosis and, eventually, the prognosis of the disease. Hypoparathyroidism, which is characterized by insufficient secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) leading to hypocalcemia, is diagnosed on biochemical grounds. Low albumin-adjusted calcium or ionized calcium with concurrent inappropriately low serum PTH concentration are the hallmarks of the disease. In this review, we discuss the characteristics and pitfalls in measuring calcium and PTH. We also undertook a systematic review addressing the utility of measuring calcium and PTH within 24 hours after total thyroidectomy to predict long-term hypoparathyroidism. A summary of the findings is presented here; results of the detailed systematic review are published separately in this issue of JBMR. Several genetic disorders can present with hypoparathyroidism, either as an isolated disease or as part of a syndrome. A positive family history and, in the case of complex diseases, characteristic comorbidities raise the clinical suspicion of a genetic disorder. In addition to these disorders' phenotypic characteristics, which include autoimmune diseases, we discuss approaches for the genetic diagnosis. © 2022 The Authors.

This systematic review was prepared in consultation with an experienced medical librarian who executed a comprehensive search in PubMed and Embase. The complete search strings are supplied in Fig. 1. All articles from the database search were added to a reference manager, and duplicates were removed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed to screen articles by abstract using two independent reviewers (KW and CY). Inclusion criteria included articles with publication dates from 1980 to 2020, in the English language, and with primary data and a focus on etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism. Exclusion criteria included any article not primarily focusing on the etiology or pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism, and those with a primary focus on genetic etiologies of hypoparathyroidism were excluded because that topic is covered elsewhere. Conference abstracts, opinion pieces, commentaries, letters, and case reports were excluded. The full text of articles selected by title and abstract screening were reviewed using the same criteria and methods. Articles retained for analysis underwent cited reference searching. Articles from cited reference searching and those recommended by experts were included if they met the above inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results are presented in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram and articles were further categorized according to subtopic (Fig. 1). A meta-analysis was not performed given the noninterventional nature of the data collected.

### Etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism: a narrative review [^117T4D3G]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is essential for calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) homeostasis through its direct actions on bone resorption, kidney transport of Ca and P, and indirect actions to increase intestinal Ca absorption through enhanced 1,25 (OH) 2 vitamin D [1,25(OH) 2 D] production. A rare disorder of impaired or inadequate PTH secretion, hypoparathyroidism, leads to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and the clinical consequences described herein. These consequences result from the lack of PTH and the resulting mineral disturbances on multiple tissues.

The estimated prevalence of hypoparathyroidism is ~23 to 37 cases per 100,000 person-years. Approximately 25% of cases arise from genetic or metabolic disorders, autoimmune destruction, or infiltration of the glands (Table 1). Transient hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia can also occur with magnesium (Mg) depletion or excess. Many cases remain idiopathic. Most commonly, however, ~75% of cases of hypoparathyroidism are iatrogenic following neck surgery.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — long-term targets and supplementation: Serum calcium should be maintained in the low normal reference range and serum phosphorus should be maintained no higher than the upper normal range; recommendations for 24-hour urine calcium excretion < 7.5 mmol/day and calcium-phosphorus product < 55 mg2/dL2 have been advocated. Calciphylaxis mortality approaches 45–50%. Calcium supplementation doses up to 3500 mg of elemental calcium per day have been reported, with most patients requiring 1500 mg daily, and therapy in two to three divided doses provides the best absorption. Calcitriol is usually recommended, with most patients requiring 0.25 to 0.5 µg of calcitriol daily (0.25–4.0 µg/day).

Definitions — temporary and permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism: Temporary postoperative hypoparathyroidism is a condition that usually resolves within the first 6 months after surgery (but sometimes can last up to 12 months) with PTH and serum calcium levels within the reference range, without calcium and/or active vitamin D analogue supplements. Permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism is a condition that continues for more than 12 months after surgery with persistently low serum calcium levels if not supplemented; the PTH level can be undetectable, low, or inappropriately low, and to assure the diagnosis of this condition, there should be an attempt at stopping supplements within 12 months after surgery.

### Chronic hypoparathyroidism-current and emerging therapies [^114nyQnc]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by low serum calcium due to insufficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) and results in significant complications. Conventional treatment for hypoparathyroidism with calcium salts and activated vitamin D has limitations such as inadequate control of symptomatic hypocalcemia and large pill burden. PTH replacement therapy offers a more physiologic alternative to conventional therapy. PTH (1–34) has a short half-life of 1 hour and is used off-label for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism. rhPTH (1–84) has a half life of 3 hours and improves symptom control but its production is being halted due to manufacturing issues. Palopegteriparatide has a 60-hour half life and results in an infusion like PTH release profile. This molecule is effective in lowering urinary calcium, maintaining serum eucalcemia, lowering serum phosphate and reducing pill burden and is now approved by the FDA and EMA. Emerging therapies include Eneboparatide which is currently being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials. Encalaret is a calcilytic molecule which is in phase 3 clinical trials and is a promising molecule for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1. New molecules include an oral PTH1receptor agonist which is in phase 1 clinical trials. A weekly PTH molecule is also being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — monitoring and timing after thyroidectomy requires anticipating the delayed calcium nadir and structured labs, as the nadir may occur 24–72 hours after thyroidectomy; postoperative measurement of absolute values and trends of total or ionized calcium blood levels are the mainstays of clinical monitoring, and at least one perioperative serum albumin level should be measured to allow calculation of corrected calcium; the cost of measuring ionized calcium level can be significantly higher than measuring serum calcium.

Treatment of early/mild to moderate hypoparathyroidism — patients whose PTH is < 15 pg/mL, serum calcium is < 8.5 mg/dL, or ionized Ca is < 1.1 mmol/L should be considered for postoperative oral calcium supplementation; a regimen of 400–1200 mg per day of elemental calcium (1–3 g of calcium carbonate; i.e., 2–6 TUMS per day) or the equivalent in calcium citrate (2000–6000 mg per day) administered orally in divided doses is usually sufficient; calcium carbonate (40% elemental calcium) and calcium citrate (21% elemental calcium) are the most common salts and should be taken with meals, with calcium carbonate requiring an acidic environment to dissolve; patients on proton pump inhibitors, elderly patients with achlorhydria, and gastric bypass patients may be better treated with calcium citrate; levothyroxine should be taken one hour before or three hours after calcium salts are taken; the prolonged period of fasting during sleep may contribute to early morning hypocalcemia if oral calcium is prescribed three times daily rather than every eight hours.

### Etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism: a narrative review [^115dGLCv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Resolution of parathyroid insufficiency occurs in the majority (70% to 80%) of patients within 1 month following surgery. Patients who still require supplement therapy due to persistently low or absent iPTH after 1 month are considered to have protracted postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. The prevalence of protracted postsurgical hypoparathyroidism varies from 13% to 44%. Others have demonstrated that the rate of protracted postsurgical hypoparathyroidism depends on the number of glands left in situ, ranging from 13% to 15% when all four glands remain in situ, to 40% to 44% when two or fewer remain in situ. The probability of recovering parathyroid function over the next 12 months is approximately 75%.

There is lack of consensus on the definition of permanent postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. Most investigators and guidelines use the need for Ca salts and active vitamin D therapy at 6 or 12 months. Permanent postsurgical hypoparathyroidism includes three distinct subcategories (Table 2). Approximately 10% to 15% of cases recover after 1 year.

### New directions in treatment of hypoparathyroidism [^116WxBx7]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The history of parathyroid hormone (PTH) replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism begins in 1929. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved recombinant human PTH(1–84) [rhPTH(1–84)] as a treatment for hypoparathyroidism. Long-term studies of rhPTH(1–84), up to 6 years, have demonstrated continued efficacy of this replacement agent. Approaches to optimize PTH treatment in hypoparathyroidism include subcutaneous pump delivery systems, long-lived carrier molecules, and long-acting PTH analogues that show promise to prolong efficacy. Calcilytic compounds have been explored as a treatment for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia. Calcilytics are negative modulators of the calcium-sensing receptor and may present a therapeutic opportunity to increase endogenous PTH synthesis and secretion.

Discussion

Through a systematic analysis of all published clinical trials, we collated the largest group to date of patients treated with PTH‐receptor agonists and demonstrated their efficacy in restoring serum phosphate levels, reducing calcium excretion and reactivating bone turnover — all issues that are not addressed by any alternative treatment. These therapies also enabled the reduction or discontinuation of oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and had a relatively good safety profile.

The first clinical study on PTH replacement therapy in hypoparathyroidism dates back to 1996. Despite the 25 years elapsed since then, very few randomized trials have been conducted to date, and none have compared PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84. Given the rarity of this disease, the few trials conducted were small in size and heterogeneous in outcomes or design, limiting the ability to draw robust conclusions. PTH replacement therapy is not currently used as standard clinical practice according to the European guidelines. However, although the conventional therapies are generally able to control hypocalcaemia, they leave several clinical issues unaddressed: hyperphosphatemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis are a significant burden for many patients, for whom PTH treatment might well be a better alternative.

One of the concerns in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism with calcium and calcitriol supplements is the delicate balance between overtreatment and symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Our meta‐analysis showed PTH replacement therapy could be considered neither superior nor inferior to oral supplements in controlling serum calcium levels. This may be because the patients enrolled in clinical trials were mostly on target for calcium at the baseline, and their oral calcium supplements were significantly reduced or discontinued during studies. It is worth noticing that studies were heterogenous in duration. We showed that PTH therapies are safe with respect to the risk of hypocalcemic or hypercalcemic episodes.

An unmet need in hypoparathyroidism is combating the associated rise in serum phosphate levels, which are largely unaffected by conventional therapies. Active vitamin D is unable to match the phosphaturic action of PTH and can even worsen hyperphosphatemia, by promoting intestinal phosphate absorption. Our meta‐analysis revealed a large posttreatment reduction in serum phosphate and a significant difference between patients receiving PTH therapies and controls. PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84 showed a similar efficacy in lowering serum phosphate.

American Thyroid Association — long-term consequences and monitoring in hypoPT: Long-standing hypoPT may substantially impact quality of life, with consequences including nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, basal ganglia calcification, ectopic soft tissue calcification, cataracts, and potential defects in bone metabolism; in rare instances renal failure requiring hemodialysis or renal transplantation may occur. To avoid this complication, periodic renal ultrasound and 24-hour urine calcium measurement are important. Standard DXA testing is not effective for this risk assessment, and patients with hypoPT often report increased anxiety and decreased sense of well-being compared with controls.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — mechanisms — The mechanisms underlying hypoPT relate to disruption of parathyroid arterial supply or venous drainage, mechanical injury, thermal or electrical injury, and partial or complete removal; normal parathyroid function requires a rich blood supply, and the parathyroid blood supply is both delicate and complex, requiring close attention during thyroidectomy to preserve it. Impaired PTH secretion produces postoperative hypocalcemia through inhibition of bone resorption, reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis by the kidneys, and reduced intestinal calcium absorption.

There are several limitations affecting the results of this meta‐analysis, mostly in relation to the small number and the heterogeneity of the studies. However, hypoparathyroidism is a rare disease, and a relatively small sample size is to be expected. Several trials provided results from the same cohort in different reports. Because this has to be avoided in a rigorous meta‐analysis, we also reduced the number of eligible studies included. We made a significant effort to identify overlapping cohorts, enabling us to focus on high‐quality data. Unfortunately, over the years several patients have participated in different clinical trials and cannot be considered naïve to PTH treatment on enrollment in a given study. Moreover, not all studies reported similar outcomes or full baseline and posttreatment values, further narrowing the available evidence. There are also several important differences in titration regimens, dosing, and inclusion criteria that contribute to the heterogeneity of the results, possibly masking differences and reducing their generalizability. Furthermore, the data could not be analyzed in relation to different etiologies of hypoparathyroidism, which could be a confounding factor. A recent study by Winer and colleagues found that patients with genetic mutations required higher doses of PTH 1−34 than did patients with postsurgical or idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. Finally, most of the studies were sponsored, with only 10 nonprofit studies included.

### Safety and efficacy of oral human parathyroid hormone (1–34) in hypoparathyroidism: an open-label study [^115AxDsu]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is a rare mineral metabolism disorder, with a prevalence of 22 per 100,000 individuals (1) and is biochemically characterized by low serum calcium and low or undetectable parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The leading cause of hypoPT in adults is iatrogenic, typically secondary to excision or injury incurred during anterior neck surgery. (2) Less common etiologies include autoimmune disease, congenital absence, and genetic disorders resulting in defective biosynthesis or secretion of the hormone. (3) The characteristic hypocalcemia in hypoPT is due to PTH levels insufficient to adequately mobilize calcium from bone, reabsorb filtered calcium from the distal nephron, or increase intestinal calcium absorption by stimulating renal 25‐hydroxyvitamin D 1α‐hydroxylase activity and subsequent 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D) synthesis. Hyperphosphatemia develops due to the loss of the phosphaturic effect of PTH. (4)

### Etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism: a narrative review [^111VRn6B]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Between 70% to 80% of cases of postoperative parathyroid failure will recover within 1 month after thyroidectomy. Serum Ca, P, and iPTH should be checked within 2 weeks to determine whether parathyroid function has recovered and replacement therapy can be terminated. The chances of parathyroid recovery are dependent on the number of parathyroid glands remaining in situ and s-Ca and iPTH levels. Detectable iPTH, four glands left in situ, and serum Ca > 2.25 mmol/L (9.00 mg/dL) at 1 month after surgery are favorable predictors of recovery. (,–)

Follow-up strategies beyond 1 postoperative month of protracted hypoparathyroidism are important, as many patients will recover over the course of the year (75%), and up to 12% beyond 1 year. Monthly iPTH and s-Ca measurements for at least 12 months are suggested, to diagnose persistence of hypoparathyroidism or recovery of the parathyroid function.

Nonsurgical etiologies of hypoparathyroidism

Approximately 25% of adults with hypoparathyroidism have a developmental, genetic, autoimmune, metabolic, or environmental condition that impairs either the secretion or action of PTH or alters parathyroid gland mass (Table 1). Medical hypoparathyroidism is particularly important in pediatric patients. Functional hypoparathyroidism can be broadly categorized as a condition in which hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are the consequence of a disorder that (i) impairs development or survival of parathyroid glands, (ii) decreases secretion of biologically active PTH, or (iii) reduces target organ responsiveness to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism).

Genetic disorders

The genetic disorders that are associated with hypoparathyroidism are discussed more fully elsewhere (see manuscript for Task Force 3).

Hypoparathyroidism is a metabolic disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and inadequate levels of or function of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The authors review the nonsurgical or medical causes of hypoparathyroidism. The most common of the nonsurgical causes is autoimmune destruction of the parathyroid. Magnesium deficiency or excess can cause a functional hypoparathyroidism. Genetic conditions result in hypoparathyroidism as part of a syndrome or in isolation. Pseudohypoparathyroidism reflects a resistance to PTH. Infiltrative, metastatic, radiation destruction, mineral deposition, or idiopathic are uncommon causes of hypoparathyroidism. This article reviews the causes of hypoparathyroidism and an approach to the evaluation of this condition.

The standard treatment of hypoPT with oral calcium supplementation and calcitriol (or an analog), intended to control hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia and avoid hypercalciuria, remains challenging for both patients and clinicians. Loss of renal PTH action decreases renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate, causing hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia, respectively. (5) Thus, patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism have been found to have an increased risk of renal complications, such as nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, and often ectopic calcification in other organs. Titration of calcium and calcitriol dose is often slow and imprecise and may require frequent dose adjustments. In addition, the intake of supplements multiple times throughout the day is inconvenient and often causes gastrointestinal intolerance. (6) PTH deficiency leads to low bone turnover and markedly altered microarchitectural and biomechanical properties of the skeleton that result in structural and dynamic skeletal defects that are not addressed by calcium supplements and active vitamin D therapy. (7, 8) Standard treatment is titrated to achieve blood calcium levels that are at the lower limit of normal to reduce the risk of hypercalciuria and ectopic calcification. (9) Patients have repeatedly reported quality of life problems such as altered mood and cognition, which may be caused by the relatively low blood calcium provided by standard treatment. (10, 11, 12) Replacement therapy with PTH has the potential advantages of reducing the high dose of calcium supplements, providing better correction of hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia and decreasing urine calcium. With these potential advantages, treatment of PTH deficiency with PTH is compelling.

Preoperative vitamin D deficiency — In planned bilateral thyroid operations, preoperative serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 25‑hydroxy vitamin D testing can be helpful; if calcium is low normal or below normal the risk of hypoparathyroidism is increased and scheduled oral calcium may be appropriate. Vitamin D deficiency categories are severe (< 10 ng/mL), moderate (10 to < 20), or mild (20–30), and to optimize postoperative oral calcium absorption it is prudent to treat vitamin D deficiency preoperatively. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved regimen is 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) weekly or 6000 IU daily for eight weeks. Given the present evidence, it would appear preferable to diagnose vitamin D deficiency and initiate appropriate corrective supplementation prior to surgery, and in elective bilateral thyroid surgery it may be prudent to defer surgery in order to correct severe vitamin D deficiency.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with hypoparathyroidism [^111u5q85]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Despite tremendous interest in hypoparathyroidism, large cohort studies describing typical treatment patterns, laboratory parameters, and rates of complications are lacking.

Objective

Our objective was to characterize the course of disease in a large cohort of hypoparathyroid patients.

Design and Setting

We conducted a chart review of patients with permanent hypoparathyroidism identified via a clinical patient data registry. Patients were seen at a Boston tertiary-care hospital system between 1988 and 2009.

Patients

We identified 120 patients. Diagnosis was confirmed by documented hypocalcemia with a simultaneous low or inappropriately normal PTH level for at least 1 yr. Mean age at the end of the observation period was 52 ± 19 (range 2–87) yr, and the cohort was 73% female.

Main Outcome Measure

We evaluated serum and urine laboratory results and renal and brain imaging.

Results

We calculated time-weighted average serum calcium measurements for all patients. The time-weighted average for calcium was between 7.5 and 9.5 mg/dl for the majority (88%) of patients. Using linear interpolation, we estimated the proportion of time within the target calcium range for each patient with a median of 86% (interquartile range 67–98%). Of those with a 24-h urine collection for calcium (n = 53), 38% had at least one measurement over 300 mg/d. Of those with renal imaging (n = 54), 31% had renal calcifications, and 52% of those with head imaging (n = 31) had basal ganglia calcifications. Rates of chronic kidney disease stage 3 or higher were 2- to 17-fold greater than age-appropriate norms.

Conclusions

Hypoparathyroidism and its treatment carry a large burden of disease. Renal abnormalities are particularly common.

Treatment standards: (1) Recommend treatment of all patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism with an albumin adjusted serum calcium level < 2.0 mmol/L; (2) Recommend the use of activated vitamin D analogues plus calcium supplements in divided doses as the primary therapy; (3) Recommend against the routine use of replacement therapy with PTH or PTH analogues; (4) Recommend vitamin D supplementation in a daily dose of 400–800 IU to patients treated with activated vitamin D analogues.
Monitoring standards: (5) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of albumin adjusted serum calcium (e.g. every 3–6 months); (6) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of serum phosphate (e.g. every 3–6 months); (7) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of serum magnesium (e.g. every 3–6 months); (8) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of creatinine (e.g. every 3–6 months); (9) Recommend routine monitoring of estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) (e.g. every 3–6 months); (10) Recommend routine assessment of symptoms of hypocalcaemia and hypercalcaemia at regular time intervals (e.g. every 3–6 months); (11) Suggest considering monitoring of 24 h urinary calcium excretion at regular intervals (1–2 yearly); (12) Recommend renal imaging if a patient has symptoms of renal stone disease or if serum creatinine levels start to rise; (13) Advise against routine monitoring of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.

### Standardizing the reporting of postoperative hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy: consensus statement from the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons, the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, and the international association of endocrine surgeons [^114kdRKF]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Early substitution with oral calcium and active vitamin D should be routinely initiated in patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism within 24 h post-surgery. This approach was shown to reduce the risk of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, including muscle cramps, paraesthesia, and cardiac irritability, and supported safe discharge planning. Use of standardized supplementation protocols should be helpful to prevent under-treatment and avoid emergency hospital readmissions. Sessa et al.compared three protocols for preventing symptomatic hypocalcaemia after total thyroidectomy: PTH-driven selective postoperative supplementation with calcium and active vitamin D (calcitriol); high-dose routine preoperative and postoperative supplementation; and low-dose routine preoperative and postoperative supplementation. High-dose routine preoperative and postoperative supplementation resulted in the shortest hospital stays and the lowest rate of symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Although overall hypocalcaemia rates were similar across groups, PTH-driven selective supplementation alone had significantly more symptomatic cases. No readmission for hypoparathyroidism or hypercalcaemia occurred in the study. High-dose routine preoperative supplementation was deemed the most effective and safest approach, making it the protocol recommended by Sessa et al. In addition, maintaining appropriate serum magnesium levels is essential for PTH function. Low intracellular magnesium impairs PTH responsiveness due to its role as a cofactor for adenylate cyclase, while elevated serum magnesium may suppress PTH synthesis and secretion by activating the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR).

Statement 4: Patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism within 24 h after surgery should have oral calcium supplementation with or without an active vitamin D analogue started before discharge to reduce the risk of developing clinical manifestations of hypocalcaemia.

Consensus: Yes (8.311)

Outliers: 8

Negative outliers: 1

Evidence level: Moderate

Statement 4A: Serum calcium levels (albumin-adjusted and/or ionized) should also be measured.

Consensus: Yes (7.800)

Outliers: 11

Negative outliers: 7

Evidence level: Moderate

Adjustment protocols for calcium and vitamin D supplementation vary widely among external follow-up providers, leading to inconsistent management. To prevent iatrogenic suppression of PTH, excessive calcium intake, and potential renal complications, thyroid surgeons should proactively recommend a structured tapering strategy for supplementation.

### PaTH forward: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of transCon PTH in adult hypoparathyroidism [^117APkuw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). TransCon PTH is an investigational long-acting prodrug of PTH(1–34) for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism.

Objective

This work aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of daily TransCon PTH in adults with hypoparathyroidism.

Methods

This phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week trial with open-label extension enrolled 59 individuals with hypoparathyroidism. Interventions included TransCon PTH 15, 18, or 21 µg PTH(1–34)/day or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a 22-week extension during which TransCon PTH dose was titrated (6–60 µg PTH[1–34]/day).

Results

By Week 26, 91% of participants treated with TransCon PTH achieved independence from standard of care (SoC, defined as active vitamin D = 0 μg/day and calcium [Ca] ≤ 500 mg/day). Mean 24-hour urine Ca (uCa) decreased from a baseline mean of 415 mg/24h to 178 mg/24h by Week 26 (n = 44) while normal serum Ca (sCa) was maintained and serum phosphate and serum calcium-phosphate product fell within the normal range. By Week 26, mean scores on the generic 36-Item Short Form Health Survey domains increased from below normal at baseline to within the normal range. The Hypoparathyroidism Patient Experience Scale symptom and impact scores improved through 26 weeks. TransCon PTH was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious or severe adverse events.

Conclusion

TransCon PTH enabled independence from oral active vitamin D and reduced Ca supplements (≤ 500 mg/day) for most participants, achieving normal sCa, serum phosphate, uCa, serum calcium-phosphate product, and demonstrating improved health-related quality of life. These results support TransCon PTH as a potential hormone replacement therapy for adults with hypoparathyroidism.

### Changes in treatment needs for chronic postoperative hypoparathyroidism during initiation of conventional treatment compared to stable phase of treatment [^115UQFJ8]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

A characteristic among HypoPT patients seen in this study was the sudden changes in treatment needs due to fluctuations in calcium levels in the blood, which also is well known from other studies suggesting biochemistry to be monitored at regular intervals (every 3–6 months) and weekly after changes in treatment. It is poorly understood how some of the symptoms and long‐term complications among HypoPT patients occur, but fluctuations in calcium and phosphate levels are presumably associated with an increased risk of long‐term complications. Increased levels of calcium and calcium‐phosphate product in the blood are associated with impaired renal function, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and renal failure. Moreover, a recent review by Mannstadt et alshows that conventional treatment increases the risk of hypercalciuria due to increased excretion of calcium in the urine caused by the lack of PTH‐induced reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys. This study was from the United States where high doses of calcium are used relative to active vitamin D, which might explain the higher risk of hypercalciuria.

More studies are needed to investigate why sudden variations in the needed treatment occur. Replacement therapy with full‐length (1–84) recombinant human (rh) PTH has been available for treatment of HypoPT in the United States and the European Union for the last couple of years and evidence have shown it to be useful especially for those who require high doses of calcium and alfacalcidol. It would be of relevance to investigate whether patients treated with the missing hormone (rh‐PTH) or patients with an (insufficient) residual function of PTH have less variations in P‐Ca and thereby more stable needs of treatment.

Hypercalcaemia is not only associated with increased risk of renal diseases, but also with an increased mortality as well as high phosphate levels increase the risk of infections. The risk of cardiovascular diseases increase when suffering from HypoPT for more than 20 years, when having more than 4 episodes of hypercalcaemia and when patients have adequately low levels of calcium corresponding to hypocalcaemia.

### Parathyroid disorders [^111ct6Gh]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Disorders of the parathyroid glands most commonly present with abnormalities of serum calcium. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients, are often asymptomatic or may have bone disease, nephrolithiasis, or neuromuscular symptoms. Patients with chronic kidney disease may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism with resultant chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Hypoparathyroidism most often occurs after neck surgery; it can also be caused by autoimmune destruction of the glands and other less common problems. Evaluation of patients with abnormal serum calcium levels includes a history and physical examination; repeat measurement of serum calcium level; and measurement of creatinine, magnesium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone levels. The treatment for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroidectomy. Management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism includes monitoring symptoms; serum calcium and creatinine levels; and bone mineral density. Patients with hypoparathyroidism require close monitoring and vitamin D (e.g., calcitriol) replacement.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^113HBpfe]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — risk factors and operative considerations — HypoPT may follow any simultaneous or staged bilateral central neck operation, and a prior partial thyroidectomy increases risk at completion thyroidectomy due to uncertain parathyroid status. The most straightforward way to avoid hypoPT is to limit thyroidectomy to a unilateral approach. Parathyroid autotransplantation (PA) at thyroidectomy has been associated with an increased risk of temporary hypoPT, yet routine PA may be associated with a reduced risk of permanent hypoPT, and the risk of permanent hypoPT is very low after autotransplantation of at least one parathyroid gland. Table 1 lists risk factors for permanent hypoPT following thyroid-related operations, including bilateral thyroid procedures, autoimmune thyroid disease, central neck dissection, substernal goiter, low-volume thyroid surgeon, prior gastric bypass or other malabsorptive state, simultaneous thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy, and prior central neck surgery.

3.4 Medication and pill burden associated with chronic hypoparathyroidism

Patients reported taking a mean (SD; range) of 8.0 (4.79; 1.0‐25.0 [n = 397]) pills/d. The number of pills consumed per day for management of hypoparathyroidism (including calcium supplements, activated vitamin D analogues, vitamin D 3 and any other hypoparathyroidism‐related medications) correlated with overall symptom severity; the mean number of pills per day was 4.0, 7.1, 8.1 and 10.0 for patients reporting no hypoparathyroidism symptoms, mild symptoms, moderate symptoms and severe symptoms, respectively. The majority of patients received activated vitamin D capsules or liquid (ie calcitriol, alfacalcidol and dihydrotachysterol [71%; n = 282]); 40% (n = 159) of patients received vitamin D tablets (ie ergocalciferol vitamin D 2 or cholecalciferol vitamin D 3). Most patients reported receiving calcium (92%; n = 366/398), either as oral calcium tablets/chews (ie Caltrate, calcium carbonate and calcium citrate [79%; n = 313]) and/or as oral antacids (13%; n = 53). Other medications patients reported receiving included magnesium supplements (36%, n = 142), diuretics (19%, n = 77) and thyroid treatment (56%, n = 221). Treatment dissatisfaction was reported by 96% (n = 376/393) of patients. Of 394 patients with data available, 144 (37%) reported disagreement with their physicians' assessments that their disease was well controlled with their current medication.

### Surgical hypoparathyroidism [^117Ev1cT]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Surgical hypoparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypoparathyroidism and the result of intentional or inadvertent extirpation, trauma, or devascularization of the parathyroid glands. Surgical hypoparathyroidism may present as a medical emergency. Pediatric patients, those with Graves disease, and those undergoing extensive neck dissections or reoperative neck surgery are at particular risk for this complication. Extensive surgical expertise, immediate or delayed autotransplantation, and prophylactic and postoperative calcium/vitamin D supplementation in select patients are associated with a reduction in the risk of surgical hypoparathyroidism. Intraoperative parathyroid imaging is among novel strategies being investigated to mitigate surgical hypoparathyroidism in the intraoperative setting.

### Therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH (1–84): a prospective four-year investigation of efficacy and safety [^111XTAdM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

PTH may be an effective treatment option for hypoparathyroidism, but long-term data are not available.

Objective

We studied the effect of 4 yr of PTH(1–84) treatment in hypoparathyroidism.

Design

Twenty-seven subjects were treated with PTH(1–84) for 4 yr, with prospective monitoring of calcium and vitamin D requirements, serum and urinary calcium, serum phosphorus, bone turnover markers, and bone mineral density (BMD).

Results

Treatment with PTH(1–84) reduced supplemental calcium requirements by 37% (P = 0.006) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D requirements by 45% (P = 0.008). Seven subjects (26%) were able to stop 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D completely. Serum calcium concentration remained stable, and urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion fell. Lumbar spine BMD increased by 5.5 ± 9% at 4 yr (P < 0.0001). Femoral neck and total hip BMD remained stable. At 4 yr, distal radius BMD was not different from baseline. Bone turnover markers increased significantly, reaching a 3-fold peak from baseline values at 6–12 months (P < 0.05 for all), subsequently declining to steady-state levels at 30 months. Hypercalcemia was uncommon (11 episodes in eight subjects over 4 yr; 1.9% of all values), with most episodes occurring within the first 6 months and resolving with adjustment of supplemental calcium and vitamin D.

Conclusions

PTH(1–84) treatment of hypoparathyroidism for up to 4 yr maintains the serum calcium concentration, while significantly reducing supplemental calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D requirements. Lumbar spine BMD increases without significant changes at other sites. These data provide support for the safety and efficacy of PTH(1–84) therapy in hypoparathyroidism for up to 4 yr.

### Calcium citrate versus calcium carbonate in the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism: a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial [^1163DQoU]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is defined by hypocalcemia and undetectable or insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). According to international guidelines, standard treatment of HypoPT includes oral calcium salts and active vitamin D metabolites to prevent hypocalcemia and to maintain serum calcium levels in the low‐normal range or just below normal.

Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) is the most widely used preparation to treat HypoPT because it contains the highest percentage of elemental calcium on a molecular weight basis (eg, 42%) and is the least expensive. It requires a source of acid, either gastric hydrochloric acid or an acidic element in the diet (eg, protein). The acid converts the carbonate salt to carbonic acid that immediately is converted to water and carbon dioxide (CO 2). It is the production of CO 2 that is believed to be responsible for side effects such as flatulence, constipation, bloating, and other gastrointestinal symptoms.

These inconvenient clinical issues with CaCO 3 raise the question about whether another calcium preparation might be more advantageous in HypoPT. Calcium citrate (Ca‐Cit) is one such alternative because it has a solubility at higher pH levels (> 6.5) and does not therefore require gastric acid for absorption. It is, thus, generally recommended in patients with achlorhydria or who are receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Its bioavailability irrespective of food is another advantage over CaC0 3.

Another potential advantage of Ca‐Cit in HypoPT is that citrate salts are used in the treatment of nephrolithiasis, since they have shown an inhibitory effect on kidney stone formation because the most frequent kidney stones consist of 70% to 80% calcium oxalate. Since patients with HypoPT are at risk for kidney stones, Ca‐Cit may harbor this additional therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there are no studies aimed to investigate the efficacy of Ca‐Cit in the management of subjects with chronic HypoPT.

This study was conducted to directly compare the use of CaCO 3 and Ca‐Cit in HypoPT. We aimed to investigate, in subjects with chronic HypoPT, (i) the effect of Ca‐Cit on elements that contribute to risk of nephrolithiasis, (ii) the ability of Ca‐Cit to maintain normal serum calcium levels compared with CaCO 3, and (iii) its impact on quality of life (QOL).

The recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–84), rhPTH(1–84), is full-length PTH that is approved in the United States and Europe as adjunctive treatment for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. In Europe, rhPTH(1–84) is indicated as adjunctive treatment for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who cannot be adequately controlled with conventional therapy alone. In the United States, rhPTH(1–84) is indicated as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia and is recommended only for patients who cannot be well controlled with calcium supplements and active vitamin D alone. The safety and efficacy of rhPTH(1–84) in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism were first shown in short-term placebo-controlled clinical studies in which the need for conventional therapy was reduced, serum calcium levels were maintained, serum phosphate decreased, and events of hypocalcemia were reduced. In longer-term, open-label clinical studies, no new safety concerns were observed, reductions in oral calcium supplements and active vitamin D were achieved, serum calcium remained within target range, serum phosphorus and calcium-phosphate product levels improved, and urinary calcium excretion normalized.

Observational studies complement findings from interventional clinical trials and can provide real-world information on long-term outcomes of safety, effectiveness, and HRQoL across a broad population. Patient registries, in particular for rare diseases, can obtain natural disease or treatment response data over the long-term that would otherwise be limited if performed by individual centers.

The multinational PARADIGHM (physicians advancing disease knowledge in hypoparathyroidism) registry (NCT01922440, EUPAS register number: EUPAS16927) is an opportunity to obtain valuable real-world data beyond those reported for clinical trials in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism by providing long-term data for the treatment of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism with rhPTH(1–84). PARADIGHM also records data that will allow for the assessment of the overall disease course in patients under conditions of routine clinical practice. Herein we describe the protocol for PARADIGHM and report baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for the current participants.

### Changes in treatment needs for chronic postoperative hypoparathyroidism during initiation of conventional treatment compared to stable phase of treatment [^113wNyiz]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcaemia caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Postsurgical HypoPT lasting less than 6 months is characterized as transient whereas chronic HypoPT has a duration of more than 6 months. Roughly, 75% of patients with HypoPT have acquired the disease due to anterior neck surgery where the parathyroid glands have been damaged or removed. A recent review reported a large variation in the incidence of HypoPT following surgery. The prevalence of transient HypoPT varied from 0 to 46% and chronic HypoPT from 0.9% to 4.4%.

The purpose of treatment is to normalize plasma calcium levels in order to avoid hypo‐ and hypercalcaemia and the long‐term complications. The conventional treatment for HypoPT is supplements with active vitamin D (alfacalcidol or calcitriol) and oral calcium. The needs (doses) for active vitamin D in relation to acquiring HypoPT have not been well reported so far. Furthermore, only sparse data are available on how doses of active vitamin D need to be adjusted during the course of the disease. One of the only available studies suggests that changes in calcium supplements and active vitamin D are only needed within the first month.

This study aims to investigate the treatment needs for active vitamin D and calcium in the first period after surgery compared to treatment needs during stable phase of HypoPT, as we hypothesize that the patients attain a stable phase of treatment with calcium and active vitamin D during the first month after surgery.

### Efficacy and safety of recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–84) in hypoparathyroidism (REPLACE): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 3 study [^1114jmwb]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism results in impaired mineral homoeostasis, including hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia. Treatment with high-dose oral calcium and active vitamin D does not provide adequate or consistent control of biochemical indices and can lead to serious long-term complications. We aimed to test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily recombinant human parathyroid hormone 1–84 (rhPTH[1–84]) in adults with hypoparathyroidism.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase 3 study (REPLACE), we recruited patients with hypoparathyroidism (≥ 18 months duration) aged 18–85 years from 33 sites in eight countries. After an optimisation period, during which calcium and active vitamin D doses were adjusted to achieve consistent albumin-corrected serum calcium, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive voice response system to 50 μg per day of rhPTH(1–84) or placebo for 24 weeks. Active vitamin D and calcium were progressively reduced, while rhPTH(1–84) could be titrated up from 50 μg to 75 μg and then 100 μg (weeks 0–5). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients at week 24 who achieved a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in their daily dose of oral calcium and active vitamin D while maintaining a serum calcium concentration greater than or the same as baseline concentrations and less than or equal to the upper limit of normal, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00732615.

Findings

Between June 23, 2009, and Feb 28, 2011, 134 eligible patients were recruited and randomly assigned to rhPTH(1–84) (n = 90) or placebo (n = 44). Six patients in the rhPTH(1–84) group and seven in the placebo group discontinued before study end. 48 (53%) patients in the rhPTH(1–84) group achieved the primary endpoint compared with one (2%) patient in the placebo group (percentage difference 51.1%, 95% CI 39.9–62.3; p < 0.0001). The proportions of patients who had at least one adverse event were similar between groups (84 [93%] patients in the rhPTH[1–84] group vs 44 [100%] patients in the placebo group), with hypocalcaemia, muscle spasm, paraesthesias, headache, and nausea being the most common adverse events. The proportions of patients with serious adverse events were also similar between the rhPTH(1–84) group (ten [11%] patients) and the placebo group (four [9%] patients).

Interpretation

50 μg, 75 μg, or 100 μg per day of rhPTH(1–84), administered subcutaneously in the outpatient setting, is efficacious and well tolerated as a PTH replacement therapy for patients with hypoparathyroidism.

Results

Study selection

The original literature search retrieved 2070 studies. Of these, 2017 were excluded after abstract screening (1251) or because they were duplicates (766), and 19 after full‐text evaluation. Ultimately, 34 studies were included, and two further studies were added after the later search performed in March 2021, as reported in Fig. 1. Thirty‐six studies (15 on PTH 1−34 and 21 on PTH 1−84) were therefore analyzed. They comprised seven RCTs, 23 open‐label trials, four crossover trials, one self‐controlled trial, and one randomized, dose‐blinded, fixed‐dose trial. Their main characteristics are summarized in Table 1 (RCTs) and Table 2 (non‐RCTs).

Table 1
Controlled Trials on PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84

Table 2
Uncontrolled Trials on PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84

Twenty‐six studies declared funding by pharmaceutical companies. PTH 1−34 daily dose ranged from 20 to 40 μg in adults and from 0.4 to 1.2 μg/kg daily in children, mostly administered twice daily. The PTH 1−84 daily dose ranged from 25 to 100 μg, administered once daily or every other day. In 11 studies, the populations partially overlapped, so the studies were excluded to avoid duplications. The participants' age ranged from 7 to 78 years. A total of 242 patients (183 females and 62 males) were enrolled in RCTs, and 343 patients (262 females and 81 males) in non‐RCTs. When reported, the most frequent etiologies of hypoparathyroidism were postsurgical (281/401 patients, 70%) followed by idiopathic, autoimmune (polyglandular failure), and genetic causes (DiGeorge syndrome; hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renal disease syndrome; calcium sensing receptor activating mutations), as reported in Tables 1 and 2. The mean disease duration ranged from 2.0 to 19 years.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^113cpXdz]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, only two other meta‐analyses have investigated some of the aspects related to PTH replacement therapy. These both limited their analysis to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (four and five articles, respectively). Liu and colleagues included only data on biochemical parameters, whereas Palui and colleagues did not compare PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84.

RCTs undoubtedly represent the highest level of evidence. However, open‐label and uncontrolled studies may still provide valuable evidence, especially in rare diseases, in which the small sample size and logistic limitations often render RCTs unfeasible or biased. Furthermore, the inclusion of all prospective studies, including real‐world ones, in a systematic review and meta‐analysis increases the power of the analysis, reduces publication bias, better reflects real‐life settings. In fact, the European Medicine Agency's guidelines state that study designs other than RCTs (prospective open‐label or crossover studies) are acceptable for rare conditions and clinical trials in small populations, if they help to improve the interpretability of the study results.

For all these reasons, we performed a meta‐analysis of both RCTs and nonrandomized prospective studies to investigate the effects of PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84 on serum and urinary calcium and phosphate levels, serum vitamin D levels, doses of calcium and active vitamin D supplements, bone markers, bone mineral density, QoL, and safety in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism.

### Long-term treatment of hypoparathyroidism: a randomized controlled study comparing parathyroid hormone-(1–34) versus calcitriol and calcium [^116qQ4gY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is one of the few remaining hormonal insufficiency states for which replacement therapy is unavailable. Previous short-term controlled trials have shown PTH to be a safe and effective treatment of hypoparathyroidism. In this randomized, parallel group, open-label trial, we compared synthetic human PTH-(1–34) (PTH) with conventional therapy, calcitriol and calcium, over a 3-yr period. Twenty-seven patients with confirmed hypoparathyroidism, aged 18–70 yr, were randomized to either twice daily sc PTH or oral calcitriol and calcium. The primary end points were calcium levels in serum and urine. Secondary end points were creatinine clearance, markers of bone turnover, and bone mineral density. Throughout the 3-yr study period, serum calcium levels were similar in both treatment groups within or just below the normal range. Mean urinary calcium excretion was within the normal range from 1–3 yr in PTH-treated patients, but remained above normal in the calcitriol group. Bone mineral content and bone mineral density showed no significant between-group differences over the 3-yr study period. We conclude that treatment with twice daily sc PTH provides a safe and effective alternative to calcitriol therapy and is able to maintain normal serum calcium levels without hypercalciuria for at least 3 yr in patients with hypoparathyroidism.

### Efficacy and safety of parathyroid hormone replacement with transCon PTH in hypoparathyroidism: 26-week results from the phase 3 paTHway trial [^1145CpJK]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

PTH replacement therapy is the ideal physiologic treatment for hypoparathyroidism. Adjunct PTH therapy via subcutaneous (SC) injection of recombinant human PTH(1‐84) has demonstrated efficacy in achieving ≥ 50% reduction of active vitamin D and oral calcium while maintaining albumin‐corrected serum calcium at or above baseline levels and within the range of 7.5–10.6 mg/dL (1.87–2.64 mmol/L). Evidence from a small, randomized crossover trial in adults with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism showed that continuous infusion (via insulin pump) of PTH(1‐34), in contrast to twice‐daily administration, decreased both urine calcium excretion and the cumulative dose required to maintain normocalcemia, all in the absence of conventional therapy. There remains an unmet need for PTH replacement therapy capable of restoring physiological levels and functions of PTH, improving HRQoL, and reducing the symptom burden and long‐term complications of hypoparathyroidism.

TransCon PTH (palopegteriparatide) is an investigational once‐daily prodrug with sustained release of active PTH in development as a treatment for adults with hypoparathyroidism. TransCon PTH consists of a parent drug, PTH(1‐34), transiently conjugated to a branched methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) carrier through a proprietary linker. It is administered as a once‐daily SC injection designed to provide stable PTH levels within the normal physiological range over 24 h/d. In the phase 2 PaTH Forward trial, daily TransCon PTH enabled independence from oral active vitamin D and therapeutic doses of elemental calcium (> 500 mg/d) in 91% of participants. Participants treated with TransCon PTH also achieved normal mean serum calcium, serum phosphate, and urine calcium, and demonstrated improved HRQoL over 26 weeks of treatment. The primary objective of the phase 3, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled PaTHway trial was to assess the treatment effect of once‐daily TransCon PTH on serum calcium levels and therapeutic doses of active vitamin D (ie, calcitriol or alfacalcidol) and elemental calcium in adults with hypoparathyroidism over 26 weeks. Additional objectives were to assess the effect of TransCon PTH on HRQoL, symptom improvement, functioning, well‐being, and urinary calcium excretion in this population.

### American Thyroid Association statement on optimal surgical management of goiter [^112PxobD]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association conclusions for goiter management note that "The options for medical treatment of euthyroid goiter are short-lived and are limited to thyroxine hormone suppression and radioactive iodine ablation", and "Newer methods of radioactive iodine ablation include prestimulation with rhTSH (currently off-label use) and may result in reduced dosage and less side effects, such as hypothyroidism". For compressive symptoms, "surgical management is recommended", with "Symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, and dysphagia" more common in thyromegaly "in particular, substernal goiters", and "Several studies have demonstrated improved breathing and swallowing outcomes after thyroidectomy". Preoperative evaluation "includes thyroid function assays and imaging (ultrasonography and/or cross-sectional imaging)", and the team "must be cognizant of complications from massive goiter surgery such as bleeding, airway issues, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and transient hypoparathyroidism".

### Standardizing the reporting of postoperative hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy: consensus statement from the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons, the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, and the international association of endocrine surgeons [^116bHq3K]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Surgical approach and extent of thyroid resection — procedure reporting and tissue-extent are tied to hypoparathyroidism risk: the procedure performed must be clearly specified, the access method should be explicitly stated (including open/classical, transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA), robotic, and other remote-access techniques), and the amount of thyroid tissue removed must be defined; total or near total thyroidectomy is associated with the highest risk of hypoparathyroidism, hemithyroidectomy carries an extremely low risk, lobectomy is increasingly the preferred approach for low-risk cancers, and subtotal thyroidectomy is rarely performed but may be used for specific benign conditions.

### Alfacalcidol vs calcitriol in the management of patient with hypoparathyroidism: a randomized controlled trial [^116f2BSH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Alfacalcidol and calcitriol are commonly used for managing hypoparathyroidism. Their relative merits have not been systematically assessed.

Objective

We compared the effect of alfacalcidol and calcitriol on phosphatemic control, hypercalciuria, and associated factors in idiopathic-hypoparathyroidism (IH).

Design and Setting

Open-label randomized controlled trial, tertiary care center.

Subjects and Methods

IH patients with optimal calcemic control on alfacalcidol were continued on the same (n = 20) or switched to calcitriol (n = 25) at half of the ongoing alfacalcidol dose. The dose was adjusted during follow-up to maintain serum total calcium between 8.0 and 9.5 mg/dL. Serum calcium, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 24-h urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio, and fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEPh) were measured at baseline and 6 months. Plasma intact-FGF23 was measured at final follow-up.

Result

Patients receiving alfacalcidol and calcitriol had comparable serum calcium at 6 months (8.7 ± 0.4 vs 8.9 ± 0.4 mg/dL, P = 0.13). Their median [interquartile range (IQR)] dose at 6 months was 2.0 (1.0–2.5) and 0.75 (0.5–1.0) µg/d, respectively. Serum 1,25(OH)2D levels were physiological in both (35.3 ± 11.6 and 32.3 ± 16.9 pg/mL). Serum phosphate and calcium excretion were comparable in 2 arms. A majority had hyperphosphatemia (75% vs 76%), hypercalciuria (75% vs 72%), and elevated FGF23 (116 ± 68 and 113 ± 57 pg/mL). Age showed significant independent association with plasma FGF23 (β = 1.9, P = 0.001). Average FEPh was low despite high FGF23.

Conclusion

At optimal calcium control, both alfacalcidol and calcitriol lead to comparable but high serum phosphate levels, hypercalciuria, physiological circulating 1,25(OH)2D, and elevated FGF23. Further studies are required to systematically investigate other treatment options.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^1178NX1e]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism

HypoPTH is a rare disorder characterized by deficient production or biological activity of PTH that results in hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The prevalence of HypoPTH is estimated to be 37/100 000 habitants per year in the United States. HypoPTH may be an acquired or inherited condition, with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism being the most common form. Neck surgery is responsible for about 75% of HypoPTH cases. The next most frequent cause is immunity dysregulation, either affecting only parathyroid glands or multiple endocrine glands (autoimmune polyglandular syndromes). Other causes include infiltrative diseases and rare genetic disorders. However, it is important to exclude magnesium disorders early in our differential diagnosis process, as both hypo- and hypermagnesemia can lead to functional HypoPTH. The diagnosis is based on the finding of low ionized or corrected for albumin calcium levels, accompanied by undetectable, low, or inappropriately normal PTH levels. Under normal circumstances, low calcium levels trigger the production and excretion of PTH from parathyroid glands, via activation of CaSRs. PTH deficiency inhibits mobilization of calcium from bone, reabsorption of calcium from kidneys, and absorption of calcium from gastrointestinal tract through 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis. As a result, hypocalcemia is established, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is decreased because PTH can't stimulate 1-a hydroxylase, phosphate levels rise because of the lack of phosphaturic action of PTH, and the fraction of filtered calcium at the glomerulus is inappropriately increased.

Clinical presentation of HypoPTH usually includes neuromuscular signs and symptoms resulting from hypocalcemia, ranging from mild perioral numbness, paresthesias in the extremities, muscle cramps, and QT interval prolongation, to severe manifestations of arrhythmias, heart failure, seizures, and laryngospasm. However, some patients, especially those with genetic forms of HypoPTH, may be asymptomatic, thus they may be diagnosed due to routine biochemical screening or due to concomitant findings. Typical facial features, chronic candidiasis, or other autoimmune endocrinopathies may direct the diagnosis to DiGeorge or APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy and candidiasis with ectodermal dystrophy syndrome), respectively. Absent or low levels of PTH result in reduced bone turnover and subsequent rise of BMD at both cortical and trabecular sites. However, bone disease derives from increased bone mineralization and altered skeletal microarchitecture. Whether these alterations relate to an increased fracture risk remains to be clarified.
