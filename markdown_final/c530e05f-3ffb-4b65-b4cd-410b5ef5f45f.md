## Question

Dopamine detoxification

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "dopamine detoxification", clarifying what the term means across contexts, what the evidence shows, and what practical steps clinicians can take now while highlighting uncertainties and future directions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the term precisely across addiction, Parkinson's disease, and general lifestyle usage. Then, I should verify the neurobiological rationale and whether "detoxification" is mechanistically coherent. Next, I will review clinical evidence in addiction, followed by Parkinson's disease hypotheses and data. After that, I should examine lifestyle "dopamine fasting" claims and their evidentiary basis. Finally, I will integrate practical clinical recommendations, acknowledge limitations, and outline research priorities, making sure I double-check key claims against guidelines and pivotal studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "dopamine detoxification" is used differently across domains and I need to ensure I'm not conflating meanings. In addiction medicine, it often refers to clinical detoxification from substances that dysregulate dopamine signaling, with the goal of restoring homeostasis and reducing relapse risk, not literally "removing dopamine" from the brain. In Parkinson's disease, some investigators propose dopamine reduction therapy to mitigate cytosolic dopamine toxicity, which is a mechanistic hypothesis rather than a detoxification in the addiction sense. In popular culture, "dopamine fasting" typically denotes behavioral abstinence from highly rewarding stimuli to recalibrate reward processing, which is metaphorical and not a neurochemical detoxification. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating any of these definitions; yes, these distinctions align with current clinical and translational literature [^115jFWPL].

> Next, I should review the neurobiological rationale for why dopamine system recovery matters in addiction. Chronic use of psychostimulants and other drugs produces blunted striatal dopamine release and reduced D2 receptor availability, which correlate with impaired executive control, heightened cue reactivity, and relapse risk; this phenotype persists into abstinence and is both a consequence of drug exposure and a vulnerability marker, so "detoxification" in this context targets normalization of these neuroadaptations rather than removal of dopamine itself [^114h8bLz] [^113DVt9u] [^113Ysm4n]. Wait, let me verify the directionality of DAT changes; I initially thought cocaine uniformly reduces DAT, but I should correct that: cocaine acutely increases synaptic dopamine by blocking DAT, and some imaging studies show increased DAT in early abstinence, whereas methamphetamine is associated with persistent DAT reductions, so the direction of change is drug- and time-dependent, reinforcing the need for tailored detoxification and recovery strategies [^114zg6X8] [^114kJDdr].

> I will now examine the clinical evidence for recovery of dopamine function during detoxification and abstinence. In methamphetamine users, protracted abstinence is associated with partial recovery of dopamine transporter levels and D2 receptor function, though deficits can persist and correlate with relapse risk, indicating that detoxification alone does not guarantee full normalization and that adjunctive treatments may be needed [^114kJDdr] [^116HDC2K]. In alcohol use disorder, D2 receptor availability remains low during early detoxification and shows limited recovery over months, aligning with persistent hypodopaminergic states into abstinence and supporting the need for integrated care beyond acute withdrawal [^116VxaEG] [^115SC8jM]. But wait, what if sleep disruption is a confounder? Reduced sleep duration mediates lower striatal D2/D3 availability in cocaine abusers, suggesting that sleep optimization during detoxification could be a meaningful, actionable target to support dopamine system recovery [^114pQdWB] [^112SqTYY].

> Let me consider the Parkinson's disease angle carefully, because the logic is different. Emerging data suggest that excess cytosolic dopamine and its reactive metabolites, notably DOPAL, may contribute to oxidative stress, α-synuclein aggregation, and neurodegeneration; accordingly, dopamine reduction therapy via tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition has reversed pathology in preclinical models, prompting calls for clinical trials to test whether lowering dopamine synthesis can mitigate toxicity without worsening motor symptoms [^115jFWPL] [^111xXcmF] [^111eHaDi]. Hold on, I should verify that this remains investigational; yes, current PD guidelines still endorse dopaminergic therapy as standard of care, and dopamine reduction therapy is not a clinical standard, so any such approach should be confined to research settings until safety and efficacy are established [^11124cqa] [^115nZCJU].

> Now, I should review the lifestyle "dopamine fasting" concept and make sure I don't overstate its scientific footing. There is no direct evidence that brief abstinence from rewarding stimuli produces measurable changes in striatal D2 receptors or dopamine release in humans; however, the construct aligns with broader principles of reducing cue exposure, improving sleep, and enhancing executive control, which can indirectly support dopamine system homeostasis and are reasonable behavioral adjuncts during recovery from addiction or problematic reward use [^113Ysm4n] [^113BwtHV]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should clarify that while TMS and other neuromodulation strategies can modulate prefrontal-subcortical circuits relevant to craving, they are not "dopamine detoxification" per se; they are tools that may aid executive control and reduce relapse risk alongside standard care [^113BwtHV].

> Next, I should translate this into practical clinical steps that are evidence-aligned. For substance use disorders, prioritize medically supervised detoxification when indicated, treat withdrawal syndromes, and then implement comprehensive care that addresses sleep, stress, and cue exposure, while considering pharmacotherapies that target dopamine signaling where supported; for example, modafinil has been explored to normalize DAT dynamics in cocaine dependence, and ALDH2 inhibition has mechanistic and preclinical support for reducing cocaine-seeking via DOPAL-driven feedback on tyrosine hydroxylase, though these remain investigational and require careful patient selection and monitoring [^114BE6wU] [^114iG3QS] [^116k6mWp]. I should double-check that I'm not implying approval; these are research directions rather than routine standards, so shared decision-making and close follow-up are essential.

> For Parkinson's disease, I need to ensure I'm aligned with guidelines. Current standards remain dopaminergic replacement with levodopa and/or dopamine agonists, titrated to effect while monitoring for motor complications and impulse control disorders; dopamine reduction therapy is not a clinical recommendation pending robust human data, so any consideration should occur within trials or exceptional circumstances with ethics oversight [^11124cqa] [^115nZCJU]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring advice; yes, guidelines emphasize surveillance for dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome when tapering, underscoring the need for gradual dose adjustments and anticipatory guidance [^116RmFEu].

> I should also acknowledge limitations and uncertainties so we don't jump to conclusions. Many imaging studies have small samples and heterogeneity, causality between dopamine markers and clinical outcomes remains complex, and interindividual differences in genetics, sleep, and stress reactivity likely moderate recovery trajectories; thus, personalized strategies and longitudinal assessment are prudent, and clinicians should avoid promising "dopamine reset" outcomes that are not yet evidence-based [^114h8bLz]. Let me reconsider whether any authoritative body endorses "dopamine detoxification" as a treatment modality; I find no such endorsement, reinforcing that the term should be used carefully and contextually.

> Finally, I will outline research priorities to move the field forward. We need longitudinal multimodal studies linking dopamine imaging, sleep metrics, and clinical outcomes across substances; randomized trials of sleep optimization and neuromodulation as adjuncts to standard care; and carefully designed clinical studies of dopamine reduction therapy in PD to test causality of cytosolic dopamine toxicity, with biomarkers and safety monitoring plans agreed in advance [^114pQdWB] [^113BwtHV] [^115jFWPL]. I should confirm that guideline bodies support research-first approaches for novel dopaminergic strategies; yes, current guidance emphasizes evidence generation before clinical adoption, which fits the tentative but intriguing dopamine reduction hypothesis in PD and the ongoing search for addiction treatments that normalize dopamine function without simply substituting one dopaminergic effect for another [^notfound].

Dopamine detoxification refers to the **biological clearance of dopamine and its metabolites** from the brain and body, primarily via enzymatic degradation and renal excretion [^112ohs2j] [^111WQKYd]. In addiction, **prolonged abstinence** can partially restore dopamine signaling, but recovery is often incomplete and relapse risk remains high [^116HDC2K] [^114kJDdr]. In Parkinson's disease, dopamine detoxification pathways are impaired, contributing to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration [^111xXcmF] [^112hHkbA]. Clinically, detoxification is managed through supportive care, medications, and monitoring; emerging strategies target dopamine metabolism and oxidative stress, but **evidence remains limited** [^114BE6wU] [^115jFWPL].

---

## Biological mechanisms of dopamine detoxification

Dopamine detoxification involves coordinated enzymatic and excretory processes that **clear dopamine and its metabolites** from the brain and body:

- **Enzymatic degradation**: Dopamine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) into inactive metabolites such as homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) [^112ohs2j] [^111WQKYd].

- **Renal excretion**: Metabolites are eliminated via urine, with approximately 80% excreted within 24 hours [^111WQKYd].

- **Antioxidant systems**: Glutathione and other antioxidants neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during dopamine metabolism, preventing oxidative damage [^1174KgiX] [^116wy2Wt].

---

## Dopamine detoxification in addiction

Chronic drug use dysregulates dopamine signaling, leading to persistent neuroadaptations. Detoxification and abstinence can partially restore dopamine function, but recovery is often incomplete:

- **Methamphetamine addiction**: Prolonged abstinence partially restores dopamine transporter (DAT) levels and dopamine release, but deficits persist, increasing relapse risk [^114kJDdr] [^116HDC2K].

- **Cocaine addiction**: Abstinence partially normalizes dopamine D2 receptor availability, but blunted dopamine responses persist, contributing to relapse vulnerability [^113DVt9u].

- **Alcohol addiction**: Detoxification partially restores dopamine receptor function, but persistent deficits remain, particularly in the ventral striatum, a region critical for reward processing [^115SC8jM].

---

## Dopamine detoxification in Parkinson's disease

In Parkinson's disease, dopamine detoxification is impaired due to **reduced aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity**, leading to accumulation of toxic dopamine metabolites such as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL). This accumulation contributes to oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and neurodegeneration [^111xXcmF] [^112hHkbA]. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to enhance detoxification pathways and reduce oxidative stress, but **clinical evidence remains limited** [^116kUPcg].

---

## Clinical implications and therapeutic strategies

Dopamine detoxification has **significant clinical implications**, particularly in addiction and Parkinson's disease:

- **Addiction treatment**: Detoxification is managed through supportive care, medications targeting withdrawal symptoms, and behavioral therapies. Medications such as modafinil and ALDH2 inhibitors are being investigated to enhance dopamine detoxification and reduce relapse risk, but evidence remains limited [^114iG3QS] [^116k6mWp].

- **Parkinson's disease management**: Current treatments focus on dopamine replacement therapies, but emerging strategies aim to enhance detoxification pathways and reduce oxidative stress. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these approaches [^11124cqa] [^116kUPcg].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Several limitations and challenges **persist** in dopamine detoxification:

- **Incomplete recovery**: Detoxification often results in only partial restoration of dopamine function, with persistent deficits increasing relapse risk [^116HDC2K] [^114kJDdr].

- **Individual variability**: Genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors influence detoxification efficiency and recovery outcomes [^115X5G8T] [^114pQdWB].

- **Limited evidence**: Therapeutic strategies targeting dopamine detoxification require further research and clinical validation [^115rBTFw] [^113dwQtZ].

---

Dopamine detoxification is the biological clearance of dopamine and its metabolites, involving enzymatic degradation and renal excretion. In addiction, detoxification partially restores dopamine function but often remains incomplete, while in Parkinson's disease, impaired detoxification contributes to neurodegeneration. Clinical management includes supportive care, medications, and monitoring, but **further research is needed** to optimize therapeutic strategies.

### Effects of alcohol detoxification on dopamine D2 receptors in alcoholics: a preliminary study [^116VxaEG]. Psychiatry Research (2002). Low credibility.

Imaging studies in patients with Type II alcohol dependence have revealed significant reductions in dopamine (DA) D2 receptor availability. Here we assessed the effects of alcohol detoxification in DA D2 receptors in alcoholic subjects. We evaluated 14 patients with Type II alcohol dependence tested within 6 weeks of detoxification and then re-tested 1–4 months later while alcohol free. The comparison group comprised 11 healthy controls. PET was used with [11C]raclopride to measure DA D2 receptors. Eight alcoholics and all control subjects were tested with a CTI 931 PET scanner and six alcoholics with a Siemens HR+ PET scanner. Data were analyzed separately for the studies done in the different scanners. Comparisons between early and late alcohol detoxification showed no significant changes in DA D2 receptor availability (Bₘₐₓ/Kᴅ) for the studies done with the CTI and the HR+ scanners. Comparison with controls showed lower DA D2 receptor levels in caudate and putamen in alcoholics tested during early detoxification and in caudate during late detoxification. These studies replicate previous findings of lower striatal DA D2 receptors in alcoholics than in controls and absence of significant recovery during alcohol detoxification. These findings suggest that low DA D2 receptor availability in alcoholics is not due to alcohol withdrawal and may reflect a predisposing factor.

### Rethinking Parkinson's disease: could dopamine reduction therapy have clinical utility? [^115jFWPL]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the 1960s, investigations established that Parkinson's patients suffered from dopamine depletion, subsequently recognized to be driven in part by loss of dopaminergic neurons. Unfortunately, the dopaminergic therapies developed to address this deficiency are incapable of slowing, halting, or reversing disease progression, suggesting that dopamine deficiency represents an incomplete understanding of the disease mechanism. Several models contemplate this shortcoming, including consideration of the role of dopamine and its metabolites.

The cautionary view that these dopaminergic therapies could be toxic prompted recommendations ranging from postponing initiation of therapy to treatment holidays. These concerns were not supported by data from multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, which also undermined concern for a role of dopamine driven disease progression. If dopamine were a disease driver, it could be argued that given the extremely low levels of dopamine in human striatum, realizing pharmacologic levels with levodopa-based therapies would be expected to reveal clinical toxicity.

However, two lines of reasoning suggest the concerns about dopaminergic pathology should not be dismissed. First, low levels of dopamine reported in Parkinson's patients may be misleading because they are tissue concentrations rather than neuron-based measures. Dopamine-related toxicity is determined by the amount of dopamine free within the cytosol of the dopaminergic neurons, where it is oxidized and metabolized into toxic byproducts (Fig. 1). Tissue concentrations represent a combination of intra- and extracellular fluids, with the intracellular compartment containing a combination of dopaminergic neurons and other cells and are not representative of what the dopaminergic neurons experience. In this context, low cytosolic dopamine levels would be required to support the current model of disease. But despite studies that suggest cytosolic levels could be elevated as appears to be its turnover, the standard of care does not consider dopamine toxicity as an important risk. Second, studies in multiple preclinical models show that dopamine reduction therapy via tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition reverses disease pathology. In models ranging from drosophila to rodents, including cell culture studies of multiple types, inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase reversed measures of disease pathology including oxidative stress, alpha-synuclein deposition, neuron loss, and impaired movement (Table 1).

### Decreased dopamine activity predicts relapse in methamphetamine abusers [^116HDC2K]. Molecular Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Studies in methamphetamine (METH) abusers showed that the decreases in brain dopamine (DA) function might recover with protracted detoxification. However, the extent to which striatal DA function in METH predicts recovery has not been evaluated. Here we assessed whether striatal DA activity in METH abusers is associated with clinical outcomes. Brain DA D2 receptor (D2R) availability was measured with positron emission tomography and [(11)C]raclopride in 16 METH abusers, both after placebo and after challenge with 60 mg oral methylphenidate (MPH) (to measure DA release) to assess whether it predicted clinical outcomes. For this purpose, METH abusers were tested within 6 months of last METH use and then followed up for 9 months of abstinence. In parallel, 15 healthy controls were tested. METH abusers had lower D2R availability in caudate than in controls. Both METH abusers and controls showed decreased striatal D2R availability after MPH and these decreases were smaller in METH than in controls in left putamen. The six METH abusers who relapsed during the follow-up period had lower D2R availability in dorsal striatum than in controls, and had no D2R changes after MPH challenge. The 10 METH abusers who completed detoxification did not differ from controls neither in striatal D2R availability nor in MPH-induced striatal DA changes. These results provide preliminary evidence that low striatal DA function in METH abusers is associated with a greater likelihood of relapse during treatment. Detection of the extent of DA dysfunction may be helpful in predicting therapeutic outcomes.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^113dwQtZ]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

It should also be noted that a deep understanding of a drug's mechanism of action is in no way a condition sine qua non to therapeutic efficacy. After all, the site of action of substances, such as cocaine has been known for decades and yet there is no better advancement in therapeutics for cocaine addiction. Also, alcohol's known actions on the dopamine system have been targeted many times, with negative or even detrimental outcomes in all these trials (reviewed in ref.). It has become clear that, without the ability to determine the specific state of an individual's dopamine system and its responsivity, direct pharmacological interference with DA receptors and transporters is unlikely to succeed as a viable treatment approach.

The failure so far to achieve more than at best marginal gains in alcoholism treatment through pharmacotherapy strongly suggest that business as usual in alcoholism research should not be considered an acceptable option. Non-medical strategies, such as addressing societal factors that promote addictionand implementing policies that limit alcohol consumptionshould of course be pursued to reduce the disease burden from alcohol use, but do not replace effective medical treatments for people who nevertheless develop alcohol addiction, in particular the population of people with dependence and very heavy drinking.

### Stimulant-induced dopamine increases are markedly blunted in active cocaine abusers [^113DVt9u]. Molecular Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Dopamine signaling in nucleus accumbens is essential for cocaine reward. Interestingly, imaging studies have reported blunted dopamine increases in striatum (assessed as reduced binding of [(11)C]raclopride to D2/D3 receptors) in detoxified cocaine abusers. Here, we evaluate whether the blunted dopamine response reflected the effects of detoxification and the lack of cocaine-cues during stimulant exposure. For this purpose we studied 62 participants (43 non-detoxified cocaine abusers and 19 controls) using positron emission tomography and [(11)C]raclopride (radioligand sensitive to endogenous dopamine) to measure dopamine increases induced by intravenous methylphenidate and in 24 of the cocaine abusers, we also compared dopamine increases when methylphenidate was administered concomitantly with a cocaine cue-video versus a neutral-video. In controls, methylphenidate increased dopamine in dorsal (effect size 1.4; P < 0.001) and ventral striatum (location of accumbens) (effect size 0.89; P < 0.001), but in cocaine abusers methylphenidate's effects did not differ from placebo and were similar whether cocaine-cues were present or not. In cocaine abusers despite the markedly attenuated dopaminergic effects, the methylphenidate-induced changes in ventral striatum were associated with intense drug craving. Our findings are consistent with markedly reduced signaling through D2 receptors during intoxication in active cocaine abusers regardless of cues exposure, which might contribute to compulsive drug use.

### Glutathione depletion and overproduction both initiate degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons [^1174KgiX]. Acta Neuropathologica (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Degeneration of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons is a major hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), resulting in striatal dopamine loss and inappropriate fine tuning of relevant motor circuitry. About 5% of PD patients develop the disease due to familial mutations while the vast majority of cases are sporadic. No singular pathomechanism initiating PD has been identified so far. Current hypotheses encompass oxidative stress through mitochondrial dysfunction, accumulation of transition metals, dysfunction of protein folding quality control, inflammation, and depletion of neurotrophic support or of anti-oxidant defence mechanisms. Depletion of the major cellular anti-oxidant glutathione (GSH) has been described in several independent studies to take place specifically in the substantia nigra of PD patients. GSH depletion is not detected in patients with multiple system atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy, despite the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. In incidental Lewy body disease, which may be considered as a pre-symptomatic form of PD and is present in up to 10% of individuals over the age of 60, GSH depletion is already present in the substantia nigra, and thus appears to precede complex I dysfunctions, iron accumulation and striatal dopamine loss. These findings imply decreased GSH levels being an early event in PD aetiology, possibly initiating or facilitating a cascade of further oxidative stress lesions. This view is supported by in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating that GSH depletion induces oxidative damage to complex I proteins.

GSH is a tri-peptide consisting of the amino acids glutamate, cysteine and glycine, the reactive thiol group of the cysteine residue serving as the cells most effective anti-oxidant. The rate-limiting step in GSH synthesis is carried out by glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCL), a dimeric protein composed of a catalytic (GCLc) and a modulatory subunit (GCLm). The modulatory subunit serves to increase the affinity of the catalytic subunit for its substrate glutamate, and renders the holo-enzyme less sensitive to feedback inhibition by GSH. Astrocytes synthesize the vast majority of brain GSH and secrete the peptide, but neurons can take up only the precursors derived from extra-cellular catabolism and must synthesize their own GSH. In non-enzymatic reactions GSH detoxifies NO₂ and peroxynitrite, and enzymatically reduces other anti-oxidants as dehydroascorbate and, indirectly, tocopherol and through glutaredoxin maintains sulfhydryl groups of proteins in reduced states. GSH peroxidases use GSH for enzymatic reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Oxidized GSH (GSSG) is recycled into the reduced state by GSH-reductase (GSR).

### Gene therapy for Parkinson's disease [^116kUPcg]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

Significant progress has been made in the field of gene therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). Successful vehicles for gene transfer into the central nervous system have been developed and clinical efficacy and safety have both been shown in various animal models of PD. Further optimisation of dosing, timing and location of gene therapy delivery as well as the ability to regulate and prolong gene expression will be important for the commencement of human trials. Current gene therapy models for PD have focused on two treatment strategies. One is the replacement of biosynthetic enzymes for dopamine synthesis and the second strategy is the addition of neurotrophic factors for protection and restoration of dopaminergic neurones. Concepts of neuroprotection and restoration of the nigrostriatal pathway will become important themes for future genetic treatment strategies for PD and may include, in addition to neurotrophic factors, genes to prevent apoptosis or detoxify free radical species. This review will highlight the recent literature on gene therapy for PD and summarise general approaches to gene therapy.

### Correlation between dopamine D (2) receptors in the ventral striatum and central processing of alcohol cues and craving [^115SC8jM]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Alcohol and other drugs of abuse stimulate dopamine release in the ventral striatum, which includes the nucleus accumbens, a core region of the brain reward system, and reinforce substance intake. Chronic alcohol intake is associated with down-regulation of central dopamine D(2) receptors, and delayed recovery of D(2) receptor sensitivity after detoxification is positively correlated with high risk for relapse. Prolonged D(2) receptor dysfunction in the ventral striatum may interfere with a dopamine-dependent error detection signal and bias the brain reward system toward excessive attribution of incentive salience to alcohol-associated stimuli.

Method

Multimodal imaging, with the radioligand [(18)F]desmethoxyfallypride and positron emission tomography as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), was used to compare 11 detoxified male alcoholics with 13 healthy men. The authors measured the association of D(2)-like dopamine receptors in the ventral striatum with alcohol craving and central processing of alcohol cues.

Results

Activation of the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum by alcohol-associated stimuli, relative to activation by neutral visual stimuli, was greater in the detoxified alcoholics than in the healthy men. The alcoholics displayed less availability of D(2)-like receptors in the ventral striatum, which was associated with alcohol craving severity and with greater cue-induced activation of the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate as assessed with fMRI.

Discussion

In alcoholics, dopaminergic dysfunction in the ventral striatum may attribute incentive salience to alcohol-associated stimuli, so that alcohol cues elicit craving and excessive activation of neural networks associated with attention and behavior control.

### Genetics of dystonia: what's known? What's new? What's next? [^113ccutf]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Although all forms of dystonia share the core clinical features of involuntary dystonic dyskinesia, there is not only marked phenotypic but also etiologic heterogeneity. Isolated dystonia can be caused by mutations in TOR1A (DYT1), TUBB4 (DYT4), THAP1 (DYT6), CIZ1 (DYT23), ANO3 (DYT24), and GNAL (DYT25). Combined dystonias (with parkinsonism or myoclonus) are further subdivided into persistent (TAF1 [DYT3], GCHI [DYT5], SGCE [DYT11], ATP1A3 [DYT12]), PRKRA (DYT16), and paroxysmal (MR-1 [DYT8], PRRT2 [DYT10], SLC2A1 [DYT18]. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, an unprecedented number of new dystonia genes have recently been described, including 4 in the past 12 months. Despite the need for independent confirmation, these recent findings raise 2 important questions regarding (1) the role of genetics in dystonia overall and (2) the role of different molecular mechanisms in dystonia pathogenesis. The genetic contribution to dystonia represents a continuum ranging from genetic susceptibility factors of small effect to causative genes with markedly reduced penetrance to those with full penetrance. Equally diverse and complex are the pathways and neuronal function(s) putatively involved in dystonia pathogenesis including dopamine signaling, intracellular transport, cytoskeletal dynamics, transcriptional regulation, cell-cycle control, ion channel function, energy metabolism, signal transduction, and detoxification mechanisms. In the next decade of dystonia research, we expect to see the discovery of additional dystonia genes and susceptibility factors. In this context, it will be of great interest to explore whether the diverse cellular functions of the known dystonia proteins may be linked to shared pathways and thus complete the complex puzzle of dystonia pathogenesis. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.

### Dopamine agonists for cocaine dependence [^115rBTFw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cocaine is a major drug of abuse. Cocaine dependence is a common and serious condition, which has become nowadays a substantial public health problem. There is a wide and well documented range of consequences associated to chronic use of this drug, such as medical, psychological and social problems, including the spread of infectious diseases (e.g. AIDS, hepatitis and tuberculosis), crime, violence and neonatal drug exposure. Therapeutic management of the cocaine addicts includes an initial period of abstinence from the drug. During this phase the subjects may experience, besides the intense craving for cocaine, symptoms such as depression, fatigue, irritability, anorexia, and sleep disturbances. It was demonstrated that the acute use of cocaine may enhance dopamine transmission and chronically it decreases dopamine concentrations in the brain. Pharmacological treatment that affects dopamine could theoretically reduce these symptoms and contribute to a more successful therapeutic approach.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of dopamine agonists for treating cocaine dependence.

Search Strategy

We searched: The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (from 1966–2000), EMBASE (from 1980–2000), LILACS (from 1982–2000), PsycLIT (from 1974–2000), Biological Abstracts (1982 to 2000). Reference searching; personal communication; conference abstracts; unpublished trials from pharmaceutical industry; book chapters on treatment of cocaine dependence.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria for all randomised controlled trials were that they should focus on the use of dopamine agonists on the treatment of cocaine dependence. Trials including patients with additional diagnosis such as opiate dependence were also eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

The reviewers extracted the data independently and Relative Risks, weighted mean difference and number needed to treat were estimated. The reviewers assumed that people who died or dropped out had no improvement and tested the sensitivity of the final results to this assumption.

Main Results

Twelve studies were included, with 587 participants randomised. Amantadine and Bromocriptine were compared to placebo in most of trials. In two studies amantadine was directly compared to bromocriptine, while amantadine was compared to desipramine, an antidepressant in three. The main efficacy outcome presented was positive urine sample for cocaine metabolites, with no significant differences between interventions. When retention in treatment was assessed as an acceptability measure, it was found a similar rate of patients remaining in treatment in both placebo and active drugs. There were no significant differences in trials where participants had primary cocaine dependence or had additional diagnosis of opioid dependence and/or were in methadone maintenance treatment.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Current evidence does not support the clinical use of dopamine agonists in the treatment of cocaine dependence. Given the high rate of dropouts in this population, clinicians may consider adding psychotherapeutic supportive measures aiming to keep patients in treatment.

### DOPAL initiates α synuclein-dependent impaired proteostasis and degeneration of neuronal projections in Parkinson's disease [^111xXcmF]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The morphological, functional, and molecular features of the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopaminergic neurons define the uniqueness of this neuronal subpopulation and its preferential vulnerability in Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition to their autonomous pacemaking activity, dopaminergic neurons present complex arborizations of axonal projections, ensuring a profuse number of striatal synaptic connections, whose integrity needs to be preserved through a high bioenergetic supply, and an efficient protein turn-over. According to the dying-back hypothesis for PD, synapse dysfunction and loss constitute the early pathological events initiating a progressive retrograde axonal injury, which gradually evolve to neuronal soma degeneration.

Aging is among the prominent pathological factors leading to PD, as it represents the greatest challenge for upholding efficient degradative pathways, thus altering neuronal protein quality control. Moreover, dopamine-induced oxidative stress seems to be paramount in nigrostriatal neuronal dysfunction as it can affect several intersected pathways, which lead to a negative loop of mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction, and protein aggregation. At striatal terminals, the misfolding and aggregation of αSynuclein (αSyn) constitutes a driving factor in synaptic derangement –.

The concept that a dyshomeostasis of catecholamines may lead to endotoxicity has been lately extended to dopamine catabolites, whose altered levels have been measured in autoptic samples and in vivo PD models. Among them, the monoamine oxidase (MAO) dopamine catabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) is by far the most reactive. Although catechol oxidation to quinone species renders dopamine able to modify thiol groups, this is a spontaneous conversion with a slow kinetics when compared to the rate of enzymatic production of DOPAL by MAO –. The additional presence of the aldehyde moiety in DOPAL exacerbates its reactivity towards proteins, with detrimental outcomes upon accumulation in the intracellular milieu.

The primary site of DOPAL burden is the pre-synaptic terminal, where its buildup is favored by a combination of defective dopamine storage in synaptic vesicles, increased MAO activity with aging, and decreased DOPAL detoxification by the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes (ALDH1A1, ALDH2). Accordingly, transcriptomic and proteomic studies in post-mortem PD patients brains, both familial and idiopathic, identified the selective reduced expression of ALDH1A1 among the molecular determinants involved in the preferential susceptibility of SNpc dopaminergic neurons. thus sustaining that the resulting DOPAL accumulation might be among the driving forces for dopaminergic neuron degeneration.

### Reduced sleep duration mediates decreases in striatal D2 / D3 receptor availability in cocaine abusers [^114pQdWB]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Neuroimaging studies have documented reduced striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor (D2/D3R) availability in cocaine abusers, which has been associated with impaired prefrontal activity and vulnerability for relapse. However, the mechanism(s) underlying the decreases in D2/D3R remain poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that sleep deprivation is associated with a downregulation of striatal D2/D3R in healthy volunteers. As cocaine abusers have disrupted sleep patterns, here we investigated whether reduced sleep duration mediates the relationship between cocaine abuse and low striatal D2/D3R availability. We used positron emission tomography with [(11)C]raclopride to measure striatal D2/D3R availability in 24 active cocaine abusers and 21 matched healthy controls, and interviewed them about their daily sleep patterns. Compared with controls, cocaine abusers had shorter sleep duration, went to bed later and reported longer periods of sleep disturbances. In addition, cocaine abusers had reduced striatal D2/D3R availability. Sleep duration predicted striatal D2/D3R availability and statistically mediated the relationship between cocaine abuse and striatal D2/D3R availability. These findings suggest that impaired sleep patterns contribute to the low striatal D2/D3R availability in cocaine abusers. As sleep impairments are similarly observed in other types of substance abusers (for example, alcohol and methamphetamine), this mechanism may also underlie reductions in D2/D3R availability in these groups. The current findings have clinical implications suggesting that interventions to improve sleep patterns in cocaine abusers undergoing detoxification might be beneficial in improving their clinical outcomes.

### Catechols in post-mortem brain of patients with parkinson disease [^112hHkbA]. European Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), a cytotoxic metabolite of dopamine, is the focus of the 'catecholaldehyde hypothesis' about the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. This study explored whether DOPAL is detectable in human striatum - especially in the putamen (Pu), the main site of dopamine depletion in Parkinson disease - and is related to other neurochemical indices of catecholamine stores and metabolism in Parkinson disease.

Methods

Putamen, caudate (Cd), and frontal cortex (Ctx) catechols were measured in tissue from patients with pathologically proven end-stage Parkinson disease (N = 15) and control subjects (N = 14) of similar age with similar post-mortem intervals.

Results

Putamen DOPAL (3% of dopamine in controls) correlated with dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid both across all subjects and within the Parkinson disease and control groups. Pu dopamine was decreased by 93% and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid 95% in Parkinson disease vs. controls, with smaller decreases of DOPAL (83%) and norepinephrine (73%) in Pu and of dopamine (74%) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (82%) in Cd. In Parkinson disease, Pu DOPAL:dihydroxyphenylacetic acid averaged 3.4 times and DOPAL:dopamine 4.4 times control (P = 0.03 each). The main catecholamine in Ctx was norepinephrine, which was decreased by 51% in Parkinson disease patients.

Conclusions

Correlated decreases of DOPAL, dopamine, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in Parkinson disease reflect severe loss of Pu dopamine stores, which seems more extensive than loss of Pu norepinephrine or Cd dopamine stores. Increased Pu DOPAL:dihydroxyphenylacetic acid ratios in Parkinson disease suggest decreased detoxification of DOPAL by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Elevated levels of cytosolic DOPAL might contribute to loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson disease.

### Genetics of dopamine receptors and drug addiction [^115X5G8T]. Human Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Dopamine plays a key role in reward behavior, yet the association of drug dependence as a chronic, relapsing disorder with the genes encoding the various dopaminergic receptor subtypes remains difficult to delineate. In the context of subsequent genome-wide association (GWAS) research and post-GWAS investigations, we summarize the novel data that link genes encoding molecules involved in the dopaminergic system (dopamine receptors, transporter and enzymes in charge of its metabolism) to drug addiction. Recent reports indicate that the heritability of drug addiction should be high enough to allow a significant role for a specific set of genes, and the available genetic studies, which might not be already conclusive because of the heterogeneity of designs, methods and recruited samples, should support the idea of a significant role of at least one gene related to dopaminergic system. Evolutionary changes in primates and non-primate animals of genes coding for molecules involved in dopaminergic system highlight why addictive disorders are mainly limited to humans. Restricting the analyses to more specific intermediate phenotypes (or endophenotypes) such as attention allocation, stress reactivity, novelty seeking, behavioral disinhibition and impulsivity, instead of the broad addictive disorder concept can be instrumental to identify novel genes associated with these traits in the context of genome-wide studies.

### Association of dopamine transporter reduction with psychomotor impairment in methamphetamine abusers [^114kJDdr]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Methamphetamine is a popular and highly addictive drug of abuse that has raised concerns because it has been shown in laboratory animals to be neurotoxic to dopamine terminals. The authors evaluated if similar changes occur in humans and assessed if they were functionally significant.

Method

Positron emission tomography scans following administration of [(11)C]d-threo-methylphenidate (a dopamine transporter ligand) measured dopamine transporter levels (a marker of dopamine cell terminals) in the brains of 15 detoxified methamphetamine abusers and 18 comparison subjects. Neuropsychological tests were also performed to assess motor and cognitive function.

Results

Methamphetamine abusers showed significant dopamine transporter reduction in the striatum (mean differences of 27.8% in the caudate and 21.1% in the putamen) relative to the comparison subjects; this reduction was evident even in abusers who had been detoxified for at least 11 months. Dopamine transporter reduction was associated with motor slowing and memory impairment.

Conclusions

These results provide evidence that methamphetamine at dose levels taken by human abusers of the drug leads to dopamine transporter reduction that is associated with motor and cognitive impairment. These results emphasize the urgency of alerting clinicians and the public of the long-term changes that methamphetamine can induce in the human brain.

### DOPAL initiates α synuclein-dependent impaired proteostasis and degeneration of neuronal projections in Parkinson's disease [^116jL2x7]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

As aggregated αSyn, highly phosphorylated at Ser129, ubiquitin, p62, and lipid membranes are the main constituents of Lewy Bodies (LBs) –, these observations become of interest in the context of PD pathology. It may be speculated that, as αSyn-DOPAL oligomers burden impedes degradative pathways and neuronal proteostasis in general, this might lead to αSyn accumulation with enhanced on-pathway fibrillation in the cell body, further contributing to LBs formation.

A consideration is due on our in vitro models, as we mainly used non-dopaminergic neuronal cultures that did not allow to induce endogenous DOPAL buildup. This choice has its rationale in circumventing experimental limits and the impaired dopamine catabolism in PD. First, the in vitro paradigm aimed at modeling in a short time span the neurotoxic outcomes that would result from a chronic accumulation of endogenous DOPAL in a dopaminergic system. A substantial body of evidence demonstrated a decreased expression and activity of ALDH1A1 in PD patients' nigrostriatal neurons, highly affecting dopamine catabolism and increasing DOPAL levels. Hence, the non-dopaminergic neurons fairly represent a similar scenario as they only express the mitochondrial ubiquitous ALDH2 which has lower affinity for DOPAL as compared to ALDH1A1. Here, we applied DOPAL treatments to the cell culture medium using a concentration that would ensure a significant increase in the amount of intracellular DOPAL, as assessed by nIRF detection of DOPAL-modified proteins in the cell lysate. Also, we previously demonstrated that, following overnight administration (at a concentration of 100 μM), DOPAL can in fact interact with αSyn in cells and covalently modify its lysines, as detected by mass spectrometry. At the same time, it is very difficult to obtain pure dopaminergic primary neuronal cultures in which dopamine catabolic pathway can be modulated and it may compromise the possibility to detect an effect. Nevertheless, we managed to obtain primary mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in which we could demonstrate that an impaired DOPAL detoxification by ALDH inhibition dramatically affects axonal arborization in an αSyn-dependent mode, overall supporting a contributing mechanism for the dying-back hypothesis of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we observed a reduced co-localization between TH and DAT only in the DEAB-exposed wild-type neurons, which we speculated to be an indication of synapse dysfunction accompanied by the axonal degeneration. Of note, αSyn aggregates have been previously demonstrated to interact with DAT affecting its levels and trafficking at the striatal terminals. Hence, it will be of importance to untangle whether DOPAL-αSyn oligomers can interfere with DAT localization and function in the early synaptic degeneration.

### Compulsive use of dopamine replacement therapy: a model for stimulant drug addiction? [^112suSfz]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

The compulsive use of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) or dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is one of the behavioural disturbances reported in some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other disorders who are receiving DRT. We draw this phenomenon to the attention of the addiction field as a topic deserving of more systematic study. We outline: the clinical features, epidemiology and clinical correlates of the disorder; the unresolved issues in its definition and diagnosis; and its potential relevance to neurobiological models of psychostimulant addiction. We argue that compulsive DRT use may provide a useful model for drug addiction, while advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and improving the management of PD patients with the disorder.

### Dopamine metabolism by a monoamine oxidase mitochondrial shuttle activates the electron transport chain [^112B9Tqs]. Nature Neuroscience (2020). High credibility.

Monoamine oxidase (MAO) metabolizes cytosolic dopamine (DA), thereby limiting auto-oxidation, but is also thought to generate cytosolic hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). We show that MAO metabolism of DA does not increase cytosolic H₂O₂ but leads to mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activity. This is dependent upon MAO anchoring to the outer mitochondrial membrane and shuttling electrons through the intermembrane space to support the bioenergetic demands of phasic DA release.

### Reduced sleep duration mediates decreases in striatal D2 / D3 receptor availability in cocaine abusers [^112SqTYY]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cocaine abusers when compared with healthy non-drug abusing controls have reduced striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor (D2/D3R) availability whether they are tested during early withdrawal or after protracted detoxification reviewed in refs, and these reductions persist after months of abstinence. Reduced striatal D2/D3R availability in cocaine abusers has been associated with increased drug craving, risk of relapse, impaired activity in prefrontal brain regions involved with self control, future cocaine preferencesand poor treatment outcomes. In preclinical studies, low D2/D3R are associated with a propensity to administer higher doses of cocaine in nonhuman primatesand with compulsive patterns of cocaine intake in rats. As such, reduced striatal D2/D3R may motivate individuals to use drugs of abuse to increase dopaminergic neurotransmission as a way of self-medication. In nonhuman primates, continuous cocaine administration was shown to reduce D2/D3R availability. These reductions remained constant following a year of cocaine administration and persisted after a year of abstinence. Although cocaine-induced increases in dopamine may influence D2/D3R receptor expression directly, the exact mechanism(s) underlying the decrease in D2/D3R associated with chronic cocaine exposures remain poorly understood.

Acute sleep deprivation has been shown to decrease striatal D2/D3R availability in healthy volunteers, which correlated with worse performance on visual attention tasks. These reductions in D2/D3R were initially interpreted to reflect increased dopamine release (interfering with the binding of the radiotracer). However, a subsequent imaging study that used methylphenidate as a challenge in humans along with microdialysis studies in rodents showed no evidence of increased dopamine release with sleep deprivation, thus indicating downregulation of D2/D3R receptors.

Cocaine use disorders are associated with significant sleep disturbances. Acute cocaine abuse increases wakefulness and reduces sleep durationand chronic cocaine abusers suffer from a decrease in sleep quality and duration, which has also been described in rodents that self-administered cocaine. Delays in sleep onset have been shown, which progressively worsened over the course of abstinence. Moreover, Shumay et al. showed that a variant in the PER2 gene, which is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, was associated with lower striatal D2/D3 availability and was more prevalent in cocaine abusers than controls; this suggests a relationship between sleep rhythms, cocaine abuse and striatal D2/D3Rs. These findings together led us to hypothesize that sleep disturbances contribute to reductions in striatal D2/D3R availability in cocaine abusers.

### Rethinking Parkinson's disease: could dopamine reduction therapy have clinical utility? [^112cBdfc]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

If Hirsch's hypothesis of "suffering" neurons is true, then reducing dopamine could reverse the disease pathology in these dysfunctional neurons and preserve the functional neurons, potentially restoring movement and cognition in the long term. With protection from dopamine and its metabolites, perhaps disease progression can be halted or even reversed. Would further studies in other experimental models be reasonable next step? Perhaps we could learn more about the science, but given the inability for any single model to reliably predict clinical effects, it seems reasonable to move directly to clinical studies, particularly with a repurposed drug available. Such clinical trials will define the place of dopamine reduction relative to dopaminergic agents in the treatment of disease and determine whether excess cytosolic dopamine is a primary driver of disease.

### Promoter specific methylation of the dopamine transporter gene is altered in alcohol dependence and associated with craving [^1145pAnr]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2009). Low credibility.

Dopaminergic neurotransmission plays a crucial role in the genesis and maintenance of alcohol dependence. Epigenetic regulation via promoter specific DNA methylation of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT) may influence altered dopaminergic neurotransmission in alcoholism. Aim of the present study was to investigate DNA promoter methylation of DAT in early alcohol withdrawal and in relation to alcohol craving. We analyzed blood samples of 76 patients admitted for detoxification treatment and compared them to 35 healthy controls. Methylation specific quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the promoter specific DNA methylation of the dopamine transporter. We assessed the extent of alcohol craving using the obsessive compulsive drinking scale (OCDS). Compared to healthy controls we found a significant hypermethylation of the DAT-promoter (Mann-Whitney U-test: p = 0.001). Ln-transformed methylation of the DAT-promoter was negatively associated with the OCDS (linear regression: Beta = -0.275, p = 0.016), particularly with the obsessive subscale (Beta = -0.300, p = 0.008). Findings of the present study show that the epigenetic regulation of the DAT-promoter is altered in patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal. Furthermore, hypermethylation of the DAT-promoter may play an important role in dopaminergic neurotransmission and is associated with decreased alcohol craving.

### Acquired dysregulation of dopamine homeostasis reproduces features of Parkinson's disease [^111UMWpT]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor deficits resulting from the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. Postmortem analyses of brains from Parkinson's patients show a loss of neuromelanin containing neuronal cell bodies in the substantia nigra and a progressive loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. Within remaining neurons, there is evidence of neuronal dysfunction in the form of protein inclusions called Lewy bodies — a primary component of which is aggregated α-synuclein. Parkinson's disease cases resulting solely from genetic factors are rare, and the majority of cases are believed to be the result of complex interactions between predisposition genes, a lifetime accumulation of environmental exposures, and deficits due to normal aging processes –. While multiple neuronal populations are affected in Parkinson's disease, the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons appear to have increased vulnerability to degeneration and the loss of these neurons results in the cardinal motor symptoms that lead to a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. It is hypothesized that dopamine, the neurotransmitter these neurons use to regulate motor output, contributes to the vulnerability to degeneration; this is thought to be due to dopamine's potential to act as an endogenous neurotoxin through two processes that generate reactive metabolites and reactive oxygen species: oxidation and enzymatic catabolism.

Dopamine oxidation occurs either by autooxidation or enzymatic oxidation and generates the highly reactive and electrophilic dopamine quinone, producing either H₂O₂ or superoxide as a byproduct. The dopamine quinone will bind to free and protein-bound nucleophilic cysteine, as well as highly nucleophilic selenocysteine found in selenoproteins, such as the mitochondrially-localized antioxidant selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4). The dopamine quinone has been shown to impair several neuronal processes with mitochondrial dysfunction being a common downstream consequence –. If dopamine does not undergo oxidation, it is susceptible to enzymatic catabolism, which generates the metabolite DOPAL while producing H₂O₂ as a byproduct. Similarly to the dopamine quinone, upon accumulating in the cytosol, DOPAL will react with proteins and generate additional reactive oxygen species as a byproduct. To minimize the accumulation of cytosolic dopamine to preserve neuronal health, there exist physical interactions between dopamine synthesis, packaging, and reuptake machinery. Following synthesis in the cytosol or presynaptic terminal reuptake, dopamine is rapidly sequestered into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) thereby isolating and stabilizing dopamine. However, there is significant evidence of VMAT2 deficiency in Parkinson's disease, which implicates dysregulation of dopamine handling in the development and/or progression of the disease –.

### Is there a common molecular pathway for addiction? [^1139nHNt]. Nature Neuroscience (2005). Medium credibility.

Drugs of abuse have very different acute mechanisms of action but converge on the brain's reward pathways by producing a series of common functional effects after both acute and chronic administration. Some similar actions occur for natural rewards as well. Researchers are making progress in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of these common effects. A major goal for future research is to determine whether such common underpinnings of addiction can be exploited for the development of more effective treatments for a wide range of addictive disorders.

### Molecular epidemiology of smoking and lung cancer [^114Af5yQ]. Oncogene (2002). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is the single most common cause of death, and almost all of it is due to tobacco smoking. Before the widespread use of cigarettes in this century, lung cancer was a rare illness. Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of numerous mutagens and carcinogens. Over the last 40 years, the type of cigarettes most frequently used has been changing, namely the increased use of low tar and nicotine cigarettes. This has been accompanied by an increased risk of lung cancer due to a smokers' need to maintain blood nicotine levels, which in turn causes the need for smoking more cigarettes per day and deeper inhalation. This phenomena has led to the increasing rates of lung adenocarcinoma, compared to squamous cell carcinoma. It also probably explains, in part, the greater risk of lung cancer in women compared to men (in addition to some biological differences). The study of lung cancer involves many types of biomarkers, including those that measure exposure, the biologically effective dose and harm. The use of these has allowed us to understand many parts of lung carcinogenesis. Genetic susceptibilities play a large role in lung cancer risk. They govern smoking behavior (affecting dopamine reward mechanisms due to nicotine and nicotine metabolism), carcinogen metabolism and detoxification, DNA repair, cell cycle control and other cellular responses. The need for the study of lung cancer is highlighted by the need to improve cessation rates and reduce exposure among persons who cannot quit smoking, for better prevention strategies for former smokers and an understanding of environmental tobacco smoke risk.

### Rethinking Parkinson's disease: could dopamine reduction therapy have clinical utility? [^111eHaDi]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Following reports of low striatal dopamine content in Parkinson's disease, levodopa was shown to rapidly reverse hypokinesis, establishing the model of disease as one of dopamine deficiency. Dopaminergic therapy became standard of care, yet it failed to reverse the disease, suggesting the understanding of disease was incomplete. The literature suggests the potential for toxicity of dopamine and its metabolites, perhaps more relevant given the recent evidence for elevated cytosolic dopamine levels in the dopaminergic neurons of people with Parkinson's. To understand the relevance of these data, multiple investigations are reviewed that tested dopamine reduction therapy as an alternative to dopaminergic agents. The data from use of an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis in experimental models suggest that such an approach could reverse disease pathology, which suggests that cytosolic dopamine excess is a primary driver of disease. These data support clinical investigation of dopamine reduction therapy for Parkinson's disease. Doing so will determine whether these experimental models are predictive and this treatment strategy is worth pursuing further. If clinical data are positive, it could warrant reconsideration of our disease model and treatment strategies, including a shift from dopaminergic to dopamine reduction treatment of the disease.

### Pyridoxine induces glutathione synthesis via PKM2-mediated nrf2 transactivation and confers neuroprotection [^116wy2Wt]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In recent years, the nonmetabolic functions of PKM2 in a series of biological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cytokinesis, have sparked considerable interest –. Our results uncover a new noncanonical function of PKM2 as a transcriptional coactivator of Nrf2, which cooperates with its metabolic function to divert glucose flux into the pentose phosphate pathwayand thereby generates sufficient GSH for ROS detoxification. Moreover, our results indicate that tumor cells can employ PKM2 to produce GSH and escape from oxidative stress, which explains the essentiality of PKM2 for tumor proliferationfrom another perspective.

Existing therapeutic strategies for PD treatment, which attempt to compensate for the loss of dopamine, are limited by their side effects and lack of long-term efficacy. Hence, understanding dopamine receptor signaling and avoiding the activation of downstream events that produce side effects is an approach for improving PD therapies. Auspiciously, we found that PKM2 mediates DRD2-induced GSH production and is selectively expressed in astrocytes, indicating that PKM2 dimerization is an ideal approach to restore GSH synthesis and prevent side effects induced by effects on neuron functions. These advantages make PKM2 a potential target for PD treatment.

Our results demonstrate that pyridoxine, also known as vitamin B 6, induces GSH synthesis via PKM2-mediated Nrf2 transactivation and confers neuroprotection. Notably, pyridoxine has an interaction with levodopa (L-DOPA), the mainstay in PD treatment. On the one hand, pyridoxine is consumed by L-DOPA metabolism; thus, the use of levodopa can cause symptomatic pyridoxine deficiency. On the other hand, pyridoxine is the coenzyme of dopa decarboxylase, converting L-DOPA to dopamine, which raises a concern that pyridoxine supplementation may result in peripheral metabolism of L-DOPA and a lack of bioavailability in the brain. However, recent studies have demonstrated that a pyridoxine intake of at most 50 mg day⁻¹ would not reduce the efficacy of L-DOPA. In summary, proper supplementation of pyridoxine is essential to L-DOPA treatment and does not reduce the efficacy of L-DOPA.

### The effects of social isolation stress and discrimination on mental health [^114nsR6r]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Monoaminergic neurotransmission

Alterations in monoaminergic neurotransmission have repeatedly been observed in subjects with major mental disorders. To highlight just a few findings, drug-induced dopamine release has been associated with attribution of incentive salience to drug-associated stimuli, while stress-dependent dopamine release may contribute to salience attribution to otherwise irrelevant stimuli in schizophrenia. In humans, acute stress exposure was associated with an indirect measure of dopamine release in subjects with a history of low parental care only. In persons with schizophrenia, meta-analytic evidence confirms that dopamine synthesis capacity, release, and synaptic levels are increased, albeit synthesis capacity was not elevated in treatment-resistant patients, pointing to substantial individual variability. All drugs of abuse release dopamine, preferentially in the nucleus accumbens shell. A (most likely compensatory) down-regulation of dopamine D2 receptors in this brain area was associated with alcohol craving and increased alcohol cue reactivity among detoxified persons with alcohol dependence, while during prolonged abstinence, a (rebound) increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission was found. Furthermore, during alcohol detoxification stress in humans, high cortisol levels were associated with a low availability of brainstem serotonin transporters, which in turn correlated with subjective levels of anxiety and depression, in accordance with the observation that corticosterone application reduces serotonin transporter density in young adult rats.

The non-human primate studies of the group of Dee Higley and co-workers demonstrate how important it is to distinguish between acute and chronic effects of social isolation stress on monoaminergic neurotransmission. Specifically, rhesus monkeys who were separated as neonates from their mothers displayed acute increases but chronic reductions in CSF serotonin metabolites. Measuring the available serotonin transporters in both non-human primates and humans revealed inverse correlations between CSF serotonin metabolites and in vivo transporter availability, most likely due to competition between endogenous serotonin levels and radioligand binding at the transporter site. In non-human primates, low serotonin turnover as reflected in low CSF serotonin metabolite levels was associated with a lower level of intoxication by alcohol and increased alcohol intake. In comparison among humans, low serotonin turnover was associated with increased clinical depression among detoxified alcohol-dependent patients.

### Inpatient gamma-hydroxybutyrate detoxification: a case report describing day-to-day therapeutic management [^114berva]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This case report pertains to a patient who successfully completed inpatient GHB detoxification, after several unsuccessful detoxification attempts without any medical support. We are reminded of the existence of severe GHB use disorders and this case also confirms existing data on withdrawal modes: the rapid onset of symptoms, clinical symptoms similar to those of GABAergic withdrawal, the frequency of hallucinatory symptoms, and the effectiveness of long half-life benzodiazepine therapy — including diazepam as a first intention therapeutic option to endure withdrawal symptoms. In this case report, withdrawal symptoms lasted 8 days, which can be considered as a long time in light of the period of elimination of GHB. Withdrawal symptoms beginning within 1 to 12 hours after the last dose (4 hours for our patient) and which may continue for 3 to 21 days were reported in literature. Although it is known that GHB increases the intracellular level of dopamine in both the mesolimbic system and the nigrostriatal pathway, the translation to the clinical symptoms observed during withdrawal is unclear. The sustained modifications within the central nervous system, persisting even after stopping GHB, could explain the kinetics and the complex forms of the withdrawal syndrome (agitation, anxiety, hallucinations). Treatment with typical or atypical antipsychotics has been necessary in some cases, although not for the patient in this case report. This suggests that scheduled inpatient detoxification, with daily supervision and medication dosage adjustments, could help patients cope with the severity of withdrawal syndrome and prevent complications. Recently, have developed decision guidelines to determine whether an outpatient or inpatient setting should be chosen. Surprisingly, they do not consider a history of unsuccessful outpatient detoxification as a criterion for the indication of inpatient detoxification. In this context, it is important to establish consensual international guidelines. Furthermore, using an established tool for the management of GHB withdrawal syndrome symptoms could provide a basis for improved adaptation of medication dosage to the specific needs of patients.

### Iron and dopamine: a toxic couple [^111HDuPF]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Iron accumulation is a cardinal feature of degenerating regions in the Parkinson's disease brain. As a potent pro-oxidant, redox-active iron may be a key player in upstream mechanisms that precipitate cell death in this disorder. Although an elevation in brain iron levels is a normal feature of ageing, the increase is greater in Parkinson's disease; on the other hand, the effects of the disease are most marked in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. In this Update, we explain that neurodegeneration in the affected regions may result from the potent redox couple formed by iron and dopamine itself, and discuss the clinical implications of this molecular trait in this dynamic and rapidly moving area of Parkinson's disease research.

### Blunted dopamine transmission in addiction: potential mechanisms and implications for behavior [^114h8bLz]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging consistently shows blunted striatal dopamine release and decreased dopamine D2 receptor availability in addiction. Here, we review the preclinical and clinical studies indicating that this neurobiological phenotype is likely to be both a consequence of chronic drug consumption and a vulnerability factor in the development of addiction. We propose that, behaviorally, blunted striatal dopamine transmission could reflect the increased impulsivity and altered cost/benefit computations that are associated with addiction. The factors that influence blunted striatal dopamine transmission in addiction are unknown. Herein, we give an overview of various factors, genetic, environmental, and social, that are known to affect dopamine transmission and that have been associated with the vulnerability to develop addiction. Altogether, these data suggest that blunted dopamine transmission and decreased D2 receptor availability are biomarkers both for the development of addiction and resistance to treatment. These findings support the view that blunted dopamine reflects impulsive behavior and deficits in motivation, which lead to the escalation of drug use.

### Nitrosative stress in Parkinson's disease [^116oPTbM]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Effects of NO on dopamine homeostasis in neurons

The unique susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons to nitrosative stress, may relate to dopamine synthesis and catabolism. Indeed, the dopamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase can be inactivated by tyrosine nitration, reducing intracellular dopamine levels. In addition, NO also catalyzes the auto-oxidation of dopamine (via quinones and semiquinones)causing protein-, lipid-, or DNA- dopamine-adducts that can lead to neurodegeneration. What's more, dopamine itself can react with many RNS including nitric dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen trioxide forming 6-nitrosodopamine which can further react with RNS to produce 6-nitrodopamine which can then produce other radicals and RNS. Together these findings suggest that dopaminergic neurons are vulnerable to nitrosative stress due, in part, to the presence of dopamine per se. RNS-altered dopamine may dysregulate dopamine homeostasis and further intensify RNS.

The effects of RNS on mitochondria also has specific implications for dopaminergic neurons since the breakdown of dopamine by the mitochondrial localized enzyme monoamine oxidase produces the metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) whose interaction with NO can impair mitochondrial respiration. The combination of DOPAC and NO was shown to also cause a decrease in glutathione. Glutathione, a thiol-reducing agent and antioxidant responsible for the breakdown of H₂O₂, is known to be dysregulated in PD patients. Indeed, decreasing glutathione synthesis in dopamine cells causes the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I in either a NO- or ONOO⁻ -dependent manner, depending on whether the treatment was acute or chronic, respectively. While the nature of the interaction between NO, DOPAC and complex I remains elusive, it is likely to play a part in the early decline of dopaminergic neurons in PD.

### Synchrony between midbrain gene transcription and dopamine terminal regulation is modulated by chronic alcohol drinking [^116ZBw6j]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Clinical literature has shown that AUD is associated with marked hypofunction of dopaminergic activity in the ventral striatum which can be observed into abstinence. Here we demonstrate that multiple inhibitory regulators of dopaminergic activity, dopamine transporters and kappa opioid receptors, are functionally upregulated in protracted abstinence from alcohol, providing a putative mechanism for the lasting hypodopaminergic state observed in AUD. Minimal work has assessed the persistence of plasticity at specific receptors and transporters into protracted abstinence and the molecular mechanisms that underly them. By demonstrating augmented dopamine reuptake, kappa opioid receptor sensitivity, and dynorphin release probability that exists after protracted abstinence, we highlight functional processes that are disrupted with chronic alcohol consumption and offer evidence supporting the potential utility of these pathways as therapeutic targets during the critical abstinence intervention point. Though more work needs to be done, the initial findings suggest that kappa opioid receptor control of dopamine release is G protein mediated while alcohol-induced upregulation may be related to altered β-arrestin. Together, this suggests that biased kappa opioid receptor ligands may be a beneficial approach to developing therapeutics for AUD and limiting off-target effects.

### Recent understanding in the mechanisms of addiction [^112rEeTt]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

The rewarding effects of drugs of abuse have been linked to increases in dopamine transmission. However, changes in brain chemistry and morphology that are produced in addiction underlie the long-lasting vulnerability to relapse and are more closely linked with the adaptations in excitatory transmission. The drug-induced changes in excitatory transmission seem to be pathologic exacerbations of normal forms of brain plasticity, and they occur in the brain areas linked by neuroimaging studies in addicted patients to craving and relapse. This review describes the brain adaptations produced in excitatory transmission by addictive drugs and identifies new potential sites of pharmacotherapeutic intervention to ameliorate addiction.

### VMAT2 safeguards β-cells against dopamine cytotoxicity under high-fat diet-induced stress [^115YFDiG]. Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) uptakes cytoplasmic monoamines into vesicles for storage. VMAT2 plays a role in modulating insulin release by regulating dopamine levels in the pancreas, although the exact mechanism remains elusive. We found that VMAT2 expression in β-cells specifically increases under high blood glucose conditions. The islets isolated from β-cell-specific Vmat2 knockout (βVmat2KO) mice show elevated insulin secretion levels in response to glucose stimulation. Under prolonged high-fat diet feedings, the βVmat2KO mice exhibit impaired glucose and insulin tolerance and progressive β-cell dysfunction. Here we demonstrate VMAT2 uptake of dopamine to protect dopamine from degradation by monoamine oxidase, thereby safeguarding β-cells from excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) exposure. In the context of high demand for insulin secretion, the absence of VMAT2 leads to elevated ROS in β-cells, which accelerates β-cell dedifferentiation and β-cell loss. Therefore, VMAT2 controls the amount of dopamine in β-cells, thereby protecting pancreatic β-cells from excessive oxidative stress.

### Venlafaxine dependence in a patient with a history of alcohol and amineptine misuse [^114nxeB6]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Venlafaxine is an inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake and a weak inhibitor of dopamine re-uptake. There was no indication of problems of abuse/dependence during the clinical trials.

Case Description

A 53-year-old client with a history of alcohol and amineptine misuse and a long history of recurrent depression, for which he was prescribed venlafaxine tablets. Over time, he increased the dosage to 50 tablets daily (3750 mg). Large venlafaxine dosages produced amphetamine-like effects, due possibly to the related increase in dopamine turnover. Once hospitalized for detoxification, the patient had a symptomatology which was consistent with a serotonergic discontinuation syndrome.

Conclusions

Physicians should be aware that patients with a history of drug and alcohol abuse might develop venlafaxine dependence.

### Dopamine hydrochloride (dopamine hydrochloride and dextrose) [^111WQKYd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Dopamine is a natural catecholamine formed by the decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). It is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal tract, and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves.

Dopamine produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings.

Dopamine's onset of action occurs within five minutes of intravenous administration, and with dopamine's plasma half-life of about two minutes, the duration of action is less than ten minutes. If monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are present, however, the duration may increase to one hour. The drug is widely distributed in the body but does not cross the blood-brain barrier to a significant extent. Dopamine is metabolized in the liver, kidney, and plasma by MAO and catechol-O-methyltransferase to the inactive compounds homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. About 25% of the dose is taken up into specialized neurosecretory vesicles (the adrenergic nerve terminals), where it is hydroxylated to form norepinephrine. It has been reported that about 80% of the drug is excreted in the urine within 24 hours, primarily as HVA and its sulfate and glucuronide conjugates and as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. A very small portion is excreted unchanged.

### Inpatient gamma-hydroxybutyrate detoxification: a case report describing day-to-day therapeutic management [^111AeYcf]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is an endogenous compound both precursor to and metabolite of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). GHB is found in the hippocampus, cortex, thalamus, and amygdala where it binds to GHB receptors. Exogenous GHB is absorbed through the digestive system and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Exogenous administration of GHB results in the activation of the GABA-B receptor. GHB has a high affinity to GABA-B receptors and to a lesser extent to subtypes of GABA-A receptors. In addition to interacting with GABA and GHB receptors, GHB has been shown to produce effects linked to other neurotransmitters, in particular dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine. The effects of GHB on the central nervous system are 2-fold; GHB initially acts as an inhibitor of dopamine release, before secondly increasing dopamine concentrations. Furthermore, small increases in central nervous system serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations also occur. GHB produces a mix of stimulant-sedative subjective effects. The dose-effect curve for GHB is steep, this means that small increases in dosage result in disproportionately large increases in effects and toxicity. Lower doses are sufficient to induce euphoria and well-being, whereas larger doses result in drowsiness and effects on both speech and motor coordination. GHB is approved as a treatment option for cataplexy in narcolepsy (the exact mechanism has not been elucidated, although a mechanism via the stimulation of inhibitory extrasynaptic GABA receptors has recently been proposed). GHB is also used illicitly. Recreational users seek GHB-induced euphoria, anxiolysis, and positive effect on libido. These effects explain the increase of the recreational use of GHB, during the last decades, in Europe. Moreover, GHB has been incriminated in sexual assaults. Cases of sexual assault may be underreported as victims may be, due to the administration of GHB, heavily sedated or comatose. GHB-induced amnesia can also add further difficulty in the recollection of facts. This leads to a delay before care. When finally admitted for care, a victims' plasma or urine GHB concentrations may be too low to detect. Due to the potent depressant effect on the central nervous system, high GHB concentrations in plasma might cause death from cardiorespiratory depression. Furthermore, GHB is considered to have a high dependence potential, and abrupt discontinuation after long-term use can result in a severe withdrawal syndrome. Despite a large number of publications related to GHB withdrawal and detoxification (eg;,), to date, no evidence-based protocol or consensual international guidelines are available — over and above the administration of benzodiazepines.

### A hPSC-based platform to discover gene-environment interactions that impact human β-cell and dopamine neuron survival [^111Gm5w8]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

β-cells are sensitive to propargite due to low glutathione

A previous study found that in rats propargite and propargite-immediate metabolites directly conjugated with glutathione (GSH) before glutathione S-transferases (GST) enzyme detoxification and degradation. To determine whether the hypersensitivity of INS + pancreatic β-cells was due to low glutathione (GSH) levels, the endogenous GSH levels were measured in hESC-derived INS -GFP + and INS − cells, primary human islets, and BJ-fibroblasts. The INS -GFP + cells and human islets had significantly lower GSH levels compared to those of INS − and fibroblast cells (Fig. 2f). To determine whether low GSH levels caused hypersensitivity to propargite treatment, GSH was added to cultured cells in an attempt to rescue propargite-induced β-cell toxicity. Indeed, 2 mM GSH fully rescued the survival rate of INS + cells after propargite treatment (Fig. 2g, h). In addition, GSH also rescued the propargite-induced pancreatic β-cell-specific death in human islets (Fig. 2i, j). Furthermore, RNA-seq profiles showed that GSH reversed propargite-induced global transcriptional changes (Fig. 2k, l), including the down-regulation of genes related to pancreas function and the upregulation of genes associated with cell death (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Additionally, GSH fully rescued propargite-induced DNA damage (indicated by γ-H2A.X expression levels) and partially rescued propargite-induced necrosis, as indicated by extracellular HMGB1 protein levels (Fig. 2m). Since GSH is an important anti-oxidant, the propargite-treated MIN6 cells were monitored for reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Supplementary Fig. 3b). However, we did not find any increase of ROS in propargite-treated conditions, suggesting the effect of GSH on rescuing β-like cells from propargite-induced necrosis was not due to its antioxidative properties. Previous findings in rodents reported on a GSH-dependent propargite detoxification pathway (Supplementary Fig. 3c), suggesting that a similar mechanism may apply to its action in pancreatic β-cells.

### Dietary L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) augments cuticular melanization in anopheles mosquitos reducing their lifespan and malaria burden [^115vnroX]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In insects, melanin is synthesized both in the exoskeleton (cuticle) and inside the body, including by the immune system, which uses melanization as an antimicrobial mechanism –. The cuticle is crucial for insect survival, making it a primary target for pest and disease vector control. Its mechanical properties (i.e. rigidity and flexibility) are related to various chitins, proteins, and the type and abundance of sclerotization or protein crosslinking occurring within. This study demonstrates that Anopheles mosquitoes can use dietary L-DOPA to enhance cuticle melanization, leading to increased body pigmentation, cuticular thickness in the legs, overall indole and chitin content, and a key EPR signal (Fig. 7). Given the abundance of L-DOPA in the environment and the potential microbiome sources of dopamine, our results have important implications for mosquito biology and potential control strategies.

Cuticular melanogenesis is closely related to cuticular hardening or sclerotization. Both are oxidative processes occurring in the same tissues and use L-DOPA or dopamine as precursors; however, the participation of laccase 2 (AGAP008731) and dopamine derivatives such as N -acetyl-dopamine (NADA) and N -β-alanyldopamine (NBAD) in mediating covalent crosslinks between cuticular proteins and/or between cuticular proteins and chitin fibers is exclusive to the sclerotization process. Our data demonstrate that mosquitoes can metabolize L-DOPA via a non-canonical pathway using 3,4-dihydroxylphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) synthase (Fig. 10a). As a detoxification mechanism, L-DOPA is directly converted into DOPAL and hydrogen peroxide. The resulting hydrogen peroxide further oxidizes the DOPAL catechol ring, leading to the formation of a melanized and flexible cuticle crosslinked with cuticular proteins, while bypassing the conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine. The buildup of DOPAL promotes oligomerization and the formation of quinone adduct ("quinonization"), which inhibits its own metabolism and the activity of other enzymes involved in the melanin biosynthesis. Therefore, this study supports that L-DOPA-induced downregulation of key melanization pathway genes (e.g. DDC and DCE) occurs at transcriptional level leading to a reduction of their protein translation/production (Fig. 10b). Further studies are required to demonstrate DOPAL buildup and protein modification.

Furthermore, insect herbivores can use plant-synthesized compounds by ingesting and storing them in their hemolymph, integument (cuticle), and other compartments such as cuticular cavities, in subcuticular compartments, fat body, or in exocrine defense glands. This process, known as chemical sequestration, requires the active transport of the compound from the gut lumen across the midgut epithelium and to other compartments via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) transporters. Unlike metabolic resistance, which involves alteration and detoxification of the compound or plant toxin, sequestered compounds must preserve their pharmacological activity, allowing insects to benefit from them. For instance, sequestered aromatic compounds have been linked to defense, reproduction, or exoskeleton stabilization in various insect orders, including Diptera. Our RNA-seq data from midguts of L-DOPA-fed mosquitoes reveals upregulation of AGAP006221, a gene coding for an aldehyde oxidase, as well as two transport-related genes — sodium-dependent nutrient amino acid transporter 5 (AGAP010857) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 2 (AGAP002972). AGAP006221 is highly upregulated in A. stephensi at early stages (up to 24 h) post-permethrin exposure, thereby playing a critical role in its detoxification process. Interestingly, in response to the insecticide-mediated stress, these authors found a broad downregulation of CYPs, GSTs, and carboxylesterases suggestive of reallocation of energetic resources during insecticide stress, as we also demonstrated in A. gambiae post dietary L-DOPA exposure. Given the pleotropic effects of dietary L-DOPA in Anopheles mosquitoes' biology, supported by its strong allelochemical activity and potential direct role as a neurotransmitter mediating host-gut microbiome interactions, it was out of the scope of this work to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for the reduction of dopamine levels in whole mosquitoes as L-DOPA concentrations in the sugar increased (Fig. 9a). However, in agreement with our findings, L-DOPA sequestration with the same dopamine trend has also been observed in the pea aphid (A. pisum) when feeding on an L-DOPA-rich plant, the broad bean (V. faba). This phenomenon enhances wound healing and confers UVA-radiation protection to the pea aphid. A potential explanation for this could involve a gut symbiont (bacteria, fungi, or a combination of both) that modulates a mechanism to maintain mosquito homeostasis. This mechanism might promote L-DOPA detoxification while avoiding its conversion into dopamine, thereby regulating critical downstream processes in insects, such as sclerotization, melanization, and the synthesis of neurotransmitters (e.g. tyramine and octopamine). Additionally, this scenario might align with the potential modulation of gut microbiome composition, favoring the establishment of organisms that create a cellular redox microenvironment, which enhances L-DOPA antioxidant properties. Further research is needed to validate L-DOPA sequestration in A. gambiae and to assess its impact on reproduction, exoskeleton stabilization, and protective role against environmental stressors such as temperature, relative humidity, and UVA damage.

BOX 2 Neurobiological theories of addiction

Neurobiological theories of addiction: Multiple theories of addiction have been proposed over the past decades to describe brain alterations accompanying the development of addiction. Among them, the most influential theories include:
The opponent-process theory — This theory posits that development of addiction would be associated with a transition from positive reinforcement (drug-seeking mediated by the acute positive effects of the drug) to negative reinforcement; the drug is consumed to alleviate the established negative emotional state. In this framework, addiction results from a cycle of spiraling dysregulation of brain reward circuits. With repeated drug use, sensitization and counteradaptation processes in the mesolimbic dopamine, the opioid and the brain and hormonal stress systems contribute to hedonic homeostatic dysregulation, referred to as allostasis, responsible for compulsive use, loss of control over drug-taking and spiraling distress that maintains persistent vulnerability to relapse.
The incentive-sensitization theory — In this theory, the enhancement of mesolimbic dopamine transmission induced by drugs of abuse results in the attribution of excessive 'incentive salience' to drug and drug-associated stimuli. Incentive salience is a process that render stimuli attractive by imbuing them with salience. Sensitization of incentive salience results in a transition from drug 'liking' to drug 'wanting' and is hypothesized to transform ordinary desires for drug experiences into drug craving. This process also contributes to relapse, even after protracted periods of abstinence.
The aberrant learning theory — this theory is based on the role of dopamine as a reward prediction error signal. Dopamine signals an error between the prediction of a reward and the actual reward received. It is argued that, when consumed, drugs mimic the dopamine reward prediction error by increasing dopamine transmission. Thus, according to this theory, repeated dopamine signal across extended drug use would continue to reinforce drug-related stimuli and actions to pathological levels, leading to an overvaluation of drug-seeking and a bias toward drug choice at the expense of alternative rewards.
The habit theory — This theory posits that addiction would emerge from the progressive development and dominance of drug habits over goal-directed control. In this framework, drug use becomes habitual through repeated consumption and association with environmental context and stimuli. With the transition to compulsive drug use and addiction, habitual drug-seeking becomes maladaptive and persists when the drug is no longer pleasurable or when it leads to negative consequences. The persistence of compulsive and maladaptive habit would be explained by drug-induced formation of abnormal habit, mediated by alterations in corticostriatal circuits, and impairment in executive functions (i.e. inhibitory control), mediated by functional disruptions in the prefrontal cortex.

### Improving L-dopa therapy: the development of enzyme inhibitors [^113mT2pa]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

The introduction of levodopa produced a monumental change in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Limitations in its bioavailability and tolerability led to the search for drugs that could improve its pharmacokinetics and safety profile. Dopa-decarboxylase inhibitors were the first such drugs that were developed, and their use in combination with L-dopa has become standard practice. Increasing knowledge on the metabolism of L-dopa allowed the identification of additional targets for intervention in an attempt to improve the symptomatic efficacy of L-dopa. Monoamineoxidase inhibitors, enhancing the central bioavailability of dopamine by blocking its metabolism, were the next step, and despite controversies regarding their efficacy, they have remained as valuable adjuncts to l-dopa in the treatment of PD. More recently, the introduction of potent, selective catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors have found their place in the therapeutic armamentarium of PD and are prescribed in combination with l-dopa to prolong the duration of its action.

### Impaired β-arrestin recruitment and reduced desensitization by non-catechol agonists of the D1 dopamine receptor [^115RDvtm]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dopamine is a fundamental catecholamine neurotransmitter, acting via five G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to modulate diverse functions. In the brain, the D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) is highly expressed in the striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC) where it plays a central role in synaptic plasticity, basal ganglia-mediated motor control, motivation, top-down executive control, learning, and memory. Inadequate dopaminergic neurotransmission in corticostriatal pathways is the demonstrated, or hypothesized –, pathophysiologic underpinning of disabling neurologic and psychiatric illnesses including Parkinson's disease (PD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, and addiction. As such, selective agonism of D1Rs has long been pursued as a putative therapeutic strategy –.

Development of clinically effective, selective D1R agonists for central nervous system (CNS) disorders has been limited by the dependence on a characteristic dopamine-like, dihydroxyphenyl catechol structural element. Mutagenesis studies, as well as recent crystal structures of the related β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) bound to catecholamine agonists, have demonstrated tight hydrogen bond associations between the catechol hydroxyl group and serine residues on transmembrane domain 5 (TM5), supporting the notion that the catechol chemical structure makes essential interactions for driving selective D1R agonism. However, as a chemical moiety, catechols have poor CNS penetration, negligible oral bioavailability, and are rapidly metabolized, via oxidative and conjugation processes including methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation. These undesirable properties have prevented the therapeutic development of selective D1R agonists, despite significant effort for nearly 40 years.

### Dopamine in drug abuse and addiction: results from imaging studies and treatment implications [^113Ysm4n]. Molecular Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The involvement of dopamine in drug reinforcement is well recognized but its role in drug addiction is much less clear. Imaging studies have shown that the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse in humans are contingent upon large and fast increases in dopamine that mimic but exceed in the intensity and duration those induced by dopamine cell firing to environmental events. In addition, imaging studies have also documented a role of dopamine in motivation, which appears to be encoded both by fast as well as smooth DA increases. Since dopamine cells fire in response to salient stimuli, the supraphysiological activation by drugs is likely to be experienced as highly salient (driving attention, arousal conditioned learning and motivation) and may also reset the thresholds required for environmental events to activate dopamine cells. Indeed, imaging studies have shown that in drug-addicted subjects, dopamine function is markedly disrupted (decreases in dopamine release and in dopamine D2 receptors in striatum) and this is associated with reduced activity of the orbitofrontal cortex (neuroanatomical region involved with salience attribution and motivation and implicated in compulsive behaviors) and the cingulate gyrus (neuroanatomical region involved with inhibitory control and attention and implicated in impulsivity). However, when addicted subjects are exposed to drug-related stimuli, these hypoactive regions become hyperactive in proportion to the expressed desire for the drug. We postulate that decreased dopamine function in addicted subjects results in decreased sensitivity to nondrug-related stimuli (including natural reinforcers) and disrupts frontal inhibition, both of which contribute to compulsive drug intake and impaired inhibitory control. These findings suggest new strategies for pharmacological and behavioral treatments, which focus on enhancing DA function and restoring brain circuits disrupted by chronic drug use to help motivate the addicted subject in activities that provide alternative sources of reinforcement, counteract conditioned responses, enhance their ability to control their drive to take drugs and interfere with their compulsive administration.

### Management of impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease: controversies and future approaches [^1138P5hm]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease are a group of impulsive behaviors most often associated with dopaminergic treatment. Presently, there is a lack of high quality evidence available to guide their management. This manuscript reviews current management strategies, before concentrating on the concept of dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome and its implications for the management of impulse control disorders. Further, we focus on controversies, including the role of more recently available anti-parkinsonian drugs, and potential future approaches involving routes of drug delivery, nonpharmacological treatments (such as cognitive behavioral therapy and deep brain stimulation), and other as yet experimental strategies.

Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency behavioural and psychiatric manifestations — pharmacologic considerations: A broad spectrum of symptomatic medications, including antidepressants, stimulants, anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers, may be beneficial and healthcare providers should adhere to age- and dose-specific guidelines. There are no absolute contraindications for the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), or stimulants in THD, but caution is recommended due to effects on monoamine neurotransmitter homeostasis and potential for exacerbated adverse effects, and dopamine receptor blocking antipsychotic medications should be avoided due to their antidopaminergic effects.

### Rationale for dopamine agonist use as monotherapy in Parkinson's disease [^117YTPRN]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Dopamine agonists are increasingly being used in the initial treatment of patients with de-novo Parkinson's disease because they provide symptom relief and a low risk of the dyskinesia frequently associated with levodopa. Evidence is also mounting in preclinical models that dopamine agonists protect dopaminergic neurons from the toxic effects of oxidative stress and the by-products of dopamine and L-dopa metabolism. Ergot derivatives, such as pergolide, induce minor side-effects and provide significant and sustained improvements in motor function in patients with early Parkinson's disease. Dopamine agonists also appear to reduce the loss of functional dopamine transporters when used early in the disease course, and these factors combine to build a case for the use of dopamine agonists in early-stage Parkinson's disease.

### Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome: a comprehensive review [^1174eq2C]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Dopamine agonists are effective and widely used treatments for Parkinson disease (PD). However, patients on dopamine agonists may experience significant side effects which necessitate dose tapering or discontinuation. Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS) is a complication that affects up to 19% of PD patients who undergo a dopamine agonist taper. It was initially described in 2010 as a severe stereotypical cluster of psychiatric and physical symptoms occurring with dopamine agonist withdrawal. Identified risk factors for DAWS include impulse control behavior disorders (ICD) and higher dopamine agonist dosage. There are emerging data suggesting that the dopamine agonist withdrawal in the setting of history of deep brain stimulation may also be a risk factor. Currently there is no standard treatment for DAWS. Therefore early recognition of risk factors is crucial for prevention. It's important to closely monitor for withdrawal symptoms in high-risk patients undergoing a dopamine agonist taper.

### Impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease: decreased striatal dopamine transporter levels [^114zg6X8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

There are several reasons why DAT binding may be decreased. In PD+ICD subjects, there may be underlying differences in genetic expression of DAT or alternatively, an interaction between dopaminergic medications and DAT regulation. For instance, differences in the variable number tandem repeat at the 3′ end of the gene for DAT, DAT1, can affect basal transporter expression. However, in a small study, no differences in DAT1 polymorphisms were noted between PD+ICD (n = 41) and PD controls.

Alternatively, multiple substances of abuse, such as methamphetamine, cocaine and alcohol, can differentially affect the regulation of DAT. For instance, methamphetamine is associated with decreased DAT density as measured using PET imaging and DAT ligands. This decrease in DAT density has been shown in early abstinence (< 6 months) with some degree of recovery after prolonged abstinence (12–16 months). However, given that cognitive deficits persist following prolonged abstinence from methamphetamine, the partial recovery was not suggested to be functionally sufficient. Similarly, alcohol-dependent subjects in early abstinence during detoxification and withdrawal have lower DAT levels as measured using [123 I]FP-CIT SPECT, which normalises at 4 weeks of abstinence. In contrast, cocaine, which acts directly to inhibit DAT, increases DAT in early abstinence as measured using [99m Tc]TRODAT and [123 I]FP-CIT SPECTconsistent with findings in postmortem studies. This observation may also play a mechanistic role in the behavioural responses observed in PD+ICD subjects. For instance, in cocaine dependence, which acts through DAT inhibition with subsequent increases in dopamine levels, the degree of DAT occupancy is associated with the subjective experience of a 'high'.

### L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, is striatal dopamine depletion a requisite? [^114Bg8uC]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is currently the most effective drug available to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). A limitation is that chronic administration of L-DOPA almost invariably, but not universally, leads to the development of abnormal involuntary movements, dyskinesia. Research suggests that striatal dopamine depletion is an important aetiological factor leading to dyskinesia development. However, in studies where L-DOPA was administered to normal animals and human subjects not afflicted by PD, abnormal involuntary movements were sometimes elicited. These studies are reviewed here and their potential significance for the pathophysiology of dyskinesia is discussed. It is concluded that, if striatal dopamine depletion may not be a requisite for the development of dyskinesia, it probably acts as a permissive factor, at least with the doses commonly employed in the clinic.

### Evidence-based initiation of dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease [^1123EYjT]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The mainstay of Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy is levodopa. The crucial question is when should levodopa be initiated? Levodopa provides the most potent motor benefit for PD, but longer term use is marked by the development of motor complications such as fluctuations in response and involuntary motor movements. Dopamine agonists reduce the risk of development of motor complications in the 5-year term. However, side effects may change the risk-benefit of dopamine agonist first strategies. In the following, the evidence for levodopa and dopamine agonists as initial monotherapy for PD is examined.

### Rethinking Parkinson's disease: could dopamine reduction therapy have clinical utility? [^115b6183]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Alpha-synuclein

Binding of dopamine with alpha-synuclein occurs in specific ratios suggesting a teleologic basis for binding of dopamine with alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein oligomerization is stimulated by dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) and dopamine–quinone, with both dopamine and DOPAL doing so in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Oligomeric and protofibrillar forms are favored as both dopamine and DOPAL inhibit fibril formation. In the absence of dopamine, no oligomers are formed and low levels of dopamine bind dopamine and its metabolites as if to block toxic effects.

Alpha-synuclein can increase cytosolic dopamine. Overexposure to alpha-synuclein damages vesicles which then leak dopamine into the cytoplasm. Further, alpha-synuclein binds to human DAT leading to increased presynaptic dopamine uptake and presynaptic dopamine overload. Control of dopamine synthesis in Parkinson's disease is not clear. Alpha-synuclein is reported to inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase as well as increase its activity. And while alpha-synuclein exerts toxic effects, low levels of alpha-synuclein protect SH-SY5Y cells by binding dopamine and its metabolites. In chronic cultures of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), metyrosine is shown to reduce alpha-synuclein deposition while L-DOPA increases alpha-synuclein deposition. And metyrosine blocks alpha-synuclein-mediated apoptosis.

There do not appear to be simple explanations for the contradictory data regarding the effect of alpha-synuclein on tyrosine hydroxylase activity and balance between toxic and neuroprotective effects. Without obvious methodologic shortcomings in these studies, explanations include the possibility that not all the models are equally relevant to clinical Parkinson's disease as well as that unmeasured variables, essentially unknown factors, are not measured which would provide additional clarity. Resolving these issues is beyond the scope of this review.

VMAT2 and vesicles

In neurons from people with Parkinson's disease, dopamine uptake and storage of dopamine are impaired, which shifts dopamine from the vesicles to into the cytosol. In murine neurons, DOPAL triggers alpha-synuclein oligomerization, which decreases vesicle motility and the processes leading to release of dopamine into the synapse to complete neurotransmission. The oligomerization induced by DOPAL damages vesicles allows for proton efflux and dopamine leakage into the cytosol. This dopamine is metabolized to DOPAL which amplifies the cycle of dysfunction. Vesicular leakage is seen in the presence of wild type, A30P or A53T forms of alpha-synuclein. Reduced vesicular motility and uptake could be driven by the mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, given the vesicular need for ATP/GTP.

### Protracted abstinence in males with an opioid use disorder: partial recovery of nucleus accumbens function [^116oh4Ti]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Here, we used fMRI to assess striatal function during stable abstinence in OUD. Previously with positron emission tomography (PET), we had consistently reported reduced striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability in a variety of drug users compared to controls including individuals with heroin use disorder, alcohol dependency and cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders. A dopamine transporter (DAT) ligand PET study was used to measure pre-synaptic dopamine terminal function and reported reduced binding in MT OUD patients, which correlated with symptoms of anxiety and reduced striatal DAT binding, in protracted abstinence (6 months) OUD patients. Similar reductions in DAT binding have been reported in a variety of other drug addictions. Our instrumental fMRI task is a modified version of the Pessiglione task in which brain activity reflects, in part, dopamine function. Blunted reward gain (PVS) accumbens activation in MT patients (but not ABS patients) measured using fMRI, which we use as an indirect measure of striatal dopamine function, might therefore be accounted for by blunted dopamine release. This suggests MT maintains a state of decreased reward sensitivity in OUD patients whereas protracted abstinence might facilitate recovery of reward sensitivity and reduce depression. However, the directionality of the association cannot be discerned in our study for it is also possible that OUD patients who had less PVS disruption were those who were able to maintain abstinence. Thus, longitudinal studies of protracted abstinent patients are needed to establish whether reward sensitivity recovers, or to determine whether recovery of PVS function might serve as a potential biomarker of when OUD patients may be able to discontinue medication for OUD. For such studies and in general, a strategy to reduce the risk of overdoses in OUD patients who seek detoxification from methadone or buprenorphine is to consider treatment with the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (extended-release Naltrexone or Vivitrol).

### Molecular neurological correlates of endorphinergic / dopaminergic mechanisms in reward circuitry linked to endorphinergic deficiency syndrome (EDS) [^11714WLV]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

The consensus of the current literature strongly supports the concept that brain neurotransmitters, and second messengers involved in the net release of dopamine in the mesolimbic region, especially the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), is directly linked to motivation, anti-stress, incentive salience (wanting), and well-being. The role of dopamine in terms of alcohol withdrawal symptomology, cocaine craving behavior, dopamine -condensation products (TIQs), and more recently, the genetic aspects of drug-seeking and pro-dopamine regulation, provide compelling evidence of the relevant molecular neurological correlates of dopaminergic /endorphinergic mechanisms in reward circuitry due to genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic insults. In the face of an Americans opioid epidemic, the clinical consensus is to treat Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) with life-long opioid substitution therapy. However, the authors suggest a paradigm shift involving novel modalities like targeting the endorphinergic system linked to dopamine release at the NAc, in terms of the induction of required "dopamine homeostasis". Utilizing the known genetic - environmental interaction theorem P = G +E, the authors provide a clear rationale for the adoption of genetic risk testing coupled with endorphinergic/dopamine regulation to address dysfunction across the brain reward circuitry. The goal of altering resting-state, functional connectivity may require a gentle "neurotransmitter fix" vis enkephalinase inhibition to overcome or combat - self-induction of acute dopamine release via psychoactive substance misuse resulting in chronic dopamine down-regulation. As subsets of reward deficiency, we are poised to provide novel, genetically guided therapy for endorphinergic, opioidergic, and dopaminergic deficiencies and related syndromes, utilizing "Precision Addiction Management.

### The interplay of dopamine metabolism abnormalities and mitochondrial defects in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia [^1121JR8Y]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dopamine (DA) is a major monoamine neurotransmitter in the brain although a substantial part of the overall DA in the body is produced by mesenteric organs. It engages in higher functions of the brain including spatial memory, motivation, arousal, reward and pleasure, in addition to regulating motor neurons, lactation, sexual behavior, and nausea. Considering these vital functions of DA, it is not surprising that malfunctions of dopaminergic signaling have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various mental disorders such as addiction, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and schizophrenia.

The synthesis of DA happens in cytosol through the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). The former enzyme converts tyrosine to dihydroxyl-phenylalanine (DOPA), which is further converted to DA via AADC catalyzation having pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor. The catabolism of DA, however, involves mitochondrion and results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under physiological conditions, the rate of DA oxidation is slow, and the cellular antioxidant machinery can cope with the formation of highly reactive products from DA oxidation. In a state of elevated DA or increased DA oxidation, however, higher levels of DA is toxic to mitochondria of neurons and glia cells. On the other hand, mitochondrial defects may lead to DA elevation in the cytosol because of impaired capacity to degrade DA. This interaction between DA and mitochondrion has essential roles in the pathogenesis of PD and schizophrenia.

### Treatment of Parkinson's disease: what's in the non-dopaminergic pipeline? [^117KVfSn]. Neurotherapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Dopamine depletion resulting from degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons is the primary neurochemical basis of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). While dopaminergic replacement strategies are effective in ameliorating these symptoms early in the disease process, more advanced stages of PD are associated with the development of treatment-related motor complications and dopamine-resistant symptoms. Other neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems are expressed in the basal ganglia and contribute to the extrapyramidal refinement of motor function. Furthermore, neuropathological studies suggest that they are also affected by the neurodegenerative process. These non-dopaminergic systems provide potential targets for treatment of motor fluctuations, levodopa-induced dyskinesias, and difficulty with gait and balance. This review summarizes recent advances in the clinical development of novel pharmacological approaches for treatment of PD motor symptoms. Although the non-dopaminergic pipeline has been slow to yield new drugs, further development will likely result in improved treatments for PD symptoms that are induced by or resistant to dopamine replacement.

### Schizophrenia: overview and dopamine dysfunction [^1167bAok]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is a chronic, often disabling illness that affects approximately 24 million people worldwide. Unfortunately, while the majority of first-episode schizophrenia patients respond well to initial antipsychotic treatment, less than 1 in 5 will maintain recovery over 2 to 5 years, and most will experience at least 1 relapse. Dopamine dysfunction helps to explain the positive symptoms experienced by patients with schizophrenia, and targeting these pathways has made current antipsychotics effective treatments for this condition. However, these agents primarily manage the positive symptoms of the disorder, while negative and cognitive symptoms can persist. More treatments are needed that comprehensively address all presentations of the disorder.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — stimulant poisoning/overdose pertinent assessment findings state that history is as important as the physical examination. If the patient is on psychiatric medication, but has failed to be compliant, this fact alone puts the patient at higher risk for the adverse outcome of delirium with agitated behavior. If the patient is found naked, this may elevate the suspicion for stimulant use or abuse; these substances increase the risk for sudden death secondary to delirium with agitated behavior, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome or serotonin syndrome can present with similar signs and symptoms. If polypharmacy is suspected, hypertension and tachycardia are expected hemodynamic findings secondary to increased dopamine release, and stimulus reduction from benzodiazepines, anti-psychotics, and ketamine will improve patient's vital signs and behavior. Be prepared for the potential of cardiovascular collapse as well as respiratory arrest. If a vasopressor is needed, epinephrine or norepinephrine is recommended over dopamine.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^114BE6wU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — Substance use disorder definition and neurobiology states that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) describes an SUD as a problematic pattern of use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress; the DSM-5 uses 11 diagnostic criteria and characterizes severity as mild, moderate, and severe with the presence of two to three, four to five, and six or more symptoms, respectively. Addictive substances disrupt the functioning of brain circuits that mediate motivation, decision making, and memory involved in obtaining natural rewards, and when functioning normally the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, a key component of the brain's reward system, trains a person to seek contexts in which they have previously experienced rapid improvements in well-being. Addictive substances artificially activate mesolimbic dopamine pathways such that reward circuits are taught that drug use is always more rewarding than expected, and with sufficient repeated use these substances become over-valued compared to natural rewards and one can develop an SUD. Simultaneously, repeated substance use impairs the ability to exert inhibitory control; over time, substance-related cues become more salient, drug craving becomes more compelling, and the impulse to use substances increases even as negative consequences of use increase. Negative affect states associated with withdrawal and chronic use become increasingly common and may drive additional drug seeking for relief, and this cascade leads to impairment in substance-related decision making that leads to many of the DSM-5 symptoms of an SUD.

### Dopamine reuptake and inhibitory mechanisms in human dopamine transporter [^116wA5Pj]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The dopamine transporter has a crucial role in regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission by uptake of dopamine into neurons and contributes to the abuse potential of psychomotor stimulants 1–3. Despite decades of study, the structure, substrate binding, conformational transitions and drug-binding poses of human dopamine transporter remain unknown. Here we report structures of the human dopamine transporter in its apo state, and in complex with the substrate dopamine, the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drug methylphenidate, and the dopamine-uptake inhibitors GBR12909 and benztropine. The dopamine-bound structure in the occluded state precisely illustrates the binding position of dopamine and associated ions. The structures bound to drugs are captured in outward-facing or inward-facing states, illuminating distinct binding modes and conformational transitions during substrate transport. Unlike the outward-facing state, which is stabilized by cocaine, GBR12909 and benztropine stabilize the dopamine transporter in the inward-facing state, revealing previously unseen drug-binding poses and providing insights into how they counteract the effects of cocaine. This study establishes a framework for understanding the functioning of the human dopamine transporter and developing therapeutic interventions for dopamine transporter-related disorders and cocaine addiction.

### Novel pharmacological targets for the treatment of Parkinson's disease [^111C6Z8d]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2006). Medium credibility.

Dopamine deficiency, caused by the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, is the cause of the major clinical motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. These symptoms can be treated successfully with a range of drugs that include levodopa, inhibitors of the enzymatic breakdown of levodopa and dopamine agonists delivered by oral, subcutaneous, transcutaneous, intravenous or intra-duodenal routes. However, Parkinson's disease involves degeneration of non-dopaminergic neurons and the treatment of the resulting predominantly non-motor features remains a challenge. This review describes the important recent advances that underlie the development of novel dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic drugs for Parkinson's disease, and also for the motor complications that arise from the use of existing therapies.

### Glutathione depletion and overproduction both initiate degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons [^115WvMr7]. Acta Neuropathologica (2011). Low credibility.

While it has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that depletion of GSH leads to nitric oxide-mediated oxidative damage of mitochondrial complex I components, the mechanism of neuronal cell loss is less clear. Cultured cortical neurons which were depleted by GCLc or GCLm demonstrated features of apoptotic cell death, but in concordance with results obtained in postmortem tissue, we did not detect significant activation of caspases in nigral DA neurons and no fragmented nuclei by GSH depletion. Activation of astrocytes was moderate, while staining for activated microglia showed more robust increase, as seen in postmortem PD brains. However, microglia morphology remained ramified and no cells with spherical macrophage-like shape appeared, indicating that classical necrosis might not be a prominent feature of DA neuronal death after GSH depletion.

GSH depletion induced a progressive decline in motor control, allowing us to follow the degeneration of the nigro-striatal system by simple behavioural assessment. Thus, this animal model is well suited for testing drugs aimed at protecting DA neurons from degeneration in functional assays, with the option to be transferred to brains of non-human primates. As it is based on a patho-physiological principle detected in brains of sporadic PD patients, it may be a valuable alternative to toxin-based models of PD currently employed, since compounds tested successfully in MPTP and 6-OHDA models have met with very limited benefit in clinical trials.

### Consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency [^116CYFqp]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). High credibility.

Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD) — pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment are summarized as follows: Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyses the rate-limiting step in dopamine biosynthesis. Autosomal recessive THD leads to clinical phenotypes reflecting deficiency of dopamine, norepinephrine, or epinephrine in the central nervous system (CNS), presenting along a continuous spectrum from mild to severe. Diagnosis is suggested by low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homovanillic acid (HVA) and confirmed by identifying biallelic pathogenic variants in the TH gene. L-dopa/decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI) supplementation is often the first-line treatment, and most patients have a good therapeutic response. However, initiation of therapy can be challenging in patients with severe disease forms.

### The vital role of constitutive GPCR activity in the mesolimbic dopamine system [^114xidXi]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Such findings point towards an adaptive increase in MOR constitutive activity during opiate withdrawal. Potentially this is to partly compensate for the sudden lack of opiate-induced MOR stimulation that the system has grown accustomed to. Interference with constitutive MOR activity, in mesolimbic neural circuitry, may therefore especially have strong effects during states of opiate withdrawal. Indeed, withdrawal symptoms from morphine treatment, such as tremors, jumping and defecation, are precipitated more strongly by MOR inverse agonists than with an equipotent dose of MOR neutral antagonist 6β-naltrexol. This is most likely due to constitutive MOR activity rather than any off-target effect, since 6β-naltrexol attenuated the effects of an MOR inverse agonist on withdrawal symptoms. Chronic morphine intake, which would enhance constitutive MOR activity, also increases the conditioned place aversion induced by naloxone, but not that induced by MOR neutral antagonists. In view of these findings in animal models, MOR neutral antagonists may have the potential to provide fewer or less severe withdrawal symptoms than naloxone/naltrexone in humans. Relevant applications in this regard are treatment of opioid overdose and forms of drug addiction. However, it remains to be determined if neutral antagonists are indeed as efficacious as their inverse agonistic counterparts. There is tentative evidence that suggests that neutral antagonists are indeed capable of suppressing drug consumption, but additional studies are required.

### Impaired dopamine release in Parkinson's disease [^116UxL7a]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

As discussed, DA release defects are routinely observed before motor symptom onset. How much of a deficit is required to produce motor symptoms, and perhaps more importantly, what other factors are modulating striatal DA content levels to either prevent, or contribute to, symptom onset? Reduced DA release does not always directly correspond to reduced striatal DA content at a given time point, and extracellular levels can be modulated by other factors such as DA reuptake. The absolute DA content threshold required for symptom onset is probably modulated by network and compensatory mechanisms such as upregulation of postsynaptic DA receptor numbers, which has been reported in humans with early Parkinson's disease. Importantly, the studies exploring DA release defects in Parkinson's disease support that it is prolonged dysfunction that is the key to motor symptom onset. On a molecular level, this is probably due to the progression of several aspects of cellular dysfunction coinciding with loss of systemic compensation, however, further studies are still required to fully understand this.

Indeed, neuronal death may be a critical switch, tipping the system beyond the ability to compensate for a system-wide deficit of striatal DA content, leading to the onset of motor symptoms. The mechanism by which neurons die in Parkinson's disease remains unclear. Synaptic dysfunction, or rather a side effect of it, might contribute to cell death through toxic cytosolic DA or α-synuclein accumulation. On the other hand, this death may be caused by programmed cell death following prolonged cellular dysfunction. Whether or not neuronal death is the mechanism by which reduced DA release passes the threshold, ultimately it is the loss of DA content itself, rather than the death of neurons, which is required for the onset of motor symptoms.

### From neurobiology to treatment: progress against addiction [^111SsYZZ]. Nature Neuroscience (2002). Medium credibility.

Most advances in addiction treatment to date have addressed the physical dependence and withdrawal that accompany addiction to some drugs of abuse. In contrast, it has proven more difficult to develop medications that effectively treat drug craving and relapse, the core features of addictive disorders. Current efforts focus on developing medications that prevent a drug from getting to its protein target, that mimic drug action and thereby partially alleviate drug craving, or that affect the addiction process per se. The latter approach is the most speculative, but also the most promising in terms of translating basic knowledge of addiction into clinical progress.

### Sulfation of thyroid hormone and dopamine during human development: ontogeny of phenol sulfotransferases and arylsulfatase in liver, lung, and brain [^115MsEfk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Sulfation is an important mechanism for regulating the biological activity of numerous hormones and neurotransmitters in man. Here we have investigated the ontogeny of sulfotransferases (SULT) and sulfatase (ARS) involved in the metabolism of thyroid hormone and dopamine. SULT1A1 enzyme activity was lower in postnatal liver and lung than in fetal tissues. Hepatic SULT1A3 (dopamine) was expressed at high levels early in development, but decreased substantially in late fetal/early neonatal liver and was essentially absent from the adult liver. In lung, significant SULT1A3 activity was observed in the fetus, but neonatal levels were considerably lower. In brain, the highest activity was observed in the choroid plexus for SULT1A1, with low and widespread activity for both SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 in other brain regions. SULT activity with 3,3'-diiodothyronine (3,3'-T(2)) as substrate was measured in all tissues and correlated significantly with SULT1A1 activity (4-nitrophenol), suggesting that SULT1A1 is primarily responsible for the sulfation of this iodothyronine. The developmental expression of SULT1A3 and SULT1A1 in liver and brain was confirmed by immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry of developing liver showed substantial expression of these proteins in hemopoietic cells in fetal liver. We also detected low activity for the hydrolysis of 3,3'-T(2) sulfate by ARS, although there was less distinction between fetal and neonatal samples than with SULT activities. We have therefore shown that the developing fetus has substantial sulfation capacity. Sulfation may therefore play a major role in the homeostasis of hormones and other endogenous compounds as well as in detoxification in the fetus, particularly as other conjugating enzyme systems, such as the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, are not expressed at significant levels until the neonatal period.

### The interplay of dopamine metabolism abnormalities and mitochondrial defects in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia [^112ohs2j]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Dopamine: metabolism, dopaminergic pathways, behavioral, and physiological functions

After the synthesis, DA is incorporated into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) and stored in the vesicles in catecholaminergic neurons. Following an action potential to a dopaminergic neuron, DA in synaptic vesicles is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to either postsynaptic or presynaptic DA receptors (DRs) or both. All DRs are metabotropic and subdivided into two major groups: D1-like receptors including D1 and D5, and D2-like receptors of D2, D3, and D4. Activation of DRs initiates second messengers, which trigger or block the activation of specific cell signaling pathways in post-synaptic neurons.

After a synaptic transmission, DA is taken up into the cytosol by either high-affinity DA transporters (DAT) or low-affinity plasma membrane monoamine transporters. The DA in the cytosol is then repackaged into synaptic vesicles by VMAT2. DA in the synaptic cleft is taken up by the surrounding astrocytes where DA is degraded into its metabolites through reactions catalyzed by monoamine oxidases (MAOs) and catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (COMT).

The degradation of DA to its inactive metabolites is carried out by COMT, monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), or MAO-B. MAO breaks down DA to 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). DOPAL, in turn, is degraded to 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) catalyzed by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH). In the presence of ferrous (Fe²⁺), H₂O₂ produces free radicals and ROS through the Fenton reaction. COMT converts DA to 3-methoxytyramine, which is then reduced to homovanillic acid (HVA) by MAO (Fig. 1). It is worth noting that COMT is predominantly expressed in glial cells but at very low levels in neurons. MAO-A predominates in catecholaminergic neurons while MAO-B locates mainly in astrocytes.

Baclofen is a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-β receptor agonist with a muscle relaxant effect. It increases GABA activity and reduces the production of glutamate and dopamine. The GABA precursor γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) has gained popularity as a drug of abuse. For the first time, we report a case of a GHB-dependent patient, who ingested several days' doses of baclofen (80 mg) simultaneously with 0.3 L (215 g) of illicit GHB. Baclofen (40 mg/d) was prescribed to prevent relapse after a successful detoxification. The patient developed a rapid coma (E2M5V1 with oxygen support), bradypnea, and hypotonia. Physicians should be alert to the danger of this combination because of the hazards of coma and respiratory distress.

### The dopamine transporter antiports potassium to increase the uptake of dopamine [^1173fWAq]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Dopaminergic signaling is involved in higher-order brain functions such as movement, mood, motivation, and learning. The dopamine transporter (DAT) is responsible for the clearance of dopamine from the extracellular space and hence plays an important role in dopamine signaling intensityand in refilling stores of dopamine. DAT malfunction has been associated with parkinsonism and ADHD. In addition, DAT is the molecular target for pharmaceutical drugs such as methylphenidate, bupropion, and modafinil, and also the rewarding and addictive effects of psychostimulants are linked to their interaction with the transporter –. The compounds that target DAT are classified into inhibitors and substrates but the underlying differences in mechanisms of drug action are generally poorly understood, including the reverse transport mode induced by amphetamine. A prerequisite for investigating the mechanisms of action of the drugs is to understand the basic transport mechanism of the transporter.

### Glutamatergic mechanisms in addiction [^114A6gRW]. Molecular Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Traditionally, addiction research in neuroscience has focused on mechanisms involving dopamine and endogenous opioids. More recently, it has been realized that glutamate also plays a central role in processes underlying the development and maintenance of addiction. These processes include reinforcement, sensitization, habit learning and reinforcement learning, context conditioning, craving and relapse. In the past few years, some major advances have been made in the understanding of how glutamate acts and interacts with other transmitters (in particular, dopamine) in the context of processes underlying addiction. It appears that while many actions of glutamate derive their importance from a stimulatory interaction with the dopaminergic system, there are some glutamatergic mechanisms that contribute to addiction independent of dopaminergic systems. Among those, context-specific aspects of behavioral determinants (ie control over behavior by conditioned stimuli) appear to depend heavily on glutamatergic transmission. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms might open new avenues to the treatment of addiction, in particular regarding relapse prevention.

For example, cue‐exposure can elicit recruitment of the reward circuit, which has been associated with subjectively experienced craving (reflected by increased neuronal activity in the reward circuit). Moreover, reductions in executive functioning in combination with decreased pre‐frontal cortex activity is often found in patients with AUD. This can lead to loss of control over the reward circuit, and thereby over impulses and behavior. Together, loss of control over the reward circuit and diminished executive control often results in issues managing craving and consequently relapse.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has gained attention as a new treatment option for substance use disorders, including AUD, because it has the potential to interfere with the disturbed neurobiology of these conditions. With TMS, magnetic pulses are derived from an electromagnetic coil wherein an alternating current is running. When placed over the skull the magnetic pulse induces a current in the underlying neuronal tissue. When pulses are applied in multiple trains, it is referred to as repetitive TMS (rTMS). Depending upon whether the frequency is low (LF) or high (HF), stimulation is inhibitory or excitatory, respectively.

In substance use disorder studies, HF‐rTMS is often applied over the dorsolateral pre‐frontal cortex (DLPFC), as it is part of the executive function circuit. The hypothetical effect of stimulation of these superficial brain regions is, first, to increase pre‐frontal cortex activity and strengthen the hypofunctional pre‐frontal cortex, thereby increasing executive control. Secondly, by indirect divergence into deeper structures of the brain, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) due to direct connectivity between the DLPFC and the mid‐brain, rTMS influences subcortical neuronal activity. The changes in activity in these areas may potentially decrease craving and decrease the chances for relapse. rTMS has been shown to increase emotion regulation in AUD and to influence functional connectivity in AUD. Thus, neuromodulation of the DLPFC could primarily strengthen the functioning of the PFC by increasing executive control. Secondarily, it could modulate activity and dopamine release in subcortical areas such as the NAcc and VTA which could decrease craving. Together, this may ultimately lead to decreased relapse rates, when applied in clinical trials in AUD.

### Inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 suppresses cocaine seeking by generating THP, a cocaine use-dependent inhibitor of dopamine synthesis [^116k6mWp]. Nature Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

There is no effective treatment for cocaine addiction despite extensive knowledge of the neurobiology of drug addiction. Here we show that a selective aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH-2) inhibitor, ALDH2i, suppresses cocaine self-administration in rats and prevents cocaine- or cue-induced reinstatement in a rat model of cocaine relapse-like behavior. We also identify a molecular mechanism by which ALDH-2 inhibition reduces cocaine-seeking behavior: increases in tetrahydropapaveroline (THP) formation due to inhibition of ALDH-2 decrease cocaine-stimulated dopamine production and release in vitro and in vivo. Cocaine increases extracellular dopamine concentration, which activates dopamine D2 autoreceptors to stimulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) in primary ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. PKA and PKC phosphorylate and activate tyrosine hydroxylase, further increasing dopamine synthesis in a positive-feedback loop. Monoamine oxidase converts dopamine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), a substrate for ALDH-2. Inhibition of ALDH-2 enables DOPAL to condense with dopamine to form THP in VTA neurons. THP selectively inhibits phosphorylated (activated) tyrosine hydroxylase to reduce dopamine production via negative-feedback signaling. Reducing cocaine- and craving-associated increases in dopamine release seems to account for the effectiveness of ALDH2i in suppressing cocaine-seeking behavior. Selective inhibition of ALDH-2 may have therapeutic potential for treating human cocaine addiction and preventing relapse.

Brain Imaging Study of the Effects of Modafinil in Cocaine Addiction ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Identification Study Status Sponsor/Collaborators Oversight Study Description -Context: Study objectives Primary: impact of modafinil versus placebo on DAT density modifications in the striatal and extra-striatal regions in cocaine dependent subjects hospitalised from D3 to D21. Primary Hypothesis: More rapid normalisation of DAT concentrations measured by PET using modafinil versus placebo from D3 to D21 during cocaine detoxification. In vivo studies in cocaine dependent patients are rare. Currently no pharmacotherapy is available to treat this pathology. Current studies indicate that pharmacological agents such as modafinil may be able to reverse the neuroadaptations induced by cocaine dependence. However, no functional neuroimaging study has analysed the impact of medications on DAT density in cocaine dependent patients.

However, in primates, in vivo PET has shown modafinil affinity for DAT. Primary Hypothesis: More rapid normalisation of DAT concentrations measured by PET using modafinil versus placebo from D3 to D21 during therapeutic cocaine withdrawal. Study objectives Primary: impact of modafinil versus placebo on DAT density modifications in the striatal and extra-striatal regions in cocaine dependent subjects hospitalised from D3 to D21. Patients will be recruited over 24 months. The total study length will be 36 months. Primary judgment criteria: Variation of the linking potentials between the TEP measurement on D3 and D21 within the various anatomical region of interest between the 2 groups. Expected Results: Decreased DAT occupation rates in the modafinil group versus placebo from D3 to D21 of withdrawal.

Outcome Measures
- Decreased DAT occupation rates in the modafinil group versus placebo from day 3 to day of cocaine detoxification.
- Evaluation of the clinical efficacy of modafinil during therapeutic cocaine withdrawal.
- Correlation between craving measurements, depressive symptom measurements and cognitive deficit measurements observed and modifications of DAT density.
