## Question

Adverse effect of Azathioprine is Select one: a. Blurred vision b. Headache c. Convulsions d. Myelosuppression

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of the following — blurred vision, headache, convulsions, or myelosuppression — is a recognized adverse effect of azathioprine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled adverse effects of azathioprine. Then, I should verify whether blurred vision, headache, or convulsions are listed in authoritative sources. Next, I will confirm whether myelosuppression is a documented and clinically significant toxicity. Finally, I will consider mechanistic plausibility and guideline context to ensure the answer is both accurate and clinically grounded.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and core toxicity profile. Azathioprine is a thiopurine immunosuppressant that is nonenzymatically converted to 6‑mercaptopurine; its most consistent, dose‑related adverse effect is myelosuppression, which is why labels emphasize complete blood count monitoring and pharmacogenetic testing for TPMT/NUDT15 when severe cytopenias occur [^115Jt4BW] [^115mQsqZ] [^116PX9mg].

> Wait, let me verify the options against the FDA labeling. Blurred vision, headache, and convulsions are not listed among the common or serious adverse effects in the azathioprine prescribing information, whereas severe leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pancytopenia, and bone marrow suppression are explicitly described, with warnings to monitor CBCs and adjust or stop therapy for excessive myelosuppression [^115mQsqZ] [^116xUKQY] [^116qjeqD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double‑check mechanistic plausibility. Azathioprine's active thioguanine nucleotides inhibit purine synthesis and DNA replication in rapidly dividing hematopoietic cells, which directly explains dose‑related neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. This aligns with the well‑established myelosuppressive liability of thiopurines and the need for TPMT/NUDT15‑guided dosing in poor metabolizers [^116PX9mg] [^113XjrD6].

> I need to ensure clinical significance is reflected in guidelines and real‑world data. The British Society of Gastroenterology and contemporary cohorts emphasize that thiopurine‑induced myelosuppression is a key toxicity necessitating pre‑treatment TPMT assessment and ongoing CBC monitoring, with severe events occurring even in patients with normal TPMT, underscoring that myelosuppression is a defining risk of azathioprine therapy [^113zLV41] [^112NMpJK].

> But wait, what if the question is testing whether ocular or neurologic adverse effects are recognized with azathioprine? I should confirm again: the FDA labeling highlights hematologic suppression and infection risks, including PML, but does not list blurred vision, headache, or convulsions as characteristic adverse effects, whereas myelosuppression is repeatedly emphasized as dose‑related and potentially life‑threatening, especially in the setting of TPMT/NUDT15 deficiency or drug interactions [^116xUKQY] [^116qjeqD].

> Final answer: Myelosuppression is the correct choice because it is the most consistent, dose‑related, and clinically significant adverse effect of azathioprine, with explicit labeling warnings and guideline‑endorsed monitoring strategies, whereas blurred vision, headache, and convulsions are not recognized adverse effects of azathioprine in authoritative sources [^115mQsqZ] [^115Jt4BW] [^113zLV41].

---

The most significant adverse effect of azathioprine is **myelosuppression** [^115mQsqZ], characterized by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [^116xUKQY]. This risk is dose-related and can be severe, especially in patients with TPMT or NUDT15 deficiencies [^112ZMFKM] [^116PX9mg]; therefore, regular CBC monitoring is essential [^115Jt4BW]. Other common effects include gastrointestinal upset, hepatotoxicity, and increased infection risk [^111oNXJ2] [^116qjeqD], but myelosuppression is the most clinically important and potentially life-threatening toxicity [^115jorQh].

---

## Hematologic toxicity (myelosuppression)

Myelosuppression is the **most significant adverse effect** of azathioprine, characterized by dose-related suppression of bone marrow function [^115jorQh] [^115mQsqZ], leading to leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [^116xUKQY]. The risk is higher in patients with genetic polymorphisms affecting thiopurine metabolism, particularly TPMT and NUDT15 deficiencies [^112ZMFKM] [^116PX9mg].

- **Leukopenia**: Very common, occurring in approximately 3% of patients, and can be severe, necessitating dose reduction or discontinuation [^111oNXJ2] [^115mQsqZ].

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Common, occurring in about 1% of patients, and may require dose adjustment or cessation of therapy [^115mQsqZ] [^116xUKQY].

- **Anemia**: Less common but clinically significant, particularly in patients with pre-existing hematologic conditions [^115mQsqZ] [^116xUKQY].

Regular monitoring of complete blood counts (CBC) is essential during azathioprine therapy [^115Jt4BW], with **weekly monitoring during the first month**, bi-weekly during the second and third months, and monthly thereafter [^115mQsqZ]. Genetic testing for TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms is recommended before initiating therapy to identify patients at increased risk of myelosuppression [^113zLV41] [^112ZMFKM].

---

## Gastrointestinal toxicity

Gastrointestinal side effects are common with azathioprine therapy, including:

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Very common, occurring in approximately 10–20% of patients, and can often be managed with dose adjustments or antiemetic therapy [^111oNXJ2] [^112S4xjk].

- **Diarrhea**: Common, occurring in about 5–10% of patients, and may require dose modification or temporary discontinuation [^111oNXJ2] [^112kHZ7W].

- **Pancreatitis**: Rare but potentially severe, occurring in less than 1% of patients, and necessitates immediate discontinuation of azathioprine [^112kHZ7W] [^112S4xjk].

---

## Hepatotoxicity

Azathioprine-associated hepatotoxicity includes **elevated liver enzymes** (ALT, AST, ALP) in approximately 10–15% of patients, typically mild and reversible with dose adjustment or discontinuation [^111oNXJ2]. Rare but serious cholestatic hepatitis and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) have also been reported, particularly with prolonged therapy or high doses [^112kHZ7W]. Regular liver function tests are recommended during therapy, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver disease or concomitant hepatotoxic medications [^115ViHp5].

---

## Immunosuppression and infection risk

Azathioprine-induced immunosuppression **increases susceptibility to infections**, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic pathogens [^116xUKQY]. Serious infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported, particularly in immunocompromised patients or those receiving concomitant immunosuppressive therapy [^116xUKQY]. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of infection, and prophylactic measures may be considered in high-risk individuals [^116oHVmb].

---

## Dermatologic reactions

Dermatologic reactions are relatively common with azathioprine therapy, including **skin rash** in approximately 5–10% of patients, typically mild and self-limited, resolving with dose adjustment or discontinuation [^114PBhsy] [^112kHZ7W]. Photosensitivity is less common but may necessitate sun protection and dose modification [^notfound]. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), are rare but potentially life-threatening and require immediate discontinuation of azathioprine [^notfound].

---

## Malignancy risk

Long-term azathioprine therapy is associated with an **increased risk of malignancies**, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, skin cancers (including melanoma), and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. The risk is dose- and duration-dependent, and regular dermatologic surveillance is recommended for patients on prolonged therapy [^116qjeqD] [^112S4xjk].

## Summary of adverse effects

| **Adverse effect** | **Frequency** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Myelosuppression (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia) | Very common | High |
| Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) | Common | Moderate |
| Hepatotoxicity (elevated liver enzymes, cholestasis) | Common | Moderate |
| Immunosuppression and infection risk | Common | High |
| Dermatologic reactions (rash, photosensitivity) | Common | Moderate |
| Malignancy risk (lymphoma, skin cancer) | Rare | High |

---

The most significant adverse effect of azathioprine is **myelosuppression**, characterized by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [^115mQsqZ]. This risk is dose-related and can be severe, particularly in patients with TPMT or NUDT15 deficiencies [^112ZMFKM] [^116PX9mg]. Regular monitoring of complete blood counts and genetic testing for TPMT and NUDT15 polymorphisms are essential to mitigate this risk [^115Jt4BW].

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 4. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic agents [^112bXvJA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate — hematologic toxicity risk factors and test dosing in psoriasis are outlined, stating that risk factors include renal insufficiency, advanced age, lack of folate supplementation, methotrexate dosing errors, drug interactions, hypoalbuminemia, and greater than moderate alcohol intake. The test dose is typically 2.5 or 5 mg with a complete blood cell (CBC) count evaluated 5 to 6 days later, and although the use of a test dose does not guarantee that patients will not experience myelosuppression, it is mandatory in patients with a decreased glomerular filtration rate or other significant risk factors for hematologic toxicity. Pancytopenia can rarely occur with the use of low-dose weekly methotrexate, even after single doses, and as pancytopenia may occur as long as 4 to 6 weeks after increasing the methotrexate dosage, more frequent monitoring is suggested with dosage increases. The literature suggests that significant myelosuppression is rare in appropriately monitored patients with psoriasis who have no risk factors for hematologic toxicity.

### Efficacy and safety of oral decitabine / cedazuridine in the chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia subpopulations from phase 2 and 3 studies [^1168Rcdj]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety

All patients had ≥ 1 adverse event and most (94% [n = 31]) had ≥ 1 adverse event of grade ≥ 3 severity (Table 3). The most common adverse events (overall and grade ≥ 3) were related to myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia). Most patients (82% [n = 27]) had ≥ 1 treatment‐emergent adverse event deemed treatment related and most (70% [n = 23]) had ≥ 1 treatment‐related event of grade ≥ 3 severity (Table S1). All of the five most common treatment‐related adverse events, and all such events observed in > 24% of patients, were related to myelosuppression: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, fatigue and leucopenia. The next four most common treatment‐related adverse events (none of grade > 2) were gastrointestinal: nausea, constipation, decreased appetite and diarrhoea. All these events, plus febrile neutropenia, were noted in > 10% of patients. Other adverse events deemed treatment related were observed in < 10% of the study population. All of the five most common grade ≥ 3 treatment‐related adverse events, and all such events observed in ≥ 10% of the study population, were related to myelosuppression and were consistent with the overall populations studied in the phase 2 and 3 studies.

TABLE 3
Most common treatment‐emergent adverse events. a

Two patients permanently discontinued oral DEC‐C and one discontinued IV decitabine due to an adverse event. The conditions leading the two patients to discontinue oral DEC‐C were failure to thrive due to social circumstances and sepsis respectively. Intravenous decitabine was discontinued due to pulmonary haemorrhage. At least one serious adverse event was reported in more than half of patients (64% [n = 21]); treatment‐related serious adverse events were noted in 15% of patients (n = 5; Table S2). Two deaths occurred during the study: one patient with MD‐CMML died due to sepsis and one with MP‐CMML died due to pulmonary haemorrhage.

### Model of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression with parameter consistency across drugs [^114Rg7Dh]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop a semimechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model describing chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression through drug-specific parameters and system-related parameters, which are common to all drugs.

Patients and Methods

Patient leukocyte and neutrophil data after administration of docetaxel, paclitaxel, and etoposide were used to develop the model, which was also applied to myelosuppression data from 2'-deoxy-2'-methylidenecytidine (DMDC), irinotecan (CPT-11), and vinflunine administrations. The model consisted of a proliferating compartment that was sensitive to drugs, three transit compartments that represented maturation, and a compartment of circulating blood cells. Three system-related parameters were estimated: baseline, mean transit time, and a feedback parameter. Drug concentration-time profiles affected the proliferation of sensitive cells by either an inhibitory linear model or an inhibitory E(max) model. To evaluate the model, system-related parameters were fixed to the same values for all drugs, which were based on the results from the estimations, and only drug-specific parameters were estimated. All modeling was performed using NONMEM software.

Results

For all investigated drugs, the model successfully described myelosuppression. Consecutive courses and different schedules of administration were also well characterized. Similar system-related parameter estimates were obtained for the different drugs and also for leukocytes compared with neutrophils. In addition, when system-related parameters were fixed, the model well characterized chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression for the different drugs.

Conclusion

This model predicted myelosuppression after administration of one of several different chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, with fixed system-related parameters to proposed values, and only drug-related parameters estimated, myelosuppression can be predicted. We propose that this model can be a useful tool in the development of anticancer drugs and therapies.

Nonmyeloid hematologic malignancies receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy — special considerations: In patients with myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, clinicians should observe their hematologic response to cancer treatment before considering an ESA. Particular caution should be exercised in the use of ESAs concomitant with treatment strategies and diseases where risk of thromboembolic complications is increased, and in all cases, blood transfusion is a treatment option that should be considered (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).

### Lenalidomide-induced myelosuppression is associated with renal dysfunction: adverse events evaluation of treatment-naïve patients undergoing front-line lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy [^112T8MKd]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Data on 72 patients receiving lenalidomide/dexamethasone for multiple myeloma (MM) was used to determine the factors that are associated with lenalidomide-induced myelosuppression. Eight of 14 patients with grade ≥ 3 myelosuppression had baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 0.67 ml/s. Kaplan-Meier analysis by log-rank test demonstrated a significant association (P < 0.0001) between renal insufficiency and time to myelosuppression (hazard ratio = 8.4; 95% confidence interval 2.9–24.7, P = 0.0001). Therefore, CrCl is inversely associated with significant myelosuppression. Caution should be exercised when lenalidomide therapy is commenced and CrCl should be incorporated as a determinant of the initial dosing of lenalidomide in MM patients.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Hodgkin lymphoma, version 2.2022 [^111GQnnu]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Myelosuppression and infection prevention — myelosuppression is the most common side effect of chemotherapy and is associated with increased risk of infections; it is uncommon for myelosuppression to continue for very long beyond completion of the primary treatment program. Patients who undergo high-dose therapy (HDT)/autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) may be at continued risk for infection, and pneumococcal, meningococcal, and H-flu revaccinations are recommended every 5 years for patients treated with splenic RT or splenectomy.

### Azathioprine (Azasan) [^1166LgM3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

TPMT and NUDT15 Testing: Consider genotyping or phenotyping patients for TPMT deficiency and genotyping for NUDT15 deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression. TPMT and NUDT15 testing cannot substitute for complete blood count (CBC) monitoring in patients receiving AZASAN. Accurate phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) results are not possible in patients who have received recent blood transfusions (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS: Cytopenias, ADVERSE REACTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections).

Drug Interactions:

Use with Xanthine Oxidase (XO) Inhibitors: One of the pathways for inactivation of azathioprine is inhibited by XO inhibitors (allopurinol or febuxostat). Patients receiving AZASAN and allopurinol concomitantly should have a dose reduction of AZASAN, to approximately 1/3 to 1/4 the usual dose. Concomitant use of AZASAN with febuxostat is not recommended. Inhibition of XO may cause increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or its metabolite, 6-MP, leading to toxicity. It is recommended that a further dose reduction or alternative therapies be considered for patients with low or absent TPMT activity receiving AZASAN and xanthine oxidase inhibitors because both TPMT and XO inactivation pathways are affected (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections).

### Incidence and management of myelosuppression in patients with chronic-and accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukemia treated with omacetaxine mepesuccinate [^117Mxy5q]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2016). Low credibility.

Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (Synribo) is an inhibitor of protein synthesis indicated for the treatment of patients with chronic- or accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Myelosuppression is the most common and clinically significant toxicity experienced by patients treated with omacetaxine. Here, we further examine the patterns of hematologic toxicity observed in clinical trials and describe the approach to management as well as resolution of events. Omacetaxine-related myelosuppression typically occurs more frequently during induction cycles. In general, the myelosuppression observed with omacetaxine treatment is manageable and reversible, and long-term administration is feasible. Careful monitoring, dose delays and reduction in administration days, and appropriate supportive care are critical for successful management of hematologic toxicity. Concerns regarding myelosuppression, observed with many cancer treatments, should not prevent eligible patients from receiving omacetaxine, particularly CML patients with unsatisfactory responses to multiple lines of prior treatment.

### Cyclophosphamide [^1126tPvR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression, Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Failure and Infections

Cyclophosphamide can cause myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), bone marrow failure, and severe immunosuppression which may lead to serious and sometimes fatal infections, including sepsis and septic shock. Latent infections can be reactivated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Antimicrobial prophylaxis may be indicated in certain cases of neutropenia at the discretion of the managing physician. In case of neutropenic fever, antibiotic therapy is indicated. Antimycotics and/or antivirals may also be indicated.

Monitoring of complete blood counts is essential during cyclophosphamide treatment so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed. Cyclophosphamide should not be administered to patients with neutrophils ≤ 1,500/mm³and platelets < 50,000/mm³. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop a serious infection. G-CSF may be administered to reduce the risks of neutropenia complications associated with cyclophosphamide use. Primary and secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in all patients considered to be at increased risk for neutropenia complications. The nadirs of the reduction in leukocyte count and thrombocyte count are usually reached in weeks 1 and 2 of treatment. Peripheral blood cell counts are expected to normalize after approximately 20 days. Bone marrow failure has been reported. Severe myelosuppression may be expected particularly in patients pretreated with and/or receiving concomitant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

### Mercaptopurine [^114RnBM2]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of mercaptopurine PO (also known as Purinethol, Purixan):
- Immunosuppression, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, skin cancer, sarcomas, cervical cancer: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mercaptopurine has been associated with an increased risk for these complications.
- **Macrophage activation syndrome**: use caution in patients with autoimmune conditions, particularly IBD. Monitor for and treat infections such as EBV and CMV that might trigger macrophage activation syndrome.
- **Myelosuppression**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mercaptopurine has been associated with an increased risk of myelosuppression, including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Monitor CBC and adjust mercaptopurine dose accordingly. Reduce mercaptopurine dose when coadministered with allopurinol. Consider testing for TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression. Reduce dose by 10% in patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency.

### Analysis of the risk factors for myelosuppression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer [^116gmkzq]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Myelosuppression induced by concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be a significant problem in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its risk factors remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate clinical data obtained before chemoradiotherapy (CRT) to identify the risk factors for myelosuppression in patients with advanced NSCLC.

Methods

Between January 2007 and January 2012, 141 patients with advanced NSCLC were treated with curative intent according to the CRT protocol (50–70 Gy at 2 Gy/day with paclitaxel 135–175 mg/m² and carboplatin 100 mg/m² on days 1, 22, and 43). The endpoint of this survey was the occurrence of grade 3 or higher myelosuppression (neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia). Risk factors significantly related to myelosuppression were extracted using logistic regression analysis.

Results

Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia occurred in 19.9, 16.3, 14.9, and 0% of the patients, respectively. According to the multivariate analysis, the risk factors included age, albumin, and body surface area (BSA) for neutropenia; performance status and bone metastases for leukopenia; and age, gender, and serum creatinine concentration for thrombocytopenia (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

It was found that age, BSA, creatinine level, and female gender were the most important factors for CRT-induced myelosuppression in advanced NSCLC. By identifying these risk factors, medical staff can improve application of appropriate medical care to reduce the myelosuppression in advanced NSCLC patients treated by CRT.

### Topotecan dosing guidelines in ovarian cancer: reduction and management of hematologic toxicity [^116JS1Wd]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

Topotecan dosing considerations and alternative dosing schedules to reduce and manage myelosuppression during the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer were reviewed. The myelosuppression patterns from phase I, II, and III clinical trials were analyzed to evaluate the degree of hematologic toxicity and to determine risk factors predictive of myelosuppression. Additionally, recent publications of alternative topotecan doses and schedules were examined. Extent of prior therapy, prior platinum therapy (particularly carboplatin), advanced age, impaired renal function, and prior radiation therapy were identified as potential risk factors for greater hematologic toxicity after topotecan therapy. Reducing the starting topotecan dose to 1.0 or 1.25 mg/m²/day is recommended to reduce the incidence of severe myelosuppression in high-risk individuals receiving topotecan for 5 consecutive days. Hematopoietic growth factors, transfusion therapy, and schedule adjustments may also help manage myelosuppression. Alternative schedules of 3-day or weekly dosing appear to have less myelotoxicity and are currently under evaluation. The clinical aspects of topotecan-related myelosuppression and results from clinical trials indicate that the dose, and possibly the dosing schedule, of topotecan can be modified to reduce hematologic toxicity and improve tolerance without compromising efficacy. Prospective individualization of topotecan dosing may prevent or minimize dose-limiting myelosuppression and allow patients to achieve the maximum topotecan benefit by improving their ability to complete therapy with fewer treatment delays. Ongoing clinical trials evaluating alternative dosing schedules with superior hematologic tolerability may facilitate the inclusion of topotecan in combination regimens for patients with ovarian cancer. Proposed topotecan dosing guidelines to reduce and manage myelosuppression are outlined.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112M1cbU]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia — thiopurine dosing by TPMT phenotype provides the following guidance. For normal metabolizer (eg, *1/*1), for 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG), the starting dose should be based on treatment protocol and allow 2 weeks to achieve steady state prior to making any dose adjustments. For intermediate metabolizer (eg, *1/*2, *1/*3A, *1/*3B, *1/*3C, or *1/*4), 6-MP: Start at 30%–80% of full dose, adjust dose based on degree of myelosuppression as dictated by protocol, and allow 2–4 weeks to achieve steady state prior to making any dose adjustments; 6-TG: Start at 50%–80% of full dose, adjust dose based on degree of myelosuppression as dictated by protocol, and allow 2–4 weeks to achieve steady state prior to making any dose adjustments. For poor metabolizer (eg, *2/*3A, *3A/*3C), 6-MP: Start at ~10% of full dose, adjust dose based on degree of myelosuppression as dictated by protocol, and allow 4–6 weeks to achieve steady state prior to making any dose adjustments; 6-TG: Start at ~10% of full dose as dictated by protocol and allow 4–6 weeks to achieve steady state prior to making any dose adjustments. For patients who are TPMT intermediate metabolizers who are already receiving reduced starting doses of thiopurines (< 75 mg/m²/day of 6-MP or < 40 mg/m²/day of 6-TG) further dose reduction may not be needed. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Incidence and management of myelosuppression in patients with chronic-and accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukemia treated with omacetaxine mepesuccinate [^117VnFzW]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2016). Low credibility.

Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (Synribo ®) is an inhibitor of protein synthesis indicated for the treatment of patients with chronic- or accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Myelosuppression is the most common and clinically significant toxicity experienced by patients treated with omacetaxine. Here, we further examine the patterns of hematologic toxicity observed in clinical trials and describe the approach to management as well as resolution of events. Omacetaxine-related myelosuppression typically occurs more frequently during induction cycles. In general, the myelosuppression observed with omacetaxine treatment is manageable and reversible, and long-term administration is feasible. Careful monitoring, dose delays and reduction in administration days, and appropriate supportive care are critical for successful management of hematologic toxicity. Concerns regarding myelosuppression, observed with many cancer treatments, should not prevent eligible patients from receiving omacetaxine, particularly CML patients with unsatisfactory responses to multiple lines of prior treatment.

### Busulfan (Myleran) [^116U54ip]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Boxed warning regarding the use of busulfan PO (also known as Myleran, Busulfex) and myelosuppression: maintain a high level of suspicion, as busulfan causes profound myelosuppression with pancytopenia as the desired therapeutic effect but can also lead to severe bone marrow hypoplasia. Use with extreme caution in patients whose bone marrow reserve may have been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or whose marrow function is recovering from previous cytotoxic therapy. Reduce or discontinue the dosage immediately at the first sign of abnormal bone marrow depression.

### Incidence of thiopurine-induced severe myelosuppression in a nationwide cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111HrJPN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is paucity of data on the incidence of severe thiopurine (TP)-induced myelosuppression (TIM) among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Methods

Using the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, we identified patients with IBD with normal pretreatment TP S-methyltransferase levels who received TPs for 6 months and developed severe TIM.

Results

Among 73,392 patients with IBD, 14,760 had received TPs, and 2,823 had a normal TP S-methyltransferase level. The incidence rate of severe TIM was 1.25 per 1,000 patient-years.

Discussion

The incidence of severe TIM was very low, calling into question the necessity of frequent long-term complete blood count monitoring among patients with IBD on TPs.

### Thioguanine (Tabloid) [^114RGnUo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The most consistent, dose-related toxicity is bone marrow suppression. This may be manifested by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination of these. Any one of these findings may also reflect progression of the underlying disease. Since thioguanine may have a delayed effect, it is important to withdraw the medication temporarily at the first sign of an abnormally large fall in any of the formed elements of the blood.

There are individuals with an inherited deficiency of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) who may be unusually sensitive to the myelosuppressive effects of thioguanine and prone to developing rapid bone marrow suppression following the initiation of treatment. Substantial dosage reductions may be required to avoid the development of life-threatening bone marrow suppression in these patients.

Prescribers should be aware that some laboratories offer testing for TPMT deficiency. Since bone marrow suppression may be associated with factors other than TPMT deficiency, TPMT testing may not identify all patients at risk for severe toxicity. Therefore, close monitoring of clinical and hematologic parameters is important. Bone marrow suppression could be exacerbated by coadministration with drugs that inhibit TPMT, such as olsalazine,
mesalazine, or sulphasalazine.

It is recommended that evaluation of the hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit, total white blood cell count and differential count, and quantitative platelet count be obtained frequently while the patient is on thioguanine therapy. In cases where the cause of fluctuations in the formed elements in the peripheral blood is obscure, bone marrow examination may be useful for the evaluation of marrow status. The decision to increase, decrease, continue, or discontinue a given dosage of thioguanine must be based not only on the absolute hematologic values, but also upon the rapidity with which changes are occurring. In many instances, particularly during the induction phase of acute leukemia, complete blood counts will need to be done more frequently in order to evaluate the effect of the therapy. The dosage of thioguanine may need to be reduced when this agent is combined with other drugs whose primary toxicity is myelosuppression.

### TPMT in the treatment of Crohn's disease with azathioprine [^116bqKY6]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Azathioprine induced profound myelosuppression linked to TPMT deficiency has now been documented in many patient groups, including those with Crohn's disease. At the start of azathioprine or mercaptopurine therapy, measurement of TPMT activity has a role in identifying the 1 in 300 patients who are at risk of severe myelosuppression when treated with standard thiopurine dosages. During the initial months of azathioprine therapy a knowledge of TPMT status warns of early bone marrow toxicity. In patients established on azathioprine these is no clear evidence to suggest that TPMT is predictive of clinical response or drug toxicity, indicating a role for TPMT in the prediction of early events rather than long term control. In patients with Crohn's disease on long term azathioprine therapy, it is clear that myelosuppression, particularly leucopenia, is caused by other factors in addition to variable TPMT activity and therefore monitoring of blood cell counts throughout treatment is essential.

### Azathioprine dosing and metabolite measurement in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: does one size fit all? [^113LwCxm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, immune-regulated inflammatory condition of the digestive system. It is thought to have a complex etiology involving genetic, immunological and environmental factors. The worldwide incidence and prevalence of IBD in children is increasing: the current incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) in children ranges between 2.5 and 11.4/100,000. Pediatric IBD is associated with more extensive and aggressive disease that has higher rates of surgical management. The main treatment goals in IBD management include timely and effective induction of remission followed by maintenance, with crucial focus on optimizing nutrition, monitoring growth and quality of life, and limiting drug-related side effects.

IBD disease activity may be assessed using the activity indexes (AI) Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), which allow clinical symptoms, physical signs and biochemical markers to be converted into an activity score. These are reliable indicators of disease severity and remission status and are helpful in evaluating the response to treatment changes. An AI score of < 10 accurately reflects clinical remission.

Thiopurines, such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine, are immunomodulatory agents recommended for the maintenance of steroid-free remission in children with IBD. They are initiated soon after diagnosis and can take up to 14 weeks to be fully effective. The recommended starting doses are currently 2–2.5 mg/kg for azathioprine and 1–1.5 mg/kg for mercaptopurine.

Thiopurine use is associated with dose-dependent adverse drug reactions (ADRs), often leading to dose reduction or drug discontinuation. Hematological toxicity in the form of myelosuppression, secondary to either thiopurine or elevated levels of its metabolite 6-thioguanine (6-TGN), is the most serious ADR. A review of 66 trials including 8302 patients reported a cumulative incidence of myelosuppression of 7%, predominantly occurring within the initial few months of treatment.

Methotrexate — toxicity profile and risk mitigation: "Common and generally minor toxicities of methotrexate include nausea, anorexia, stomatitis, and fatigue that most often occur at the time of methotrexate administration". These effects "may be minimized by administering methotrexate by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, splitting the dose, folate supplementation, or by administering the dose with food or at bedtime". Major toxicities are "myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary fibrosis". In reported fatalities, "Of 164 possible methotrexate-associated fatalities, 67 were caused by myelosuppression, 30 were caused by pulmonary fibrosis, and 8 were caused by hepatotoxicity". Pulmonary fibrosis is noted as severe and "much less common in patients with psoriasis than in patients with rheumatoid arthritis". Additional reported risks include "Hepatitis, reactivation of tuberculosis (TB), and lymphoma, especially the B-cell type that is commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection", and "These observations suggest that practitioners need to maintain a high index of suspicion for these infections in patients being treated with methotrexate".

### Incidence of thiopurine-induced severe myelosuppression in a nationwide cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^113Y3rHW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Thiopurines (TPs) (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) are integral in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Myelosuppression is a side effect of TPs and a frequent reason for dose reductions and/or treatment discontinuation. The reported cumulative incidence of TP-induced myelosuppression (TIM) is 7% usually occurring within a few weeks to months of drug initiation. Pretreatment testing of enzyme TP S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is recommended to identify patients at risk of TIM. However, even in patients who have normal TPMT activity, European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation guidelines recommend monitoring white blood cell (WBC) counts every 2–3 months after 2 months of drug initiation. The British Society of Gastroenterology recommends a full blood count every 3 months.

These guidelines are primarily based on expert opinion, and there are limited data on the incidence of severe TIM among patients with IBD on long-term TP treatment. To address this unmet need, we aim to evaluate the incidence of severe myelosuppression among patients with IBD on long-term TP therapy with a normal TPMT level.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^113zLV41]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Statement 85. We recommend that thiopurines should be avoided in patients with low TPMT activity. The dose of thiopurine should be reduced to 50% in those with intermediate thiopurine activity. Daily dosage should also be reduced in patients with significant renal impairment (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

The usual dose of azathioprine is 2–2.5 mg/kg daily and for mercaptopurine 1–1.25 mg/kg daily for patients with normal TPMT activity (box 6). There is a very high risk of thiopurine-induced myelosuppression in patients with absent TPMT activity (homozygous or compound heterozygous TPMT deficiency). While very low dose (5% of usual target) has been proposed, a thiopurine should generally be avoided in this group. In those with heterozygous TPMT deficiency, however, 50% of standard thiopurine dose is associated with improved tolerance.

Genetic variation in NUDT15 has now also been described in association with myelosuppression. This was originally described in East Asiansbut has now also been described in IBD patients of European ancestry. Recent CPIC guidelines recommend NUDT15 testing, particularly for Asian patients, with consideration of dose reduction or thiopurine avoidance.

5.2.2.2 Starting dose for thiopurines

Azathioprine and mercaptopurine should be started at the full dose. There is no evidence that starting at low doses and then gradually increasing up to target improves safety or tolerance, and low-dose initiation may cause significant delay in achieving the correct target dose.

5.2.2.3 Renal excretion of thiopurines

Thiopurine metabolites are renally excreted. Thiopurines should be used with caution in renal impairment with 75% of usual dose given if creatinine clearance is 10–50 mL/min, and 50% of usual dose if < 10 mL/min.

### Nilotinib (Danziten) [^113s3e7g]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Substitution with Other Nilotinib Products and Risk of Medication Errors

Nilotinib is available in different formulations, recommended dosages, and tablet strengths, and for different indications. DANZITEN (nilotinib) tablets may not be substitutable with other nilotinib products, including other nilotinib tablets, on a milligram per milligram basis. When switching patients between other nilotinib products and DANZITEN (nilotinib) tablets, a dose conversion may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 and 2.2)]. Substitution of DANZITEN (nilotinib) tablets for another nilotinib product to achieve the same daily nilotinib dosage on a milligram per milligram basis may result in a clinically significant:

- Increase in nilotinib exposure which may increase the risk of nilotinib-associated adverse reactions.

- Decrease in nilotinib exposure which may reduce DANZITEN effectiveness.

Confirm that the intended nilotinib product is being prescribed and dispensed.

5.2 Myelosuppression

Treatment with DANZITEN can cause Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Perform CBCs every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by withholding DANZITEN temporarily or dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Other endocrine abnormalities

In patients treated with imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib, thyroid abnormalities were detected in 25%, 55% and 70% of patients, respectively. Hypothyroidism is more common than hyperactivity, and it responds to hormone supplementation. Gynaecomastia has been reported in 6% patients with imatinib, mostly associated with diminution of testosterone levelsand dasatinib.

Haematological adverse events: myelosuppression

General comments

Myelosuppression developing during TKI treatment of CML is very common. It is due to the combined effect of the suppression of the leukaemic clone and the inhibition of non-leukaemic haematopoiesis, which is greatly reduced at CML diagnosis. After TKI-induced reduction of leukaemic haematopoiesis, normal stem and progenitor cells need time to recover from pre-existing suppression by the malignant clone and to re-populate the bone marrow.

This interpretation is supported by several observations: first, myelosuppression is almost always limited to the first weeks or months of treatment. Second, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression is predominant at the initiation of treatment and decreases substantially with longer exposures to any TKI. Third, haematological side effects of TKIs are (mostly) dose-dependent, reversible on treatment cessation or dose reduction, and affect all three lineages to a variable degree. Thus, myelosuppression is an expression of efficacy rather than a true toxicity, and it is rare once a remission has been achieved.

Nevertheless, haematological toxicity is important because it is the major cause of treatment discontinuation/interruption and dose reduction, since a patient with chronic phase CML cannot be put at risk of dying from infection or bleeding, Thus, the management of cytopenias lies mainly in tight monitoring of blood counts.

### 5-azacytidine and decitabine monotherapies of myelodysplastic disorders [^111Vs64R]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and differentiate the pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and results of major clinical trials of 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) therapy of myelodysplastic disorders.

Data Sources

A PubMed/MEDLINE search was conducted (1966-October 2004) using the following terms: DNA methylation, myelodysplastic disorders, 5-azacytidine, and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine). Additional data sources included bibliographies from identified articles and manufacturer information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials for the treatment of various malignancies by hypomethylating agents were selected from data sources. All published, major clinical trials evaluating 5-AzaC or decitabine in myelodysplastic disorders and transformed myeloid leukemia treatment were included.

Data Synthesis

Myelodysplastic disorders are a group of bone marrow stem cell hyperplasias and dysplasias that result in ineffective hematopoiesis. Myelodysplastic disorders and transformed leukemia have poor prognosis and minimal response to chemotherapy. DNA hypomethylating agents have been shown to improve overall response rates (increased neutrophil, leukocyte, and platelet counts), time to leukemic progression, and quality of life compared with supportive therapy. The incidence of the most common adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression) can be reduced by low-dose, continuous, or extended-interval infusion.

Conclusions

Since appropriate dosing schedules of decitabine are being investigated, comparison of the clinical effectiveness of 5-AzaC and decitabine would be premature at this time. DNA hypomethylating agents show promise as monotherapies of myelodysplastic disorders and transformed leukemia and may be useful as a component of combination chemotherapy of various malignancies.

NCCN ovarian cancer — newly diagnosed patients: counseling on primary therapy options and intraperitoneal (IP)/intravenous (IV) regimen precautions. Eligible patients should be informed about primary options — IV chemotherapy, a combination of IP and IV chemotherapy, or a clinical trial — so they can decide which is most appropriate. Before combined IP and IV therapy, patients must be apprised of increased toxicities versus IV alone, including increased myelosuppression, renal toxicities, abdominal pain, neuropathy, GI (gastrointestinal) toxicities, metabolic toxicities, and hepatic toxicities. Patients considered for the IP cisplatin and IP/IV paclitaxel regimen should have normal renal function before starting, a medically appropriate performance status based on anticipated toxicities, and no prior medical problems that could significantly worsen (e.g., pre-existing neuropathy). Prior to and after each cycle of IP cisplatin, adequate amounts of IV fluids need to be administered to prevent renal toxicity; after each cycle, patients need careful monitoring for myelosuppression, dehydration, electrolyte loss, and organ toxicities (such as renal and hepatic damage). Patients often require IV fluids postchemotherapy in the outpatient setting to prevent or help treat dehydration. Refer to the original references (Discussion) for full toxicity data, doses, schedule, and dose modifications.

### Azathioprine sodium [^116xUKQY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cytopenias:

Severe leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemias including macrocytic anemia, and/or pancytopenia may occur in patients being treated with azathioprine. Severe bone marrow suppression may also occur. Hematologic toxicities are dose-related and may be more severe in renal transplant patients whose homograft is undergoing rejection. It is suggested that patients on azathioprine have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage alterations or other therapy changes are necessary. Delayed hematologic suppression may occur. Prompt reduction in dosage or temporary withdrawal of the drug may be necessary if there is a rapid fall in or persistently low leukocyte count, or other evidence of bone marrow depression. Leukopenia does not correlate with therapeutic effect; therefore the dose should not be increased intentionally to lower the white blood cell count.

TPMT
or NUDT15 Deficiency

Patients with thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency may be at an increased risk of severe and life-threatening myelotoxicity if receiving conventional doses of azathioprine (see CLINCIAL PHARMACOLOGY). Death associated with pancytopenia has been reported in patients with absent TPMT activity receiving azathioprine. In patients with severe myelosuppression, consider evaluation for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests). Consider alternative therapy in patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency and reduced dosages in patients with heterozygous deficiency (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Serious infections:

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including azathioprine, are at increased risk for bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and opportunistic infections, including reactivation of latent infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes.

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy

Cases of JC virus-associated infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including azathioprine. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset neurological manifestations and consider consultation with a neurologist as clinically indicated. Consider reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, consider the risk that the reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft.

Safety profile

During the neoadjuvant period, 32 (94.1%), 31 (91.2%), and 11 (32.4%) patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), treatment-related AEs (TRAEs), immune-related AEs (irAEs), respectively (Table 3). The most common TEAEs during the neoadjuvant period were myelosuppression (n = 27, 79.4%), nausea/vomiting (n = 17, 50.0%), and rash (n = 9, 26.5%). Seventeen patients (50.0%) had grade ≥ 3 AEs. The most common grade ≥ 3 AE was myelosuppression (n = 11, 32.4%). cCRT-related adverse events occurred in 28 (82.4%) patients, including 10 (29.4%) with grade 3 cCRT-related AEs (7 myelosuppression, 4 nausea/vomiting and 1 with both.) and 4 (11.8%) with grade 4 myelosuppression. The most common cCRT-related AEs were myelosuppression and nausea/vomiting (Supplementary Table 1). Two (5.9%) had radiotherapy discontinuation: one patient due to grade 3 nausea/vomiting at the dose of 36Gy/20f and one due to grade 3 nausea/vomiting and myelosuppression at the dose of 34.2 Gy/19f.

### Pemetrexed (pemfexy) [^115Nj9yv]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1	Myelosuppression and Increased Risk of Myelosuppression without Vitamin Supplementation

Pemetrexed can cause severe myelosuppression resulting in a requirement for transfusions and which may lead to neutropenic infection. The risk of myelosuppression is increased in patients who do not receive vitamin supplementation. In Study JMCH, incidences of Grade 3–4 neutropenia (38% versus 23%), thrombocytopenia (9% versus 5%), febrile neutropenia (9% versus 0.6%), and neutropenic infection (6% versus 0) were higher in patients who received pemetrexed plus cisplatin without vitamin supplementation as compared to patients who were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12prior to and throughout pemetrexed plus cisplatin treatment.

Initiate supplementation with oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12prior to the first dose of PEMFEXY; continue vitamin supplementation during treatment and for 21 days after the last dose of PEMFEXY to reduce the severity of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Obtain a complete blood count at the beginning of each cycle. Do not administer PEMFEXY until the ANC is at least 1500 cells/mm³and platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm³. Permanently reduce PEMFEXY in patients with an ANC of less than 500 cells/mm³or platelet count of less than 50,000 cells/mm³in previous cycles [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

In Studies JMDB and JMCH, among patients who received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3–4 neutropenia was 15% and 23%, the incidence of Grade 3–4 anemia was 6% and 4%, and incidence of Grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia was 4% and 5%, respectively. In Study JMCH, 18% of patients in the pemetrexed arm required red blood cell transfusions compared to 7% of patients in the cisplatin arm [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT and JMEI, where all patients received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3–4 neutropenia ranged from 3% to 5%, and incidence of Grade 3–4 anemia ranged from 3% to 5%.

### Mercaptopurine [^115ViHp5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Myelosuppression: Monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose of MERCAPTOPURINE for excessive myelosuppression. Consider testing in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency. Patients with homozygous-TPMT or homozygous-NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction. (2.2, 5.1)
Hepatotoxicity: Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Withhold MERCAPTOPURINE at onset of hepatotoxicity. (5.2)
Immunosuppression :Response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised pediatrics. (5.3)
Treatment Related Malignancies: Aggressive and fatal cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have occurred. (5.4)
Macrophage Activation Syndrome: Monitor for and treat promptly; discontinue MERCAPTOPURINE. (5.5)
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.6, 8.1, 8.3)

5.1 Myelosuppression

The most consistent, dose-related adverse reaction of MERCAPTOPURINE is myelosuppression, manifested by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination of these. Monitor CBC and adjust the dosage of MERCAPTOPURINE for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Consider testing for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) and NUDT15 genotyping can identify patients who have reduced activity of these enzymes. Patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction, [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

Myelosuppression can be exacerbated by coadministration with allopurinol, aminosalicylates or other products that cause myelosuppression [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.3, 7.4)]. Reduce the dosage of MERCAPTOPURINE when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Cytomegalovirus mediated myelosuppression [^112Ee14b]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has long been associated with myelosuppression. Evidence for this association has been provided from in vitro studies, statistical analysis of clinical studies, informative case reports, and murine models. Reports differ as to how CMV mediates myelosuppression. Some data indicate direct infection of hematopoietic progenitors and their progeny, others indicate that the supportive microenvironment is infected and thereby its supportive function compromised. In this report we review data suggesting that the severity of myelosuppression in patients is associated with particular CMV genotypes identified by variations in the glycoprotein B gene.

Combination and immunogenicity strategies — combination therapy with a thiopurine is more efficacious than anti-TNF monotherapy and should be considered, especially in patients who have failed one or more anti-TNF agents; extrapolating from data in Crohn's disease, methotrexate may be used instead of thiopurines to decrease anti-TNF immunogenicity; extrapolating from data with anti-TNF agents, thiopurines and methotrexate may be used to decrease vedolizumab immunogenicity; the addition of allopurinol (while decreasing the thiopurine dose to 1/4 of the previous dose) may be considered at centers with experience and recognizing the risks of severe myelosuppression and infection.

### Trends in recommendations for myelosuppressive chemotherapy for the treatment of solid tumors [^114Sfiwi]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2006). Low credibility.

Lung, breast, and colorectal cancers are the 3 most frequent causes of cancer-related death in the United States. In the past 15 years, survival has increased dramatically for patients with these tumor types, partly because improved chemotherapy caused major changes in standard care. In addition, maintaining chemotherapy dose intensity has an established a positive effect on patient outcomes. However, delivering chemotherapy at full dose and on schedule is limited primarily by myelosuppression. To determine how expert opinion about preferred chemotherapy for lung, breast, and colorectal cancers has changed over the past decade, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guidelines from 1996, 2000 or 2001, and 2005 for each tumor type were compared. The myelosuppressive potentials of NCCN-recommended agents were assessed using data from their prescribing information. Many agents and combinations of agents recommended in the NCCN guidelines for treating lung, breast, and colorectal cancers are associated with myelosuppression. Several of these myelosuppressive regimens, which were previously recommended for treating advanced-stage or metastatic disease, are now preferred for early-stage disease, and neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy is now recommended in more tumor types and stages than ever before. These findings indicate that the cytotoxic agents and regimens recommended today are associated with more myelosuppression than those preferred a decade ago and are more widely used in early-stage disease when survival benefits are possible. Because of this trend toward more intensive treatment of patients with cancer, proactive steps should be taken to minimize the risk for myelosuppression and its complications while optimizing the relative dose intensity.

### Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of the combination of topotecan and ifosfamide administered intravenously every 3 weeks [^114h4rw6]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The estimates for the parameters used to describe the sigmoidal– E max relationship of the pharmacokinetics and the myelosuppression were similar to previously reported values.reported an AUC₅₀ for total topotecan of 173 nh −1 after single-agent topotecan (0.5–1.5 mg m⁻² day⁻¹ × 5). In contrast, the Hill coefficients were two-fold higher than previously reported (1.8), possibly indicating the additive effect of IF on the myelosuppression. The relationship between the topotecan exposure and the decrease in THR indicated that the maximum decrease is not likely to be reached with the doses studied. No structural differences (only random) were observed in the estimates for the AUC 50 in the first and second course. This was in accordance with the observation that neutropenia was not cumulative. So far, dose escalation of topotecan only reached approximately 50% of the MTD of single-agent treatment with topotecan. This indicated a considerable additive myelosuppressive effect of IF. Exposure to the activated metabolites of IF (4OHIF and IFM) ranged approximately five-fold in the study, although the IF dose was not escalated. However, no clear relationship between the exposure to these active metabolites and the myelosuppression was observed (data not shown). Additive modelling of topotecan lactone/total and 4OHIF did not result in an increased goodness-of-fit of the relationship with myelosuppression. The inability to detect this relationship can be explained by the limited number of subjects, in which all data were available (n = 14) and the lack of an IF dose escalation or myelosuppresion data after single-agent topotecan or IF administration.

### Allopurinol [^114PyMoB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hepatotoxicity

Cases of reversible clinical hepatotoxicity have occurred in patients taking allopurinol tablets, and in some patients, asymptomatic rises in serum alkaline phosphatase or serum transaminase have been observed. If anorexia, weight loss, or pruritus develop in patients on allopurinol tablets, evaluate liver enzymes. In patients with pre-existing liver disease, monitor liver enzymes periodically. Discontinue allopurinol tablets in patients with elevated liver enzymes.

5.5 Myelosuppression

Myelosuppression, manifested by anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, has been reported in patients receiving allopurinol tablets. The cytopenias have occurred as early as 6 weeks up to 6 years after the initiation of therapy of allopurinol tablets. Concomitant use of allopurinol tablets with cytotoxic drugs associated with myelosuppression may increase the risk of myelosuppression. Monitor blood counts more frequently when cytotoxic drugs are used concomitantly [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Concomitant use with allopurinol increases the exposure of either mercaptopurine or azathioprine which may increase the risk of myelosuppression. Reduce the dosage of mercaptopurine or azathioprine as recommended in their respective prescribing information when used concomitantly with allopurinol tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.6 Potential Effect on Driving and Use of Machinery

Drowsiness, somnolence and dizziness have been reported in patients taking allopurinol tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Inform patients also that the central nervous system depressant effects of allopurinol tablets may be additive to those of alcohol and other CNS depressants.

Advise patients to avoid operation of automobiles or other dangerous machinery and activities made hazardous by decreased alertness when starting allopurinol tablets or increasing the dose, until they know how the drug affects them.

### Azathioprine [^115mQsqZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cytopenias

Severe leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemias including macrocytic anemia, and/or pancytopenia may occur in patients being treated with azathioprine. Severe bone marrow suppression may also occur. Hematologic toxicities are dose-related and may be more severe in renal transplant patients whose homograft is undergoing rejection. It is suggested that patients on Azathioprine Tablets have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage alterations or other therapy changes are necessary. Delayed hematologic suppression may occur. Prompt reduction in dosage or temporary withdrawal of the drug may be necessary if there is a rapid fall in or persistently low leukocyte count, or other evidence of bone marrow depression. Leukopenia does not correlate with therapeutic effect; therefore, the dose should not be increased intentionally to lower the white blood cell count.

TPMT or NUDT15 Deficiency

Patients with thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency may be at an increased risk of severe and life-threatening myelotoxicity if receiving conventional doses of Azathioprine Tablets (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Death associated with pancytopenia has been reported in patients with absent TPMT activity receiving azathioprine. In patients with severe myelosuppression, consider evaluation for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests). Consider alternative therapy in patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency and reduced dosages in patients with heterozygous deficiency (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

RESULTS

A total of 73,392 eligible patients with IBD were included in the VA Healthcare System. Of these, 14,760 patients with IBD had received TPs. Pretreatment TPMT testing was performed in 3,400 patients, and 2,823 patients had a normal TPMT level. Among these patients with a normal TPMT level, 40 patients had severe myelosuppression. After manual adjudication through detailed chart review, only 11 patients were found to have severe myelosuppression secondary to TPs. Figure 1 shows a flow chart highlighting the reasons for exclusion in the remaining 29 patients. Table 1 represents the baseline characteristics of these 11 patients.

### TPMT and NUDT15 genotyping recommendations: a joint consensus recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium, college of American pathologists, Dutch pharmacogenetics working group of the royal Dutch pharmacists association, European society for pharmacogenomics and personalized therapy, and pharmacogenomics knowledgebase [^112ZMFKM]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2022). High credibility.

Thiopurine toxicity risk and testing modality — TPMT and NUDT15 loss-of-function alleles are major contributors to thiopurine-induced myelosuppression, and heterozygous individuals on conventional doses are at increased risk, with homozygotes markedly increased. TPMT phenotyping assays directly can measure TPMT enzymatic activity and detect low activity from rare variants, but this type of functional testing should not be performed in individuals with recent blood transfusions or in individuals already treated with a thiopurine drug; NUDT15 enzymatic testing is not readily available clinically. Therefore, TPMT and NUDT15 genotype testing is a reasonable approach to identify individuals at increased risk of thiopurine toxicity and is widely available clinically.

### Genetic association analysis and frequency of NUDT15*3 with thiopurine-induced myelosuppression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in a large Dutch cohort [^112AQsCw]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Thiopurine drugs are cornerstone treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The most common adverse drug reaction is thiopurine-induced myelosuppression (TIM), that may partly be explained by the genetic polymorphism NUDT15*3. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the NUDT15*3 polymorphism frequency and its association with TIM in an IBD patient population in the Netherlands. DNA from patients previously genotyped for TPMT was genotyped for NUDT15*3. In IBD patients treated with thiopurines association tests with TIM were conducted. Out of 988 included patients, 13 (1.3%) were heterozygous for NUDT15*3. Of all patients, 606 had IBD and received thiopurine treatment. In these patients, 8/606 (1.3%) were heterozygous polymorphic for NUDT15*3 of which 50.0% developed TIM compared to 2.3% in the wild type patients (p < 0.001). The study results show a clinically relevant prevalence of NUDT15*3 in the Dutch patient population. Its strong association with TIM suggests pre-therapeutic genotyping potentially clinically utile.

### Thiopurine-induced myelotoxicity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a review [^115jorQh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

Probably, the most important and potentially lethal adverse event of azathioprine (AZA) and mercaptopurine (MP) is myelosuppression. Our aim was to conduct a review of AZA/MP-induced myelotoxicity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.

Methods

Bibliographical searches were performed in MEDLINE/EMBASE. The studies evaluating thiopurine-induced myelotoxicity in patients with IBD were reviewed. The cumulative incidence and the incidence rate of AZA/MP-induced myelotoxicity were calculated by a meta-analysis.

Results

In total, 66 studies (8,302 patients) were included. The cumulative incidence of AZA/MP-induced myelotoxicity was 7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6–8%). The incidence rate (per patient and year of treatment) of the drug-induced myelotoxicity was 3% (95% CI 3–4%). The risk was roughly similar with AZA and with MP (7%vs 9%). The duration of AZA/MP treatment in patients with myelotoxicity ranged from 12 days to 27 yr. The cumulative incidence of infections among AZA/MP-induced myelotoxicity patients was 6.5%. The cumulative incidence of severe myelotoxicity was 1.1% (incidence rate 0.9%). Three deaths were reported due to myelotoxicity (cumulative incidence 0.06%, 95% CI 0.02–0.17%). The risk of death among patients who developed myelotoxicity was 0.94% (95% CI 0.32–2.70%).

Conclusion

The incidence rate of myelotoxicity in IBD patients receiving AZA/MP is approximately 3% per patient and year of treatment. Although bone marrow toxicity may develop at any time after starting the therapy, this happens more frequently during the first months. The incidence rate of severe myelotoxicity is less than 1% per patient and year of treatment, and the mortality risk is less than 0.1% (which means that the risk of death among IBD patients who develop myelotoxicity is approximately 1%).

### Impact of nutrition risk index, prognostic nutritional index and skeletal muscle index on early myelosuppression of first-line chemotherapy in stage IV gastric cancer patients [^114abjRJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, stage IV gastric cancer patients with low NRI, low PNI and low SMI have significantly more prone to early myelosuppression ≥ grade 2, and the high PNI was associated with higher completion rate of chemotherapy. In patients with stage IV gastric cancer with low NRI, low PNI and low SMI, the side effects of chemotherapy, particularly those associated with myelosuppression, must be carefully managed in subsequent treatment and start early nutritional and exercise interventions so that patients can successfully complete chemotherapy cycles. Prechemotherapy low levels of NRI, PNI and SMI were associated with greater occurrences of early myelosuppression ≥ grade 2 in stage IV patients with gastric cancer treated with first-line chemotherapy.

### Hairy cell leukemia and COVID-19 adaptation of treatment guidelines [^114FLBaS]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

The combination of a BRAF inhibitor either with a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody or a MEK inhibitor can further increase the rate of durable remissions without inducing severe myelosuppression. Therefore, selection of the optimal induction therapy for the newly diagnosed patient should consider these "off-label" options that may avoid excessive myelosuppression during the current pandemic. It may also be prudent to avoid the use of an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody during this time as well if the patient is scheduled to be soon vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (see section on prevention) or if the benefit of adding rituximab in terms of depth and rapidity of response is offset by the perceived risk of rituximab-induced immune suppression.

Newly diagnosed cHCL — choice of treatment

Primary treatment over the past two decades includes either cladribine or pentostatin. Both nucleoside analogs are effective and may induce long-term complete remissions. Purine nucleosides have been the established approved therapy for cHCL either as front-line therapy or for those in relapse. Their use has resulted in marked improvement in survival in patients with HCL, but both agents are very immunosuppressive. Different schedules have been proposed for cladribine. The administration on 5 consecutive days of cladribine is frequently used as highly effective induction, but is myelosuppressive. Other schedules have been explored in an effort to reduce myelosuppression, but have been equivalent with respect to infectious complications. Pentostatin can also be myelosuppressive, but the schedule of administration enables dose titration to reduce the depth and length of myelosuppression. Both cladribine and pentostatin cause serious and prolonged immunosuppression and their use requires careful consideration during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Myelosuppression by sunitinib is flt-3 genotype dependent [^116du6jG]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Sir,

Myelosuppression is frequently observed during treatment with the multi tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The frequency and severity of myelosuppression varies among the drug class with sunitinib being a relative myelotoxic compound leading to leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in 56–78% and 41–65% of the patients, respectively.

In a previous issue of the British Journal of Cancer, have investigated the potency of three TKIs that target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib, against a large panel of kinases in in vitro and cellular assays. They further evaluated the potential for myelosuppression by measuring the ability of these TKIs to inhibit human bone marrow progenitor growth. Both c-kit and flt-3 seemed to be important kinases for the development of early stem and progenitor cells, as determined by. The differences in activity against these kinases provide a plausible explanation for the observed differences in clinical myelosuppression between sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib.

As there is considerable variability among patients with regard to sunitinib-induced myelosuppression, additional patient characteristics could very well contribute to the development of bone marrow toxicity. In a recent study, we have investigated the relationship between germ-line variants in genes encoding proteins involved in sunitinib disposition, metabolism and mechanism of action and the development of common toxicities, including haematological toxicities. We found a strong association between the presence of the flt-3 738C-allele, which is a non-synonymous polymorphism in the flt-3 receptor with currently unknown functionality, and a 2.8-fold reduction in the risk for developing leukopenia after one cycle of sunitinib treatment. This finding not only underlines the role of flt-3 in myelosuppression as suggested bybut might also explain the large interpatient variability in sunitinib-related leukopenia response.

### Chronic activation of endothelial MAPK disrupts hematopoiesis via NFKB dependent inflammatory stress reversible by SCGF [^115i41LL]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

SCGF enhances hematopoietic regeneration following myelosuppressive injury

Myelosuppressive insults have been shown to adversely impact the endothelial niche resulting in a loss of vascular integrity and delayed hematopoietic recovery. In particular, ionizing radiation is known to activate NF-kB signaling within the endothelium leading to inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Given that SCGF infusion resolves vascular and hematopoietic defects in CDH5-MAPK mice, we sought to determine whether SCGF can enhance hematopoietic recovery following myelosuppressive stress. Wild-type mice were given a myelosuppressive dose of irradiation (650 rad) and infused every other day with either 0.5, 1, or 2 μg of SCGF for a total of seven injections starting at Day +1 post-irradiation and hematopoietic recovery was assessed for 21 days (Supplementary Fig. 10a). The dose–response experiment indicated that infusion of 2 μg of SCGF resulted in a significantly enhanced recovery of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, confirming that SCGF enhances hematopoietic recovery following myelosuppressive stress (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Utilizing this strategy, we sought to test whether SCGF can improve hematopoietic recovery and preserve HSPC activity in both control and CDH5-MAPK mice (Supplementary Fig. 10b). We found that infusion of SCGF improved hematopoietic recovery following 650 rad of myelosuppressive irradiation in both control and CDH5-MAPK mice (Fig. 9a, b). Immunofluorescence analysis of femoral BM sections at Day 28 post-irradiation revealed that SCGF infusion resulted in preservation of vascular integrity in both control as well as CDH5-MAPK mice (Fig. 9c, d). Evaluation of BM cellularity and HSC frequency after 28 days following myelosuppressive injury revealed that there was a significant increase in BM cellularity in both control and CDH5-MAPK mice treated with SCGF (Fig. 9e), while no significant changes were observed in phenotypic HSC frequency (Fig. 9f). Given that HSC frequency has been shown to poorly correlate with engraftment potential under conditions of inflammatory stress, we set forth to determine if SCGF infusion enhances HSC functionality following myelosuppression. To this end, we performed a competitive BM transplant on day 28 post-irradiation, wherein 2.5 × 10⁶ donor WBM cells from CDH5-MAPK mice or littermate controls (treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or SCGF) were transplanted along with 5 × 10⁵ CD45.1 competitor WBM cells into lethally irradiated (950 rads) CD45.1 mice (Fig. 9g, h). Analysis of CD45.2 cell engraftment 4 months post-transplant revealed that infusion of SCGF significantly enhanced long-term engraftment potential and multi-lineage reconstitution abilities for hematopoietic cells derived from both control and CDH5-MAPK mice (Fig. 9g, h). SCGF infusion was able to maintain the serial repopulation ability of hematopoietic cells derived from CDH5-MAPK mice during secondary transplantation assays (Fig. 9g, h), demonstrating that SCGF preserves HSC functionality in CDH5-MAPK mice both at steady state (Fig. 8d–g) and following myelosuppressive injury (Fig. 9g–j). Although SCGF infusion did not impact steady-state hematopoiesis in control mice (Fig. 8), these data show that SCGF preserves HSC function in control mice following myelosuppressive injury (Fig. 9g, h), thereby uncovering an undefined role for SCGF during hematopoietic stress. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that SCGF has potent therapeutic properties that not only enhances vascular and hematopoietic recovery under an inflammatory stress, but also significantly improves the functionality of the HSC following myelosuppressive insult to the hematopoietic system.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^112S4xjk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Thiopurines and methotrexate — use, dosing, and safety include that for newly diagnosed pediatric CD, 6-mercaptopurine, dosed at 1.5 mg/kg/d, administered in combination with the first course of corticosteroids, has demonstrated efficacy; adverse effects of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, myelosuppression, nausea, infections, hepatotoxicity, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and lymphoproliferative disorders, with risks of skin cancer and lymphoma demonstrated in observational studies and decreasing with medication discontinuation, and although these agents may be considered as steroid-sparing maintenance agents, accumulating risks associated with thiopurine exposures may outweigh the original steroid-sparing benefit. Methotrexate is also effective as a corticosteroid-sparing agent for the maintenance of CD remission, with parenteral methotrexate at 25 mg per week for at least 6 months with potential reduction to 15 mg per week; patients with normal small bowel absorption may be started on or switched to oral methotrexate at 15–25 mg once per week. Adverse effects related to methotrexate include nausea and vomiting, hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, bone marrow suppression and skin cancer, and likely lymphoma; the white blood cell counts and liver chemistries should be routinely monitored, and when prescribed to women with child-bearing capability, methotrexate should be administered only if highly effective contraception is in place. For patients on anti-TNF therapy, thiopurines or methotrexate may also be used as adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity with methotrexate 12.5–15 mg orally once weekly; antidrug antibodies can develop as early as the first 100 days of treatment, and lower drug levels at week 14 and greater risk of loss of response may be associated with active smoking status, increased body mass index, and anti-TNF monotherapy, whereas earlier initiation of combination therapy with immunomodulators may yield more durable effectiveness.

Palliative nuclear medicine therapies of bone metastases — patient preparation states that prior to administration of 89Sr-chloride, 153Sm-EDTMP, or 223Ra-Cl2, the patient should have a recent radionuclide bone scan to demonstrate osteoblastic metastases (within 3 months is preferred), and a bone scan must be used to verify that sclerotic lesions on radiograph or CT have increased radiotracer uptake; osteolytic metastases should be further characterized with a bone scan, and for 223Ra-Cl2, CT of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis should be obtained to exclude visceral disease. Bone scintigraphic abnormalities should be correlated with appropriate physical examination and anatomic imaging to evaluate issues needing attention prior to radionuclide treatment; in such cases radionuclide therapies should be pursued only in conjunction with targeted therapy (local radiation or surgical treatment), and radionuclide therapies have no role in the treatment of acute presentations of these entities. Prior to therapy, clinicians should consider other sources of pain indicated by the patient's clinical history and physical examination. Given the potential treatment myelotoxicity, clinicians should discontinue myelosuppressive chemotherapy in anticipation of 89Sr-chloride, 153Sm-EDTMP, or 223Ra-Cl2 treatment (6–8 weeks for long-acting myelosuppressive chemotherapy and ~4 weeks for other myelosuppressive chemotherapy). Concomitant treatment with 89Sr-chloride, 153Sm-EDTMP, or 223Ra-Cl2 and external beam hemi-body radiation should be considered with caution as data describing combined adverse effects are lacking, and the potential for overlapping myelotoxicity from these treatments should be considered.

### Examining the characteristics of colchicine-induced myelosuppression in clinical cases: a systematic review [^116fuqNo]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The use of colchicine has been associated with varying degrees of myelosuppression. Despite expanded use in cardiovascular and inflammatory conditions, there remains clinician concern because of potential myelosuppressive side effects. A systematic review was conducted to explore the reported myelosuppressive events of colchicine.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted using the MeSH terms ("colchicine") AND ("myelosuppression", "bone", "marrow", "suppression", "aplasia", "leukopenia/leucopenia", "lymphopenia", "neutropenia") on September 1, 2020, and was updated on November 30, 2021. The search was conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The search included references published from 1978 to 2020 and was limited to English-language observational studies (ie, case reports, case series, case control studies, and cohort studies) or trial data.

Results

In total, 3233 articles were screened, with 30 studies of 47 patients with myelosuppression from colchicine identified. Most patients with myelosuppression had comorbidities, including renal impairment (21/47, 44.7%). Out of 47 patients, 15 (31.9%) and 13 (27.7%) were reported to be concurrently taking cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter inhibitors, respectively. Patients with renal impairment accounted for the majority of overall patients taking these CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors (8/15, 53.3%, and 8/13, 61.5%, respectively). Out of 21 patients with renal impairment, 13 had worsening cytopenia during colchicine use. The presentations ranged from moderate anemia (grade 2) to severe thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia (grade 4).

Conclusion

Colchicine has few reports of myelosuppression. The majority of patients with myelosuppression had preexisting renal impairment or concomitant CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitor use. Caution should be taken in this subset of patients with increased monitoring.

Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity exhibits a monogenic codominant inheritance and catabolizes thiopurines. TPMT variant alleles are associated with low enzyme activity and pronounced pharmacologic effects of thiopurines. Loss-of-function alleles in the NUDT15 gene are common in Asians and Hispanics and reduce the degradation of active thiopurine nucleotide metabolites, also predisposing to myelosuppression. We provide recommendations for adjusting starting doses of azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and thioguanine based on TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes (updates on www.cpicpgx.org).

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of azathioprine PO (also known as Imuran, Azasan):
- **Acute infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy**: maintain a high level of suspicion for immunosuppression, as azathioprine is associated with these adverse effects.
- **Exacerbation of myelosuppression**: use extreme caution in patients with thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency. Consider alternative therapy or dosage reductions.
- **Hematologic disorder**: use extreme caution in patients with renal transplant, TPMT deficiency, or nucleotide diphosphatase deficiency.
- **Hematologic malignancies**: maintain a high level of suspicion as chronic immunosuppression with azathioprine increases risk for post-transplant lymphoma and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients with IBD.
- **Thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, anemia, myelosuppression**: maintain a high level of suspicion for myelosuppression and cytopenias.

### Understanding hematological toxicities using mathematical modeling [^114TLDPC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Balancing antitumor efficacy with toxicity is a significant challenge, and drug-induced myelosuppression is a common dose-limiting toxicity of cancer treatments. Mathematical modeling has proven to be a powerful ally in this field, scaling results from animal models to humans, and designing optimized treatment regimens. Here we outline existing mathematical approaches for studying bone marrow toxicity, identify gaps in current understanding, and make future recommendations to advance this vital field of safety research further.

A subsequent open-label analysis evaluated 81 subjects; duration of therapy ranged from 1 to 220 months (median 16 months), with 49% controlled and 51% discontinuing because of initial failure (5%), side effects (36%), or relapse of psoriasis (10%). Myelosuppression was the most frequent side effect, occurring in 47% of subjects and requiring discontinuation in 21%, and serum transaminase levels were elevated in 25% of evaluated subjects. In a novel pulse dosing regimen given either twice or 3 times per week, 10 of 14 patients showed marked improvement, with patients given between 120 mg twice per week up to 160 mg 3 times per week.

Psoriasis systemic therapy — methotrexate hematologic toxicity and monitoring — notes that hematologic toxicity is more likely in patients with renal insufficiency, advanced age, dosing errors, drug interactions, hypoalbuminemia, and greater than moderate alcohol intake; a test dose should be considered in patients with such risk factors, and if there is no evidence of myelosuppression or hepatotoxicity the weekly dose can be increased as needed. Pancytopenia can result after even a single dose and can occur as late as 6 weeks, so close laboratory monitoring is recommended after each dose increase. Regular laboratory monitoring with complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests should be performed every 3 to 6 months assuming no abnormalities, and periodic renal monitoring should be considered in patients with poor renal function.

### Temozolomide [^116wRfjs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression

Myelosuppression, including pancytopenia, leukopenia and anemia, some with fatal outcomes, have occurred with temozolomide [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

In MK-7365–006, myelosuppression usually occurred during the first few cycles of therapy and was generally not cumulative. The median nadirs occurred at 26 days for platelets (range: 21 to 40 days) and 28 days for neutrophils (range: 1 to 44 days). Approximately 10% of patients required hospitalization, blood transfusion, or discontinuation of therapy due to myelosuppression. Geriatric patients and women have been shown in clinical trials to have a higher risk of developing myelosuppression.

Obtain a complete blood count and monitor ANC and platelet counts before initiation of treatment and as clinically indicated during treatment. When temozolomide is used in combination with radiotherapy, obtain a complete blood count prior to initiation of treatment, weekly during treatment, and as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)].

For severe myelosuppression, withhold temozolomide and then resume at same or reduced dose, or permanently discontinue, based on occurrence [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)].

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Fatal and severe hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving temozolomide. Perform liver tests at baseline, midway through the first cycle, prior to each subsequent cycle, and approximately two to four weeks after the last dose of temozolomide.

5.3 Pneumocystis Pneumonia

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) has been reported in patients receiving temozolomide. The risk of PCP is increased in patients receiving steroids or with longer treatment regimens of temozolomide.

For patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, provide PCP prophylaxis for all patients during the concomitant phase. Continue PCP prophylaxis in patients who experience lymphopenia, until resolution to Grade 1 or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Monitor all patients receiving temozolomide for the development of lymphopenia and PCP.

5.4 Secondary Malignancies

The incidence of secondary malignancies is increased in patients treated with temozolomide-containing regimens. Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukemia, have been observed following temozolomide administration.

### Genome-wide association study of myelosuppression in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with platinum-based chemotherapy [^112EHiAv]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Platinum-induced myelosuppression severely impedes successful chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Hence, it is clinically important to identify the patients who are at high risk for severe toxicity to certain chemotherapy. We first carried out a genome-wide scan of 906703 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify genetic variants associated with platinum-induced myelosuppression risk in 333 NSCLC patients with chemotherapy. Then, we replicated 24 SNPs that had P < 1 × 10⁻⁴ in another independent cohort of 876 NSCLC patients. With P < 0.05 as the criterion of statistical significance, we found that rs13014982 at 2q24.3 and rs9909179 at 17p12 exhibited consistently significant associations with myelosuppression risk in both the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) scan and the replication stage (rs13014982: odds ratio (OR) = 0.55, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.41–0.74, P = 7.29 × 10⁻⁵ for GWAS scan and OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65–0.93, P = 0.006 for replication stage; rs9909179: OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.37–0.70, P = 4.60 × 10⁻⁵ for GWAS scan and OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68–0.99, P = 0.040 for replication stage; both in additive model). In combined samples of genome-wide scan and replication samples, the minor alleles of rs13014982 and rs9909179 remained significant associations with the decreased risk of myelosuppression (rs13014982: OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61–0.83, P = 1.36 × 10⁻⁵; rs9909179: OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.65–0.89, P = 0.001). Rs13014982 at 2q24.3 and rs9909179 at 17p12 might be independent susceptibility markers for platinum-induced myelosuppression risk in NSCLC patients.

### A practical guide to thiopurine prescribing and monitoring in IBD [^115Fv73p]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Bone marrow toxicity

Myelosuppression has been associated with low TPMT activity and with MeMP > 11 450 pmol/8×10⁸ RBCs. In this scenario, we adopt the same approach to that of hypermethylation and hepatotoxicity and switch to LDTA. Where leucopenia occurs in the absence of hypermethylation, our practice is to alter dosing according to relevant blood count parameters (see figure 4). In the case of lymphopenia, adjustment is debateable, as studies suggest patients with lymphopenia are not at increased risk of infections.

### Single nucleotide polymorphism in ABCG2 is associated with irinotecan-induced severe myelosuppression [^112Jh4Kx]. Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Irinotecan is an anti-neoplastic agent that is widely used for treating colorectal and lung cancers, but often causes toxicities such as severe myelosuppression and diarrhea. In this study, we performed a two-stage case-control association study for irinotecan-induced severe myelosuppression (grades 3 and 4). In the first stage, 23 patients who developed severe myelosuppression and 58 patients who did not develop any toxicity were examined for 170 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 genes involved in the metabolism and transport of irinotecan. A total of five SNPs were identified to show the possible association with severe myelosuppression (P(Fisher) < 0.01) and were further examined in 7 cases and 20 controls in the second stage of the study. An intronic SNP, rs2622604, in ABCG2 showed P(Fisher) = 0.0419 in the second stage and indicated a significant association with severe myelosuppression in the combined study (P(Fisher) = 0.000237; P(Corrected) = 0.036). Although only limited subjects were investigated, our results suggested that a genetic polymorphism in ABCG2 might alter the transport activity for the drug and elevate the systemic circulation level of irinotecan, leading to severe myelosuppression.

### Induction of blood-circulating bile acids supports recovery from myelosuppressive chemotherapy [^115GsyK8]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapeutic agents can reduce bone marrow (BM) activity, causing myelosuppression, a common life-threatening complication of cancer treatment. It is challenging to predict the patients in whom prolonged myelosuppression will occur, resulting in a delay or discontinuation of the treatment protocol. An early indicator of recovery from myelosuppression would thus be highly beneficial in clinical settings. In this study, bile acids (BAs) were highly increased in the systemic circulation as a natural response during recovery from myelosuppression, supporting regeneration of BM cells. BA levels in the blood of pediatric cancer patients and mice treated with chemotherapeutic agents were increased, in synchrony with early proliferation of BM cells and recovery from myelosuppression. In a mouse model of altered BA composition, Cyp8b1 knockout mice, a subset of mice recovered poorly after chemotherapy. The poor recovery correlated with low levels and changes in composition of BAs in the liver and systemic circulation. Conversely, BA supplementation in chemotherapy-treated wild-type mice resulted in significantly improved recovery. The results suggest that part of the mechanism by which BAs support recovery is the suppression of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways in expanding and recovering hematopoietic cells. The findings propose a novel role of BAs as early markers of recovery and active components of the recovery process after chemotherapy.

### Trends in the use of primary prophylactic colony-stimulating factors and neutropenia-related hospitalization in elderly cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy in the USA: 1995–2015 [^113oCMAJ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess changes in neutropenia-related hospitalization, myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and primary prophylactic colony-stimulating factor (PP-CSF) use in elderly cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

Methods

We identified annual cohorts of patients aged ≥ 66 years with breast cancer, lung cancer, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) initiating myelosuppressive chemotherapy during 1995–2015 using Medicare 5% (1994–2008) and 20% (2007–2015) data. We described myelosuppressive chemotherapy changes by febrile neutropenia (FN) risk category (high, intermediate, unclassified), PP-CSF use, and, in the first cycle of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, neutropenia-related hospitalization (ICD-9-CM: 288.0X, first 5 positions). We evaluated hospitalization trends using a logistic regression model with spline curve of calendar year adjusting for baseline characteristics.

Results

Annual cohorts included 1451–2114 eligible patients for 1995–2007 and 5272–7603 for 2008–2015. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy use with high/intermediate FN risk increased from 31% in 1995 to 56% in 1999, stabilized through 2008 (range 56–61%), then decreased to 52% in 2015. PP-CSF use increased from 5.5% in 1995 to 52.7% in 2015, mainly due to pegfilgrastim introduction in 2002. Crude neutropenia-related hospitalization incidence decreased from 5.2% in 1995 to 2.7% in 2015; adjusted incidence decreased, on average, by 4.7% yearly before 2010 (p < 0.0001) and was flat from 2010 onward (p = 0.53).

Conclusions

Among elderly patients with breast cancer, lung cancer, or NHL receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, PP-CSF use increased substantially after 2002. Neutropenia-related hospitalization incidence in the first cycle decreased yearly before 2010 and was flat afterward. Further studies are needed to understand overall decreasing neutropenia-related hospitalization trends and effects of changes in myelosuppressive chemotherapy and FN management.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Myelosuppression: Monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose of PURIXAN for excessive myelosuppression. Consider testing in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency. Patients with homozygous-TPMT or homozygous-NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction. (2.2, 5.1)
Hepatotoxicity: Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Withhold PURIXAN at onset of hepatotoxicity. (5.2)
Immunosuppression :Response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised pediatrics. (5.3)
Treatment Related Malignancies: Aggressive and fatal cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have occurred. (5.4)
Macrophage Activation Syndrome: Monitor for and treat promptly; discontinue PURIXAN. (5.5)
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.6, 8.1, 8.3)

5.1 Myelosuppression

The most consistent, dose-related adverse reaction of PURIXAN is myelosuppression, manifested by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination of these. Monitor CBC and adjust the dosage of PURIXAN for excessive myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Consider testing for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) and NUDT15 genotyping can identify patients who have reduced activity of these enzymes. Patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction, [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

Myelosuppression can be exacerbated by coadministration with allopurinol, aminosalicylates or other products that cause myelosuppression [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.3 and 7.4)]. Reduce the dosage of PURIXAN when coadministered with allopurinol [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Azathioprine [^115Jt4BW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

TPMT and NUDT15 Testing: Consider genotyping or phenotyping patients for TPMT deficiency and genotyping for NUDT15 deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression. TPMT and NUDT15 testing cannot substitute for complete blood count (CBC) monitoring in patients receiving azathioprine. Accurate phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) results are not possible in patients who have received recent blood transfusions (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS: Cytopenias, ADVERSE REACTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections).

Drug Interactions: Use with Xanthine Oxidase (XO) Inhibitors: One of the pathways for inactivation of azathioprine is inhibited by XO inhibitors (allopurinol or febuxostat). Patients receiving Azathioprine Tablets and allopurinol concomitantly should have a dose reduction of azathioprine, to approximately 1/3 to 1/4 the usual dose. Concomitant use of Azathioprine Tablets with febuxostat is not recommended. Inhibition of XO may cause increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or its metabolite, 6-MP, leading to toxicity. It is recommended that a further dose reduction or alternative therapies be considered for patients with low or absent TPMT activity receiving Azathioprine Tablets and xanthine oxidase inhibitors because both TPMT and XO inactivation pathways are affected (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections).

### Azathioprine dosing and metabolite measurement in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: does one size fit all? [^114PBhsy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Scatterplot for azathioprine dose and thioguanine (TGN) level (r = 0.3 P = 0.20)

Figure 3
Scatterplot for white blood cell (WBC) counts and thioguanine (TGN) level (r = -0.18 P = 0.3)

Reduced enzyme activity results in an increased risk of myelosuppression. It is therefore recommended to check TPMT levels in every child prior to the initiation of therapy (normal range 25–50 pmol/h/mgHb). Cytopenia can occur even in the presence of normal TPMT activity; therefore, blood monitoring is required in all patients. Dose reduction or alternative treatments can be considered where an abnormal TPMT status is identified.

Side effects and ADRs, including gastroenterological disturbance, skin rash and pancreatitis, are common with thiopurine treatment, requiring dose adjustment or discontinuation in up to 25% of adult patients, with 56% of ADRs occurring within 1 month and 92% within 3 months of treatment. A multifaceted approach is required to maximize the response to and safety of these drugs. Pre-treatment TPMT status and regular monitoring of blood counts on treatment is considered the minimum standard for patients treated with thiopurine. Using 6-TGN levels above 235 pmol/8 × 10⁸ RBC as a surrogate marker of efficacy is well documented and is associated with maintaining clinical remission. It is also important to minimize the idiosyncratic side-effects by using an appropriate dosing regimen. Although the current dosing regimen for thiopurine therapy is body-weight based, there is increasing evidence to support the use of metabolite measurement to adjust thiopurine doses. Similarly to our findings, Hibi et al reported that low-dose thiopurine was effective and safe in maintaining remission in adults with ulcerative colitis. They described a significantly lower incidence of myelosuppression in the low-dose cohort compared with the standard-dose group.

### Autologous hematopoietic stem cell infusion for sustained myelosuppression after BCMA-CAR-T therapy in patient with relapsed myeloma [^1171PJGM]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Previous reports of unexpected organ injury and deaths related by CAR-T cell therapy significantly limit the application of novel therapies. The main adverse effects of CAR-T cell therapy include CRS, neurotoxicity, B cell aplasia, and bone marrow depression. B cell aplasia occurs in almost all patients treated with CAR-T therapy. Myelosuppression is a common but not serious adverse reaction in CAR-T therapy. Cohen reported 11 relapsed and refractory MM patients received BCMA targeted CAR-T cells, anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia occurred in each patient. Fried analyzed the persistent severe hematologic toxicity after CD19 CAR-T cells therapy for patients with relapsed and refractory leukemia and lymphoma, it was indicated severe myelosuppression was more common in patients with high grade CRS and in patients receiving stem cell transplantation prior to CAR-T therapy. The patient underwent ASCT within 1 year before receiving the CAR-T cell infusion, insufficient recovery of bone marrow hematopoiesis due to intensive chemotherapy, which in turn may result in bone marrow dysfunction under hematopoietic stress.

Most myelosuppression could be restored with component transfusion and stimulating factor applications. However, the case we presented here obtained mild CRS and no neurotoxicity occurred, but severe and lasting myelosuppression were observed. We found that severe myelosuppression already existed when he received infusion of CAR-T cells (Fig. 1c), this is consistent with the report. Applications of the component transfusion and stimulating factor did not improve the myelosuppression, ultimately, it was successfully recovered by autologous stem cell infusion.

The application of autologous stem cells in the CAR-T therapy, whose effect was similar to the role of hematopoietic stem cell infusion in transplantation after high-dose chemotherapy, promoted the reconstruction of bone marrow hematopoietic system, avoided serious infection. Autologous stem cell infusion is also a worthwhile option when patients suffer from severe and sustained myelosuppression after treatment with CAR-T cells.

### Preclinical characterization of G1T28: a novel CDK4 / 6 inhibitor for reduction of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression [^111AvgtN]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression continues to represent the major dose-limiting toxicity of cytotoxic chemotherapy, which can be manifested as neutropenia, lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. As such, myelosuppression is the source of many of the adverse side effects of cancer treatment including infection, sepsis, bleeding, and fatigue, thus resulting in the need for hospitalizations, hematopoietic growth factor support, and transfusions (red blood cells and/or platelets). Moreover, clinical concerns raised by myelosuppression commonly lead to chemotherapy dose reductions, therefore limiting therapeutic dose intensity, and reducing the antitumor effectiveness of the treatment. Currently, the only course of treatment for myelosuppression is growth factor support which is suboptimal. These treatments are lineage specific, do not protect the bone marrow from the chemotherapy-inducing cytotoxic effects, and the safety and toxicity of each agent is extremely specific. Here, we describe the preclinical development of G1T28, a novel potent and selective CDK4/6 inhibitor that transiently and reversibly regulates the proliferation of murine and canine bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and provides multilineage protection from the hematologic toxicity of chemotherapy. Furthermore, G1T28 does not decrease the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy on RB1-deficient tumors. G1T28 is currently in clinical development for the reduction of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in first- and second-line treatment of small-cell lung cancer.

### Cyclophosphamide (frindovyx) [^116qBhFf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression, Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Failure and Infections

Cyclophosphamide can cause myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), bone marrow failure, and severe immunosuppression which may lead to serious and sometimes fatal infections, including sepsis and septic shock. Latent infections can be reactivated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Antimicrobial prophylaxis may be indicated in certain cases of neutropenia at the discretion of the managing physician. In case of neutropenic fever, antibiotic therapy is indicated. Antimycotics and/or antivirals may also be indicated.

Monitoring of complete blood counts is essential during cyclophosphamide treatment so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed. Cyclophosphamide should not be administered to patients with neutrophils ≤ 1,500/mm³and platelets < 50,000/mm³. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop a serious infection. G-CSF may be administered to reduce the risks of neutropenia complications associated with cyclophosphamide use. Primary and secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in all patients considered to be at increased risk for neutropenia complications. The nadirs of the reduction in leukocyte count and thrombocyte count are usually reached in weeks 1 and 2 of treatment. Peripheral blood cell counts are expected to normalize after approximately 20 days. Bone marrow failure has been reported. Severe myelosuppression may be expected particularly in patients pretreated with and/or receiving concomitant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

All randomised patients received ≥ 2 cycles of treatment. Patients received a median of 10 cycles (range: 2–36). Nearly two‐thirds of patients (64%) had ≥ 1 delayed cycle; more than half (58%) had ≥ 1 dose‐reduced cycle. The most common reasons for cycle delays were related to myelosuppression and its clinical consequences, including the need to wait for blood counts to recover, as well as myelosuppression‐related adverse events such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and infections. Median durations of follow‐up were 23.4 months (range: 1.9–41.2) for the full study population, 27.2 months (range: 4.0–41.2) for patients with MD‐CMML, and 15.0 months (range: 1.9–40.2) for patients with MP‐CMML.

Response rate was 76% (25/33; CR + PR + mCR + HI), with 21% (7/33) of patients attaining CR and 15% (5/33) achieving mCR concurrently with HI (Table 2). Median time to best response was 2.3 months (range: 1–7). Median durations of best response were 9.4 months (range: 2–23) for the 23 patients for whom this parameter was reported, 10.1 months (range: 2–23) for patients with MD‐CMML (n = 19) and 6.5 months (range: 6–11) for those with MP‐CMML (n = 4). Median durations of CR were 9.4 months (range: 5–18) for the full cohort (n = 7) and patients with MD‐CMML (n = 5) and 8.6 months (range: 6–11) for those with MP‐CMML (n = 2).

### Pemetrexed [^111GzFcM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1	Myelosuppression and Increased Risk of Myelosuppression without Vitamin Supplementation

Pemetrexed can cause severe myelosuppression resulting in a requirement for transfusions and which may lead to neutropenic infection. The risk of myelosuppression is increased in patients who do not receive vitamin supplementation. In Study JMCH, incidences of Grade 3–4 neutropenia (38% versus 23%), thrombocytopenia (9% versus 5%), febrile neutropenia (9% versus 0.6%), and neutropenic infection (6% versus 0) were higher in patients who received pemetrexed plus cisplatin without vitamin supplementation as compared to patients who were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12prior to and throughout pemetrexed plus cisplatin treatment.

Initiate supplementation with oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12prior to the first dose of Pemetrexed Injection; continue vitamin supplementation during treatment and for 21 days after the last dose of Pemetrexed Injection to reduce the severity of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity of Pemetrexed Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Obtain a complete blood count at the beginning of each cycle. Do not administer Pemetrexed Injection until the ANC is at least 1500 cells/mm³and platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm³. Permanently reduce Pemetrexed Injection in patients with an ANC of less than 500 cells/mm³or platelet count of less than 50,000 cells/mm³in previous cycles [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

In Studies JMDB and JMCH, among patients who received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3–4 neutropenia was 15% and 23%, the incidence of Grade 3–4 anemia was 6% and 4%, and incidence of Grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia was 4% and 5%, respectively. In Study JMCH, 18% of patients in the pemetrexed arm required red blood cell transfusions compared to 7% of patients in the cisplatin arm [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI, where all patients received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3–4 neutropenia ranged from 3% to 5%, and incidence of Grade 3–4 anemia ranged from 3% to 5%.

### Mercaptopurine [^116qWYxD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1	Recommended Dosage

The recommended starting dose of MERCAPTOPURINE is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg (50 mg/m²to 75 mg/m²) orally once daily as part of combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. Take MERCAPTOPURINE either consistently with or without food.

After initiating MERCAPTOPURINE, monitor complete blood counts (CBC) and adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for excessive myelosuppression. Evaluate the bone marrow in patients with prolonged myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression to assess leukemia status and marrow cellularity.

Evaluate thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) status in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

If a patient misses a dose, instruct the patient to continue with the next scheduled dose.

2.2	Dosage Modifications in Patients with TPMT and/or NUDT15 Deficiency

Consider testing for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency in patients who experience severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

Homozygous Deficiency in either TPMT or NUDT15

Patients with homozygous deficiency of either enzyme typically require 10% or less of the recommended dosage. Reduce the recommended starting dosage of MERCAPTOPURINE in patients who are known to have homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency.

Heterozygous Deficiency in TPMT and/or NUDT15

Reduce the MERCAPTOPURINE dosage based on tolerability. Most patients with heterozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency tolerate recommended dosage, but some require dose reduction based on adverse reactions. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 may require more substantial dose reductions.

2.3	Dosage Modifications in Renal and Hepatic Impairment

Renal Impairment

Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for MERCAPTOPURINE in patients with renal impairment (CLcr less than 50 mL/min). Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Hepatic Impairment

Use the lowest recommended starting dosage for MERCAPTOPURINE in patients with hepatic impairment. Adjust the dosage to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for adverse reactions [see Uses in Specific Populations (8.7)].
