## Question

is metformin safe during pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the safety of metformin during pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "safety" across maternal, fetal/neonatal, and long-term offspring outcomes. Then, I should review evidence by indication: gestational diabetes, pregestational type 2 diabetes, PCOS, and obese non-diabetic populations. Next, I will examine guideline positions and the pharmacology, including placental transfer and pregnancy pharmacokinetics, and finally synthesize a practical, risk–benefit conclusion with scenario-specific recommendations and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm what "safety" should encompass in this context, because if I miss a domain, I might draw the wrong conclusion. I need to consider maternal outcomes such as glycemic control, gestational weight gain, hypoglycemia, and hypertensive disorders; fetal/neonatal outcomes such as congenital malformations, macrosomia/LGA, neonatal hypoglycemia, preterm birth, SGA, and perinatal death; and importantly, long-term offspring outcomes like neurodevelopment and adiposity, since short-term neutrality does not preclude delayed effects.

> Now, focusing on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), I should verify the comparative effectiveness of metformin versus insulin and how guidelines frame its role. A high-quality meta-analysis of 16 RCTs found metformin reduces neonatal hypoglycemia, LGA, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and maternal weight gain without increasing preterm birth, SGA, perinatal mortality, or Cesarean delivery, though long-term data are limited, which is reassuring for short-term safety but reminds me to scrutinize longer-term outcomes separately [^113WEqnL]. Hold on, I should align this with current standards: the ADA 2025 designates insulin as first-line and does not recommend metformin as first-line because it crosses the placenta and may be inadequate alone for glycemic targets, yet allows it as an alternative if insulin is declined or unsuitable, which affects how I counsel patients on "safety" and "appropriateness" in real practice [^1157LJBr]. Let me also check newer RCT data: EMERGE did not meet its composite primary endpoint but reduced insulin initiation, gestational weight gain, infant birthweight, and macrosomia, supporting certain maternal and neonatal benefits even if not first-line [^114rasyG].

> Turning to pregestational type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in pregnancy, I should confirm both practice patterns and outcome data. Insulin remains the preferred first-line therapy per ADA, but I need to note that metformin is increasingly used, often adjunctive to insulin, with observational data suggesting outcomes comparable to insulin alone and RCT evidence (MiTy) showing lower maternal weight gain, lower insulin dose, and fewer Cesareans without differences in serious neonatal morbidity, which suggests maternal benefits without obvious neonatal harm in the short term, though I must be cautious about confounding and generalizability [^1157LJBr] [^116LNRAe]. Wait, let me verify utilization trends to ensure I'm not overstating this: U.S. claims analyses show rising metformin use into the second trimester among women with T2DM, consistent with evolving practice despite guideline preference for insulin, which I should frame as real-world practice rather than an endorsement of first-line status [^112KhB3W]. And an Asian nationwide cohort also found no increase in adverse outcomes versus insulin, though that remains observational and lower in credibility than RCTs, so I'll keep my confidence calibrated accordingly [^11129NER].

> For PCOS, I need to be precise about timing and indication, because the risk–benefit calculus changes once pregnancy is established. The ADA 2025 specifically recommends discontinuing metformin by the end of the first trimester when it was used for ovulation induction, which I should emphasize during counseling because continuation beyond that point is not guideline-supported for PCOS alone [^113cBkWz]. Let me think about signals: small observational series suggested lower early pregnancy loss with continued metformin in PCOS, but these data are older, retrospective, and at higher risk of bias, so I should not over-interpret them against modern guideline advice [^111YWNcG]. Also, metformin's immunomodulatory effects during pregnancy in PCOS have been documented, but the clinical significance of cytokine shifts remains unclear, so I should not infer benefit or harm from these mechanistic findings alone [^111PMLPv].

> What about overweight or obese women without diabetes? I should check if metformin meaningfully improves outcomes, because if not, "safety" also implies avoiding futile therapy. Trials in obese non-diabetic populations, including NEJM and GRoW, generally showed modest reductions in gestational weight gain without reductions in LGA/macrosomia or consistent improvements in other outcomes, and systematic reviews agree; therefore, routine use for this indication is not recommended, which helps me avoid extending the notion of "safe" to "effective" where it isn't [^1129Y4R1] [^113oSpFQ] [^112WXqmC]. I should confirm guideline stance: narrative syntheses emphasize that metformin is not recommended for GDM prevention or weight management in non-diabetic pregnancy, which aligns with the trial data [^1164XyaP].

> Next, I will examine maternal safety signals head-on. Let me verify the consistent findings: metformin reduces gestational weight gain compared with insulin or placebo and is associated with fewer maternal hypoglycemic episodes than insulin, and may reduce pregnancy-induced hypertension in GDM, which supports a favorable maternal short-term safety profile and may contribute to patient acceptability [^112vKSLM]. I should double-check the need for rescue insulin, because efficacy affects safety via hyperglycemia exposure: a substantial proportion still require supplemental insulin, as reflected by RCTs and smaller trials where 30–50% needed insulin support, underscoring that metformin often functions as part of a combined strategy rather than monotherapy throughout pregnancy [^114rasyG] [^115vGS7G].

> Now to fetal and neonatal short-term outcomes, where safety concerns are most acute. I need to confirm the consistent signals: metformin reduces LGA/macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia versus insulin in GDM, without increases in SGA or perinatal mortality, which reassure me about immediate neonatal risk–benefit, provided glycemic targets are met [^112vKSLM]. Wait, I recall an earlier meta-analysis reporting a possible rise in preterm birth with metformin in GDM; I should not jump to conclusions without reconciling sources. The BMJ 2015 analysis suggested more preterm birth with metformin in some comparisons, but subsequent, larger syntheses and EMERGE did not confirm a significant increase, suggesting that any preterm birth signal is inconsistent and may reflect heterogeneity or chance; I will present this nuance rather than a categorical claim of risk [^1133zCST] [^112vKSLM] [^114rasyG].

> I should confirm teratogenicity risk and placental transfer, because these points often drive patient anxiety. Metformin crosses the placenta, and fetal serum levels can be similar to or higher than maternal, which is a key fact for shared decision-making, yet regulatory summaries and observational datasets do not show a clear association with major birth defects or miscarriage, aligning with large congenital anomaly registry analyses that found no overall increase in major anomalies; one exploratory signal for pulmonary valve atresia has been reported but is plausibly due to chance and has not been consistently replicated, so I will mention it with appropriate caution [^1118dgzw] [^113WEqnL] [^1118dgzw] [^113taBdf].

> Long-term offspring outcomes are my next checkpoint, and I need to be careful because this is where uncertainty resides. Let me verify neurodevelopment first: a 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis found no association between in utero metformin exposure and neurodevelopmental delay or adverse motor/cognitive scores up to mid-childhood, which is reassuring within available follow-up windows [^1117PKbB]. But wait, potential effects on growth trajectories and adiposity have been observed in some follow-ups of metformin-exposed offspring, though findings are inconsistent across studies like the New Zealand cohort and narrative syntheses; this suggests a need for cautious counseling that the long-term metabolic phenotype remains an area of active study without definitive harm signals, but not a guarantee of neutrality either [^1179dzFJ] [^1143TLcW] [^117DDPZL].

> I will now examine pharmacokinetics and dosing, because exposure matters for both efficacy and safety. Pregnancy increases renal clearance of metformin, lowering serum concentrations, which means some patients may need dose adjustments to maintain glycemic effect as pregnancy progresses, though individualized titration to targets remains the standard approach rather than a one-size rule [^114GWYBv]. I should confirm practical dosing references: labeling and compendia outline typical initiation and maintenance ranges used in GDM, but these should be contextualized within guideline preferences for insulin as first-line for pharmacologic treatment of diabetes in pregnancy, with metformin reserved for cases where benefits outweigh risks or when insulin is declined or not feasible [^1163LXyQ] [^1157LJBr].

> Before concluding, I need to align with authoritative guidelines so my final synthesis reflects both evidence and standards. ADA 2025 states insulin is the preferred first-line pharmacotherapy for diabetes in pregnancy and does not recommend metformin as first-line due to placental transfer and uncertainties around long-term offspring effects; nonetheless, metformin can be considered when insulin is not acceptable or feasible, with shared decision-making about benefits, failure rates requiring insulin add-on, and the unknowns of long-term exposure, and metformin used for PCOS-related ovulation induction should be discontinued by the end of the first trimester, which is a key operational "safety" point [^1157LJBr] [^113cBkWz]. Insulin's positioning as first-line is echoed broadly across reviews of pregnancy diabetes therapy, reinforcing that "safe" must be interpreted within the hierarchy of recommended options [^1146HjSC].

> Putting this together, is metformin "safe" in pregnancy? Hold on, I should be precise: for GDM and for T2DM as an adjunct, short-term maternal and neonatal outcomes with metformin are generally favorable or neutral compared with insulin, with consistent reductions in neonatal hypoglycemia, LGA/macrosomia, maternal weight gain, and less maternal hypoglycemia, while recognizing a substantial need for rescue insulin in many patients and uncertain long-term offspring metabolic effects, which merits transparent counseling despite reassuring neurodevelopmental data to date [^112vKSLM] [^114rasyG] [^1117PKbB] [^1143TLcW]. Therefore, I should frame metformin as acceptable when insulin is not feasible or as an adjunct to reduce insulin requirements, rather than as default first-line, and emphasize placenta crossing and the need for ongoing follow-up of offspring outcomes in shared decision-making [^1157LJBr] [^1179wJRp].

> By scenario, let me think this through clearly and double-check myself. In GDM, metformin is reasonable if insulin is declined or unsuitable, with counseling about benefits, the likelihood of needing insulin add-on, and the uncertainty around long-term effects, and with close glucose monitoring to avoid undertreatment; in T2DM, insulin remains preferred, but adding metformin can reduce insulin dose and maternal weight gain without clear neonatal harm in RCTs; in PCOS, discontinue metformin by the end of the first trimester when it was used to induce ovulation; and in obese non-diabetic pregnancy, do not use metformin routinely due to lack of outcome benefits beyond small effects on maternal weight gain, which keeps therapy aligned with efficacy and safety together rather than safety alone [^1157LJBr] [^114rasyG] [^113cBkWz] [^1129Y4R1].

Metformin is generally considered **safe during pregnancy** [^1179wJRp] for gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes when insulin is not feasible, with no clear increase in major birth defects or miscarriage [^112vKSLM] [^113ULwyE]. It crosses the placenta [^1118dgzw], so long-term offspring effects remain uncertain [^1143TLcW]; **insulin is preferred first-line** [^1157LJBr], and metformin should be stopped by the end of the first trimester if used for PCOS or ovulation induction [^113cBkWz]. Metformin is not recommended for GDM prevention or for use in type 1 diabetes during pregnancy [^1164XyaP] [^1157LJBr].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Insulin as first-line therapy**: Insulin is the preferred first-line treatment for diabetes in pregnancy [^1157LJBr] due to its established safety and efficacy [^112Rm8po].

- **Metformin as second-line therapy**: Metformin is recommended as a second-line option [^1157LJBr] for gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes in pregnancy when insulin is declined or cannot be safely administered [^116PM5dB].

- **Discontinuation in PCOS**: For PCOS or ovulation induction, metformin should be discontinued [^113cBkWz] by the end of the first trimester [^1157LJBr].

## Safety profile of metformin during pregnancy

### Maternal outcomes

- **Glycemic control**: Metformin provides glycemic control comparable to insulin [^112vKSLM] in gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes during pregnancy [^1146HjSC].

- **Gestational weight gain**: Metformin is associated with reduced gestational weight gain [^114rasyG] compared to insulin [^112vKSLM].

- **Hypoglycemia**: Metformin has a lower risk of maternal hypoglycemia [^115vGS7G] compared to insulin [^112vKSLM].

---

### Fetal and neonatal outcomes

- **Congenital anomalies**: No clear association [^1179wJRp] with increased major congenital anomalies or miscarriage.

- **Neonatal hypoglycemia**: Lower risk [^112vKSLM] of neonatal hypoglycemia compared to insulin [^1133zCST].

- **Birth weight**: Reduced risk [^112vKSLM] of large-for-gestational-age infants and macrosomia compared to insulin [^116Dpyhc].

- **Preterm birth**: Some studies report a slightly increased risk [^1133zCST] of preterm birth with metformin, but overall neonatal outcomes are comparable to insulin [^112vKSLM].

---

## Long-term outcomes for offspring

Regarding long-term outcomes for offspring, **Growth and development** show limited evidence of no significant differences in long-term growth or neurodevelopment compared with insulin [^1117PKbB] [^112vKSLM]. Metabolic health findings include some reports of increased **adiposity** and higher **BMI trajectories** in childhood, though data remain limited and inconsistent [^1179dzFJ] [^1143TLcW].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and placental transfer

Regarding pharmacokinetics and placental transfer, **Placental transfer** involves metformin crossing the placenta [^1118dgzw], with fetal concentrations similar to maternal levels. Pharmacokinetics are altered during pregnancy, with **increased clearance** [^114GWYBv] that may necessitate **dose adjustments** [^1118dgzw].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Regarding contraindications and precautions, **Contraindications** include renal or hepatic impairment, or hypersensitivity to the drug, while **Precautions** call for cautious use in patients with gastrointestinal disorders or risk factors for lactic acidosis.

## Comparison with insulin therapy

| **Outcome** | **Metformin** | **Insulin** |
|-|-|-|
| Glycemic control | Comparable [^112vKSLM] | Comparable |
| Maternal hypoglycemia | Lower risk [^112vKSLM] | Higher risk |
| Gestational weight gain | Lower [^114rasyG] | Higher |
| Neonatal hypoglycemia | Lower risk [^1133zCST] | Higher risk |
| Large-for-gestational-age infants | Lower risk [^116Dpyhc] | Higher risk |
| Preterm birth | Slightly higher risk | Lower risk |

## Current research gaps and ongoing studies

Ongoing studies aim to clarify long-term offspring outcomes, particularly metabolic and developmental effects. Evidence remains limited for **specific populations**, including individuals with **type 1 diabetes** and other subgroups [^1157LJBr]. Optimal dosing strategies during pregnancy require further investigation [^1118dgzw].

---

Metformin is generally **safe during pregnancy** for gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes when insulin is not feasible, with no clear increase in major birth defects or miscarriage [^113ULwyE]. Insulin remains **first-line** [^1157LJBr], and metformin should be stopped by the end of the first trimester if used for PCOS or ovulation induction [^113cBkWz].

## References

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1157LJBr]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, particularly concerning oral hypoglycemics, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend not using metformin and glyburide, individually or in combination, as first-line agents. This is due to both drugs crossing the placenta and potentially being insufficient to achieve glycemic goals. Additionally, other oral and non-insulin injectable glucose-lowering medications should not be used because of the lack of long-term safety data.

### Short- and long-term outcomes of metformin compared with insulin alone in pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112vKSLM]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). High credibility.

To assess the short- and long-term maternal and fetal impact of metformin in pregnancy compared with insulin, we performed a comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Eligible studies were randomized control trials (RCTs) or follow-ups of an RCT that: (1) compared metformin with insulin in pregnancy in women with gestational diabetes mellitus or Type 2 diabetes; and (2) reported maternal or fetal outcomes of interest. Two reviewers extracted the data, evaluated study quality, and calculated pooled estimates.

Sixteen studies (n = 2165 in quantitative analysis) were included. Metformin lowered the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia [risk ratio (RR) = 0.63; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.45 to 0.87], large for gestational age babies (RR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.99), pregnancy-induced hypertension (RR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.85), and total maternal pregnancy weight gain [mean difference (MD) = -2.07; 95% CI, -2.88 to -1.27]. Metformin did not increase preterm delivery (RR = 1.18; 95% CI, 0.67 to 2.07), small for gestational age babies (RR = 1.20; 95% CI, 0.67 to 2.14), perinatal mortality (RR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.17 to 3.92), or Caesarean section (RR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.19). Long-term outcome information is limited.

Our review found that metformin had no short-term adverse effects on pregnancy, potential benefits in the neonatal period, but limited long-term follow-up information. Prior to routine use, we recommend further follow-up studies of offspring exposure.

### Metformin hydrochloride [^1179wJRp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Limited data with metformin hydrochloride use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association of metformin with major birth defect or miscarriage risk. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy.

No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 5-times, respectively, a 2550 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6–10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1C > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20–25% in women with an HbA1C > 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations: disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects and stillbirth.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113cBkWz]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus during pregnancy, more specifically with respect to oral hypoglycemics, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend discontinuing metformin by the end of the first trimester when it has been previously initiated for the treatment of PCOS and induction of ovulation.

### Zituvimet [^112G9AMp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy: Risk summary**: Available data on the use of Zituvimet and sitagliptin during pregnancy is insufficient to determine an associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies on metformin use during pregnancy have not shown a clear link to major birth defects or miscarriage risk [see Data]. Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy presents risks to both the mother and fetus [see Clinical Considerations]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. Similarly, no adverse developmental effects were noted with metformin when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 6-times, respectively, a 2,000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes and hemoglobin A1c (A1C) levels over 7%. It has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with an A1C over 10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

### The use of glucose-lowering medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy in the United States [^112KhB3W]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

In a large cohort of publicly and privately insured US women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), metformin was the most frequently dispensed antidiabetic medication in the 90 days before pregnancy. The prescription for metformin declined throughout pregnancy, and insulin monotherapy became the most prevalent treatment by the second trimester. However, the use of metformin during pregnancy more than doubled between 2000 and 2014, while insulin use remained stable. Treatment combinations of insulin with other non-insulin antidiabetic medications, predominantly metformin, also increased over time. Women on metformin monotherapy before pregnancy often switched to, or added, insulin, while those on insulin monotherapy rarely added metformin. The smaller number of women on the combination of metformin and insulin before pregnancy tended to stay on the combination. Sulphonylurea prescriptions were less common but remained stable both throughout pregnancy and over time. The use of antidiabetic medications other than insulin, metformin, and sulphonylureas before pregnancy was low, with most women switching to insulin early in pregnancy.

Our results are consistent with other recent studies describing increases in the use of non-insulin antidiabetic medications in pregnancy. We observed that metformin was the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic medication before pregnancy, which differs from studies in which insulin was more prevalent; this discrepancy is likely due to differences in the definition of pregestational diabetes used in other studies, which allowed for inclusion of women with different criteria.

### Metformin for women who are overweight or obese during pregnancy for improving maternal and infant outcomes [^112WXqmC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

There has been considerable interest in providing antenatal dietary and lifestyle advice for women with obesity or who are overweight during pregnancy, as a strategy to limit gestational weight gain and improve maternal and infant health. However, such antenatal interventions appear to have a modest effect on gestational weight gain and other clinical pregnancy and birth outcomes, and additional strategies are required. Metformin is an oral insulin-sensitizing medication that acts to decrease blood glucose concentrations. It is commonly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and polycystic ovarian syndrome and is being used increasingly in the treatment of gestational diabetes, having been shown to result in decreased rates of caesarean birth and neonatal hypoglycemia. Metformin may be an adjuvant therapy to antenatal strategies in pregnant women with obesity or who are overweight, acting to reduce glucose production in the liver and improve glucose uptake in smooth muscle cells, thereby improving the overall metabolic health of women in pregnancy and reducing the risk of known adverse pregnancy outcomes.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the role of metformin in pregnant women with obesity or who are overweight, on maternal and infant outcomes, including adverse effects of treatment and costs.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register.

### Metformin in pregnancy and childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1117PKbB]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

This study aimed to examine the impact of maternal metformin use during pregnancy on offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science (Core Collection) were searched from inception until July 1, 2023.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Studies of women who received treatment with metformin at any stage of pregnancy for any indication with neurodevelopmental data available for their offspring were included. Studies without a control group were excluded. Randomized controlled trials, case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies were included in the review.

- **Methods**: Studies were screened for inclusion and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for nonrandomized studies, and the Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomized trials.

- **Results**: A total of seven studies met the inclusion criteria, including a combined cohort of 14,042 children with 7,641 children who were exposed and followed for up to 14 years of age. Metformin use during pregnancy was not associated with neurodevelopmental delay in infancy (relative risk, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–2.17; three studies; 9,668 children) or at ages 3 to 5 years (relative risk, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–1.45; two studies; 6,118 children). Compared with unexposed peers, metformin use during pregnancy was not associated with altered motor scores (mean difference, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, -1.15 to 1.74; three studies; 714 children) or cognitive scores (mean difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval).

### Glibenclamide, metformin, and insulin for the treatment of gestational diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1133zCST]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Oral agents are clearly more attractive than insulin to treat women with gestational diabetes, but attainment of similar or better results should be a prerequisite for their use. The results of the three meta-analyses presented here indicate that, in the short term at least, this is not the case for glibenclamide, which is associated with higher birth weight and more incidences of macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia. For metformin, results were better for maternal outcomes in terms of weight gain and pregnancy-induced hypertension, but uneven for fetal outcomes, resulting in more preterm births and less severe neonatal hypoglycemia. It is important to bear in mind, however, that metformin is associated with a higher rate of treatment failure and that its long-term safety remains unknown.

- **Future research considerations**:
	1. Meta-analyses of individual patient data would allow adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, especially important in the comparison of metformin with insulin.
	2. Although definite proof that glibenclamide produces more fetal hyperinsulinism is lacking, evidence discourages further trials using this drug.
	3. Studies addressing mechanisms underlying earlier delivery and less neonatal hypoglycemia in women treated with metformin would be of interest.

We conclude that, in the short term, for women with gestational diabetes requiring drug treatment, glibenclamide is clearly inferior to both insulin and metformin, while metformin (plus insulin when required) performs slightly better than insulin. According to these results, glibenclamide should not be used.

### Anti-diabetic drug utilization of pregnant diabetic women in US managed care [^112CCGBB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

In general, the use of insulin to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy is accepted and recommended as safe and effective in achieving normal blood glucose levels. There is also sufficient evidence to support that metformin is non-inferior to insulin with regards to neonatal safety, but comparative data regarding efficacy during pregnancy are lacking. Furthermore, the majority of metformin safety studies have been completed in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome or gestational diabetes, not in women with pre-existing diabetes, and have not evaluated pregnancy outcomes (pre-term labor, preeclampsia, cesarean section delivery) as safety endpoints.

The distinct increase in sulfonylurea use during pregnancy observed in this cohort was noteworthy in this context because this drug class is currently not recommended for this indication, including an FDA contraindication for use in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy. This notwithstanding, several studies have found no harmful effects and report good glycemic control with the use of sulfonylureas during pregnancy. Again, the majority of studies on the use of this drug class in pregnancy address use in gestational diabetic women and lack evidence on various aspects of safety and efficacy.

### Long-term effects of metformin on offspring health: A review of current evidence and future directions [^117DDPZL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

In summary, during pregnancy, hyperglycemia can lead to a range of complications, including polyhydramnios, preterm delivery, respiratory distress, neonatal hypoglycemia, macrosomia, and an increased risk of miscarriage. Treatment via lifestyle, metformin, and/or insulin therapy has been shown to ameliorate these risks and associated perinatal adverse outcomes. According to prospective clinical studies, as an anti-diabetic agent, metformin could offer important benefits for pregnancies complicated by hyperglycemia, with potential advantages of less patient and health professional burden and cost, and a lower risk of hypoglycemia and excess gestational weight gain compared with insulin.

Yet, in T2DM, PCOS, and GDM, potential benefits need to be offset against the risks of metformin use in pregnancy, which continue to be controversial in the context that it traverses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation. Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that women with GDM be offered metformin if glycemic targets are not met with diet and exercise within 1–2 weeks. Guidelines in Scotland and Canada recommend that metformin or glibenclamide be considered as initial treatments in GDM or as alternatives to insulin, but that women be informed of its transplacental passage, the lack of evidence on long-term safety, and the likelihood of metformin failure necessitating insulin initiation. Conversely, the American and Australian Diabetes Associations recommend insulin as the first-line treatment for GDM if lifestyle management fails.

### Long-term effects of metformin on offspring health: A review of current evidence and future directions [^1143TLcW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Metformin is widely prescribed for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, and gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnancy. Its use is driven by factors including oral administration, lower patient and health system burden and cost, and benefits such as a lower risk of excess gestational weight gain and hypoglycemia compared with insulin. Metformin use appears safe in pregnancy; however, there remain concerns regarding long-term effects of intrauterine metformin exposure on offspring health.

Randomized controlled trial follow-up studies suggest that metformin-exposed offspring may have altered postnatal growth trajectories and increased adiposity in childhood, although data are limited. Whether this is a transient adaptation or a precursor to long-term metabolic dysfunction is unclear, as data on cardiometabolic and neurodevelopmental parameters — including glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and cognitive function — are sparse and inconsistent. Methodological challenges include heterogeneous study designs, high attrition rates, and inadequate control for confounding variables.

Given these uncertainties, further well-powered, long-term prospective studies and individual patient data meta-analyses, harmonizing data and adjusting for confounders, are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of metformin use in pregnancy. Until such data are available, clinicians must weigh the benefits and advantages of metformin use in pregnancy against the unknowns regarding its potential long-term impact on offspring health.

### Association of long-term child growth and developmental outcomes with metformin vs insulin treatment for gestational diabetes [^1179dzFJ]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Metformin is an emerging option for treating gestational diabetes (GDM). However, because metformin crosses the placenta, patients and clinicians are concerned with its long-term effect on child health. The objective of this study is to estimate the association of treating GDM with metformin vs insulin in relation to child growth and development.

This research is a population-based cohort study of New Zealand women treated with metformin or insulin for GDM from 2005 to 2012 and their children. National health care data were linked to create a cohort of mothers and their children, drawing from maternity care, pharmaceutical dispensing, hospitalizations, demographic records, and the B4 School Check (B4SC) preschool health assessment. Women treated pharmacologically with metformin or insulin during pregnancy were included, excluding pregnancies with evidence of diabetes and deliveries prior to 2013. Liveborn infants were linked to their B4SC results, with data analyzed between January 2017 and May 2018.

- **Exposures**: Pharmacologic treatment for GDM with metformin or insulin, measured using pharmaceutical claims data.
- **Main outcomes and measures**: Child growth, assessed through weight and height, and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores for behavioral development. All outcomes were derived from the B4SC screening program. Linear and log-binomial regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to estimate the association of child growth and psychosocial outcomes with metformin vs insulin treatment for GDM.

### Immunomodulatory effects of metformin treatment in pregnant women with PCOS [^111PMLPv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

This is the first comprehensive assessment of how metformin treatment in pregnant women with PCOS affects maternal serum cytokines at different stages of pregnancy. Metformin induced robust immunological changes, reflected by a broad increase of multifunctional maternal serum cytokine levels throughout pregnancy in the metformin group compared with the placebo group. The most prominent changes involved an increase in the chemotactic protein eotaxin, the growth factor FGF-b, and the inflammatory cytokine IL-17. Instead of the hypothesized suppression of inflammatory cytokines, metformin treatment induced a mobilization of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The effect of metformin was BMI-dependent and strongest in women of normal weight or overweight at baseline. The gestational timing of the metformin effect differed between hyperandrogenic and normoandrogenic women; hyperandrogenic women had the most pronounced effect of metformin late in pregnancy.

Our study shows that metformin has a broad immunomodulatory effect during pregnancy that both exceeds and contradicts the anti-inflammatory properties described in previous studies. Because this is the first study of how metformin treatment affects a broad panel of serum cytokines throughout pregnancy in women with PCOS, comparable studies are scarce. The RCT EMPOWaR assigned women (n = 290) to metformin or placebo throughout pregnancy and found that metformin reduced the serum levels of CRP and IL-6, but in contrast to our study, all women were obese and only 10% had PCOS.

### Metformin compared with insulin in the treatment of pregnant women with overt diabetes: A randomized controlled trial [^115vGS7G]. American Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

To compare the safety and tolerability of metformin to insulin for glycemic control among women with preexisting type 2 and early A2 gestational diabetes, a study was conducted. Women with preexisting type 2 diabetes and those diagnosed with gestational diabetes who required medical management prior to 20 weeks were randomly assigned to metformin or insulin. Glycemic control, defined as more than 50% capillary blood glucose within the target range, was compared between groups. Other outcomes included patient tolerance, neonatal and obstetric complications, maternal weight gain, neonatal cord blood C-peptide, and patient satisfaction with therapy.

Twenty-eight women completed the study, with 14 in each group. Of the 15 women assigned to metformin, 100% continued to receive metformin until delivery, although 43% required supplemental insulin to achieve glycemic control. Glucose measures did not differ between the groups, and the proportion who met fasting and postprandial glycemic target values did not differ between the groups. Women treated with metformin had significantly fewer subjective episodes of hypoglycemia compared with those using insulin (0% versus 36%; p = 0.04) as well as reported glucose values less than 60 mg/dL (7.1% versus 50%; p = 0.03).

In conclusion, metformin should be considered for the treatment of overt diabetes and early A2 gestational diabetes in pregnancy.

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^115GjB6w]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Metformin is well-established as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in non-pregnant individuals. The low cost, acceptability, and broad tolerability of metformin have also made it an attractive option for research into the treatment of other conditions associated with insulin resistance. Despite almost 50 years of clinical experience with the use of metformin to treat diabetes in pregnancy, many questions remain regarding its precise effectiveness in different maternal subgroups, as well as potential short-term and long-term effects on the offspring.

In this narrative review, we present the evidence for the use of metformin during pregnancy in various maternal subgroups, including women living with overweight and obesity, women at risk of gestational diabetes, women diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and women with pregestational diabetes, including type 2 diabetes. Our specific focus is on the impact of metformin on short-term maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. We also consider the evidence for other emerging indications for metformin in pregnancy, such as the prevention and management of pre-eclampsia.

- **Plain language summary**: This article looks at research on how metformin use in pregnancy affects mothers and newborns in the short term. Doctors have prescribed metformin since the 1970s for the treatment of diabetes in pregnancy. Despite years of use, there are still questions about how safe and effective metformin is for mothers and their children. Metformin taken during pregnancy moves through the placenta into the fetus's bloodstream.

### Insulin use during gestational and pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy: A systematic review of study design [^1146HjSC]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Insulin is the first-line pharmacologic therapy for women with diabetes during pregnancy. However, conducting well-designed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and achieving recommended glycemic targets remain challenging for this unique population. This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to understand the evidence for insulin use in pregnancy and the outcome metrics most often used to characterize its effect on glycemic, maternal, and fetal outcomes in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pregnant women with diabetes.

- **Methods**: An SLR was conducted using electronic databases, including Medline and EMBASE via the Ovid platform, evidence-based medicine reviews (2010–2020), and conference proceedings (2018–2019). Studies were included if they assessed the effect of insulin treatment on glycemic, maternal, or fetal outcomes in women with diabetes during pregnancy. Studies on any type of diabetes other than gestational or pre-existing diabetes, as well as non-human studies, were excluded.

- **Results**: In women diagnosed with GDM or pre-existing diabetes, most studies compared insulin treatment with metformin (n = 35), followed by diet with lifestyle intervention (n = 24), and glibenclamide (n = 12). Most studies reporting on glycemic outcomes compared insulin with metformin (n = 22) and glibenclamide (n = 4). Fasting blood glucose was the most reported clinical outcome of interest. Among the studies reporting maternal outcomes, the method of delivery and delivery complications were most commonly reported. Large for gestational age, stillbirth, and perinatal mortality were the most common fetal outcomes reported.

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^111VhyiG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Other extensive meta-analyses have been conducted examining fertility and ovulation outcomes in PCOS. The most recent is a technical report informing the 2023 International PCOS Guideline, which included meta-analyses of 36 RCTs comparing metformin with placebo, CC, letrozole, and FSH. Metformin improved live birth, clinical pregnancy, and ovulation rates versus placebo. While metformin and CC were comparable for live birth, their combination outperformed CC alone in improving ovulation and live birth rates. Adding metformin to letrozole was superior to metformin plus CC, but not superior to letrozole alone, for clinical pregnancy and ovulation rates, although these findings were of low certainty due to high risk of bias. No benefit was seen for metformin plus FSH over FSH alone.

Earlier meta-analyses of 35 RCTs and 21 RCTs found similar results. One showed that metformin improved clinical pregnancy rates and reduced the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology compared with placebo or no treatment. The other reported that metformin modestly improved clinical pregnancy rates compared with placebo (47.7% vs. 42.9%) in non-obese women with PCOS, but had comparable efficacy to CC. While adding metformin to CC reduced miscarriage risk compared with placebo, it was associated with a higher miscarriage rate than CC alone and lower clinical and multiple pregnancy rates than letrozole. Additionally, a broader systematic review of 38 studies encompassing both pregnant and non-pregnant women highlighted the potential role of metformin.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116PM5dB]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the use of metformin PO (also known as Riomet) in pregnant patients across all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Insulin is the preferred first-line treatment for diabetes in pregnancy. The ACOG guidelines suggest metformin as a second-line choice for patients declining insulin or those unable to safely administer insulin. The American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend discontinuing metformin, when used to treat PCOS and induce ovulation, by the end of the first trimester. Metformin PO (also known as Riomet) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Metformin exposure in first trimester of pregnancy and risk of all or specific congenital anomalies: Exploratory case-control study [^113WEqnL]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

To investigate whether exposure to metformin during the first trimester of pregnancy, for diabetes or other indications, increases the risk of all or specific congenital anomalies, a population-based exploratory case-control study was conducted using malformed controls. Cases of 29 specific subgroups of non-genetic anomalies, and all non-genetic anomalies combined, were compared with controls, which included all other non-genetic anomalies or genetic syndromes.

This study was conducted across 11 EUROmediCAT European congenital anomaly registries, covering 1,892,482 births in Europe between 2006 and 2013. A total of 50,167 babies were affected by congenital anomalies, which included 41,242 non-genetic and 8,925 genetic anomalies. This group includes live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks' gestation, and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly.

- **Main outcome measure**: Odds ratios adjusted for maternal age, registry, multiple births, and maternal diabetes status.

The results indicated that 168 babies affected by congenital anomalies (141 non-genetic and 27 genetic) were exposed to metformin, accounting for 3.3 per 1,000 births. There was no evidence for a higher proportion of exposure to metformin during the first trimester among babies with all non-genetic anomalies combined, compared with genetic controls (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.30). The only significant finding was related to pulmonary valve atresia (adjusted odds ratio 3.54, 1.05 to 12.00, compared with non-genetic controls; 2.86, 0.79 to 10.30, compared with genetic controls).

In conclusion, no evidence was found for an increased risk of all non-genetic congenital anomalies combined following exposure to metformin during the first trimester of pregnancy.

### Effect of metformin in addition to dietary and lifestyle advice for pregnant women who are overweight or obese: The GRoW randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113oSpFQ]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Maternal overweight and obesity are associated with well-recognized pregnancy complications. Antenatal dietary and lifestyle interventions have a modest effect on gestational weight gain without affecting pregnancy outcomes. We aimed to assess the effects on maternal and infant outcomes of antenatal metformin given in addition to dietary and lifestyle advice among overweight and obese pregnant women.

- **Methods**: GRoW was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which pregnant women at 10–20 weeks' gestation with a BMI of 25 kg/m² or higher were recruited from three public maternity units in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. Women were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated schedule to receive either metformin (to a maximum dose of 2000 mg per day) or matching placebo. Participants, their antenatal care providers, and research staff (including outcome assessors) were masked to treatment allocation. All women received an antenatal dietary and lifestyle intervention. The primary outcome was the proportion of infants with birthweight greater than 4000 g. Secondary outcomes included measures of maternal weight gain, maternal diet and physical activity, maternal pregnancy and birth outcomes, maternal quality of life and emotional wellbeing, and infant birth outcomes. Outcomes were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (including all randomly assigned women who did not withdraw consent to use their data and who did not have a miscarriage or termination of pregnancy before 20 weeks' gestation, or a stillbirth).

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^1164XyaP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Overall, one can summarize that the results of trials of metformin in GDM prevention have been largely disappointing, and metformin is not currently recommended for GDM prevention. As most participants in prior studies were white, future work should include more diverse racial and ethnic populations, use double-blind, placebo-controlled study designs, and consider GDM prevention as a primary outcome.

- **Metformin for pregnancies affected by GDM**: GDM can be defined as glucose intolerance that develops during pregnancy in women without pre-existing diabetes. Worldwide, GDM is estimated to affect 14% of pregnancies, with the highest prevalence in the Middle East, North Africa, and South-East Asia, although prevalence rates vary according to the screening approaches and diagnostic criteria used.

Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia during GDM pregnancies independently increases the risk of Caesarean delivery and pre-eclampsia for the mother. For the neonate, there are increased risks of macrosomia, hypoglycaemia, hyperbilirubinemia, birth injury, preterm birth, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. Treatment of GDM with glucose-lowering therapy has been shown to mitigate many of these risks, though glycaemic treatment targets are debated.

Following lifestyle modification, some guidelines recommend insulin as the first-line treatment for GDM. The American Diabetes Association specifically does not recommend metformin as first-line treatment, citing concern.

### The use of glucose-lowering medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy in the United States [^116tdqKC]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Some guidelines allow for the use of either insulin or noninsulin antidiabetic agents for gestational diabetes, but only insulin is recommended for pregnant women with preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to document treatment patterns in routine care for women with preexisting T2DM.

We identified pregnancy cohorts within two US claims databases for publicly and privately insured individuals: the Medicaid Analytical eXtract (2000–2014) and OptumClinformatics (2004–2014). T2DM was classified with a validated algorithm using ICD‐9‐CM and CPT codes. We assessed medication usage over the years of the study, and changes in medication use before and after the beginning of pregnancy, using prescription fills as a proxy for the use of insulin, metformin, sulphonylureas, and other noninsulin antidiabetic agents before pregnancy and during each trimester.

Among 12,631 women with T2DM, insulin use in pregnancy was stable over the study years, with 55%–60% in the second trimester; however, second trimester use of metformin increased from less than 5% to 20%. Over the study period, 41% of women filled a prescription for metformin before pregnancy, 37% in the first trimester, and 17% in the second trimester. By the second trimester, few women used sulphonylureas (11%) or other noninsulin antidiabetic agents (1%). Of the women on metformin only before pregnancy, 36% switched to insulin only by the second trimester, 11% added insulin, and 16% continued on metformin only. Of the women on both metformin and insulin before pregnancy, 61% switched to insulin only by the second trimester.

### Pregnancy in women with type 2 diabetes: who takes metformin and what is the outcome [^115Zw8g8]. Diabetic Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The study aimed to review pregnancy outcomes in women with type 2 diabetes (Type 2 DM), comparing those treated with metformin to those not treated with the drug. Data were collected through case-note reviews for all pregnancies in women with Type 2 DM over a six-year period (1998–2003) at the National Women's Hospital. Of the 214 pregnancies included, metformin was taken in 93 pregnancies and continued until delivery in 32; the remaining 121 pregnancies formed the control group. The principal outcome measures were preeclampsia, perinatal loss, and neonatal morbidity.

- **Results**: Baseline characteristics differed between groups. Women in the metformin group had a greater mean (SD) body mass index [35.5 (7.6) vs. 33.5 (6.6) kg/m², P < 0.05], more chronic hypertension (19% vs. 7%, P < 0.05), and higher mean (SD) first trimester glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels [8.3 (1.9)% vs. 7.5 (1.7)%, P < 0.005]. No significant differences between the metformin and control groups were observed in the rate of preeclampsia (13% vs. 14%, P = 0.84), perinatal loss (3% vs. 2%, P = 0.65), or neonatal morbidity. This included the rate of prematurity (23% vs. 22%, P = 0.7), admission to the neonatal unit (40% vs. 48%, P = 0.27), respiratory distress (9% vs. 18%, P = 0.07), and treatment with intravenous dextrose (20% vs. 31%, P = 0.08).

- **Conclusions**: Pregnant women with Type 2 DM treated with metformin had more risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, yet no differences in the outcomes were observed compared to women not taking metformin. Randomized trials are needed to address the potential benefits of metformin treatment.

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^1129nhVn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The aim of this article is to review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of metformin in the various subgroups of pregnant women in which it has been studied, specifically women living with overweight and obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM). Other emerging indications for metformin in pregnancy are also considered. This review focuses on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes only; the longer-term effects on maternal offspring are considered in a separate article in this special supplement.

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^115qJfVR]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Metformin use in different maternal subgroups**: Rates of obesity are increasing worldwide, and women of childbearing age are at particular risk of obesity and weight gain. Maternal obesity is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, childhood obesity, and impacts on the long-term cardiometabolic health of offspring. While these adverse outcomes occur in obesity independent of glucose intolerance, obesity further increases the risk of pregnancy complications in women with GDM.

- **Metformin for non-diabetic pregnant women living with overweight or obesity**: A summary of randomized and observational studies is detailed in Table 1. Metformin has been evaluated at doses between 1000 and 3000 mg/day for its potential to impact gestational weight gain (GWG), limit fetal overgrowth, and reduce the rates of GDM in women living with obesity.

		- **Reduced maternal weight gain**: Reduced maternal weight gain has been found in some, but not all, studies. Some but not all of these differences may be explained by differences in the ethnicity of participants, mean body mass index (BMI) at randomization, and dose of metformin. Systematic reviews evaluating GWG have reported high rates of heterogeneity; however, metformin appears to reduce GWG by 1.49–2.93 kg.

		- **Hypertensive disorders**: Two studies found a reduction in the rates of hypertensive disorders, and this is further discussed in Section 4.7.1.

- **Fetal outcomes**: Metformin does not impact fetal overgrowth or size in studies at the time of writing. No increase in the rates of small for gestational age (SGA) deliveries has been observed.

### Metformin and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women with gestational diabetes in the United Kingdom: A population-based cohort study [^116Dpyhc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Metformin is increasingly used off-label as the treatment of gestational diabetes (GDM). Our objective was to determine if metformin versus insulin initiation is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, its pregnancy register, and Hospital Episode Statistics from 1998 to 2018. We included pregnancies of women who initiated metformin or insulin between 20 weeks gestation and pregnancy end. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of large for gestational age (LGA) and macrosomia. Secondary outcomes included small for gestational age (SGA), preterm birth, caesarean delivery, and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (HDP). Inverse probability weighted-Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing those who initiated metformin versus insulin at cohort entry, accounting for baseline covariates.

Our cohort included pregnancies of 1,297 women initiating metformin and 895 women initiating insulin. Compared to insulin initiation, metformin initiation was associated with a decreased risk of LGA or macrosomia (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49, 0.78), caesarean delivery (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69, 0.98), and preterm birth (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.58, 1.08). The HRs for HDP and SGA were 0.92 (95% CI 0.57, 1.27) and 1.33 (95% CI 0.67, 2.00), respectively.

Our study suggests that, compared to initiating insulin, initiating metformin is associated with decreased risks of LGA or macrosomia, caesarean delivery, and preterm birth. Further investigation is needed to understand its full impact on SGA and HDP.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112Rm8po]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, particularly concerning oral hypoglycemics, the ES 2013 guidelines recommend considering metformin for glycemic control in patients with gestational diabetes who meet the following criteria:

- **Inadequate glycemic control** despite medical nutrition therapy.
- **Refusal of insulin therapy** or inability to use insulin.
- **Pregnancy stage** in the second or third trimester.

### Metformin use in the first trimester of pregnancy and risk for nonlive birth and congenital malformations: Emulating a target trial using real-world data [^113ULwyE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Metformin is a first-line pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes, but there is limited evidence about its safety in early pregnancy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the teratogenicity of metformin use in the first trimester of pregnancy.

In an observational cohort of pregnant women with pregestational type 2 diabetes receiving metformin monotherapy before the last menstrual period (LMP), a target trial with two treatment strategies was emulated: insulin monotherapy (discontinuing metformin treatment and initiating insulin within 90 days of LMP) or insulin plus metformin (continuing metformin and initiating insulin within 90 days of LMP). The study was set using the U.S. Medicaid healthcare administration database, covering the years 2000 to 2018, and included 12,489 pregnant women who met the eligibility criteria.

The risk and risk ratio of nonlive births, live births with congenital malformations, and congenital malformations among live births were estimated using standardization to adjust for covariates. Results indicated that a total of 850 women were in the insulin monotherapy group, and 1,557 were in the insulin plus metformin group. The estimated risk for nonlive birth was 32.7% under insulin monotherapy (reference) and 34.3% under insulin plus metformin (risk ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.04]). The estimated risk for live birth with congenital malformations was 8.0% (CI, 5.7% to 10.2%) under insulin monotherapy and 5.7% (CI, 4.5% to 7.3%) under insulin plus metformin (risk ratio, 0.72 [CI, 0.51 to 1.09]).

A limitation of the study is the possible residual confounding by glycemic control and body mass index.

### Insulin use during gestational and pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy: A systematic review of study design [^116na7N2]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

Insulin is the first-line pharmacologic therapy for women with diabetes during pregnancy. However, conducting well-designed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and achieving recommended glycemic targets remains a challenge for this unique population. This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to understand the evidence for insulin use in pregnancy and the outcome metrics most often used to characterize its effect on glycemic, maternal, and fetal outcomes in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and in pregnant women with diabetes.

- **Methods**: An SLR was conducted using electronic databases in Medline, EMBASE via the Ovid platform, evidence-based medicine reviews (2010–2020), and conference proceedings (2018–2019). Studies were included if they assessed the effect of insulin treatment on glycemic, maternal, or fetal outcomes in women with diabetes during pregnancy. Studies on any type of diabetes other than gestational or pre-existing diabetes, as well as non-human studies, were excluded.

- **Results**: In women diagnosed with GDM or pre-existing diabetes, most studies compared the treatment of insulin with metformin (n = 35), followed by diet along with lifestyle intervention (n = 24) and glibenclamide (n = 12). Most studies reporting on glycemic outcomes compared insulin with metformin (n = 22) and glibenclamide (n = 4). Fasting blood glucose was the most reported clinical outcome of interest. Among the studies reporting maternal outcomes, the method of delivery and delivery complications were most commonly reported. Large for gestational age, stillbirth, and perinatal mortality were the most frequently noted outcomes.

### Effect of pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics of metformin [^114GWYBv]. Diabetic Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

To determine the effects of pregnancy on metformin pharmacokinetics, seven women with Type 2 diabetes mellitus taking metformin throughout pregnancy were studied on two occasions: once at 28–36 weeks gestation and once at least 8 weeks postpartum. Serum metformin concentrations were determined across a dosing interval using high-performance liquid chromatography. The areas under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 hours post-dose (AUC0–4) and 0 to 8 hours post-dose (AUC0–8), where possible, were compared in the pregnant and non-pregnant state.

Metformin concentrations were lower in pregnancy in six subjects, with a mean (95% CI) AUC0–4 that was 69% (53.6, 84.8) of the postpartum value. The AUC0–4 of one subject was higher in pregnancy at 142% of the postpartum value. Overall, the mean (95% CI) AUC0–4 during pregnancy for all seven subjects was 80% (51.3, 107.8) of the postpartum value (P = 0.053, two-tailed t-test; P = 0.027, one-tailed t-test).

These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the clearance of metformin increases in pregnancy as a result of enhanced renal elimination. A larger study is required to establish whether metformin dose adjustments are necessary in late pregnancy to maintain therapeutic effect.

### Metformin for gestational diabetes in routine clinical practice [^1123Jv2x]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with gestational diabetes treated with diet, metformin, and/or insulin in routine clinical practice at a single center.

- **Methods**: We analyzed prospectively collected data from the National Women's Health database for all women with gestational diabetes who delivered between January 2007 and December 2009. Since June 2007, women requiring medication have been given a choice of either metformin or insulin treatment, except women with a fetal abdominal circumference less than the 10th percentile, who were not offered metformin.

- **Results**: There were 1269 women with gestational diabetes; treatment was diet in 371, insulin in 399, and metformin in 465 (249 metformin alone, 216 metformin and insulin). Women treated with metformin and/or insulin had significantly higher BMIs compared with those in the diet group (P < 0.001) and had a higher fasting glucose at diagnosis (P < 0.001). Women treated with insulin had higher rates of Caesarean delivery (45.6% insulin, 37% metformin, 34% diet, P = 0.02) than women treated with metformin or diet. They also had higher rates of preterm births (19.2% insulin, 12.5% metformin, 12.1% diet, P = 0.005), customized large-for-gestational-age infants (18.5% insulin, 12.5% metformin, 12.4% diet, P = 0.02), neonatal admissions (18.7% insulin, 12.7% metformin, 14.0% diet, P = 0.04), and neonatal intravenous dextrose use (11.1% insulin, 5.1% metformin, 7.4% diet, P = 0.004). Neonatal outcomes were similar between diet- and metformin-treated women.

The study concluded that in routine practice, the use of metformin in women with gestational diabetes shows comparable neonatal outcomes to dietary treatment, with the potential for differing maternal outcome measures.

### Metformin exposure in first trimester of pregnancy and risk of all or specific congenital anomalies: Exploratory case-control study [^111Ehh3D]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

We found no evidence of an overall increased risk of all major congenital anomalies combined after exposure to metformin during the first trimester. Given the rise in exposure to metformin during pregnancy, our findings are particularly timely. Our large international, population-based database, with 168 cases of congenital anomaly exposed to metformin from an estimated 6,245 exposed pregnancies in Europe, represents more than five times the number of metformin exposures previously available in the literature.

Exposure to metformin during the study period remained rare; just over three in every 1,000 babies affected by congenital anomaly were exposed to metformin in the first trimester, with considerable variation in the prevalence of metformin use across registries. Similar variation was evident across Europe in a study that used prescription redemption records. The variation in the prescription of metformin between regions could be due to several factors — differences in the prevalence of pregestational diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, and infertility; the diagnostic criteria used for polycystic ovary syndrome; and the criteria for prescription of metformin for the different indications.

The prevalence of exposure to metformin during pregnancy would be expected to be higher because of the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes. In keeping with the shared pathophysiological basis of the conditions for which metformin is indicated, some women had more than one indication for its use, also evidenced elsewhere.

Our results are reassuring regarding the risk of all major congenital anomalies combined with metformin exposure.

### Metformin, pre-eclampsia, and pregnancy outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^114sELUm]. Diabetic Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The study investigated whether metformin use during pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was associated with pre-eclampsia and assessed its safety for both mother and neonate.

- **Methods**: Pre-eclampsia and other pregnancy outcomes were prospectively studied in 90 women with PCOS who conceived on metformin (1.5–2.55 g/day) and had at least one live birth (97 pregnancies, 100 live births). These outcomes were compared with 252 healthy women (without known PCOS) with at least one live birth, consecutively delivered in a community obstetrics practice.

- **Results**: Women with PCOS were older than the control group (33 ± 5 years vs. 29 ± 6 years, P < 0.05) and a higher proportion of them were over 35 years old at conception (23% vs. 13%, P = 0.028). Additionally, women with PCOS were significantly heavier (93 ± 23 kg vs. 72 ± 18 kg, P < 0.05). The birth weights of neonates born at or after 37 weeks gestation in women with PCOS (3414 ± 486 g) did not significantly differ from those of the control group (3481 ± 555 g), P = 0.34.

### Metformin exposure in first trimester of pregnancy and risk of all or specific congenital anomalies: Exploratory case-control study [^1144v9DN]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

To investigate whether exposure to metformin during the first trimester of pregnancy, for diabetes or other indications, increases the risk of all or specific congenital anomalies, a population-based exploratory case-control study was conducted using malformed controls. Cases of 29 specific subgroups of non-genetic anomalies, and all non-genetic anomalies combined, were compared with controls (all other non-genetic anomalies or genetic syndromes).

The study was set across 11 EUROmediCAT European congenital anomaly registries, surveying 1,892,482 births in Europe between 2006 and 2013. Participants included 50,167 babies affected by congenital anomalies (41,242 non-genetic and 8,925 genetic), including live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks' gestation, and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly.

The main outcome measures were odds ratios adjusted for maternal age, registry, multiple births, and maternal diabetes status. Results showed that 168 babies affected by congenital anomalies (141 non-genetic and 27 genetic) were exposed to metformin, which is 3.3 per 1000 births. No evidence was found for a higher proportion of exposure to metformin during the first trimester among babies with all non-genetic anomalies combined compared with genetic controls (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.30). The only significant result was for pulmonary valve atresia (adjusted odds ratio 3.54, 1.05 to 12.00, compared with non-genetic controls; 2.86, 0.79 to 10.30, compared with genetic controls).

No evidence was found for an increased risk of all non-genetic congenital anomalies combined following exposure to metformin during the first trimester.

### JanumetXR [^113taBdf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Published data from post-marketing studies do not report a clear association between metformin use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any risk due to methodological limitations, including small sample sizes and inconsistent comparator groups.

- **Animal data**:
	- **Sitagliptin and metformin**: No animal reproduction studies were conducted with the coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin.
	- **Sitagliptin**: In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits.
	- Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in the offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg.
	- **Metformin**: Metformin did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2- and 6-times a 2000 mg clinical dose based on b.

### Postnatal cardiometabolic health after metformin use in gestational diabetes: A secondary analysis of the EMERGE trial [^1169Exe5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) display adverse lifetime cardiometabolic health. The study examined whether early metformin use in GDM could impact cardiometabolic risk factors postpartum. EMERGE, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, randomized pregnancies 1:1 to placebo or metformin at GDM diagnosis and followed participants from randomization until 12 ± 4 weeks postpartum. In total, 478 pregnancies were available for postpartum maternal assessment, with 237 and 241 assigned to metformin and placebo, respectively.

- **Methods**: Weight (kg), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m²), waist circumference (cm), and blood pressure (mmHg) were measured. Infant feeding method was documented, and blood specimens were drawn for a 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test, fasting insulin, C-peptide, and lipid analysis.

- **Results**: Despite similar weight and BMI at trial randomization, participants receiving metformin had significantly lower weight (79.5 ± 15.9 vs. 82.6 ± 16.9 kg; p = 0.04) and BMI (29.3 [5.6] vs. 30.5 [5.4]; p = 0.018) at the postpartum visit. However, no difference in weight change from randomization to 12 weeks postpartum was observed between metformin and placebo groups. Overall, 29% (n = 139) of the cohort met criteria for prediabetes or diabetes, with no positive impact from metformin. There were also no differences in measurements of insulin resistance, blood pressure, or lipids between groups.

- **Conclusion**: Early metformin use in GDM did not impact important cardiometabolic parameters in the early postpartum period despite significant benefits in weight gain and insulin use during pregnancy.

### Association of pregnancy outcomes in women with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin versus insulin when becoming pregnant [^11129NER]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

This investigation is the first nationwide population-based cohort study to assess the effects of different glucose-lowering regimens in women with preexisting type 2 diabetes on becoming pregnant. Our data demonstrate that metformin treatment is not associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with standard insulin treatment, whether continuing with metformin therapy or switching from metformin to insulin.

Our results show that many women with preexisting type 2 diabetes received metformin treatment during pregnancy. The popularity of metformin use during pregnancy in this study might result from the ease of use of this oral agent, the emergence of promising safety profiles for metformin use in pregnancy, and needle phobia. The rising cost of insulin is one of the reasons supporting the use of metformin as an alternative to insulin during pregnancy. However, the National Health Insurance (NHI) provides reimbursements for insulin, and insulin is inexpensive in Taiwan; therefore, affordability may not account for the frequent use of metformin in this study.

Our data reveal that metformin treatment did not increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The safety of metformin use during pregnancy has been demonstrated in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In the largest study of women with GDM (n = 751) randomized to metformin or insulin treatment at 20–33 weeks of gestation, comparable pregnancy outcomes were observed between the two arms. A follow-up study of their offspring reported that metformin-exposed children in the New Zealand cohort were larger at 7–9 years old.

### The use of glucose-lowering medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy in the United States [^116LNRAe]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

There are several possible explanations for the observed increase in metformin use during pregnancy. First, as many pregnancies are unplanned, changes to pre-pregnancy medication regimens often occur during pregnancy. Metformin and newer non-insulin drugs are established treatments in the non-pregnant T2DM population, and late recognition of pregnancy or lack of preconception counseling may lead to the continuation of these medications into pregnancy. Consistent with this hypothesis, transitions to guideline-recommended treatment are not occurring before pregnancy for many women in our study, which may result in first trimester fetal exposure to medications with unknown safety profiles and/or suboptimal glycemic control in early pregnancy.

Second, because women with T2DM often have insulin resistance that worsens during pregnancy, they may require high doses of insulin to achieve euglycemia. The possibility that metformin in combination with insulin may help pregnant women with T2DM achieve glycemic control without high doses of insulin has been embraced by many clinicians and is the subject of two randomized trials. The MiTy trial evaluated the addition of metformin to a standard insulin regimen among pregnant women with T2DM enrolled between 6 and 20 weeks of gestation and found no differences in neonatal mortality or serious morbidity. There was a significant benefit in the metformin group for glycemic control, lower insulin requirements, less gestational weight gain, and fewer caesarean births; infants in the metformin group weighed less, which resulted in both fewer infants born…

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^116MewuJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Metformin and the risk of congenital malformations.

Decades of clinical experience with metformin use during pregnancy have not yielded concerns regarding an increased risk of congenital malformations. This is supported by limited data from observational studies.

In 2018, Given et al. conducted a case-control study using data from European registries, including 50,167 infants with congenital anomalies, 168 of whom had been exposed to metformin during the first trimester. The authors found no evidence of an overall increased risk of all major congenital anomalies combined but did note an association between metformin use and the risk of pulmonary valve atresia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–12.00, compared with non-genetic controls). However, the authors concluded that this finding was no more than would be expected by chance.

In 2023, Abolhassani et al. published a systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk of major congenital malformations following first-trimester exposure to metformin in women with PCOS or PGDM. The point estimates for the rates of major congenital malformations in metformin-exposed women with PCOS were not significant in either randomized controlled trials (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.09 to 9.21; I² = 0%) or observational studies (OR 1.35; 95% CI 0.37 to 4.90; I² = 65%). Similarly, the observational studies included in their meta-analysis did not demonstrate an increased rate of major congenital malformations in metformin-exposed women with PGDM (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.18; I² = 59%). However, the authors noted…

### Metformin for pregnancy and beyond: The pros and cons [^111MSsEA]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Metformin has been used in pregnancy since the 1970s. It is cheap, widely available, and acceptable to women. Despite its increasing use, controversy remains surrounding its benefits and risks. Metformin effectively reduces hyperglycemia for the mother during pregnancy, and it reduces rates of macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia. However, concern exists regarding an increase in the rate of small for gestational age (SGA) births and obesity in childhood. This paper aims to review the evidence and expert opinion behind metformin use in pregnancy through to the postpartum period.

- **Methods**: We performed a literature review of relevant studies from online databases using a combination of keywords. We also searched the references of retrieved articles for pertinent studies.

- **Results**: There is strong evidence that metformin is safe in early pregnancy with no risk of congenital malformations. If used throughout pregnancy, it is likely to lead to reduced maternal weight gain and reduced insulin dosage in women with type 2 diabetes. In infants, metformin reduces hypoglycemia and macrosomia but may increase the rate of infants born SGA. There is some evidence of an increased risk of obesity and altered fat distribution in offspring. Metformin appears well tolerated in pregnancy and is more acceptable to women than insulin therapy.

- **Conclusion**: Due to increasing rates of maternal obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and type 2 diabetes, metformin use in pregnancy is increasing. Overall, it appears safe and effective, but further research is needed to examine mechanisms linking metformin to obesity reported during childhood.

### Kombiglyze XR [^117AC9nj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Limited available data on Kombiglyze XR or saxagliptin in pregnant women are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published trials with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [see Data]. No adverse developmental effects independent of maternal toxicity were observed when saxagliptin and metformin were administered separately or in combination to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c greater than 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with an HbA1c greater than 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations: Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases maternal risks for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes also increases fetal risks for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.

- **Data: Animal data - Saxagliptin**: In embryo-fetal development studies, saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis.

### Metformin versus placebo in obese pregnant women without diabetes mellitus [^1129Y4R1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Obesity is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Lifestyle-intervention studies have not shown improved outcomes. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity and, in pregnant patients with gestational diabetes, it leads to less weight gain than occurs in those who do not take metformin.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned pregnant women without diabetes who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of more than 35 to receive metformin, at a dose of 3.0 g per day, or placebo (225 women in each group) from 12 to 18 weeks of gestation until delivery. The BMI was calculated at the time of study entry (12 to 18 weeks of gestation). The primary outcome was a reduction in the median neonatal birth-weight z score by 0.3 SD (equivalent to a 50% reduction, from 20% to 10%, in the incidence of large-for-gestational-age neonates). Secondary outcomes included maternal gestational weight gain and the incidence of gestational diabetes and of preeclampsia, as well as the incidence of adverse neonatal outcomes. Randomization was performed with the use of computer-generated random numbers. The analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

- **Results**: A total of 50 women withdrew consent during the trial, which left 202 women in the metformin group and 198 in the placebo group. There was no significant between-group difference in the median neonatal birth-weight z score (0.05 in the metformin group [interquartile range, -0.71 to 0.92]).

### Alogliptin and metformin hydrochloride [^111vtiWb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Limited available data on alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets or alogliptin in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association between metformin and the risk of major birth defects or miscarriage [see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].

Concomitant administration of alogliptin and metformin in pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects in offspring at maternal exposures up to 28 times and two times the 25 mg and 2000 mg clinical doses, respectively [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6–10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus with a HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20–25% in women with an HbA1c > 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. It also increases the fetal risk for major malformations and stillbirth.

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^112qSUK9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Metformin is well-established as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in non-pregnant individuals. The low cost, acceptability, and broad tolerability of metformin have also made it an attractive option for research into the treatment of other conditions associated with insulin resistance. Despite almost 50 years of clinical experience with the use of metformin to treat diabetes in pregnancy, many questions remain regarding its precise effectiveness in different maternal subgroups, as well as potential short-term and long-term effects on the offspring.

In this narrative review, we present the evidence for the use of metformin during pregnancy in various maternal subgroups, including women living with overweight and obesity, women at risk of gestational diabetes, women diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and women with pregestational diabetes, including type 2 diabetes. Our specific focus is on the impact of metformin on short-term maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. We also consider the evidence for other emerging indications for metformin in pregnancy, such as the prevention and management of pre-eclampsia.

This article examines research on how metformin use in pregnancy affects mothers and newborns in the short term. Doctors have prescribed metformin since the 1970s for the treatment of diabetes in pregnancy. Despite years of use, there are still questions about how safe and effective metformin is for mothers and their children. Metformin taken during pregnancy moves through the placenta into the foetus's bloodstream.

### Use of antidiabetic drugs during pregnancy among U.S. women with livebirth deliveries in the Mini-Sentinel system [^116TA8nM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

There is a need for ongoing routine surveillance of medication use during pregnancy, as new drugs become available and prescribing trends and recommendations change. Up to 9% of pregnant women have pre-existing diabetes mellitus or develop gestational diabetes, which may require drug therapy. The prevalence of gestational diabetes has been increasing over the last two decades. Unmanaged diabetes in pregnancy, leading to hyperglycemia, is associated with excess risk of macrosomia, stillbirths, and other neonatal complications.

The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Practice Bulletin #30 in 2001 recommended adding insulin if glycemic control could not be achieved with nutritional therapy alone for women with gestational diabetes. Several randomized controlled trials and observational studies, which compared glyburide to insulin for gestational diabetes, showed the two therapies to be comparable in achieving glycemic control. In 2013, the ACOG guidelines were revised (Practice Bulletin #137) to state that insulin and oral ADDs (e.g. glyburide and metformin) are equally efficacious and could be considered for first-line therapy. The use of glyburide increased during this time period. The American Diabetes Association guidelines (2015) list insulin and metformin as preferred treatments and state that glyburide may be used, but may have a higher rate of neonatal hypoglycemia and macrosomia.

For women with pre-existing diabetes who become pregnant, an ACOG Practice Bulletin (#60) in 2005 and a consensus statement by the American Diabetes…

### Paternal use of metformin during the sperm development period preceding conception and risk for major congenital malformations in newborns [^117Bfmeb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Metformin is the most used oral antidiabetic medication. Despite its established safety profile, it has known antiandrogenic and epigenetic modifying effects, raising concerns about possible adverse developmental effects caused by genomic alterations related to paternal use of metformin during the spermatogenesis period preceding conception.

- **Objective**: To assess the potential adverse intergenerational effect of metformin by examining the association between paternal metformin use during spermatogenesis and major congenital malformations (MCMs) in newborns.

- **Design**: Nationally representative cohort study.

- **Setting**: A large Israeli health fund.

- **Participants**: 383,851 live births linked to fathers and mothers that occurred from 1999 to 2020.

- **Measurements**: MCMs and parental cardiometabolic conditions were ascertained using clinical diagnoses, medication dispensing information, and laboratory test results. The effect of metformin use on MCMs was estimated using general estimating equations, accounting for the use of other antidiabetic medications and parental cardiometabolic morbidity.

- **Results**: Compared with unexposed fathers, the prevalence of cardiometabolic morbidity was substantially higher among fathers who used metformin during spermatogenesis, as well as among their spouses. Whereas the crude odds ratio (OR) for paternal metformin exposure in all formulations and MCMs was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.64), the adjusted OR was 1.00 (CI, 0.76 to 1.31). Within specific treatment regimens, the adjusted OR was 0.86 (CI, 0.60 to 1.23) for metformin in monotherapy.

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^115GhUfy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Other, smaller clinical trials have studied the short-term efficacy and safety of metformin versus insulin in GDM pregnancies. Most have demonstrated a reduction in GWG with metformin use. Some have mirrored the EMERGE findings of lower mean birthweights and fewer LGA infants in the metformin groups. No other studies have replicated the increased preterm birth risk seen in the MiG trial. Comparisons between these studies are limited by the heterogeneity in inclusion criteria, ethnicities, GDM diagnostic criteria, treatment targets, and outcome measures in each study. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses continue to be published regularly in this area, though none have yet incorporated the results from the EMERGE or SUGAR-DIP trials. A summary of recently published systematic reviews and meta-analyses was previously given in a table by Newman et al.

The term PGDM refers to diabetes in pregnancy that existed prior to conception. The main type of PGDM encountered in clinical practice is T2DM, with fewer living with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or rarer forms of diabetes such as monogenic diabetes. The prevalence of PGDM, and particularly T2DM, has increased substantially in recent decades among women of childbearing age. Tight glycaemic management before and during pregnancy is required to mitigate the associated risks of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^114rasyG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The EMERGE (Early Metformin in Addition to Usual Care in the Reduction of Gestational Diabetes Effects) trial results were published by Dunne et al. in 2023. EMERGE was the first double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to examine the efficacy and safety of early metformin use from the time of GDM diagnosis. The study authors randomized 535 pregnancies diagnosed with GDM (using WHO 2013 criteria) before 28 + 6 weeks' gestation in a 1:1 ratio to either metformin (2500 mg) or placebo, in addition to usual care.

The primary outcome was a composite efficacy outcome of insulin initiation or a fasting glucose level ≥ 5.1 mmol/L (91.8 mg/dL) at gestational weeks 32 or 38. The primary outcome was not significantly different between the metformin group and the placebo group (56.8% vs. 63.7%; relative risk 0.89; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02; p = 0.13).

- **Secondary analysis**: Demonstrated a lower requirement for insulin initiation in the metformin group compared with the placebo group (38.4% vs. 51.1%; RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.91; p = 0.004). Women in the metformin group experienced less gestational weight gain on average (0.8 vs. 2.0 kg; difference −1.2 kg; 95% CI −1.99 to −0.42; p = 0.003), but there was no difference in weight loss at the 12-week post-partum visit.

- **Infant outcomes**: There was no significant difference in the proportion of preterm births between the two groups. Infants in the metformin group had lower mean birthweights (3.393 vs. 3.506 kg; difference −113 g; 95% CI −201 to −24; p = 0.005). There were fewer cases of macrosomia (7.6% vs. 14.8%; difference −7.2%; 95% CI −12.6% to −1.8%; p = 0.02) and large for gestational age (LGA) babies.

### Effects of metformin on early pregnancy loss in the polycystic ovary syndrome [^111YWNcG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common form of female infertility in the United States. In addition to poor conception rates, pregnancy loss rates are high (30–50%) during the first trimester. We hypothesized that hyperinsulinemic insulin resistance contributes to early pregnancy loss in the syndrome and that decreasing hyperinsulinemic insulin resistance with metformin during pregnancy would reduce the rate of early pregnancy loss.

We conducted a retrospective study of all women with PCOS who were seen in an academic endocrinology clinic within the past 4.5 years and who became pregnant during that time. Sixty-five women received metformin during pregnancy (metformin group) and 31 women did not (control group). The early pregnancy loss rate in the metformin group was 8.8% (6 of 68 pregnancies), compared to 41.9% (13 of 31 pregnancies) in the control group (P < 0.001). In the subset of women in each group with a prior history of miscarriage, the early pregnancy loss rate was 11.1% (4 of 36 pregnancies) in the metformin group, compared to 58.3% (7 of 12 pregnancies) in the control group (P = 0.002).

Metformin administration during pregnancy reduces first-trimester pregnancy loss in women with PCOS.

### A narrative review of metformin in pregnancy: Navigating benefit and uncertainty [^1118dgzw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide that has been in therapeutic use since the 1950s. It is widely considered to be a cheap, safe, and effective glucose-lowering treatment and is frequently used in non-pregnant adults with diabetes. Research interest in metformin has surged in recent years due to its therapeutic potential in other insulin-resistant states such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), pre-diabetes, and gestational diabetes (GDM). Diverse investigational uses have been proposed in cancer prevention, Alzheimer's disease, and healthy aging.

Although metformin has been used to treat diabetes in pregnancy since the 1970s, its use remains controversial. It is noteworthy that metformin bioavailability, volume of distribution, and clearance are increased during pregnancy, and there is a lack of guidance on the optimal dosing strategy throughout pregnancy. Metformin has been shown to cross the human placenta, with fetal serum concentrations equivalent to or higher than maternal serum concentrations. Mouse models identify organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) as key to fetal metformin uptake and distribution. Placental expression of this transporter increases with gestational age, implying that peak fetal exposure may occur in later gestation. However, while metformin use has not been observed to increase the risk of major congenital malformations, safety concerns have been raised regarding potential long‐term impacts on offspring, outside of the neonatal period.

Several potential mechanisms for fetal harm from metformin have been proposed. Activated AMPK signalling and inhibited pathways are under investigation.
