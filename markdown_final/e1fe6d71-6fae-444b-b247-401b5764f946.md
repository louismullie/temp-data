## Question

Assessments for bowel obstruction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the assessment of suspected bowel obstruction, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and red flags. Then, I should verify the role and limitations of laboratory tests. Next, I will review imaging strategy, starting with the debate over plain radiographs, followed by CT, ultrasound, MRI, and water-soluble contrast studies. After that, I need to integrate imaging with decision-making about surgery versus nonoperative care. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check conflicting guidance and reconcile it with the best available evidence [^11769Xvp] [^112GH4fd] [^114oJRNW].

> Let me first confirm the clinical foundation: history, exam, and vitals are the starting point, and I should not jump to conclusions before establishing pretest probability. Classic features include colicky abdominal pain, distension, nausea/vomiting, and obstipation, with prior abdominal surgery strongly predictive of adhesive SBO; however, I need to remember that elderly patients may have atypical or muted pain, and that watery diarrhea can mislead toward gastroenteritis in partial obstruction, so I should verify these nuances carefully [^112NJPGt] [^114vy2ZH]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about bowel sounds; I initially thought they were a reliable sign, but wait, interobserver variability is high and auscultation has limited diagnostic value, so I should not rely on it to decide management [^116H6RB9]. I should also screen for strangulation: fever, tachycardia, hypotension, continuous pain, peritonitis, metabolic acidosis, and rising lactate are red flags that lower my threshold for urgent surgery [^111t77Y3] [^111jwYqH].

> Next, I should review the laboratory workup and confirm what actually changes management. I need to check CBC, electrolytes, renal function, and lactate, and consider coagulation if surgery is possible; these help detect dehydration, electrolyte derangements, and ischemia, but I should verify that no single lab predicts strangulation reliably, even though elevated lactate, leukocytosis, and metabolic acidosis raise concern and should trigger escalation [^112GH4fd] [^114K9YdH]. Wait, let me verify the prognostic value of biomarkers; recent meta-analyses suggest NLR, CRP, PCT, D-dimer, and lactate have limited standalone accuracy for ischemia or need for surgery, so I should treat them as adjuncts rather than definitive tests [^112ZUNW3] [^117GVT3D].

> Now, imaging — this is where I need to be careful because guidance conflicts. Historically, many taught that supine and erect abdominal radiographs are the first step; I initially thought that too, but hold on, I should verify current recommendations. The WSES 2017–2018 updates advise against routine abdominal X-rays due to low sensitivity/specificity and limited impact on management, whereas older WSES guidance endorsed plain films as first-line; reconciling this, contemporary practice favors skipping routine plain films and proceeding directly to CT when available, reserving X-rays for resource-limited settings or when CT is unavailable [^114wNzTP] [^116ws9Fc] [^115wdLS4]. I should double-check that this aligns with emergency medicine and radiology guidance; yes, modern ED-focused reviews and ACR criteria support CT as the preferred modality because it answers the key management questions and changes decisions more reliably than plain films [^111jwYqH] [^116wWtZ6].

> CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is the cornerstone when obstruction is suspected; I need to ensure I order it with appropriate technique and interpretation goals. CT can confirm obstruction, localize the transition point, identify the cause (e.g., adhesion, hernia, mass, volvulus, intussusception), grade severity, and detect complications such as closed-loop obstruction, ischemia, or perforation; sensitivity and specificity for SBO are high, and CT features like closed loop, mesenteric congestion, and free fluid correlate with urgent surgery [^116qZheG] [^112mRChz]. Wait, I should verify the role of oral contrast; positive oral contrast is not required and may delay care, but water-soluble contrast via NG tube can be used selectively to assess progress and has prognostic value in nonoperative management, with a 24-hour abdominal X-ray to document contrast reaching the colon indicating resolution likelihood [^116qE3dr] [^114PmQXv] [^116U7Dsr]. I should also remember that CT can miss low-grade or intermittent obstruction, in which case CT enterography or enteroclysis may be needed if suspicion remains high [^111JHrY1].

> But wait, what if I want to avoid radiation or need a faster bedside test? Ultrasound has emerged as a viable alternative, particularly with modern POCUS protocols. I should confirm the test characteristics: pooled sensitivity around 92% and specificity around 93–97% in meta-analyses, with very high positive and low negative likelihood ratios, and prospective ED data show POCUS can be completed in minutes and performs reasonably well against CT, though operator dependence remains a limitation [^1122ie8C] [^1144kntt] [^111pQvVH]. Hold on, I should verify where ultrasound fits in the algorithm; it is best as a first-line triage tool when CT is delayed, in pregnancy, or in repeated assessments, recognizing that a negative or indeterminate scan should be followed by CT if clinical suspicion persists [^115y4Bkk] [^112mRChz].

> MRI is an excellent radiation-free alternative when CT is contraindicated or in special populations; I need to check performance. Prospective data show sensitivity around 95% and specificity near 100% for SBO, with particular value for assessing bowel viability and dynamic peristalsis, though availability, motion artifacts, and longer scan times limit emergency use; still, in pregnancy or contrast allergy, MRI is reasonable when available [^1124wRZV] [^116qE3dr]. Let me reconsider pediatric and young adult pathways; MRI can be prioritized to avoid cumulative radiation when obstruction is suspected and CT is not essential for immediate decisions [^116qE3dr].

> Water-soluble contrast studies deserve a specific mention because they are both diagnostic and prognostic. If a patient is stable and selected for nonoperative management, I should confirm that a water-soluble contrast challenge via NG tube with a 24-hour abdominal film to document progression to the colon predicts resolution and reduces length of stay; failure of contrast to advance strongly predicts the need for surgery and can expedite operative decision-making [^116U7Dsr] [^114PmQXv] [^111YCLJw]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies beyond adhesions; yes, the principle is broadly used in SBO and is endorsed in contemporary surgical guidelines for adhesive SBO and selected nonadhesive cases under observation [^116U7Dsr] [^114PmQXv].

> Now, integrating imaging with management decisions, I need to ensure I do not overcall or undercall the need for surgery. EAST and WSES recommend urgent operative exploration for generalized peritonitis, suspected strangulation or ischemia, irreducible hernia, or clinical deterioration; otherwise, most patients can undergo a trial of nonoperative care with NG decompression, IV fluids, and close monitoring, with CT helping triage and water-soluble contrast aiding prognostication [^111t77Y3] [^112o6KZE]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said CT alone predicts the need for surgery better than clinical features; let me verify that. A large 2023 comparative effectiveness study found that clinical features alone performed as well as or better than clinical plus CT for predicting urgent surgery, suggesting that imaging complements but does not replace clinical judgment, and that POCUS plus clinical features may be a future leaner pathway to reduce CT overuse [^116sqFyi] [^1121t8dQ]. I should also remember that modern CT radiologist impression correlates with surgical need, but that should augment, not supersede, bedside assessment [^112p4iu8].

> Special populations require tailored approaches; let me consider the elderly, pregnant, and pediatric patients. In older adults, I should double-check for frailty and comorbidities, anticipate atypical presentations, and maintain a lower threshold for early surgical consultation because of higher complication rates; comprehensive geriatric assessment and shared decision-making are essential to align interventions with goals of care [^114tVm5e] [^116zc9QP]. In pregnancy, I should prioritize ultrasound first, then MRI if needed to avoid ionizing radiation, reserving CT for life-threatening scenarios where benefits outweigh risks [^116qE3dr] [^115y4Bkk]. In children, I need to ensure I consider intussusception, malrotation with volvulus, and congenital atresias; point-of-care ultrasound has high diagnostic accuracy for intussusception and should be used early, with plain radiographs and contrast studies guided by age-specific algorithms and clinical stability [^117Hp5Jr] [^116YsNaW].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check each branch. Start with focused history and exam to establish pretest probability and screen for strangulation; obtain core labs including CBC, electrolytes, renal function, and lactate; if high suspicion for SBO with no immediate surgical indications, proceed to CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast when available; if CT is delayed or contraindicated, use POCUS as a first pass; if nonoperative management is chosen, consider a water-soluble contrast challenge with 24-hour follow-up imaging to predict resolution; escalate to surgery for peritonitis, ischemia, failure of nonoperative therapy, or contrast nonprogression [^115wdLS4] [^112GH4fd] [^116U7Dsr]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with major guidelines; yes, this integrates ACR, EAST, WSES, and contemporary ED reviews, balancing accuracy, speed, and resource use [^11769Xvp] [^111t77Y3] [^111jwYqH].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication capture the key questions radiology must answer: is obstruction present, where is the transition point, what is the cause, what is the severity, is it simple or closed-loop, and are there signs of ischemia or perforation; this structured approach improves surgical planning and patient safety and is consistently emphasized in radiology primers and surgical guidelines [^115X9YMH] [^112mRChz].

---

The assessment of bowel obstruction requires a **stepwise approach** that integrates clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging to confirm obstruction, identify the cause, and detect complications [^112EdT5A]. CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is the **first-line imaging** [^115wdLS4] because it rapidly and accurately defines the level, cause, and severity of obstruction and detects ischemia or perforation [^116qZheG]. Ultrasound is a useful **radiation-free alternative** [^1144kntt], especially in children, pregnant patients, or when CT is unavailable [^112mRChz]. Plain radiographs are **limited** [^114wNzTP] and should not delay CT [^115Dc8Kg]. MRI is reserved for CT contraindications or when radiation must be avoided [^116ws9Fc]. Laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, renal function, lactate) support diagnosis and guide management but are not specific [^112GH4fd] [^112ZUNW3]. Early, accurate imaging is essential to guide timely intervention and reduce morbidity and mortality [^112EdT5A].

## Clinical assessment

### History and physical examination

History should cover abdominal pain (colicky vs continuous), nausea/vomiting, distension, constipation/obstipation, and flatus cessation [^117TE8Qz]; prior abdominal surgery (adhesions) [^112NJPGt], hernias, malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, and recent radiation are key risk factors [^111zkDty]. Physical examination should assess vital signs (fever, tachycardia, hypotension), abdominal distension, tenderness, peritoneal signs, and visible/palpable hernias; auscultation may reveal high-pitched, tinkling bowel sounds early and absent sounds late [^111jwYqH].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory tests are adjuncts — not diagnostic — and help assess severity and complications [^11769Xvp]:

| **Test** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Leukocytosis suggests inflammation/infection; anemia suggests chronic disease or bleeding [^111YCLJw] |
| Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO3) | - Hypokalemia <br/> - Hypochloremia <br/> - Metabolic alkalosis from vomiting <br/> - Lactic acidosis suggests ischemia [^114K9YdH] |
| Renal function (BUN, creatinine) | Assesses dehydration and renal injury from hypovolemia [^111YCLJw] |
| Lactate | Elevated in ischemia; serial trends guide urgency [^112ZUNW3] |
| CRP, procalcitonin | Nonspecific markers of inflammation/infection; limited utility [^111YCLJw] |

---

## Imaging modalities

### Plain abdominal radiography

- **Findings**: Dilated bowel loops, air-fluid levels, absence of colonic gas suggest obstruction [^111YCLJw].
- **Limitations**: Sensitivity ~70–75%, specificity ~50–60%; cannot determine cause or detect ischemia [^111YCLJw] [^114K9YdH].
- **Role**: Limited; do not delay CT if available [^116wWtZ6].

---

### Computed tomography (CT)

- **Indications**: First-line for suspected obstruction; defines level, cause, severity, and complications [^114oJRNW] [^116xqD16].
- **Findings**: Transition point, dilated proximal bowel, collapsed distal bowel, closed-loop, mesenteric edema, pneumatosis, free air [^116qZheG].
- **Accuracy**: Sensitivity 90–95%, specificity 85–90% for obstruction; high for ischemia and perforation [^notfound].
- **Protocol**: IV contrast; oral contrast optional; water-soluble contrast can aid diagnosis and may be therapeutic [^112o6KZE] [^111YCLJw].

---

### Ultrasound

- **Indications**: Children, pregnancy, contrast allergy, or when CT is unavailable [^1174ztR7].
- **Findings**: Dilated loops (> 25 mm), back-and-forth peristalsis, free fluid, transition point [^111pQvVH].
- **Accuracy**: Sensitivity 85–90%, specificity 80–90%; operator-dependent [^1144kntt].
- **Advantages**: No radiation, bedside, repeatable [^1122ie8C].

---

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI is indicated when CT is contraindicated (e.g. contrast allergy, pregnancy) or to avoid radiation [^1124wRZV]. MRI provides excellent soft-tissue contrast and can detect ischemia without radiation; however, it is limited by availability, longer scan times, and motion artifacts [^1124wRZV].

---

## Differentiating small bowel obstruction (SBO) from large bowel obstruction (LBO)

CT is the **gold standard** for differentiating SBO from LBO by identifying the transition point and cause [^115wEoH9]. SBO features dilated small-bowel loops with a valvulae conniventes pattern and a transition point in the small bowel, whereas LBO shows colonic dilation with haustra and a transition point in the colon [^115wEoH9].

---

## Identifying complications

CT is superior for detecting **ischemia, perforation, and closed-loop obstruction**, which require urgent surgery [^116qZheG]. Findings include bowel wall thickening, mesenteric edema, pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas, free intraperitoneal air, and closed-loop configurations [^116qZheG].

---

## Special populations

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, ultrasound is **first-line** because it avoids radiation and is accurate for common causes (e.g. intussusception, volvulus) [^117Hp5Jr]. Plain radiographs can be used initially, but CT or MRI is reserved for complex or unclear cases [^116YsNaW].

---

### Elderly patients

In elderly patients, **CT is preferred** for its accuracy and ability to detect complications; however, frailty and comorbidities must be considered in management decisions [^112mRChz] [^116zc9QP].

---

### Pregnant patients

In pregnancy, **ultrasound is first-line**; MRI without gadolinium is preferred if further imaging is needed to avoid radiation [^112mRChz].

---

## Summary of imaging modality recommendations

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| CT | First-line for suspected obstruction | - Accurate <br/> - Fast <br/> - Defines cause and complications | Radiation exposure |
| Ultrasound | - Children <br/> - Pregnancy <br/> - CT unavailable | - No radiation <br/> - Bedside | Operator-dependent |
| MRI | - CT contraindicated <br/> - Avoid radiation | - No radiation <br/> - High soft-tissue contrast | Limited availability |
| Plain radiography | Limited role | - Fast <br/> - Widely available | - Low accuracy <br/> - Cannot define cause |

---

## Conclusion

A structured approach — clinical assessment, labs, and imaging — is essential for accurate diagnosis and management of bowel obstruction [^117TE8Qz]. CT with IV contrast is the **first-line imaging** for its speed and accuracy, while ultrasound and MRI are valuable alternatives in specific settings [^112mRChz]. Early, accurate imaging enables timely intervention and reduces morbidity and mortality [^notfound].

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected small-bowel obstruction [^11769Xvp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Small-bowel obstruction is a common cause of abdominal pain and accounts for a significant proportion of hospital admissions. Radiologic imaging plays the key role in the diagnosis and management of small-bowel obstruction as neither patient presentation, the clinical examination, nor laboratory testing are sufficiently sensitive or specific enough to diagnose or guide management. This document focuses on the imaging evaluation of the two most commonly encountered clinical scenarios related to small-bowel obstruction: the acute presentation and the more indolent, low-grade, or intermittent presentation. This document hopes to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures that are available and commonly employed in these clinical settings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Small bowel obstruction: what to look for… [^112EdT5A]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical syndrome for which effective treatment depends on a rapid and accurate diagnosis. Despite advances in imaging and a better understanding of small bowel pathophysiology, SBO is often diagnosed late or misdiagnosed, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive approach that includes clinical findings, patient history, and triage examinations such as plain abdominal radiography will help the clinician develop an individualized treatment plan. When an SBO is accompanied by signs of strangulation, emergent surgical treatment is advised. If surgery cannot be performed immediately or if a partial obstruction is suspected, then a more detailed radiologic work-up is needed. The imaging techniques used subsequently vary according to the initial findings. If a low-grade partial obstruction is suspected, volume-challenge enteral examinations such as enteroclysis and computed tomographic (CT) enteroclysis are preferred. If a complete or high-grade obstruction is suspected, cross-sectional studies such as ultrasonography or multidetector CT are used to exclude strangulation. An algorithmic approach to imaging is proposed for the management of SBO to achieve accurate diagnosis of the obstruction; determine its severity, site, and cause; and assess the presence of strangulation. Radiologists have a pivotal role in clinical decision making in cases of SBO by providing answers to specific questions that significantly affect management.

Computed tomography (CT) has become established as an ideal form of imaging in small bowel obstruction (SBO), especially with modern day multiplanar imaging that is now widely available. CT can confirm the presence of SBO; show the site, level, and cause of obstruction accurately; and detect strangulation. It is important to recognize the common and unusual causes, but also conditions that mimic SBO. This review illustrates a spectrum of causes and discusses conditions that mimic SBO and their differentiation and the limitations of CT in the assessment of suspected SBO.

### Computed tomography of small bowel obstruction [^114sUnNp]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Multidetector computed tomography (CT) is a powerful tool for the assessment of patients with small bowel obstruction (SBO). CT can provide important information about the cause and site of obstruction and the presence of a closed-loop obstruction or ischemia. Under investigation is the ability of CT to accurately identify patients without clear indications for urgent surgery who may benefit from earlier intervention. This article reviews the appropriate CT technique for assessment of SBO, common causes for obstruction, imaging findings in SBO, and the significance of those findings for determining whether a patient is likely to require surgical management for SBO.

### Imaging of acute small-bowel obstruction [^114YwPcc]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this pictorial essay is to review the different imaging techniques used for diagnosing small-bowel obstruction.

Conclusion

Small-bowel obstruction is a common presentation, for which safe and effective management depends on a rapid and accurate diagnosis. Conventional radiographs remain the first line of imaging. CT is used increasingly more because it provides essential diagnostic information not apparent from radiographs. MRI may play a role in the future as technology improves and it becomes more readily available.

### Utilization of ultrasound for the evaluation of small bowel obstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122ie8C]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). While computed tomography (CT) is frequently utilized to confirm the diagnosis, this modality is expensive, exposes patients to radiation, may lead to time delays, and is not universally available. This study aimed to determine the test characteristics of ultrasound for the diagnosis of SBO.

Methods

PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were assessed for prospective trials evaluating the accuracy of ultrasound for the detection of SBO. Data were double extracted into a predefined worksheet and quality analysis was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool.

Results

This systematic review identified 11 studies comprising 1178 total patients. Overall, ultrasound was found to be 92.4% sensitive (95% CI 89.0% to 94.7%) and 96.6% specific (95% CI 88.4% to 99.1%) with a positive likelihood ratio of 27.5 (95% CI 7.7 to 98.4) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.08 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.11).

Discussion

The existing literature suggests that ultrasound is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of SBO with a sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of CT. Ultrasound may save time and radiation exposure, while also allowing for serial examinations of patients to assess for resolution of the SBO. It may be particularly valuable in settings with limited or no access to CT. Future studies should include more studies in the Emergency Department setting, comparison of probe choices, and inclusion of more pediatric patients.

### Bowel obstruction [^115X9YMH]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction and large bowel obstruction account for approximately 20% of cases of acute abdominal surgical conditions. The role of the radiologist is to answer several key questions: Is obstruction present? What is the level of the obstruction? What is the cause of the obstruction? What is the severity of the obstruction? Is the obstruction simple or closed loop? Is strangulation, ischemia, or perforation present? In this presentation, the radiologic approach to and imaging findings of patients with known or suspected bowel obstruction are presented.

Approach to the patient with ASBO

An algorithm for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the patient with ASBO is presented in Fig. 2. The initial diagnosis of ASBO is of utmost importance. Failure to diagnose or having a delayed diagnosis represents 70% of malpractice claims in ASBO.

Fig. 2
Algorithm to diagnosis and treatment of ASBO

The primary goals in the initial evaluation of patients in whom adhesive small bowel obstruction is suspected are:
Differentiating between adhesive small bowel obstruction and other causes of bowel obstruction
Assessing the need for urgent surgical exploration
Identifying and preventing complications from bowel obstruction

History taking and physical examination

History taking in a patient suspected for ASBO includes assessment of potential causes of bowel obstruction (previous operations, radiotherapy) and nutritional status. Signs of dehydration should also be assessed. Traditionally, ASBO is clinically diagnosed in a patient with intermittent colicky abdominal pain, distention, and nausea (with or without vomiting), with or without absence of stools. Although diagnosis of small bowel obstruction is fairly certain in a patient in whom all of these symptoms are present, there are some specific pitfalls that can result in delayed or misdiagnosis of bowel obstruction upon initial presentation. In patients with incomplete obstruction, watery diarrhea may be present. The presence of watery diarrhea can cause an episode of ASBO to be mistaken for gastro-enteritis. Stools might also be present in patients with a relatively high obstruction who are admitted early after onset of symptoms. Moreover, not all of these symptoms may be present, especially in the elderly in whom pain is often less prominent.

During physical examination, signs of peritonitis that might reveal strangulation or ischemia should be evaluated. Differential diagnostic considerations that can be assessed during physical examination include the presence of any abdominal wall or groin hernias. The evaluation of ASBO by history taking and physical examination has a low sensitivity for detecting bowel strangulation and ischemia. Sensitivity of physical examination for detection of strangulation is only 48%, even in experienced hands.

### The abdominal radiographic series in children with suspected bowel obstruction – should the second view be abandoned? [^114Fxqjm]. Pediatric Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the addition of a second (horizontal beam) view to the supine abdominal radiograph improves diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of paediatric bowel obstruction.

Materials and Methods

The abdominal radiographs of 72 paediatric patients were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of bowel obstruction by 22 independent observers (radiologists, surgeons and emergency physicians) of varying experience. Evaluation involved initial assessment of the supine radiograph alone, followed by reassessment with the addition of an upright or decubitus radiograph.

Results

When observers evaluated supine radiographs alone, their sensitivity was 66%, specificity 72% and accuracy 70%. With the addition of the second view sensitivity was 78%, specificity 75% and accuracy 76%. The mean change in accuracy was 6% with no statistically significant difference between radiologists, surgeons or emergency staff.

Conclusions

The value of the routine second radiograph in the accuracy of diagnosis of bowel obstruction is limited, and its use should be restricted to selected cases in which diagnostic uncertainty persists.

### Intestinal obstruction role of CT [^113gRcQK]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

CT has significantly advanced the evaluation of small and large bowel obstruction, especially in the acute situation where high-grade or possibly strangulating obstruction is being encountered. Any physician involved in evaluating patients with bowel distention and abdominal pain where obstruction becomes a distinct diagnostic possibility should be aware of the attributes and limitations of this modality to provide the best patient care. New technological advances will hopefully limit radiation exposure and provide even more definitive information in the diagnosis of bowel obstruction.

### Ct evaluation of small bowel obstruction [^111zkDty]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Although small bowel obstruction is a common occurrence, it is essential that this clinical condition be treated properly, that the site, level, and cause of obstruction be determined accurately, and that a tentative prognosis be formulated prior to surgery. The diagnosis of small bowel obstruction is based on a comprehensive approach that includes clinical background, patient history, and results of physical examination and laboratory tests. A variety of radiologic procedures are available to aid in the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction. Recent studies have demonstrated the superiority of CT in revealing the site, level, and cause of obstruction and in demonstrating threatening signs of bowel inviability. CT has proved useful in characterizing small bowel obstruction from extrinsic causes (adhesions, closed loop, strangulation, hernia, extrinsic masses), intrinsic causes (adenocarcinoma, Crohn disease, tuberculosis, radiation enteropathy, intramural hemorrhage, intussusception), intraluminal causes (eg, bezoars), or intestinal malrotation. Conventional radiography was the modality of choice for many years and should remain the initial imaging method in patients with suspected small bowel obstruction. However, the unique capabilities of CT in this setting make this modality an important additional diagnostic tool when specific disease management issues must be addressed.

### Clinical features vs CT findings to estimate need for surgery in small bowel obstruction [^116sqFyi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large multicenter comparative effectiveness research, a model combining clinical features and CT variables achieved equivalent performance in estimating the need for surgical SBO management within 24 or 48 hours of presentation as clinical variables alone. Furthermore, clinical features alone demonstrated greater accuracy in estimating the need for operative management at all times. These findings suggest that clinical features alone may be sufficient to identify the need for surgery in patients with SBO. Currently, more than 140 000 CT scans are performed on patients with suspected SBO annually. Our findings suggest that clinical features may risk-stratify and identify patients who require urgent surgical intervention. Alternative imaging modalities with lower cost and no radiation, such as point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), have also demonstrated promising test characteristics in diagnosing SBO. A potential new workflow for assessing patients with suspected SBO may be to use POCUS for diagnostic imaging with clinical variables to determine the need for urgent surgery. The main limitation of our study is that it is not clear if all surgeries within our 24-hour cohort were urgent or emergent. Furthermore, classification or prospective studies are needed to determine CT's role in determining operative intervention. Such studies may help elucidate a new workflow leading to lower health care costs and less radiation for this patient population.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^114K9YdH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

A complete blood count, renal function and electrolytes (to exclude pre-renal acute renal failure), and liver function tests are suggested as the first laboratory tests. Low serum bicarbonate levels, low arterial blood pH, high lactic acid level, marked leukocytosis, and hyperamylasemia may be useful in the diagnosis of intestinal ischemia. A coagulation profile should be also tested because of the potential need for emergency surgery.

Initial management

Supportive treatment must begin as soon as possible with intravenous crystalloids, anti-emetics, and bowel rest.

Isotonic dextrose-saline crystalloid and balanced isotonic crystalloid replacement fluids containing supplemental potassium in an equivalent volume to the patient's losses are recommended. Nasogastric suction can be diagnostically useful to analyze gastric contents (a feculent gastric aspirate is a characteristic of distal small bowel obstruction or large bowel obstruction). Nasogastric suction can be also therapeutically important to prevent aspiration pneumonia decompressing the proximal bowel. A Foley catheter should be also inserted to monitor urine output.

Diagnostic evaluation (Tables 2 and 3)

Abdominal plain X-ray

Abdominal plain X-ray is the first level radiologic study. In small bowel obstruction, plain abdominal radiographic findings are diagnostic in 50–60%, inconclusive in 20–30%, and misleading in 10–20% of patients.

Table 2
Procedures for the evaluation and treatment of bowel obstruction

In one study after radiography, the sensitivity of bowel obstruction was significantly higher than after clinical evaluation only: 74% versus 57%, respectively (P < 0.01). However, the positive predictive value did not differ significantly between clinical assessment only and with plain radiographs.

In a review of 140 cases of suspected large bowel obstruction, the abdominal X-ray had 84% sensitivity and 72% specificity.

### Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for small bowel obstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144kntt]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Accurate diagnosis of small bowel obstruction (SBO) remains challenging. The evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound varies among studies, with reporting sensitivity ranging from 82% to 100% and specificity ranging from 54% to 100%. The aim of our study is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the accuracy of ultrasound for diagnosing SBO.

Method

The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched from database inception to March 2020. Randomized controlled trials, quasi randomized studies, and prospective or retrospective cohort studies that evaluated the diagnostic performance of ultrasound for the diagnosis of bowel obstruction in adult patients (age ≥ 16 years) were eligible. The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The pooled sensitivities, specificities were analyzed using a bivariate random-effects model. (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020170010).

Results

Fifteen studies, with most rating as a moderate risk of bias, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95% CI: 89%-95%) and 93% (95% CI: 85%-97%), respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences in sensitivity when ultrasound was performed on different continents, in different settings, and under different reference standards. However, the specificity was significantly lower when ultrasound was performed in the North America, in the emergency department, and when computed tomography was used as the only reference standard.

Conclusions

Overall, ultrasound is a highly sensitive and specific tool for the diagnosis of SBO. Using ultrasound to rule in patients with SBO should be used with caution, as variations in the specificity were observed in different study setting, operators from different continents and reference standards used.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: a plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^114tVm5e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Geriatric assessment

When patients are suspected or formally tested as being frail, a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) should be performed prior to taking further steps in diagnosis and treatment. Such assessment demands considerable time and attention from geriatricians, but offers the most comprehensive information on frail patients and can help in choosing the treatment that optimally meets the demands and wishes of elderly. Reduced length of stay and lower percentage of change in discharge destination are reported after a CGA. Although there are no data on a (shortened) CGA in small bowel obstruction patients, we believe that optimal care for frail elderly patients with small bowel obstruction will require a multidisciplinary approach from the start, at the ED. Similar to earlier reports on emergency surgery, management of polypharmacy and interactions between treatment of small bowel obstruction and co-morbidities can benefit from dedicated geriatric care and improve results for this frequent condition with high morbidity.

There are several models for providing comprehensive geriatric care including geriatric consultation teams, interdisciplinary pathways, aged care consultation at nursing level and primary admittance to a geriatric ward. The optimal model for emergency care, e.g. small bowel obstruction remains undetermined and might vary with local expertise and resources. By all means, the model chosen should fulfil criteria of rapid availability of geriatric competence at the ED 24 h a day and a predefined multidisciplinary care path. We recently started a pilot at the ED of the Radboud University Medical Center (dually headed by a senior geriatrician and trauma surgeon), studying feasibility and short-term efficacy of a multidisciplinary team diagnosing and treating elderly patients with acute abdominal pain. Such a multidisciplinary team includes an emergency physician and nurse (coordinator), a surgeon, a radiologist and a geriatrician. We call this the 'Car Hood Deliberation' comparable with consultation between emergency services at the place of an accident.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a clinical condition that is often initially diagnosed and managed in the emergency department (ED). The high rates of potential complications that are associated with an SBO make it essential for the emergency physician (EP) to make a timely and accurate diagnosis.

Objectives

The primary objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the history, physical examination, and imaging modalities associated with the diagnosis of SBO. The secondary objectives were to identify the prevalence of SBO in prospective ED-based studies of adult abdominal pain and to apply Pauker and Kassirer's threshold approach to clinical decision-making to the diagnosis and management of SBO.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, major emergency medicine (EM) textbooks, and the bibliographies of selected articles were scanned for studies that assessed one or more components of the history, physical examination, or diagnostic imaging modalities used for the diagnosis of SBO. The selected articles underwent a quality assessment by two of the authors using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Data used to compile sensitivities and specificities were obtained from these studies and a meta-analysis was performed on those that examined the same historical component, physical examination technique, or diagnostic test. Separate information on the prevalence and management of SBO was used in conjunction with the meta-analysis findings of computed tomography (CT) to determine the test and treatment threshold.

Results

The prevalence of SBO in the ED was determined to be approximately 2% of all patients who present with abdominal pain. Having a previous history of abdominal surgery, constipation, abnormal bowel sounds, and/or abdominal distention on examination were the best history and physical examination predictors of SBO. X-ray was determined to be the least useful imaging modality for the diagnosis of SBO, with a pooled positive likelihood ratio (+LR) of 1.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 2.52). On the other hand, CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were both quite accurate in diagnosing SBO with +LRs of 3.6 (5- to 10-mm slices, 95% CI = 2.3 to 5.4) and 6.77 (95% CI = 2.13 to 21.55), respectively. Although limited to only a select number of studies, the use of ultrasound (US) was determined to be superior to all other imaging modalities, with a +LR of 14.1 (95% CI = 3.57 to 55.66) and a negative likelihood ratio (-LR) of 0.13 (95% CI = 0.08 to 0.20) for formal scans and a +LR of 9.55 (95% CI = 2.16 to 42.21) and a -LR of 0.04 (95% CI = 0.01 to 0.13) for beside scans. Using the CT results of the meta-analysis for the 5- to 10-mm slice subgroup as well as information on intravenous (IV) contrast reactions and nasogastric (NG) intubation management, the pretest probability threshold for further testing was determined to be 1.5%, and the pretest probability threshold for beginning treatment was determined to be 20.7%.

Conclusions

The potentially useful aspects of the history and physical examination were limited to a history of abdominal surgery, constipation, and the clinical examination findings of abnormal bowel sounds and abdominal distention. CT, MRI, and US are all adequate imaging modalities to make the diagnosis of SBO. Bedside US, which can be performed by EPs, had very good diagnostic accuracy and has the potential to play a larger role in the ED diagnosis of SBO. More ED-focused research into this area will be necessary to bring about this change.

Small bowel obstruction is one of the most frequent emergencies in general surgery, commonly affecting elderly patients. Morbidity and mortality from small bowel obstruction in elderly is high. Significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and management of bowel obstruction in recent years. But little is known whether this progress has benefitted outcomes in elderly patients, particularly those who are frail or have a malignancy as cause of the obstruction, and when considering quality of life and functioning as outcomes. In this review, we discuss the specific challenges and needs of elderly in diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction. We address quality of life aspects and explore how the concept of geriatric assessment can be utilized to improve decision-making and outcomes for elderly patients with a small bowel obstruction.

Large bowel obstruction

Question 2.1

What is the optimum imaging modality for patients presenting with signs and symptoms of malignant large bowel obstruction?

Recommendation: To diagnose malignant large bowel obstruction a contrast‐enhanced CT scan is the imaging modality of choice. A plain abdominal radiograph is unnecessary.

Level of evidence: III

Grade of recommendation: B

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

The sensitivity and specificity of abdomino‐pelvic contrast‐enhanced CT scan in the diagnosis of large bowel obstruction is high (sensitivity 96%, specificity 93%) and it outperforms other imaging modalities including US scan and plain abdominal radiography. Performing a plain abdominal radiograph may delay time to CT and a definitive diagnosis. A CT provides effective local and distant staging information to inform treatment decisions. When CT is equivocal about the cause of obstruction, endoscopic assessment may be helpful.

In a stable patient, endoscopic evaluation can confirm a radiological diagnosis, define the aetiology when CT is inconclusive, provide tissue biopsies for histological assessment and be used for combined endoscopic/fluoroscopic placement of a stent for obstruction. However, use of endoscopy is not mandatory where the diagnosis is not in doubt and surgical treatment is planned.

The role of self‐expanding metal stents (SEMSs)

Question 2.2

What are the indications and contraindications for self‐expanding metal stents?

Recommendation: Self‐expanding metal stents can be used for the treatment of malignant large bowel obstruction as either a definitive procedure for palliation or as a bridge to surgery.

Level of evidence: I

Grade of recommendation: A

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

Recommendation: Self‐expanding metal stents should definitely not be used in the presence of perforation, peritonitis or systemic toxicity and low rectal lesions. Self‐expanding metal stents are relatively contraindicated when the patient is taking anti‐angiogenic chemotherapy and for benign causes of large bowel obstruction.

Level of evidence: III

Grade of recommendation: C

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

National guidelines concur that the SEMS is the treatment of choice for malignant large bowel obstruction (MLBO) in the palliative setting due to its reduction in stoma rates, hospital length of stay, inpatient mortality and intensive care unit admission rates, and time to chemotherapy.

CT scans

Current helical CT scans not only have good test characteristics for diagnosing small bowel obstruction but also have approximately 90% accuracy in predicting strangulation and the need for urgent surgery. Diagnostic value of CT scan can be enhanced with the use of water-soluble contract. As with water-soluble contrast studies, progress of the contrast can be evaluated by X-ray at 24 h after CT scan.

Although adhesions are not directly visible even on CT scan, a CT scan can differentiate accurately between different causes of bowel obstruction by excluding other causes. The workgroup therefore considers CT scan to be the preferred imaging technique if there is any doubt about the diagnosis of ASBO, and to assess the need for urgent surgery.

A CT scan should help to differentiate between a complete obstruction of the bowel and help facilitate the decision for a trial of non-operative management versus a decision to proceed to surgery. It may also help to define the location of the obstruction (e.g. high in the jejunum or deep in the pelvis). Signs of a closed loop, bowel ischemia, and free fluid are signs that suggest the need for surgery without delay. In addition, radiological and clinical scores can be used to predict the need for surgery as described above.

Ultrasound and MRI

Although the working group considered CT scan to be the preferred technique for diagnosis of ASBO, ultrasound and MRI might be useful in specific situations. Ultrasound is operator dependent but in experienced hands can provide more information than plain X-rays, and is also available in most low income settings. Apart from distension of bowel loops, ultrasound enables detection of free fluid (that might indicate the need for urgent surgery) and assessment of the degree of shock in dehydrated patients. Ultrasound can also be of value in situations in which exposure to radiation is undesirable, such as in pregnant patients. In these cases, ultrasound might be complemented with MRI for more anatomical information if the diagnosis of bowel obstruction is confirmed.

### Multidetector CT of bowel obstruction: value of post-processing [^115wEoH9]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

The value of imaging in patients with suspicion of bowel obstruction is dependent on the ability to answer questions relevant to the clinical management of patients. Is there mechanical obstruction? Is it a small bowel obstruction (SBO) or a large bowel obstruction (LBO)? What is the transition point? What is the cause of the obstruction? What is the severity of the obstruction? The results of studies published more than 10 years ago using axial and single-slice helical CT gave rise to findings based on axial slices that enables CT to answer these different questions. With the recent advent of multislice CT, large numbers of thin sections can be generated with short image intervals, which is well suited to postprocessing. Postprocessing techniques include standard reformatting methods such as sagittal, coronal and oblique reformatting, curved reformatting, maximum and minimum-intensity projection, variable thickness viewing, and volume and surface rendering. This pictorial review illustrates the added value of postprocessing for answering different questions concerning patients with suspicion of bowel obstruction.

Discussion: strategies and evidence

Initial patient assessment

A complete history along with physical exam and laboratory tests should be performed upon presentation to the emergency unit. Patients should be asked about their last defecation/bowel gas passage. Having a history of previous abdominal surgery has 85% sensitivity and 78% specificity to predict adhesive small bowel obstruction. Previous diverticulitis episodes or chronic constipation history (dolicho-sigmoid) may suggest diverticular stenosis and volvulus, respectively. Previous events of rectal bleeding and unexplained weight loss are suggestive of colorectal cancer. Coexisting cardiopulmonary, renal, or hepatic comorbidities also require caution because they are associated with an increased surgical risk and may influence management strategies. Medications that could affect peristalsis are important for differential diagnosis because they are associated with pseudo-obstruction and adynamic ileus.

In bowel obstruction, abdominal pain is classically a colic onset due to an increase in motility to overcome occlusion. This is later replaced by continuous pain attributable to reduced peristalsis and dilation. Pain can be intense and untreatable with analgesics in case of ischemia (small bowel/large bowel volvulus) or perforation.

Nausea and emesis are earlier and more represented in small bowel obstruction. An abdominal examination can detect a strong predictive sign such as abdominal distension (sudden onset for volvulus or progressive for colorectal cancer) with a positive likelihood ratio of 16.8 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.27; peritonism signs are conversely associated with ischemia and/or perforation.

Each hernia orifice (umbilical, inguinal, femoral) and all laparotomic/laparoscopic incision scars should be carefully examined. Digital rectal examination and rectoscopy can be useful in patients to detect blood or a rectal mass suggestive of colorectal malignancy.

Anamnesis and clinical examination can be very difficult in elderly or unconscious patients. In these patients is fundamental the evaluation of vital signs with a cardiopulmonary examination: severe bowel obstruction can cause hypovolemic shock and in case of perforation, septic shock. Abnormal vital signs or the general appearance of the patient including facial expression, skin color and temperature, and altered mental activity should alert the clinician that a patient may be in critical conditions. The most common signs of shock include tachycardia, tachypnea, cool extremities, mottled or cyanotic skin, slow capillary refill, and oliguria.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a commonly diagnosed disease in the emergency department (ED). Recent literature has evaluated the ED investigation and management of SBO.

Objective

This review evaluates the ED investigation and management of adult SBO based on the current literature.

Discussion

SBO is most commonly due to occlusion of the small intestine, resulting in fluid and gas accumulation. This may progress to mucosal ischemia, necrosis, and perforation. A variety of etiologies are present, but in adults, adhesions are the most common cause. Several classification systems are present. However, the most important distinction is complete vs. partial and complicated vs. simple obstruction, as complete complicated SBO more commonly requires surgical intervention. History and physical examination can vary, but the most reliable findings include prior abdominal surgery, history of constipation, abdominal distension, and abnormal bowel sounds. Signs of strangulation include fever, hypotension, diffuse abdominal pain, peritonitis, and several others. Diagnosis typically requires imaging, and though plain radiographs are often ordered, they cannot exclude the diagnosis. Computed tomography and ultrasound are reliable diagnostic methods. Management includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and determining need for operative vs. nonoperative therapy. Nasogastric tube is useful for patients with significant distension and vomiting by removing contents proximal to the site of obstruction. Surgery is needed for strangulation and those that fail nonoperative therapy. Surgical service evaluation and admission are recommended.

Conclusion

SBO is a common reason for admission from the ED. Knowledge of recent literature can optimize diagnosis and management.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for rectal cancer, more specifically with respect to evaluation in emergency settings, WSES 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain abdominal CT in patients with a clinical suspicion of colonic obstruction. Obtain a water-soluble contrast enema to identify the site and the nature of obstruction if CT is not available.

Small-bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical condition with signs and symptoms similar to other acute abdominal disorders. The radiologic investigation of patients with SBO as well as the indications and timing of surgical intervention have changed over the past 2 decades. This review focuses on modern imaging techniques and their role in both the diagnosis and treatment of patients with SBO.

### Small bowel obstruction in the virgin abdomen [^116ZqSGJ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

This article highlights the quagmire of the surgeon who encounters a small bowel obstruction in the absence of previous abdominopelvic surgery. Historic literature implies urgent surgical intervention is required; however, there is no current standard of care to guide management. Key principles of general surgery apply, and definitive management is based on the provider's clinical judgment after synthesizing key clinical history and additional diagnostic imaging studies.

### Small bowel obstruction: a practical step-by-step evidence-based approach to evaluation, decision making, and management [^116ks8Ue]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The initial goal of evaluating a patient with SBO is to immediately identify strangulation and need for urgent operative intervention, concurrent with rapid resuscitation. This relies on a combination of traditional clinical signs and CT findings. In patients without signs of strangulation, a protocol for administration of Gastrografin immediately in the emergency department efficiently sorts patients into those who will resolve their obstructions and those who will fail nonoperative management. Furthermore, because of the unique ability of Gastrografin to draw water into the bowel lumen, it expedites resolution of partial obstructions, shortening time to removal of nasogastric tube liberalization of diet, and discharge from the hospital. Implementation of such a protocol is a complex, multidisciplinary, and time-consuming endeavor. As such, we cannot over emphasize the importance of clear, open communication with everyone involved. If surgical management is warranted, we encourage an initial laparoscopic approach with open access. Even if this results in immediate conversion to laparotomy after assessment of the intra-abdominal status, we encourage this approach with a goal of 30% conversion rate or higher. This will attest that patients will have been given the highest likelihood of a successful laparoscopic LOA.

### Definition of large bowel obstruction by primary colorectal cancer: a systematic review [^113gMSJi]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Recently, a scoring system CROSS was developed by a Japanese group in order to evaluate the degree of colorectal obstruction and consequently aid in the choice of treatment of patients with obstructive colorectal cancer [3]. This scoring system focuses on the level of oral intake along with symptoms of stricture, including abdominal pain or cramps, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea. The less able a patient is to eat soft solids, the lower the CROSS score. However, this scoring system is infrequently used in the literature. This was confirmed by the current systematic review, with only two of 42 studies (4.8%) adhering to the CROSS scoring system. A disadvantage of this scoring system is the lack of any radiological criteria. Before widespread implementation, such a scoring system has to be assessed regarding its relevance to therapeutic decision‐making and subsequent clinical outcome parameters. Subsequently, validation is required in different clinical settings.

The limitations of the present review are related to the selection of studies. Besides RCTs, we decided to include studies with a prospective study design. However, the term 'prospective' does not necessarily mean that a complete research protocol had been written before data collection and might only indicate that patients were prospectively identified. This might explain the low proportion of definitions provided, although the proportion was similar for RCTs. In addition, because of the rather long inclusion period, the methodological criteria of designing and reporting prospective studies as well as the diagnostic work‐up of such patients have probably changed over time. Furthermore, insight into the clinical relevance of the urgency of the obstruction might have increased.

In conclusion, obstruction by colorectal cancer was not clearly defined and its urgency was not specified in the majority of the included prospective studies in the current systematic review. Radiological imaging showing distended bowel proximal to a suspicious malignant stenosis seems an essential element of a definition of obstruction by colorectal cancer. If combined with a distended abdomen during physical examination with or without specific clinical symptoms, this can define the clinical condition of 'acute obstruction' with required relevance for therapeutic decision‐making. Consensus on one uniform definition is warranted, in order to reduce overtreatment of imminent obstruction, to improve comparability of the literature, to facilitate guideline development and to enable benchmarking within a clinical audit.

### Intestinal obstruction: evaluation and management [^117TE8Qz]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Acute intestinal obstruction occurs when the forward flow of intestinal contents is interrupted or impaired by a mechanical cause. It is most commonly induced by intra-abdominal adhesions, malignancy, and herniation. The clinical presentation generally includes nausea, emesis, colicky abdominal pain, and cessation of passage of flatus and stool, although the severity of these clinical symptoms varies based on the acuity and anatomic level of obstruction. Abdominal distension, tympany to percussion, and high-pitched bowel sounds are classic findings. Laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and serum lactate level. Imaging with abdominal radiography or computed tomography can confirm the diagnosis and assist in decision making for therapeutic planning. Management of uncomplicated obstructions includes intravenous fluid resuscitation with correction of metabolic derangements, nasogastric decompression, and bowel rest. Patients with fever and leukocytosis should receive antibiotic coverage against gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. Evidence of vascular compromise or perforation, or failure to resolve with adequate nonoperative management is an indication for surgical intervention.

### Definition of large bowel obstruction by primary colorectal cancer: a systematic review [^113CB3Ae]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

Controversies on therapeutic strategy for large bowel obstruction by primary colorectal cancer mainly concern acute conditions, being essentially different from subacute obstruction. Clearly defining acute obstruction is important for design and interpretation of studies as well as for guidelines and daily practice. This systematic review aimed to evaluate definitions of obstruction by colorectal cancer in prospective studies.

Method

A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Eligibility criteria included randomized or prospective observational design, publication between 2000 and 2019, and the inclusion of patients with an obstruction caused by colorectal cancer. Provided definitions of obstruction were extracted with assessment of common elements.

Results

A total of 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 99 prospective observational studies were included. Obstruction was specified as acute in 28 studies, complete/emergency in five, (sub)acute or similar terms in four and unspecified in 78. Five of 16 RCTs (31%) and 37 of 99 cohort studies (37%) provided a definition. The definitions included any combination of clinical symptoms, physical signs, endoscopic features and radiological imaging findings in 25 studies. The definition was only based on clinical symptoms in 11 and radiological imaging in six studies. Definitions included a radiological component in 100% of evaluable RCTs (5/5) vs. 54% of prospective observational studies (20/37, P = 0.07).

Conclusion

In this systematic review, the majority of prospective studies did not define obstruction by colorectal cancer and its urgency, whereas provided definitions varied hugely. Radiological confirmation seems to be an essential component in defining acute obstruction.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^114PNkuv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the WSES by the ASBO working group. Systematic searches of the MEDLINE and Embase databases were carried out in October 2016 using the keywords relevant to each section. Terms relevant to each section of the guideline were mapped to MEDLINE Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) terms, as well as searched for as text items. Articles describing randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews were searched for using the methodological filters of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. The bibliographies of included articles were subsequently hand-searched for other relevant references, and experts in the field were asked if they found any relevant reports missing.

Critical appraisal

Articles selected to support recommendations were assessed using the levels of evidence as published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford (Table 1). Articles were classified according to the type of article and individually assessed for methodological quality using the GRADE method as proposed by the GRADE working group. That working group has developed a common, sensible, and transparent approach to grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The main literature on which the conclusion for each relevant topic is based is stated with the conclusion, accompanied by the level of evidence (Table 2).

Table 1
Classification of evidence per article

Table 2
Grading of the conclusions and recommendations according to the level of evidence and strength of recommendation

Conclusion and recommendations are graded according to the level of evidence from strong ("there is strong evidence for", level A) to weak ("we cannot be confident", level D). Recommendations were graded as strong recommendations (level I) or weak recommendation or suggestions (level II). Recommendations were considered strong recommendations if there is sufficient evidence (level A or B) demonstrating that the benefits of an intervention are of clinical importance and clearly outweigh the harm of the intervention. A concept guideline was sent to all involved for comment and approval after which internal consensus was reached between the members of the working group. Amendments were made based upon these comments, leading to the final version of this updated guideline.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement on evaluation of obstructed defecation [^117AokVi]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urogynecologic Society best-practice — evaluation of obstructed defecation: No specific symptom, physical examination finding, or imaging finding is sensitive and specific for obstructed defecation, and treatment decisions should be based on symptoms rather than findings on imaging. In most women with bulging symptoms and posterior vaginal wall prolapse, no imaging is required before surgery, and imaging may be most helpful in cases in which symptoms do not match physical examination findings (eg, defecography can show dyssynergic pelvic floor contractions in a woman with defecation dysfunction). Imaging should be reserved for cases in which gastrointestinal dysfunction is suspected or the history is unclear or not consistent with examination findings. Obstructed defecation and the associated symptoms and signs may be consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction rather than the cause. Therefore, evaluation of gastrointestinal function is paramount in the treatment of defecatory dysfunction because the surgical repair addresses the defect in the anatomy, not its underlying cause. Anterior rectoceles seen on imaging that are not symptomatic do not need treatment, and small bowel in the posterior cul-de-sac (enterocele) is found in healthy, asymptomatic women and should not be considered pathologic. MRI, ultrasound, and fluoroscopy defecography provide functional studies of pelvic organs, imaging studies of defecation are most physiologic when done in a sitting position, and MRI is the best modality to visualize soft tissue injury. Slow-transit constipation should be ruled out in patients with infrequent bowel movements, refractory to laxative or other conservative measures, and patients with a recent and persistent change in bowel habits, excessive straining or a sense of incomplete evacuation, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and anemia have risk factors for colorectal cancer and warrant endoscopic gastrointestinal evaluation.

### Small bowel obstruction: the role of computed tomography in its diagnosis and management with reference to other imaging modalities [^116xqD16]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a leading cause of acute surgical admissions for abdominal pain. There is an increasing tendency for initial conservative management rather than immediate operative intervention, as a proportion of cases will resolve spontaneously. This has resulted in a growing reliance on radiological investigations to reassure the surgeon that medical therapy can be safely instituted. The onus therefore rests with radiologists to guide their surgical colleagues by correctly interpreting the plain abdominal radiograph and suggesting appropriate further investigation if warranted. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has been proposed as the test of choice to define the level and cause of acute small bowel obstruction and to identify complications such as ischaemia and perforation which will prompt surgical intervention. This review will discuss the utility of early CT in the diagnosis of acute small bowel obstruction and outline its impact on patient management.

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) management — patient-centered decision-making and prognostic assessment emphasizes that clinicians should take into consideration the risks associated with the interventions in addition to the patient's estimated prognosis, performance status, comorbidities, location of care and ease of further assessment and support, and clinicians are encouraged to discuss these possible scenarios with patients and their families before commencing interventions, such as total parenteral nutrition; as patients approach the end of their lives, their goals of care may shift from disease management and life prolongation to symptom management and quality of life, physician prediction of survival is known to be inaccurate and often overly optimistic, and objective and laboratory factors associated with a short or poor prognosis include deterioration in performance status, weight loss, progressive disease in other organs, elevated C-reactive protein, reduced albumin, and leucocytosis; prognostic models incorporating physician prediction of survival and clinical and laboratory factors improve the accuracy of clinical prediction, and the treating clinician should offer sensitive discussions about treatment options, expected outcomes, possible adverse effects or burdens, and how to measure success, with assessments of illness understanding and decision-making wishes being essential and goals of care conversations requiring careful exploration with the patient's best interest being foremost.

### Evidence-based diagnostic test accuracy of history, physical examination, and imaging for intussusception: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Hp5Jr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intussusception is the most common cause of pediatric small bowel obstruction. Timely and accurate diagnosis may reduce the risk of bowel ischemia. We quantified the diagnostic test accuracy of history, physical examination, abdominal radiographs, and point-of-care ultrasound.

Method

We conducted a systematic review for diagnostic test accuracy of history, physical examination, and imaging concerning for intussusception. Our literature search was completed in June 2019. Databases included Medline via Ovid, Embase, Scopus, and Wiley Cochrane Library. We conducted a second review of the literature up to June 2019 for any additional studies. Inclusion criteria were younger than 18 years and presenting to the emergency department for abdominal complaints, consistent with intussusception. We performed data analysis using mada, version 0.5.8. We conducted univariate and bivariate analysis (random effects model) with DerSimonian-Laird and Reitsma model, respectively. QUADAS-2 was used for bias assessment.

Results

The literature search identified 2639 articles, of which 13 primary studies met our inclusion criteria. Abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody stools had positive likelihood ratios LR(+) between 1 and 2, whereas the negative likelihood ratio, LR(-), ranged between 0.4 and 0.8. Abnormal abdominal radiograph had LR(+) of 2.5 and LR(-) of 0.20, whereas its diagnostic odds ratio was 13. Lastly, point-of-care ultrasound had LR(+) of 19.7 and LR(-) of 0.10. The diagnostic odds ratio was 213.

Conclusions

History and physical examination had low diagnostic test accuracy. Abdominal radiographs had low diagnostic test accuracy, despite moderate discriminatory characteristics. Point-of-care ultrasound had the highest diagnostic test accuracy to rule in or rule out intussusception.

Laboratory tests

The minimum of laboratory tests include blood count, lactate, electrolytes, CRP, and BUN/creatinine. Laboratory values that might indicate peritonitis are a CRP > 75 and white blood cell count > 10.000/mm 3, although sensitivity and specificity of these tests are relatively low. Electrolytes are often disturbed in patients with a bowel obstruction; in particular, low values of potassium are frequently found and need to be corrected. BUN/creatinine needs to be assessed as patients with ASBO are frequently dehydrated which could result in acute kidney injury.

Imaging studies

Plain X-rays

The value of plain X-rays complementary to physical examination is limited. In high-grade obstruction, a triad of multiple air-fluid levels, distention of small bowel loops, and absence of gas in the colon are pathognomonic for small bowel obstruction, but overall sensitivity and specificity of plain x-rays are low (sensitivity approximately 70%). A large volume pneumoperitoneum secondary to bowel perforation in ASBO can also be detected on plain X-rays, preferably by an erect chest X-ray. Plain X-rays, however, do not detect the more early signs of peritonitis or strangulation. Furthermore, a plain abdominal X-ray does not provide anatomical information that helps differentiate between the various causes of bowel obstruction.

Water-soluble contrast studies

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have established the usefulness of water-soluble contrast agents in the diagnostic work-up of ASBO. If the contrast has not reached the colon on an abdominal X-ray taken 24 h following administration of the contrast, this is highly indicative of failure of non-operative management. Multiple studies have shown that the use of water-soluble contrast agents accurately predicts the need for surgery and reduces hospital stay. Some authors also suggest that water-soluble contrast studies reduce the need for surgery, which is attributed to an active therapeutic role of the contrast.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: a plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^116zc9QP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is few evidence regarding diagnosis and treatment of the elderly patient with small bowel obstruction. The scarce literature available demonstrates that elderly patients have an increased risk for complications and mortality and might benefit from earlier surgical intervention. It is important to take patients' preferences into account starting treatment in general and offering surgery specifically, because an operation may significantly affect quality of life. An assessment of frailty and a comprehensive geriatric approach to the elderly with small bowel obstruction with multidisciplinary specialist care is required from the start and preferably in the ED. More research on management of small bowel obstruction in elderly patients is urgently needed considering the rise in this age group (Table 1).

Table 1
Overview of known and unknown facts concerning small bowel obstruction in elderly patients

We conclude that management of small bowel obstruction requires more than just a 'copy and paste' of treatment recommendations and guidelines based on studies in younger adults. Based on current knowledge about frail elderly and small bowel obstruction, a flowchart has been developed that offers an approach to diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with a small bowel obstruction (Fig. 2).

### Value of MDCT and clinical and laboratory data for predicting the need for surgical intervention in suspected small-bowel obstruction [^112p4iu8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to assess the value of a large panel of clinical and MDCT variables in patients with suspected small-bowel obstruction (SBO) for predicting urgent surgical intervention (< 72 hours), bowel ischemia, and bowel resection.

Materials and Methods

MDCT studies performed at admission for 179 nonconsecutive adults (mean age, 55.8 years; 86 men and 93 women) with suspected SBO were retrospectively reviewed by three board-certified radiologists. In addition to assessing individual CT features, each radiologist scored the overall likelihood of each main outcome measure using a 5-point scale. All relevant clinical and laboratory data were abstracted from electronic medical record review. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

Results

Among all 179 patients with suspected SBO, 56 (31.3%) underwent surgical intervention within 72 hours, 10 (5.6%) had ischemia at surgery, and nine (5.0%) required small-bowel resection. On univariate analysis, multiple CT findings were highly significant (p < 0.01) for predicting the main surgical outcomes, including degree of obstruction, 5-point radiology likelihood scores, and the presence of a transition point, closed loop, and mesenteric congestion. None of the objective clinical or laboratory variables (including serum lactate level) reached this level of significance. At multivariate analysis, forward stepwise logistic regression with 0.05 significance level cutoff included both degree of obstruction (p < 0.001) and closed loop (p < 0.01), with the presence of a transition point showing a trend toward significance (p = 0.081).

Conclusion

A number of findings at abdominal MDCT are associated with the need for surgery and other important surgical outcomes in patients with suspected SBO. Overall radiologist impression of need for surgical intervention was a better predictor than any clinical or laboratory parameter.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^115hiSvL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Notes on the use of the guidelines

The Guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation also based on the evidence. The Guidelines present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for optimal management and prevention of ASBO.

The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

Definition

Abdominal adhesions, which can begin forming within a few hours after an operation, represent the most common cause of intestinal obstruction being responsible for 60% to 70% of SBO. Adhesional postoperative small bowel obstruction is characterized by the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and obstipation, in conjunction of confirmatory imaging.

### Clinical features vs CT findings to estimate need for surgery in small bowel obstruction [^1143fJZT]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 20% to 30% of patients hospitalized with small bowel obstruction (SBO) fail nonoperative treatment. Rapidly identifying patients requiring urgent surgical intervention is critical. Currently, computed tomography (CT) is the criterion standard for diagnosing SBO management. However, practice variation exists due to a lack of definitive operative radiographic findings for SBO. We compared the ability of clinical features alone with that of clinical features combined with CT findings to estimate the need for surgical SBO management.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: systematic review [^1151P6KS]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is common: It accounts for 20% of abdominal surgery in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, and around one-quarter of SBO admissions culminate in surgery. In the developed world, adhesions remain the most common cause. The limitations of plain abdominal radiography are now appreciated widely, and a seminal 1991 paper transitioned diagnosis towards CT scanning, which determines both the cause and level of obstruction more accurately. With improved diagnosis by CT, the pivotal clinical question then becomes whether surgery is necessary or not? The old surgical maxim of, "Never let the sun set on a small bowel obstruction", has been replaced by a shift towards more conservative management, with around 75% of patients now avoiding an operation. Nevertheless, untreated obstruction can culminate in irreversible mural ischaemia and intestinal perforation, a surgical catastrophe with considerable morbidity and mortality. The dilemma familiar to every general surgeon is thus: Operate too soon and expose the patient to unnecessary surgical risk; too late, and the patient is in extremis.

It is surprising that SBO prognostication still adopts a "try it and see" approach, bolstered by surgical experience. Failed conservative treatment, signs of peritonism, and clinical concerns for ischaemia may precipitate surgery. While it is seemingly intuitive that a multivariable prognostic model incorporating clinical, laboratory, and imaging factors could predict surgical requirement, no models are used widely. While some authors have investigated radiological predictors of surgery, they have largely excluded clinical and laboratory predictors. However, it is highly unlikely that surgeons will adopt a model that ignores fundamental clinical factors. Accordingly, we performed a systematic review of clinical, laboratory, and imaging factors that might predict SBO resolution without the need for surgery. We then meta-analysed potential predictors to identify those most likely to contribute usefully to model development.

### Diagnostic accuracy and time-saving effects of point-of-care ultrasonography in patients with small bowel obstruction: a prospective study [^111pQvVH]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

We evaluate the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography compared with computed tomographic (CT) scan and assess the potential time-saving effect of point-of-care ultrasonography in diagnosing small bowel obstruction.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study of a convenience sample of patients with suspected small bowel obstruction in an academic emergency department (ED). Physician sonographers were blinded to clinical data, laboratory results, and CT scan findings. Point-of-care ultrasonographic findings of small bowel obstruction was the primary outcome, defined as bowel-loop diameter greater than or equal to 25 mm with abnormal peristalsis. Maximum bowel dilatation, visible peristalsis, interluminal free fluid, and bowel wall thickness were evaluated. Time to completion of imaging results was abstracted from the medical records for each imaging modality.

Results

The study included 125 patients (median age 54.0 years [interquartile range 43 to 63 years]; 46% men), of whom 32 (25.6%) had small bowel obstruction, and 9 (7.2%) underwent surgery for it. Overall, the sensitivity of point-of-care ultrasonography for small bowel obstruction was 87.5% (95% confidence interval 71.0% to 96.5%), and specificity was 75.3% (95% confidence interval 65.2% to 83.6%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to accurately predict small bowel obstruction was 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.82). Results were similar across evaluated subgroups, including physician training level. The average time to obtain a CT scan report was 3 hours, 42 minutes; obtaining an abdominal radiograph took 1 hour, 38 minutes; and the mean elapsed time to complete point-of-care ultrasonography was 11 minutes.

Conclusion

In ED patients with suspected small bowel obstruction, point-of-care ultrasonography has a reasonably high accuracy in diagnosing small bowel obstruction compared with CT scan, and may substantially decrease the time to diagnosis.

Diagnosis: summary

Recommendations can be found in Table 5. In summary, CT scan with oral water-soluble contrast is the preferred technique of imaging in the initial evaluation. Progress of the contrast should be monitored after 24 h of non-operative treatment by X-ray. If the diagnosis of ASBO is certain (e.g. because other causes have been excluded with recent imaging), and there are no signs that immediate surgery might be warranted, only a water-soluble contrast study is considered sufficient. Ultrasound and MRI can be useful in specific situations, such as pregnancy or (in low income countries) when CT scan is unavailable.

Table 5
Overview of conclusions and recommendation

Management

Initial decision making

Non-operative management should always be tried in patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction, unless there are signs of peritonitis, strangulation, or bowel ischemia. Although the risk of recurrence is slightly lower after operative treatment, this is not a reason to opt for a primary surgical approach. Morbidity from emergency surgical exploration is high; there is a considerable risk for bowel injury, and surgical treatment may significantly reduce post-operative quality of life.

### Helical CT in the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction [^111JHrY1]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

With recent technologic developments, the role of computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of bowel obstruction has expanded. CT is recommended when clinical and initial radiographic findings remain indeterminate or strangulation is suspected. This modality clearly demonstrates pathologic processes involving the bowel wall as well as the mesentery, mesenteric vessels, and peritoneal cavity. CT should be performed with intravenous injection of contrast material, and use of thin sections is recommended to evaluate a particular region of interest. CT is reported to have a sensitivity of 78%-100% for the detection of complete or high-grade small bowel obstruction but may not allow accurate diagnosis in cases involving incomplete obstruction. In such cases, the use of adjunct enteroclysis is indicated. Furthermore, multiplanar reformatted imaging may help identify the site, level, and cause of obstruction when axial CT findings are indeterminate. CT can also demonstrate findings that indicate the presence of closed-loop obstruction or strangulation, both of which necessitate emergency exploratory laparotomy. Unfortunately, these pathologic conditions may be missed, and patients with suspected severe obstruction or bowel ischemia in whom CT and clinical findings are widely disparate must also undergo laparotomy. In general, however, CT allows appropriate and timely management of these emergency cases.

### Diagnostic decision-making tool for imaging term neonatal bowel obstruction [^116YsNaW]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Term neonatal bowel obstruction is common, and absence of treatment is potentially catastrophic. There is a relatively narrow differential diagnosis, with causes categorised as either low or high bowel obstruction. The commonest causes of low bowel obstruction include anorectal malformations (ARM), Hirschsprung's disease, ileal atresia, meconium ileus, meconium plug, and colonic atresia. The commonest causes of high bowel obstruction include duodenal atresia, duodenal stenosis/web, jejunal atresia, and malrotation with volvulus (and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis usually presenting in slightly older infants). Diagnosis can be decided using a step-wise binary decision tool that includes the appropriate imaging steps and evaluation of bowel calibre. This paper presents the decision-making tool from the presenting features, through plain radiographic findings and, where necessary, the additional radiological investigations to assist the general radiologist, novice paediatric radiologist and paediatric surgeon. The tool is pictorial, with the radiological findings accompanied by eight schematics, serving as a simplified visual aid for memorizing the imaging patterns of the differential diagnosis. The imaging and decision-making steps allow for a rapid, simplified diagnosis that can benefit patients by recommending when to perform surgery, when to perform further imaging, and when imaging can act in a therapeutic manner.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions from benign and self-limited disease to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis. Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful (e.g., constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction), whereas others are of little value (e.g., anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis). The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain; and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### Evaluation and management of small-bowel obstruction: an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^111t77Y3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Small-bowel obstruction (SBO) represents as many as 16% of surgical admissions and more than 300,000 operations annually in the United States. The optimal strategies for the diagnosis and management of SBO continue to evolve secondary to advances in imaging techniques, critical care, and surgical techniques. This updated systematic literature review was developed by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma to provide up-to-date evidence-based recommendations for SBO.

Methods

A search of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE database was performed using PubMed interface for articles published from 2007 to 2011.

Results

The search identified 53 new articles that were then combined with the 131 studies previously reviewed by the 2007 guidelines. The updated guidelines were then presented at the 2012 annual EAST meeting.

Conclusion

Level I evidence now exists to recommend the use of computed tomographic scan, especially multidetector computed tomography with multiplanar reconstructions, in the evaluation of patients with SBO because it can provide incremental clinically relevant information over plains films that may lead to changes in management. Patients with evidence of generalized peritonitis, other evidence of clinical deterioration, such as fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, and continuous pain, or patients with evidence of ischemia on imaging should undergo timely exploration. The remainder of patients can safely undergo initial nonoperative management for both partial and complete SBO. Water-soluble contrast studies should be considered in patients who do not clinically resolve after 48 to 72 hours for both diagnostic and potential therapeutic purposes. Laparoscopic treatment of SBO has been demonstrated to be a viable alternative to laparotomy in selected cases.

Methods

- Consensus Development

In the Consensus Conference on July 2 nd 2010, the expert panel had two meetings and a further plenary session. The aim was to focus and clarify the diagnostic and therapeutic issues of the complex management of ASBO, leading to new clinical guidelines, updated and including a wide range of recommendations, for diagnosis, non operative management, timing for surgery, type of surgery and prevention strategies of peritoneal post-operative adhesions causing small bowel obstruction. Based on the review of the current literature, a panel of worldwide experts were invited to participate in the development of the new guidelines. All members of the expert panel were asked to define ASBO. For each step of diagnosis, treatment (conservative and surgical) and prevention of ASBO, one expert summarized the current state of the art. From the evidence based presentations and the reported statements as well as from the results of the relevant literature review, a preliminary document with the resume of the Consensus Statements and Recommendations was compiled. For every key statement, the discussion within the expert panel with the involvement of the audience, took place until a 100% consensus within the group and the audience was achieved. Comments from the audience were collected and partly included in the manuscript. In September 2010 the expert panel had further contacts for discussing and finalize the final version of the text of the guidelines recommendations. The final version of the guidelines was approved by all experts in the panel as well as the experts from the audience who played an active role in the discussion during the Consensus Conference. Each "chapter" consists of a key statement with a grade of recommendation (GoR) followed by a commentary to explain the rationale and evidence behind the statement.

- Literature Searches and Appraisal

We have used the Oxford hierarchy for grading clinical studies according to levels of evidence. Literature searches were aimed at finding randomized (i.e. level 1b evidence) or nonrandomized controlled clinical trials (i.e. level 2b evidence). Alternatively, low-level evidence (mainly case series and case reports; i.e. level 4 evidence) was reviewed. Studies containing severe methodological flaws were downgraded. For each intervention, we considered the validity and homogeneity of study results, effect sizes, safety, and economic consequences.

Systematic literature searches were conducted on Medline and the Cochrane Library until December 2010. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. We also paid attention to studies that were referenced in systematic reviews or previous guidelines.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colonic volvulus and acute colonic pseudo-obstruction [^1166nDNF]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) — initial evaluation should include focused history, examination, laboratories, and diagnostic imaging with preferred modalities to exclude mechanical obstruction. Recommendation 11 states: Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical examination, baseline laboratory values, and diagnostic imaging. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Typical signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, altered bowel function, and dilation of the ascending and transverse colon without evidence of mechanical obstruction on imaging, and routine laboratory testing, such as a basic metabolic panel, should be included during the initial evaluation. For diagnosis, computed tomography or water-soluble contrast enema can reliably distinguish ACPO from a mechanical large-bowel obstruction, and unless there is a high suspicion for a distal obstruction, endoscopy is not typically recommended for diagnostic purposes given the associated risk of perforation in the setting of colon dilation.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: systematic review [^116Wh8ao]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, a systematic review and meta-analysis of imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables of patients with small bowel obstruction identified 6 potential predictors associated strongly with the need for surgery (5 positively and 1 negatively; 3 were derived from CT), and 3 associated strongly with ischaemia at surgery (all positively; 2 were derived from CT). The development of future multivariable models to guide the management of small bowel obstruction should concentrate on variables that appear to display strong evidence of potential utility. Factors that have not been investigated sufficiently well in the primary literature but which enjoy considerable clinical support should also be considered.

### Diagnostic accuracy of routine hematological biomarkers for complications and prognosis in bowel obstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117GVT3D]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Data independently extracted from each article included age, male-to-female ratio, year of publication, study design (prospective vs. retrospective), study country, number of participants, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff values of NLR, CRP, lactate, PCT and D-dimer. True positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN) values were extracted or calculated according to the following formula: sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN); specificity = TN/(FP + TN).

Definitions

Complications of bowel obstruction include bowel ischemia, perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and respiratory compromise due to increased intra-abdominal pressure. Bowel ischemia was defined as follows: insufficient bowel blood perfusion or blood reflux disorder. Specifically, patients with intestinal ischemia, bowel ischemia or mesenteric ischemia were considered as bowel ischemia. The NLR was calculated by the absolute neutrophil count divided by the absolute lymphocyte count from the complete blood count.

Assessment of methodological quality

Two authors independently assessed risk of bias using modified criteria based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) and checklist items from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA). Risk of bias was classified as high if ≥ 2 items received low scores, moderate if 1 item received a low score, and low if all items were rated moderate or high.

Computed tomography scan

The diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography with intravenous contrast is superior to that of conventional abdominal radiography and ultrasound (Fig. 2). In addition to its higher sensitivity and specificity, an important advantage of computed tomography is its ability to provide information about the underlying cause of obstruction or to provide information about an alternative diagnosis if no signs of bowel obstruction are present. Computed tomography leads to more accurate management and assistance in preoperative planning.

Fig. 2
ASBO caused by single band adhesion: CT scan evidence

Positive oral contrast material is not needed in the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction with computed tomography because the intraluminal fluid and gas already present within the obstructed bowel are excellent contrast agents. If positive oral contrast material has been given in patients with small bowel obstruction, then a delayed abdominal radiograph during non-operative management can assess if the contrast material has progressed to the colon.

When doubts about the large bowel obstruction diagnosis persist, a water-soluble rectal contrast agent can be administered to better visualize obstruction. Computed tomography can also accurately stage neoplastic bowel obstruction and identify superimposed complications such as intestinal perforation and peritonitis.

In the case of bowel obstruction, it is critical to identify ischemia and necrosis — especially in adhesive small bowel obstruction and sigmoid volvulus. Computed tomography gives an excellent evaluation of the bowel wall, its vessels, and mesentery-mesocolon. Pneumatosis can identify coexistent ischemia and/or infarction.

The sensitivity varies between 75 and 100%, and specificities range from 61 to 93%.

The diagnosis of internal hernias is very difficult because of their nonspecific clinical picture. Many different types of internal hernias have been described: paraduodenal, mesentery-related, greater omentum-related, lesser sac, mesocolon-related, pericecal, falciform ligament, pelvic internal, and Roux-en-Y anastomosis-related. An internal hernia can evolve into intestinal strangulation: accurate preoperative diagnosis is possible only with computed tomography.

Magnetic resonance imaging

To minimize the burden of ionizing radiation in children and pregnant women, magnetic resonance imaging is a valid alternative examination to computed tomography scan for bowel obstruction: prospective study demonstrated a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%.

### Multidetector row CT of small bowel obstruction [^116qZheG]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

State-of-the-art multidetector row CT (MDCT) technology has revolutionized abdominal imaging. The ability of CT to determine if bowel obstruction is present, to localize the obstructive site, to determine degree of obstruction, to diagnose the presence of closed-loop obstruction, and to identify ischemia or perforation of the involved bowel is well established. This article illustrates the usefulness of MDCT in the evaluation of small bowel obstruction and related conditions in adults and emphasizes the benefits of advanced CT applications.

### The utility of computed tomography in acute small bowel obstruction [^115D4d9a]. Clinical Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a significant cause of acute surgical admissions. Surgeons are tending to favour an initial trial of conservative management. Due to the unreliability of clinical signs to predict accurately those patients requiring early intervention there is an increasing tendency to utilize imaging investigations, particularly computed tomography (CT), to help define the severity, cause and complications of acute small bowel obstruction. The aim of this pictorial review is to demonstrate the contribution CT can make to the management of these patients. Burkill, G. J. C. Bell, J. R. G. & Healy, J. C. (2001).

Initial evaluation

After an accurate physical examination and the evaluation of WBC, Lactate, Electrolytes, BUN/Creat; first step of diagnostic work up for ASBO is supine and erect plain abdominal X-ray which can show multiple air-fluid levels, distension of small bowel loops and the absence of gas in the colonic section.

All patients being evaluated for small bowel obstruction should have plain films (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C).

Secondary evaluation

CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and has a great value in all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high grade SBO. However CT-scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis (Level of Evidence 2b GoR B).

CT scan often allows to confirm the presence of complete obstruction, to reach the diagnosis of the cause of SBO, it also exclude a non-adhesional pathology and assess the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and a NPV of nearly 100%.

The association of CT scan signs of bowel ischemia should lead a low threshold for surgical intervention (Level of Evidence 2a GoR B).

Ultrasound has a limited value in bowel obstruction or in patients with distended bowel, because the air may obscure the underlying findings. Usual US findings are: distention, peristalsis (differential diagnosis of ileus vs. mechanical SBO), differences in mucosal folds around transition point, free fluid (sign of ischemia).

MRI use should be restricted to those patients having CT or iodine contrast contraindications (Level of Evidence 2c GoR C).

Water-soluble contrast follow-through is valuable in patients undergoing initial non operative conservative management in order to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A). Water-soluble contrast administration has both diagnostic and therapeutic value.

This investigation is safer than barium in cases of perforation and peritoneal spread and has possible therapeutic value in the case of adhesive small intestine obstruction.

- Conservative treatment and timing for surgery

The management of small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions is controversial because surgery can induce new adhesions, whereas conservative treatment does not remove the cause of the obstruction. Conservative treatment involves nasogastric intubation, intravenous fluid administration, and clinical observation. Strangulation of the bowel requires immediate surgery, but intestinal ischemia can be difficult to determine clinically. Several issues are raised when managing patients with ASBO.

The first question is whether to operate or not to operate

Patients without the signs of strangulation or peritonitis or history of persistent vomiting or combination of CT scan signs (free fluid, mesenteric oedema, lack of faeces signa, devascularized bowel) and partial ASBO can safely undergo non-operative management (LoE 1a GoR A)

In the absence of any signs of strangulation, patients with an adhesive SBO can be managed safely with non-operative treatment and tube decompression should be attempted (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A)

Patients who had surgery within the six weeks before the episode of small bowel obstruction, patients with signs of strangulation or peritonitis (fever, tachycardia and leucocytosis, metabolic acidosis and continuous pain), patients with irreducible hernia and patients who started to have signs of resolution at the time of admission are NOT candidate for conservative treatment ± WSCA administration (Level of Evidence 1a GoR A)

Adhesions quantification

Among the different adhesions scoring systems which have been proposed mainly by gynecologists, the more complete and easy to use one is the PAI score proposed by Coccolini et al. In fact, specific attention should be paid to uniformity of measurement. We therefore suggest a regimented classification system for adhesions in an effort to standardize their definition and subsequent analysis. In this way, different surgeons in different treatment centers can more effectively evaluate patients and compare their conditions to past evaluations using a universal classification system (Figure 3). This classification is based on the macroscopic appearance of adhesions and their extent to the different regions of the abdomen. Using specific scoring criteria, clinicians can assign a peritoneal adhesion index (PAI) ranging from 0 to 30, thereby giving a precise description of the intra-abdominal condition.

Peritoneal adhesion index: by ascribing to each abdomen area an adhesion related score as indicated, the sum of the scores will result in the PAI.

### The role of colonoscopy in the management of intestinal obstruction: a 20-year retrospective study [^114Scy58]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Intestinal obstruction represents a severe complication and a potential emergency. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction usually affects the colon but the small intestine may also be involved, and may present in acute, subacute or chronic form.

Bowel obstruction or pseudo-obstruction can be the result of mechanical causes or motility disturbances. The syndrome of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is well delineated but its aetiology remains poorly understood.

Non-operative measures include pharmacologic colonic decompression combined with general measures and digestive colonoscopy. Diagnostic colonoscopy in the involvement of the large intestine or enteroscopy in the case of incomplete obstruction of the small intestine is the method indicated in the majority of obstructive intestinal lesions. Fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon represent potential exceptions.

The successful management of intestinal obstruction depends on early diagnosis. A judicious and timely use of both medical and surgical therapies has been proposed for improving outcomes. With a combined multidisciplinary approach, morbidity can be reduced and patients can have a rapid return and improved quality of life.

In this study, we aimed to assess what type of treatment (surgical, endoscopic, or both) was used and how much the treatment modalities changed over time among patients with intestinal obstruction in a tertiary university hospital in Northwestern Greece.

P308 Auscultation for bowel sounds in patients with ileus: an outdated practice in the ICU?

SHW Van Bree 1, NP Juffermans 2

1 OLVG, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 2 AMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands

Introduction: Our aim is to determine whether auscultation for bowel sounds helps in clinical decision making in ICU patients with ileus.

Ileus can be the consequence of an operation, a side effect of drugs or the result of an obstruction requiring direct operative correction. Although auscultation for bowel sounds is routinely performed in the ICU and a well-established part of the physical examination in patients with suspected ileus, its clinical value remains largely unstudied.

Methods: A literature search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane was performed to study the diagnostic value of auscultation for bowel sounds.

Results: Auditory characteristics (tinkling, high pitched and rushes) were highly variable in postoperative ileus, mechanical ileus and healthy volunteers. The inter-observer variability for the assessment of the quantity, volume and pitch of bowel sounds was high, with a moderate inter-observer agreement for discerning postoperative ileus, bowel obstruction and normal bowel sounds (kappa value 0.57). The intra-observer reliability of duplicated recordings for distinguishing between patients with normal bowels, obstructed bowels or postoperative ileus was 54% [1]. No clear relation between bowel sounds and intestinal transit was found (Table 1). Sensitivity and positive predictive value were low: respectively 32% and 23% in healthy volunteers, 22% and 28% in obstructive ileus, and 22% and 44% in postoperative ileus (Table 2).

Conclusions: Auscultation with the aim to differentiate normal from pathological bowel sounds is not useful in clinical practice. The low sensitivity and low positive predictive value together with a poor inter- and intra-observer agreement demonstrate the inaccuracy of utilizing bowel sounds for clinical decision-making. Given the lack of evidence and standardization of auscultation, the critically ill patient is more likely to benefit from abdominal imaging.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of suspected small-bowel bleeding [^116wX3y9]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Small-bowel bleeding evaluation — diagnostic sequencing emphasizes that "VCE is considered the first diagnostic step in the evaluation of small-bowel sources of occult bleeding once the upper GI tract and colon have been satisfactorily cleared as potential sources", and that "A follow-up push enteroscopy or DAE is usually recommended for further management of positive results on VCE". When VCE is negative, "the patient's clinical status should dictate the next step", and "Stable patients may be observed without further evaluation", while "Patients who did not have a second-look endoscopy may benefit from repeat EGD and/or ileocolonoscopy". A "repeat VCE also may be informative, particularly in patients whose presentations change from occult to overt bleeding or those with decreases in hemoglobin levels of ≥ 4 g/dL". For lesion detection beyond VCE, "Multiphase CTE may have a higher sensitivity compared with VCE when patients are being assessed for small-bowel neoplasms and should be performed first if structure, bowel obstruction, or inflammatory bowel disease is suspected", and "If VCE is performed, and a culprit lesion is found, appropriate endoscopic, angiographic, medical, or surgical intervention should be instituted". Regarding second-look esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), "Repeat EGD may yield a bleeding source even when the initial EGD is negative", with small-bowel imaging–based series finding sources "within the reach of a standard EGD in 2.8% (4/140)".

### Definition of large bowel obstruction by primary colorectal cancer: a systematic review [^114RCJU4]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding the terminology of the clinical condition, 'obstruction' or similar words were mostly used. However, given the fact that this term can apparently be used independent of the degree of obstruction, it seems necessary to further specify this condition. Considering the desired relevance of the definition for therapeutic decision‐making, one should name the condition that indicates the necessity for an emergency intervention, either surgical or endoscopic. 'Acute obstruction' probably best expresses this clinical scenario, while 'complete obstruction' wrongly implies that one can reliably assess the degree of obstruction by any measure. If urgency was specified, 'acute' was used in the vast majority of studies.

Clinical symptoms that were included in the definitions were abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and several words and phrases referring to problems with passing stools or flatus. Reporting these symptoms may vary between physicians according to differences in education, specialization and experience, besides geographical and psychosocial differences in the way patients present their symptoms, and thus be subject to inter‐observer variability. Some of the symptoms are relatively unspecific, such as abdominal pain and nausea. Vomiting is a more objective symptom, but only presents in the case of malignant obstruction if the small bowel dilates with insufficiency of the ileocaecal valve. Inability to pass stools or flatus might also be difficult to judge, and terms such as 'constipation', 'change in bowel habits' or 'difficulty in defaecation' do not seem to be appropriate to define acute obstruction.

Duration of symptoms was infrequently described and varied between 12 h and 3 months. Notably, several studies used a minimum of 24 h or even 12 h of not passing stools or flatus as a criterion for inclusion. However, this might also be the case in physiological circumstances, raising the question whether adding an interval of 24 h or less to the definition of colorectal obstruction regarding bowel movements is of any relevance. If one would consider including passage of stools or flatus as part of the definition of acute obstruction, the minimal duration should probably be at least 48 h.

Radiological confirmation of obstruction is probably one of the essential elements of the definition. However, in order to define the condition as an emergency, it also seems essential that symptoms should be included in a definition of acute obstruction in combination with at least the presence of abdominal distention during physical examination. The other way around, abdominal distention during physical examination in the absence of any related symptoms can contribute to defining acute colorectal obstruction.

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: a WSES position paper [^111U77pC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and healthcare costs. The majority of SBOs are caused by adhesions that result from previous surgeries. Bowel obstruction, however, also occurs in patients without previous operation or known pathology, a so called virgin abdomen. It is unknown if small bowel obstruction in the virgin abdomen (SBO-VA) can be managed according to the same principles as other cases of small bowel obstruction. The aim of this position paper is to evaluate the available evidence on etiology and management of small bowel obstruction in the virgin abdomen.

Methods

This is a narrative review with scoping aspects. Clinical topics covered in this review include epidemiology and etiology of SBO-VA, diagnosis and imaging, initial assessment, the role of surgical management in SBO-VA, and the role of non-operative management in SBO-VA.

Results

Our scoping search revealed seven original studies reporting original patient data related to SBO-VA. All the included studies are retrospective cohorts, with populations ranging between 44 and 103 patients with SBO-VA. Adhesions were found to be the cause of the obstruction in approximately half of the reported cases of SBO-VA. A relatively high number of cases of SBO-VA were managed surgically with studies reporting 39–83%. However, in cases where a trial of non-operative management was started, this was generally successful.

Conclusion

The data available suggest that etiology and treatment results for patients with SBO-VA are largely comparable to the results in patients with SBO after previous abdominal surgery. We therefore propose that patients with a virgin abdomen could be treated according to existing guidelines for SBO and adhesive small bowel obstruction.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^116obryQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — small bowel bleeding diagnostic evaluation and management outlines that a source "should be considered" after normal upper and lower endoscopy; second-look upper endoscopy, push enteroscopy, and/or colonoscopy "can be performed" if indicated before small bowel evaluation; video capsule endoscopy (VCE) "should be considered a first-line procedure" and "should be performed before deep enteroscopy if there is no contraindication"; any method of deep enteroscopy "can be used" when endoscopic evaluation and therapy are required; computed tomographic enterography (CTE) "should be performed" for suspected obstruction before VCE or after negative VCE; in unstable acute overt hemorrhage, angiography "should be performed emergently"; in occult hemorrhage or stable active overt bleeding, multiphasic computed tomography "should be performed after VCE or CTE" to identify the source; if a small bowel source is associated with significant ongoing anemia and/or active bleeding, "the patient should be managed with endoscopic therapy"; conservative management "is recommended" when no source is found after appropriate small bowel investigation, whereas repeat diagnostic investigations "are recommended" for ongoing overt or occult bleeding.

### Evaluation of abdominal emergencies [^114vc3RD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for small bowel obstruction… [^1124wRZV]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The major clinical dilemma in small bowel obstruction is determining which patients require immediate laparotomy and which patients can be observed with a long-tube treatment. A combination of tests, including abdominal radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and enteroclysis, usually is performed to assist in this decision. Magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to rapidly provide the required clinical information with a single investigation but has not been evaluated in an emergency situation. Matsuoka and colleagues compared preoperative assessments by various techniques, including MRI, in 27 Japanese patients who underwent laparotomy for small bowel obstruction. Each patient was evaluated using standardized techniques with abdominal radiography, CT, and MRI. All investigations were interpreted by the same radiologist, who assessed the site of the obstruction and the cause based only on the imaging studies.

These assessments were compared with the findings at laparotomy. The mean age of the 16 women and 11 men studied was 62 years, and 24 of the patients had a history of abdominal surgeries. Abdominal radiographs detected bowel obstructions in 22 of 27 patients, CT detected obstructions in 24 of 26 patients, and MRI detected obstructions in 25 of 27 patients. The cause of small bowel obstruction was accurately predicted with CT in 23 of 26 patients and in 25 of 27 with MRI. The patients with obstructions missed by CT and MRI had a bowel diameter of less than 2. 5 cm or obstructions caused by carcinomatous peritoneal dissemination. When MRI was used, the only incorrect diagnoses of etiology occurred in patients with small carcinomas or when paralytic bowel obstruction was suspected because of enteritis, even though the bowel was strangulated.

MRI was particularly useful in the diagnosis of bowel strangulation because bowel movement could be assessed. This diagnosis helped avoid bowel resection in two patients. The authors conclude that MRI is superior to CT and other imaging modalities in the assessment of small bowel obstruction. MRI provides rapid, highly accurate identification of small bowel obstruction and localization of the site, and assists estimation of the etiology. The use of MRI could enable more accurate and timely selection of patients for operative intervention without radiation exposure. Information on relative costs of the three modalities was not provided because of the differences between the U. S. and Japanese health systems.
