## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for alcoholic hepatitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the ICD-10 code is for alcoholic hepatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact ICD-10-CM code(s) that map to alcoholic hepatitis. Then, I should verify whether there are subcodes that distinguish severity or complications. Next, I will check the coding accuracy and positive predictive value of these codes in administrative data. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting sources and confirm the most precise answer with guideline-aligned usage examples.

> Let me first confirm the core ICD-10-CM code. Multiple authoritative sources consistently identify K70.1 as the code for alcoholic hepatitis, with K70.10 for alcoholic hepatitis without ascites and K70.11 for alcoholic hepatitis with ascites, which are the two clinically relevant subcategories used in contemporary coding systems [^113vUUk3] [^116Q5u6M].

> Wait, let me verify the subcoding detail so I don't overgeneralize. The K70.1x structure indeed splits into K70.10 (without ascites) and K70.11 (with ascites), and this is reflected in coding references and epidemiologic studies that explicitly use K70.1x to capture alcoholic hepatitis in administrative datasets, including mortality analyses that separate alcoholic hepatitis (K70.1x) from alcoholic cirrhosis (K70.3x) [^113vUUk3] [^116Q5u6M] [^114BStR1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic accuracy. I should double-check how reliable these codes are in real-world data. Validation studies show that K70.1 has only moderate positive predictive value (roughly 45–54%) for true alcoholic hepatitis when compared against clinical criteria, meaning administrative coding misclassifies a substantial fraction of cases; accuracy improves when the code is in the primary position or when combined with complication codes, but it remains imperfect and should be interpreted cautiously in research [^112NQKR2] [^114Nf9fm] [^116dHTv5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought K70.4 might also represent alcoholic hepatitis because some studies list K70.4 alongside K70.1 when identifying AH cohorts. But let me reconsider and verify the hierarchy. K70.4 corresponds to alcoholic hepatic failure, which is a more severe, distinct clinical entity than uncomplicated alcoholic hepatitis, so using K70.4 to define alcoholic hepatitis would be imprecise even though some epidemiologic papers aggregate K70.1 and K70.4 for case capture; the correct code for alcoholic hepatitis per se remains K70.1, with K70.10 or K70.11 specifying ascites status [^113vUUk3] [^1165v78E] [^114BStR1].

> I should confirm the practical coding choice. For clinical documentation and billing, the most specific and appropriate ICD-10-CM codes are K70.10 for alcoholic hepatitis without ascites and K70.11 for alcoholic hepatitis with ascites; if specificity is not available, K70.1 may be used as the parent category, but K70.10/K70.11 are preferred when documented [^113vUUk3] [^116Q5u6M].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for alcoholic hepatitis is K70.1, with subcodes K70.10 (without ascites) and K70.11 (with ascites). Use the most specific subcode when supported by documentation, and interpret administrative data using these codes with caution given modest positive predictive value in validation studies [^113vUUk3] [^116Q5u6M] [^112NQKR2] [^114Nf9fm].

---

The ICD-10 code for alcoholic hepatitis is **K70.1** [^113vUUk3]. Use **K70.10** for alcoholic hepatitis without ascites and **K70.11** for alcoholic hepatitis with ascites [^116Q5u6M]. These codes are used to document alcoholic hepatitis in medical records and billing, but coding accuracy varies, so clinical correlation is essential [^112NQKR2] [^114Nf9fm].

## ICD-10 codes for alcoholic hepatitis

The ICD-10 codes for alcoholic hepatitis are:

| **ICD-10 code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| K70.1 | Alcoholic hepatitis |
| K70.10 | Alcoholic hepatitis without ascites |
| K70.11 | Alcoholic hepatitis with ascites |

---

These codes are part of the **K70** category, which covers alcoholic liver disease, and provide specific documentation of alcoholic hepatitis with or without ascites [^113vUUk3].

---

## Clinical criteria for alcoholic hepatitis

Alcoholic hepatitis is diagnosed clinically based on the following criteria:

- **Heavy alcohol use**: Typically > 40 g/day for women and > 60 g/day for men for at least 6 months, with continued use until 4–8 weeks before presentation [^112QAdHQ] [^114mwBou].
- **Rapid onset of jaundice**: Onset within 8 weeks of heavy alcohol use [^112QAdHQ] [^114mwBou].
- **Laboratory findings**: Elevated AST and ALT, typically AST > 50 U/L, ALT > 50 U/L, with an AST:ALT ratio > 1.5, and both values < 400 U/L [^112QAdHQ] [^114mwBou].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: Such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and ischemic hepatitis [^112QAdHQ] [^114mwBou].

---

## Limitations and accuracy of ICD-10 coding for alcoholic hepatitis

While ICD-10 codes are widely used for documentation and billing, their accuracy for alcoholic hepatitis is limited:

- **Positive predictive value (PPV)**: Studies show PPVs around 45–54% for ICD-10 codes identifying alcoholic hepatitis, indicating significant misclassification [^112NQKR2] [^114Nf9fm].
- **Primary diagnosis field**: Accuracy improves when alcoholic hepatitis is coded as the primary diagnosis rather than secondary, but remains suboptimal [^114Nf9fm] [^1112tPvX].
- **Clinical correlation**: Given these limitations, clinical correlation and review of medical records are essential for accurate diagnosis and coding [^116dHTv5] [^115sr4aT].

---

## Clinical implications of alcoholic hepatitis

Alcoholic hepatitis is a severe manifestation of alcohol-related liver disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Severe cases (Maddrey discriminant function ≥ 32 or MELD > 20) have high short-term mortality and often require hospitalization and corticosteroid therapy [^114U4aT9] [^113bB7ug]. Long-term outcomes depend heavily on **alcohol abstinence** and ongoing management of liver disease complications [^114T3oDi] [^1136Egpq].

---

## Summary of ICD-10 codes for alcoholic hepatitis

- **K70.1**: Alcoholic hepatitis
- **K70.10**: Alcoholic hepatitis without ascites
- **K70.11**: Alcoholic hepatitis with ascites

These codes are used to document alcoholic hepatitis in medical records and billing, but **clinical correlation is necessary** due to coding accuracy limitations [^112NQKR2] [^114Nf9fm].

Introduction

Many studies on alcoholic hepatitis (AH) use the International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding to identify patients. Data regarding the diagnostic accuracy of ICD codes for AH are limited.

Methods

A total of 151 patients with ICD-10 codes for AH were reviewed for the presence or absence of AH using standardized diagnostic criteria.

Results

Sixty-eight of the 151 patients met AH criteria, corresponding to a positive predictive value of 45%. Patients with AH experienced higher model for end-stage liver disease and mortality than those who did not (P < 0.05).

Discussion

Our results suggest ICD-10 codes are not reliable for identifying AH. Studies using the ICD codes should be interpreted cautiously.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the validity of ICD-10 coding for AH in this Canadian hospitalization database appears sub-optimal. Although the accuracy of coding algorithms improved when restricted to patients with AH in the primary diagnosis field or with codes indicative of hepatic complications (e.g. ascites and gastrointestinal haemorrhage), the use of administrative data in epidemiologic studies of AH should be undertaken cautiously. If administrative data is used for case identification, confirmation of the diagnosis via medical record review is recommended.

Background

Epidemiologic studies of alcoholic hepatitis (AH) have been hindered by the lack of a validated International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding algorithm for use with administrative data. Our objective was to validate coding algorithms for AH using a hospitalization database.

Methods

The Hospital Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) was used to identify consecutive adults (≥ 18 years) hospitalized in the Calgary region with a diagnosis code for AH (ICD-10, K70.1) between 01/2008 and 08/2012. Medical records were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of AH, defined as a history of heavy alcohol consumption, elevated AST and/or ALT (< 300 U/L), serum bilirubin > 34 μmol/L, and elevated INR. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the diagnosis field in which the code was recorded (primary vs. secondary) and AH severity. Algorithms that incorporated ICD-10 codes for cirrhosis and its complications were also examined.

Results

Of 228 potential AH cases, 122 patients had confirmed AH, corresponding to a positive predictive value (PPV) of 54% (95% CI 47–60%). PPV improved when AH was the primary versus a secondary diagnosis (67% vs. 21%; P < 0.001). Algorithms that included diagnosis codes for ascites (PPV 75%; 95% CI 63–86%), cirrhosis (PPV 60%; 47–73%), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (PPV 62%; 51–73%) had improved performance, however, the prevalence of these diagnoses in confirmed AH cases was low (29–39%).

Conclusions

In conclusion the low PPV of the diagnosis code for AH suggests that caution is necessary if this hospitalization database is used in large-scale epidemiologic studies of this condition.

### Validation of coding algorithms for the identification of patients hospitalized for alcoholic hepatitis using administrative data [^116XZNcM]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

In this retrospective study, the hospital Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) was queried to identify adults (age ≥ 18 years) hospitalized in the Calgary region in the province of Alberta, Canada with a primary or secondary diagnosis of AH (ICD-10 diagnosis code, K70.1) between January 2008 and August 2012. Only the first hospitalization was considered among patients with multiple admissions for AH to avoid selection bias. Specifically, patients diagnosed with AH are more likely to be diagnosed with AH again during future admissions, thereby falsely elevating coding validity. The Calgary region included three adult, acute care hospitals and served a catchment population of approximately 1.5 million individuals. Over 99% of Alberta residents are registrants of the Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan, a universal plan that covers all hospitalization costs. The DAD contains up to 25 diagnoses, 20 procedures, and mortality information on all discharges from Calgary hospitals. This database has been used to examine the epidemiology, outcomes, and coding accuracy of various medical conditions. This study protocol and a waiver of consent was approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary.

Materials and methods

Design and data source

This was a retrospective study conducted using the NIS database to evaluate hospitalizations for AH in the US from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019. Inclusion criteria included patients with a primary diagnosis of AH. Patients were excluded if they were aged less than 21 years, or had a history of viral hepatitis infection or nonalcoholic liver disease. The NIS database was developed as a stratified probability sample to represent all nonfederal hospitals in the US. During the designated study period, NIS used the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 (prior to September 2015) and 10 (after October 2015) coding systems. Detailed information on the design and sampling methods of NIS is available at https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov.

Outcome measures

The NIS database was analyzed for hospitalizations with a primary principal discharge diagnosis of AH, using ICD-9 code (571.1) and ICD-10 code (K701.0, K701.1), from 2009–2019. The outcomes of interest included demographic characteristics, mean LOS, mean inpatient cost (MIC), and mortality trends. In addition, we determined independent predictors that had a hazard ratio with a > 10% increase and used them to develop a risk scoring system for 30-day inpatient mortality for AH hospitalizations. This was used to devise a mortality scoring system.

### The global, regional, and national burden of cirrhosis by cause in 195 countries and territories, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^114Xi9i1]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Overview

This study is part of GBD 2017, which was a systematic effort to estimate the levels and trends of burden caused by 359 diseases and injuries by sex, age, year (1990–2017), and location, including seven super-regions, 21 regions, and 195 countries and territories. We modelled the mortality and prevalence of cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, hereafter collectively referred to as cirrhosis. We report numbers and age-standardised and age-specific rates for mortality, prevalence, and DALYs, which are the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death and years lived with disability (YLDs). This study is compliant with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting.

We considered diagnoses coded as B18 and K70–77 in the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) to be compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. ICD-10 codes B18.0–18.2 were mapped to chronic viral hepatitis B and C in the GBD cause list, B18.8 and 18.9 to other causes, K70 to alcohol-related liver disease, K75.81 to NASH, and the rest of the codes to the category of other causes, which included but was not limited to autoimmune hepatitis (K75.4). The detailed list of ICD-10 codes mapped to the GBD cause list is reported in the appendix (p 4). The causes grouped in the "other chronic liver diseases" category mainly included autoimmune hepatitis, toxic liver diseases, other inflammatory liver diseases, chronic hepatitis not specified, and other diseases of the liver (K76). ICD-10 codes for acute hepatitis were not included in this study. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was considered to be a separate entity from compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, and codes for diabetes were also excluded. Finally, deaths caused by hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded because: ICD-10 codes define hepatocellular carcinoma as a cause irrespective of liver cirrhosis; hepatocellular carcinoma can be distinguished from cirrhosis in countries with adequate data; and implications on natural history and management of the two causes are not similar.

Existing evidence shows that ICD-10 coding is valid for defining overall cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases in most of the data sources used to assemble the cause-of-death database but does not have the required accuracy for reporting cirrhosis by the five causes estimated in the current study. The models that we used to split the parent cirrhosis mortality and morbidity into the five causes are described below.

Population-based data on the epidemiology and natural history of NAFLD are crucial to assess the true burden of this liver disease. Our data suggest that misclassification of NAFLD and obesity in the ICD-10-AM coding process may be related to a lack of appropriate codes or inadequate clinical documentation due to under-recognition or under-recording of these conditions. There may also be a lack of clarity about the diagnosis of NAFLD in the presence of coexisting liver diseases such as alcohol excess or viral hepatitis. Recognition of the utility and limitations of ICD-10-AM codes to study the burden of NAFLD/NASH cirrhosis in Australia is imperative to inform public health strategies and appropriate investment of resources to manage this burgeoning chronic disease.

Discussion

In this population-based study, we assessed the validity of ICD diagnosis coding algorithms for AH in a Canadian hospitalization database. Our finding of a low PPV for AH (54%) suggests that AH was not accurately and completely coded in the administrative data and caution must be exercised if the DAD is used for large-scale epidemiologic studies of AH. Under the assumption that the PPV remains relatively constant over time (as observed in our study), the DAD could be used to assess temporal trends in AH admissions. However, the exact incidence for any given year based on this data is likely to be erroneous. Administrative data could also be used as a screening tool for potential cases with AH. In this situation, confirmation of the presence of AH requires additional clinical information such as that obtainable via a review of medical records. In light of our findings, the validity of previous studies that used administrative data to study the epidemiology and outcomes of AH should be scrutinized. In one study, Sandahl and colleagues used this ICD-10 code to identify AH cases from the Danish National Registry of Patients and describe its incidence and associated mortality. In total, 1,951 suspected cases of AH were identified between 1999 and 2008. The annual incidence increased from 37 to 46 per million population in men and from 24 to 34 per million in women. However, according to our results, close to half of the patients identified in this study may not have been true cases of AH. This study also reported 84-day mortality ranging from 14% to 24%, similar to the 90-day mortality rate of 17% for confirmed AH in our study. In another study, Liangpunsakul used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample hospitalization database to report the outcomes of patients hospitalized for AH in the United States with case identification using the ICD-9 code for this condition (571.1). The study showed that AH represented 0.71% of all hospital admissions in 2007 and reported an in-hospital mortality rate of 6.8%. Although our study validated only the ICD-10 coding classification (as ICD-9 codes were unavailable), there is no clear rationale for the accuracy to differ among the two classification systems both of which include a single code for AH. Moreover, a study by Quan and colleagues that used the DAD (as in our study) demonstrated that the coding accuracies between the ICD-9 and ICD-10 classifications for liver diseases are very similar (AH was not examined specifically in this study). Therefore, our results should be generalizable to databases using either the ICD-9 or ICD-10 classifications.

### Alarming trends: mortality from alcoholic cirrhosis in the United States [^113z4qFY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcoholic cirrhosis is an advanced form of alcohol-related liver disease. In the United States, between 2010 and 2016, alcohol-related liver disease was the primary cause of nearly 1 in 3 liver transplants, surpassing hepatitis C.

Methods

We utilized the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database to compare trends in mortality from alcoholic cirrhosis in the United States in 1999 and 2019. We defined mortality from alcoholic cirrhosis as International Classification of Diseases code K70.3 (alcoholic cirrhosis of liver). We calculated mortality rates and mortality rate ratios (MRRs) per 100,000 from alcoholic cirrhosis in 10-year age groups from 25 to 85+ as measures of effect and 95% confidence intervals to test for significance.

Results

In 1999, there were 6007 deaths from alcoholic cirrhosis among 180,408,769 aged 25–85+ years, yielding a mortality rate of 3.3 per 100,000. In 2019, there were 23,780 deaths from alcoholic cirrhosis among 224,981,167 aged 25–85+ years, yielding a mortality rate of 10.6 per 100,000. The overall MRR of 3.2 was statistically significant. (P < .001), and was apparent in each 10-year age group.

Conclusions

These alarming trends in mortality from alcoholic cirrhosis in the United States contribute to the formulation of many hypotheses. These require testing in analytic studies designed a priori to do so. Meanwhile, clinical and public health efforts are necessary to curb the epidemics of heavy alcohol consumption and overweight and obesity in the United States that may be contributing to these alarming trends.

### Detecting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk factors in health databases: accuracy and limitations of the ICD-10-AM [^1124Fffn]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Determining the accuracy of ICD coding in hospital admission data is necessary to understand the limitations and improve the reliability of health system databases for epidemiological studies and health services research. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the performance and limitations of ICD-10-AM codes to identify NAFLD/NASH in admitted patient encounters with cirrhosis at a major tertiary hospital. The secondary aims were to investigate the accuracy of ICD-10-AM coding for NAFLD risk factors (obesity and T2DM) and other aetiologies of cirrhosis, namely alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^113xDz9d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis — proposed definitions and subtypes categorize cases as definite, probable, and possible. Definite alcoholic hepatitis requires histological confirmation of features of alcoholic hepatitis. Probable alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical diagnosis based on (a) heavy alcohol use for > 5 years, (b) active alcohol use until 4 weeks prior to presentation, (c) sudden onset or worsening of jaundice, and (d) AST/ALT ratio > 1.5:1 with levels < 400IU/L, with (e) absence of other causes of liver disease. Possible alcoholic hepatitis reflects diagnostic uncertainty due to another confounding etiology of liver disease or unclear history on alcohol consumption.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalizations for alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis in Alberta, Canada [^116opDip]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic lockdown and restrictions had significant disruption to patient care. We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on hospitalizations of patients with alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis as well as alcoholic hepatitis (AH) in Alberta, Canada.

Methods

We used validated International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10) coding algorithms to identify liver-related hospitalizations for nonalcoholic cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, and AH in the province of Alberta between March 2018 and September 2020. We used the provincial inpatient discharge and laboratory databases to identify our cohorts. We used elevated alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase, elevated international normalized ratio, or bilirubin to identify AH patients. We compared COVID-19 restrictions (April-September 2020) with prior study periods. Joinpoint regression was used to evaluate the temporal trends among the 3 cohorts.

Results

We identified 2916 hospitalizations for nonalcoholic cirrhosis, 2318 hospitalizations for alcoholic cirrhosis, and 1408 AH hospitalizations during our study time. The in-hospital mortality rate was stable in relation to the pandemic for alcoholic cirrhosis and AH. However, nonalcoholic cirrhosis patients had lower in-hospital mortality rate after March 2020 (8.5% vs 11.5%; P = 0.033). There was a significant increase in average monthly admissions in the AH cohort (22.1/10,000 admissions during the pandemic vs 11.6/10,000 admissions before March 2020; P < .001).

Conclusions

Before and during COVID-19 monthly admission rates were stable for nonalcoholic and alcoholic cirrhosis; however, there was a significant increase in AH admissions. Because alcohol sales surged during the pandemic, future impact on alcoholic liver disease could be detrimental.

Case definition of liver cirrhosis

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) instruction manual permits assignment of an ICD code to the underlying cause of death as noted in a death certificate. Depending on information available on the death certificate, a specific cause of death is assigned, for example, alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, or a more general code can only be assigned, for example, unspecified cirrhosis of the liver. The immediate and intermediate causes of death are attributed to the underlying cause. Consequently, there has been large variation in assignment of ICD codes to liver cirrhosis deaths across the published literature, and no standard definition has been consistently utilized. Based on the GBD2010 Gastrointestinal Diseases expert group recommendations, we included in our definition the following underlying causes of death: liver cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis infections and hepatic decompensation events. Table 1 expands on the specific ICD codes used and Additional file 1: Table S1 specifies the fraction of liver cirrhosis deaths under each ICD code. We opted for a broad definition in order to better accommodate differences across ICD revisions, variation in diagnostic accuracy across countries and discrepancies in reporting causes of death in different cultural contexts; for example, purposefully under-reporting deaths due to alcohol-related liver cirrhosis in cultures that prohibit alcohol intake. Deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. While hepatocellular carcinoma generally develops on a background of liver cirrhosis, we elected to keep deaths due to this malignant entity separate for several reasons: 1) ICD rules on coding causes of death assign hepatocellular carcinoma as an underlying cause of death irrespective of the presence or absence of liver cirrhosis; 2) the distinction between liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is possible with minimal misclassification in countries with adequate cause of death data; and 3) the implication on survival and the management of each condition are different.

### Positive predictive value of international classification of diseases, 10th revision, codes for cirrhosis and its related complications [^1148nhVY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Large administrative databases using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes are useful for epidemiologic, health services, and outcomes research. 1,2 However, coding accuracy of disease conditions could be a limiting factor. Cirrhosis prevalence is increasing because of an aging hepatitis C cohort and an increase in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. 3 We previously examined the validity of ICD, 9th revision (ICD-9), codes for cirrhosis in US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative databases. 4,5 This work has formed the basis for many clinical, epidemiologic, and health services research studies. However, with transition from the ICD-9 to ICD, 10th revision (ICD-10), coding system, it is important to determine the validity of these new cirrhosis codes in administrative databases. Although the greater number of codes in the ICD-10 system may be associated with greater specificity and coding accuracy than with the ICD-9 system, this hypothesis remains untested.

Subgroup analyses of AH coding algorithm validity

Among confirmed AH cases, 89% (108/122) had an AH code recorded as the primary diagnosis compared with only 50% (53/106) among unconfirmed cases (P < 0.001). The PPV improved from 54% overall to 67% (95% CI 59–74%) when AH was the primary diagnosis versus 21% (95% CI 12–33%) when AH was recorded as a secondary diagnosis (P < 0.001). A severe presentation was also more common in patients with confirmed AH versus unconfirmed cases (80% [97/122] vs. 43% [45/106]; P < 0.001). Accordingly, the PPV of an AH diagnosis was higher among severe compared to mild cases (68% [95% CI 60–76%] vs. 29% [95% CI 20–40%]; P < 0.001). When stratified by year of hospitalization, the PPV was highest in 2012 (70%; 95% CI 54–83%) compared to 2008 through 2011 (45% to 54%), however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.17). Comparison of the PPV between admitting hospitals, which ranged from 50% to 57%, showed no significant differences between centres (P = 0.69).

### Validation of coding algorithms for the identification of patients hospitalized for alcoholic hepatitis using administrative data [^114xUuaf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by hepatic dysfunction in the setting of heavy alcohol intake. Rapid onset of jaundice is a cardinal manifestation of AH; other common signs include fever, ascites, muscle wasting and hepatic encephalopathy. AH is often complicated by infection and hepatorenal syndrome, both of which significantly increase mortality. Untreated patients with severe AH, typically defined by a Maddrey discriminant function (DF) ≥ 32 and/or the presence of hepatic encephalopathy, have a particularly poor prognosis with one-month mortality rates ranging from 30% to 50%. In patients with a mild presentation of AH, the risk of progression to cirrhosis is 50%; this risk is highest in patients who continue to abuse alcohol.

Population-based studies describing the epidemiology and outcomes of AH are limited. A Danish study by Sandahl et al. was the first population-based epidemiologic study of AH and demonstrated an increase in annual incidence among both Danish men and women between 1999 and 2008. Another study described the clinical characteristics and mortality of patients hospitalized in the United States for AH using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Both of these studies relied on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes for AH in an administrative database for case identification. Although such codes have been validated for other non-hepatic and hepatic conditions (e.g. cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, drug hepatotoxicity), their validity for AH has yet to be confirmed. While the burden of alcohol-related liver disease is increasing in many regions, large-scale studies describing the epidemiology of AH in Canada have been hindered by the lack of a validated coding algorithm. Therefore, the primary objective of our study was to validate coding algorithms for the identification of patients hospitalized for AH using administrative data. Our study findings will inform researchers if administrative data can be used for epidemiological studies and surveillance of this condition.

This study used the public-use 2010 US MCOD data file, which contains information on all registered deaths occurring within the calendar year. State vital registration offices house these death certificates and, through a cooperative agreement, compile and share this information with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS then uses this information to generate the annual national multiple-cause mortality datasets.

The conditions on the cause of death section of the death certificate are reported by the decedent's physician, hospital residents, medical examiner, or coroner. The types of causes of death are the underlying, immediate, intermediate, and contributing causes of death that, together, are called the multiple causes of death. In MCOD files, these conditions are translated into International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), codes by highly skilled nosologists at NCHS using 2 schemes: entity axis and record axis. The entity axis represents a direct transcription of each disease entity listed on the cause of death section of the death certificate. The record axis represents a modified version of the entity axis in which repetitive conditions and inconsistencies are removed, related conditions are joined, and coding rules are followed. An example of how conditions are coded is as follows: a death certificate with cirrhosis of liver and alcoholism as causes of death would be directly transcribed to ICD-10 codes K74 (cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol) and F10 (alcohol dependence syndrome) as entity axis conditions. These conditions represent separate entities for the same death record. Searching for death records with ICD-10 code K74 would, on the surface, seem that such records had no mention of alcohol. Therefore, a preferable record axis code would be K70.3 (alcoholic cirrhosis of liver), which would encompass both ICD-10 codes K74 and F10.

### Alcoholic liver disease-related mortality in the United States: 1980–2003 [^115a9W3W]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Data on temporal changes in alcoholic liver disease (ALD)-related mortality in the United States are lacking. This longitudinal assessment is important, given the divergent data on trends in worldwide ALD-related mortality, concerns for underestimation of mortality attributed to ALD in previous investigations, and shifting attention to hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related mortality.

Methods

We analyzed mortality data compiled in the multiple cause-of-death public-use data file from the National Vital Statistics System from 1980 to 2003 using categorization by both International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 systems. The main outcome measure was age- and sex-adjusted death rates attributable to ALD, HCV, or both (ALD/HCV) listed as immediate or underlying cause of death.

Results

A total of 287,365 deaths were observed over the 24-year period. Age- and sex- adjusted incidence rates of ALD-related deaths decreased from 6.9/100,000 persons in 1980 to 4.4/100,000 persons by 2003. After introduction of HCV diagnostic testing, HCV-related liver mortality increased to 2.9/100,000 persons by 2003. Death rates for subjects with concomitant ALD/HCV rose to 0.2/100,000 persons by 1999 and then remained unchanged through 2003. Age-specific mortality related to ALD was highest in the ages of 45–64 years. Between 1980 and 2003, the age- and sex-adjusted ALD-related mortality (per 100,000 persons) decreased from 6.3 to 4.5 among Caucasians, 11.6 to 4.1 among African Americans, and 8.0 to 3.7 among the "other" race group.

Conclusions

Despite a decline in ALD-related mortality, the proportion of alcohol-related liver deaths is still considerably large and comparable in scope to that of HCV.

### Predictors of leaving against medical advice in patients with alcohol-related hepatitis [^1165v78E]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol-related hepatitis is one of the most severe manifestations of alcohol-related liver disease and has been associated with significant morbidity, mortality and financial burden. Patients with alcohol use disorders are at risk of leaving against medical advice (LAMA); however, there is currently a lack of data in the literature to show which patients are at higher risk. In this study, we investigated the specific demographic factors and comorbidities associated with LAMA.

Methods

Patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of alcohol-related hepatitis (ICD10-CM codes K70.4 and K70.1) between January 2016 and December 2019 were included in this study. Demographics, comorbidities, complications and interventions were studied in for patients who LAMA. Multivariate analysis was conducted to elucidate factors contributing to the increased risk of alcohol-related hepatitis.

Results

A total of 538,750 patients were admitted with a diagnosis of alcohol-related hepatitis. Of these, 31,500 (5.84%) patients LAMA. Older age, Hispanic race, private insurance, and higher income status were associated with a lower risk of LAMA, while younger age, African American race, lack of insurance and being in the lowest income quartile were associated with the highest risk.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrated that significant differences exist between patients with alcohol-related hepatitis who LAMA and those who remain hospitalized until discharge. We believe that this study will help healthcare providers identify patients at risk of LAMA, and help promote the targeted education of specific subgroups to improve their understanding of their disease state and decrease adverse events.

### Trends in the burden of chronic liver disease among hospitalized US adults [^112GxH71]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

As with many studies using large claims databases, these findings should be interpreted within the context of certain limitations. The NIS records data per hospitalization, and not per individual patient, without linkage or follow-up data. Owing to the cross-sectional nature of the database, longitudinal analysis is not possible, and no causal inferences can be drawn. Thus, there may be repeat hospitalizations of patients with CLD among this study cohort. Nevertheless, given that the main objective of this study was to characterize the overall clinical and economic burden of CLD hospitalizations in the US, these results still provide critical data to address this important public health concern. This study focused specifically on alcoholic cirrhosis to minimize error in the estimates given the limitations inherent in the use of ICD-9-CM coding-based algorithms to identify and isolate ALD as a whole. However, because this study focused specifically on alcoholic cirrhosis, it may not capture the true burden of ALD (eg, the burden among patients with alcoholic hepatitis who may be hospitalized but do not have cirrhosis). A considerable proportion of hospitalizations did not have an identifiable underlying etiology. Hospitalizations in this category related to CLD may be attributable to other chronic diseases (eg, cholestatic liver diseases). The changes in coding and data structure of the NIS in 2015 may have resulted in misclassification bias, and the P value for trend for some characteristics may not be as informative owing to these changes. Chronic liver disease with mention of alcohol is more thoroughly defined in ICD-10-CM (K70.xx) compared with the ICD-9-CM; however, NAFLD ICD codes still lack specificity in both coding systems. This change may have contributed to the apparent increased burden of alcoholic cirrhosis and decreased burden of NAFLD in 2016. The loss of Elixhauser comorbidity software within the NIS for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for 2016 may have led to underestimation of the burden of certain comorbidities (eg, hypertension). We tried to circumvent these limitations through a comprehensive review of ICD codes to ensure that our definitions using ICD-10-CM codes are congruent with the ICD-9-CM codes previously used.

### Detecting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk factors in health databases: accuracy and limitations of the ICD-10-AM [^1165jUNx]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Objective

The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis is often underestimated in healthcare and administrative databases that define disease burden using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. This retrospective audit was conducted to explore the accuracy and limitations of the ICD, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) to detect NAFLD, metabolic risk factors (obesity and diabetes) and other aetiologies of chronic liver disease.

Design/Method

ICD-10-AM codes in 308 admitted patient encounters at two major Australian tertiary hospitals were compared with data abstracted from patients' electronic medical records. Accuracy of individual codes and grouped combinations was determined by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ).

Results

The presence of an ICD-10-AM code accurately predicted the presence of NAFLD/NASH (PPV 91.2%) and obesity (PPV 91.6%) in most instances. However, codes underestimated the prevalence of NAFLD/NASH and obesity by 42.9% and 45.3%, respectively. Overall concordance between clinical documentation and 'grouped alcohol' codes (κ 0.75) and hepatitis C codes (κ 0.88) was high. Hepatitis B codes detected false-positive cases in patients with previous exposure (PPV 55.6%). Accuracy of codes to detect diabetes was excellent (sensitivity 95.8%; specificity 97.6%; PPV 94.9%; NPV 98.1%) with almost perfect concordance between codes and documentation in medical records (κ 0.93).

Conclusion

Recognition of the utility and limitations of ICD-10-AM codes to study the burden of NAFLD/NASH cirrhosis is imperative to inform public health strategies and appropriate investment of resources to manage this burgeoning chronic disease.

Aetiology

An ICD-10-AM code for NAFLD/NASH was present in 57 (18.5%) encounters (table 1). Overall concordance between codes and patients' medical records was good (κ 0.62). However, while specificity (97.7%), PPV (91.2%) and NPV (84.4%) were high, codes for NAFLD/NASH underestimated the prevalence of NAFLD/NASH by 42.9% (39 of 91 encounters did not contain a code despite documentation of NAFLD/NASH in the medical record; sensitivity 57.1%). The five false-positive codes were in patients with ALD (n = 4 including two with HCV as a cofactor) and HBV (n = 1).

At least one alcohol-related ICD-10-AM code was present in 158 (51.3%) encounters. Concordance between alcohol-related codes and patients' medical records was substantial (κ 0.75). Codes had good overall accuracy to detect ALD with high sensitivity (83.6%), specificity (92.4%), PPV (93.7%) and NPV (80.7%).

An HCV-related ICD-10-AM code was present in 85 (27.6%) encounters. Accuracy of codes to detect current or treated HCV infection was almost perfect (κ 0.88), with high sensitivity (88.0%), specificity (98.1%), PPV (95.3%) and NPV (95.1%).

Current HBV (hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive) was present in a minority of patients (n = 10) and was identified with an ICD code in all cases (sensitivity 100%; specificity 97.3%; NPV 100%; κ 0.70). However, an additional eight patients with prior exposure to HBV (HBsAg negative, hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) and/or hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positive) had a false-positive ICD-10-AM code for HBV (PPV 55.6%).

### Validation of coding algorithms for the identification of patients hospitalized for alcoholic hepatitis using administrative data [^115Fy14s]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Among the 106 patients who did not fulfill our diagnostic criteria for confirmed AH, 31 patients clearly did not have AH upon medical records review. The diagnosis for these patients includes cirrhosis, sepsis, recent history of AH, pancreatitis, acetaminophen toxicity, cocaine use, heart failure and alcohol intoxication.

Taking into consideration that our definition of AH may not be strictly followed by physicians, we performed a sensitivity analysis using a loosened definition of AH that confirmed diagnosis of AH if patients fulfilled both of the following criteria: heavy alcohol consumption (> 196 g/week or > 56 g in any day among males, and > 98 g/week or > 42 g in any day among females) and exclusion of other causes of acute hepatic dysfunction (e.g. drug hepatotoxicity, autoimmune hepatitis, ischemic hepatitis, etc.). With this loosened diagnostic criteria, PPV improved to 73% (95% CI 67–79%), up from 54%. This improved PPV remains sub-optimal, thus further supporting our initial findings that AH was not accurately and completely coded in the administrative data. Realizing the limitations of both sets of diagnostic criteria, one could infer that the true PPV for the AH diagnosis code lies within 54% to 73%.

Our study has several limitations that warrant discussion. First, we lack data for a control group representative of the general hospitalized population. Without controls, the sensitivity, specificity and NPVs of the diagnosis code for AH (and related algorithms) cannot be calculated. Second, since this is a retrospective study, the reliability of patients' self-reported alcohol intake is questionable. On numerous occasions, multiple descriptions of alcohol consumption were recorded in the medical record. Anecdotally, patients tended to admit to greater alcohol intake when questioned by addictions specialists. As a result, we utilized a hierarchical approach to record alcohol consumption (see Methods). Since the amount of alcohol intake is a vital criterion in the reference standard for an AH diagnosis, underreporting may have led to an underestimation of AH in our study.

### ICD-10-AM codes for cirrhosis and related complications: key performance considerations for population and healthcare studies [^111rNdUX]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Results

A random sample of 542 encounters was ascertained, however, clinical notes were unavailable for two encounters. Therefore, a total of 540 encounters among 406 patients were included in the final audit. Mean age (± SD) at the time of encounter was 55.1 (± 12.8) years and most encounters were among men (68.1%).

Eighty-seven encounters (16.1%) were abstracted by ≥ 2 data collectors during the initial stage to verify internal consistency. For all pairs of data collectors, κ was between 0.82 and 0.94. The team discussed and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

Cirrhosis

A total of 413 encounters had evidence of cirrhosis on medical record review. Accuracy of four individual ICD-10-AM codes (K70.3, K74.4, K74.5, K74.6) to detect the presence of cirrhosis was variable, with PPVs ranging from 0.67 to 1.00 (table 1). No single code could reliably exclude the presence of cirrhosis (all NPVs ≤ 0.35). A combination of the four cirrhosis codes provided a high probability (PPV 0.96) that a patient with ≥ 1 of these codes had cirrhosis documented in the medical record during that encounter. However, the combination under-detected cirrhosis prevalence (only 336 of 413 encounters in patients with cirrhosis were identified (table 2); sensitivity 81.4%; NPV 0.60).

### Trends in the burden of chronic liver disease among hospitalized US adults [^1162pvyB]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Study Population and Variables

The sample included CLD-related hospitalizations of US adults (aged ≥ 18 years) between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2016. We defined CLD using a comprehensive review of ICD-9-CM codes based on prior published algorithms, from January 1, 2012, to September 30, 2015, and corresponding ICD-10-CM codes starting October 1, 2015 (eFigure and eTable 1 in the Supplement). To minimize ascertainment bias, we classified a hospitalization as CLD related if it was associated with (1) a primary discharge diagnosis of CLD or (2) a primary discharge diagnosis of another liver-related cause (eg, cirrhosis) in combination with a secondary diagnosis of CLD (eTable 1 in the Supplement).

Among CLD-related hospitalizations, we stratified hospitalizations by 4 main etiologies (alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus [HBV] infection, hepatitis C virus [HCV] infection, and NAFLD), as these etiologies combined account for most of the burden of CLD among hospitalized patients in the US. Adult hospitalizations with alcoholic cirrhosis were identified by first isolating all hospitalizations with cirrhosis listed as a diagnosis (eTable 2 in the Supplement). From the cohort with cirrhosis, we excluded patients with autoimmune hepatitis, viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, only NAFLD-specific codes (ICD-9: 571.5, 571.8–9; ICD-10: K75.81), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis listed as a diagnosis (eTable 2 in the Supplement). We then defined alcoholic cirrhosis as hospitalizations with ALD or alcohol use disorder in addition to cirrhosis(eTable 2 in the Supplement). Adult hospitalizations with NAFLD were identified by first using ICD codes for liver disease without mention of alcohol (ICD-9: 571.5, 571.8–9, 567.23, 572.2–4, 456.0-2x, 789.5x; ICD-10: I85.xx, K65.2, K72.1x, K72.9x, K74.0–2, K74.6x, K75.8x, K75.9, K76.0, K76.6–9, K77, R18.x) and then excluding patients with chronic liver disease with mention of alcohol or alcohol use disorder (eTable 2 in the Supplement), alcoholic cirrhosis, and other etiologies of acute or chronic liver disease, (autoimmune hepatitis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, chronic passive congestion of liver, clonorchiasis, disorders of porphyrin and bilirubin metabolism, echinococcus of liver, fascioliasis, Gaucher disease, hemochromatosis, viral hepatitis, lysosomal acid lipase deficiency and other lipoid disorders, opisthorchiasis, other amyloidosis, other deficiencies of circulating enzymes, other disorders of the liver, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, syphilis of the liver, or Wilson disease) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Patients with alcohol abuse listed as an Elixhauser comorbidity were included in the alcoholic cirrhosis cohort and excluded from the NAFLD cohort for data using ICD-9-CM codes.

### Hepatitis A hospitalisations in the United States and risk factors for inpatient mortality: a nationwide population study, 1998–2020 [^115bgHbj]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis A virus infections in the United States have been declining; however, recent widespread outbreaks have brought the disease back into the spotlight. We aim to describe the epidemiology of hepatitis A hospitalisations from 1998 to 2020 in the United States and investigate risk factors for inpatient mortality. We utilised the National Inpatient Sample database and identified hepatitis A-related hospitalisations using ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Demographic and clinical data including death, coinfections, comorbidities and pregnancy status were extracted. Data were analysed by logistic and Poisson regression. We identified a total of 213,681 hepatitis A-related hospitalisations between 1998 and 2020, with hospitalisation rates ranging between 22.4 per 1,000,000 and 62.9 per 1,000,000. Between 1998 and 2015, the hospitalisation rate for hepatitis A was decreasing (IRR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97–0.98; p < .001); however, between 2015 and 2020, it increased overall (IRR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.21–1.23; p < .001). The overall inpatient mortality rate was 2.7%. Age ≥ 55years (OR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.41–2.40; p < .001), alcoholic cirrhosis (OR = 2.53; 95% CI: 1.64–3.90; p < .001), ascites (OR = 2.65; 95% CI: 1.86–3.78; p < .001), hepatorenal syndrome (OR = 9.04; 95% CI: 5.93–13.80; p < .001), heart failure (OR = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.29–2.39; p < .001), pulmonary hypertension (OR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.28–3.19; p = .003) and malignant neoplasm (OR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.25–2.45; p = .001) were associated with increased odds of mortality. Tobacco use disorder (OR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.38–0.70; p < .001) was associated with decreased odds of mortality. None of the hepatitis A-associated hospitalisations involving pregnant women resulted in death. Hepatitis A hospitalisations initially declined but increased rapidly after 2015. Certain risk factors can be used to predict prognosis of hospitalised patients.

### A new definition for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: an international expert consensus statement [^1164UyWK]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The exclusion of other chronic liver diseases including "excess" alcohol intake has until now been necessary to establish a diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). However, given our current understanding of the pathogenesis of MAFLD and its rising prevalence, "positive criteria" to diagnose the disease are required. In this work, a panel of international experts from 22 countries propose a new definition for the diagnosis of MAFLD that is both comprehensive and simple, and is independent of other liver diseases. The criteria are based on evidence of hepatic steatosis, in addition to one of the following three criteria, namely overweight/obesity, presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, or evidence of metabolic dysregulation. We propose that disease assessment and stratification of severity should extend beyond a simple dichotomous classification to steatohepatitis vs. non-steatohepatitis. The group also suggests a set of criteria to define MAFLD-associated cirrhosis and proposes a conceptual framework to consider other causes of fatty liver disease. Finally, we bring clarity to the distinction between diagnostic criteria and inclusion criteria for research studies and clinical trials. Reaching consensus on the criteria for MAFLD will help unify the terminology (e.g. for ICD-coding), enhance the legitimacy of clinical practice and clinical trials, improve clinical care and move the clinical and scientific field of liver research forward.

Methods

This cross-sectional study used the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research mortality database from 1999 to 2022. We abstracted multiple cause-of-death files, which include data from death certificates across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each certificate provides an underlying cause of death, contributing causes, and demographic information. Our analyses focused on the underlying cause of death to identify ALD-related mortality. ALD mortality was identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes (K70.xx), with separate analyses conducted for AH (K70.1x) and AC (K70.3x). Details of the ICD-10 codes used can be found in eTable in Supplement 1. This study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines to ensure the highest standard of reporting for observational studies. This study was determined to be exempt from review and informed consent by the institutional review board at Cook County Health owing to the use of deidentified, publicly available data, in accordance with 45 CFR §46.

We analyzed deaths occurring in individuals aged 25 years and older from 1999 to 2022. Age-adjusted annual mortality rates were calculated per 100 000 population and were stratified by sex (male or female), age groups (25–44, 45–64, 65–84, and ≥ 85 years), and race and ethnicity (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, Hispanic, and White) as classified by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research based on death certificates using Office of Management and Budgets standards. Mortality rates were age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population using methods suggested by the National Center for Health Statistics. This approach applies age-specific rates from our study population to the standard 2000 US population distribution across 11 age categories, producing weighted averages that allow for valid comparisons of mortality trends over time. We evaluated overall trends in age-adjusted mortality rates from 1999 to 2022 separately for ALD, AH, and AC, stratified by the aforementioned demographic characteristics.

To determine the vital status and cause of death, the National Center for Health Statistics linked all participants aged 20 years and older to the National Death Index to 31 December 2006. Therefore, for each participant follow-up extended from the date of the examination to the date of death or 31 December 2006.

Cause of death was determined from the underlying cause listed on the death certificate. We used the publicly available linked mortality data files, which identify the cause of death using the Underlying Cause of Death-113 (UCOD 113) groups (international classification of disease, 10th revision). The Underlying Cause of Death-113 variable was created by the National Center for Health Statistics to recode all deaths coded under ICD-9 (international classification of disease, ninth revision) — that is, deaths before 1999, into comparable ICD-10 groups to assist the researcher with analyses that span the entire survey period for mortality. The comparability of ICD-9 and ICD-10 underlying cause of death UCOD 113 recode has been validated. We defined cardiovascular disease mortality as deaths with underlying cause of death codes: ICD-10 I00-I69. Cancer mortality was defined as deaths with underlying cause of death codes: ICD-10 C00-C-97. Finally, liver related mortality was defined as deaths with underlying cause of death codes: ICD-10 K-70, or K-73-K74.

Methods

Study Design and Data Sources

We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, from January 1 to December 31, 2022. This study used data from ICES, an independent, nonprofit research institute that houses a large electronic repository of datasets for all Ontario residents who are eligible for the province's single-payer health care system (Ontario Health Insurance Plan). Due to the retrospective nature of this study, a waiver of informed consent was obtained from the Queen's University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board. This study used multiple administrative datasets (eTable 1 in Supplement 1), and these datasets were linked using unique encoded identifiers and analyzed at ICES. The study protocol received ethics approval from the Queen's University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board and was conducted in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for observational studies.

Study Populations

Adolescents and young adults aged 13 to 39 years with an incident diagnosis of AH were identified through inpatient hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) records. We used the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) to identify AH as the main or most responsible diagnosis for the hospital admission or ED visit (ICD-9 code 571.1; ICD-10 code K70.1) associated with a positive predictive value for AH of 90%. If individuals had multiple AH presentations, the index event was used. Incident diagnoses were captured from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2021, with a lookback window to the earliest available data and follow-up was until December 31, 2022. The type of AH presentation was defined as diagnosis and discharge from the ED vs hospital admission.

We excluded those who had our outcomes before the first AH presentation (cirrhosis and/or decompensation using validated definitions in ICES data; history of liver transplant (LT) identified through billing claims (eTable 2 in Supplement 1) and those with an invalid health card number and no Ontario Health Insurance Plan eligibility. We also identified a cohort at risk of outcomes if they survived their first presentation of AH by further excluding individuals who died or developed cirrhosis and/or decompensation during their initial AH presentation or within 6 months after ED or hospital discharge to exclude prevalent disease.

### Validation of coding algorithms for the identification of patients hospitalized for alcoholic hepatitis using administrative data [^111CU9CR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The PPVs of diagnostic algorithms that included codes for cirrhosis and alcohol-related conditions in the administrative data are shown in Table 2. The PPVs tended to be higher for algorithms that included ascites (75%; 95% CI 63–86%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (62%; 95% CI 51–73%), and cirrhosis (60%; 95% CI 47–73%). In general, these PPVs improved when restricted to cases with an AH code in the primary diagnosis field and those with severe presentations (Table 2). However, the prevalence of these conditions in patients with confirmed AH was low, ranging from 29% for cirrhosis to 39% for gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The prevalence of codes for other cirrhosis and alcohol-related disorders were generally too low or their inclusion did not enhance the PPV of the algorithms (Table 2). For example, a diagnosis code for hepatic encephalopathy was recorded in only 2.5% of confirmed AH cases (4.2% of severe cases), and thus, the PPV of an algorithm including both an AH and hepatic encephalopathy code was only 50% (95% CI 12–88%). Stratification by year and hospital of admission did not indicate any consistent differences between PPVs for these algorithms (data not shown).

Table 3 outlines the performance characteristics of algorithms according to the number of cirrhosis and alcohol-related conditions recorded in the administrative data in addition to an AH diagnosis code. In patients with three or more associated conditions, the PPV for confirmed AH improved to 62% to 79%; however, only 6% to 34% of confirmed cases had this number of additional diagnoses in their administrative data.

K74.6 'Other and unspecified cirrhosis'

The ICD-10-AM code K74.6 'Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver' was present in 126 (40.9%) of admissions. Most encounters (95.2%) were in patients who had cirrhosis documented in the audited admission. The most common aetiology among encounters containing code K74.6 was NAFLD/NASH (42.9%); however, over one-third of these encounters were in patients who also had ALD, HCV or an 'other' concurrent aetiology (figure 1). Three encounters included code K74.6 in the absence of a documented CLD aetiology. These were all day procedures with minimal documentation in the medical record (n = 1 endoscopy and n = 2 large volume paracentesis). A further three encounters were assigned this code in the absence of documented cirrhosis (n = 2 day admissions for liver biopsy and n = 1 admission for ascites of cardiac origin).

Validation of an AH diagnosis based on administrative data

Of the 228 potential AH cases, 122 patients had confirmed AH based on medical record review, corresponding to a PPV of 54% (95% CI 47–60%). Overall, inter-rater agreement for an AH diagnosis was good (kappa 0.86; P < 0.001), and higher among patients with a severe (kappa 0.88; P < 0.001) versus mild (kappa 0.80; P < 0.002) presentation. Compared to unconfirmed cases, patients with confirmed AH had greater liver disease severity according to the Maddrey DF (45 vs. 12; P < 0.001) and MELD scores (21 vs. 13; P < 0.001); a higher prevalence of ascites (38% vs. 14%; P < 0.001); a lower prevalence of alcohol withdrawal (16% vs. 26%; P = 0.05); and greater 90-day and 180-day mortality (Table 1). Patients with confirmed AH also had greater median daily alcohol intake (121 vs. 112 g; P = 0.024), however, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients that had daily alcohol intake within the top quartile (24% vs. 25%; P = 0.87). Differences between confirmed and unconfirmed AH cases were not observed with respect to age, sex, admitting hospital, year of admission, or the remaining cirrhosis and alcohol-related complications (Table 1).

### Incidence and progression of alcohol-associated liver disease after medical therapy for alcohol use disorder [^112LZMfG]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Definitions of ALD and Addiction Treatment

We identified patients with ALD who had at least 1 of the following ICD-10 diagnosis codes: alcoholic hepatitis (K70.1), alcoholic cirrhosis of liver (K70.3), alcoholic hepatic failure (K70.4), alcoholic fibrosis and sclerosis (K70.2), other cirrhosis (K74.69), or unspecified cirrhosis (K74.60). We did not consider patients to have liver disease if they had a diagnosis of either alcoholic fatty liver (K70.0) or alcoholic liver disease–unspecified (K70.9) because many patients with moderate and high alcohol use develop hepatic steatosis, which has unclear clinical significance regarding liver-related morbidity and mortality.

We studied several medications for AUD: disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, gabapentin, baclofen, and topiramate. To narrow the focus on patients who received sustained pharmacotherapy, we included patients who received at least 3 prescriptions of a given pharmacotherapy. Patients were considered to be treated in each analysis if they initiated medical addiction therapy before the relevant outcome. Patients were considered to be untreated if they received no medical addiction therapy before the relevant outcome. The duration of a given therapy was the time between the first and the most recent prescription of medical addiction therapy. We also collected data on psychotherapy for AUD and accounted for them in the multivariable analyses (eTable 1 in the Supplement).

### Validation of coding algorithms for the identification of patients hospitalized for alcoholic hepatitis using administrative data [^112Jmnev]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Although the reference standard for the diagnosis of AH includes liver biopsy, this procedure is not part of the routine clinical management of patients with suspected AH in Calgary hospitals. Therefore, patients were considered to have a confirmed diagnosis of AH if they fulfilled all the following criteria based on history and laboratory investigations at hospital admission: 1) heavy alcohol consumption (> 196 g/week or > 56 g in any day among males, and > 98 g/week or > 42 g in any day among females); 2) elevated serum AST and/or ALT concentration, but < 300 IU/L (to exclude other disorders associated with acute hepatic dysfunction including acetaminophen toxicity); 3) serum bilirubin > 34 μmol/L; 4) elevated INR; and 5) exclusion of other causes of acute hepatic dysfunction (e.g. drug hepatotoxicity, autoimmune hepatitis, ischemic hepatitis, etc.). Patient with missing information on any of the above criteria are considered "Not AH". To confirm the inter-rater agreement of a diagnosis of AH according to these criteria, 21 patients were randomly selected and all three physicians reviewed their medical records. In cases of disagreement, a consensus was reached.

### Detecting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk factors in health databases: accuracy and limitations of the ICD-10-AM [^112DCkii]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

In our patient cohort, there was almost perfect concordance between administrative codes and documentation of T2DM in medical records. Recent studies examining hospital data from a trauma centreand cancer outcomes registryin Australia have also reported 'excellent' and 'substantial' agreement, respectively, between administrative data and medical records for T2DM. This high concordance is likely a consequence of the mandatory requirement to code T2DM when it is documented, as well as the need to monitor and treat this condition during the hospital admission.

Compared with NAFLD/NASH codes, overall accuracy of ICD-10-AM codes for other aetiologies of CLD was high, similar to findings in prior studies. While most patients with ALD cirrhosis were detected using codes F10.1 ' Harmful use of alcohol', K70.3 'Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver' and K70.4 'Alcoholic hepatic failure', 'grouped alcohol' codes had the best overall concordance (κ 0.75). Viral hepatitis codes B18.2 'Chronic viral hepatitis C' and B18.1 'Chronic viral hepatitis B without delta-agent' also had high concordance (κ ≥ 0.70), though the code for HBV identified several false-positive patients with previous exposure to HBV. We were not able to assess the accuracy of other viral hepatitis codes because they were not present in our sample.

Strengths of our study include the selection of a well-characterised cohort of patients with a diagnosis of cirrhosis confirmed by a healthcare provider. While it was outside the scope of the current study to assess the accuracy of clinical documentation, data abstraction from medical records was conducted by clinicians experienced in the management of CLD, including a hepatologist. The study was conducted using encounters at two tertiary hospitals that use electronic medical records. Therefore, a limitation of the study is that quality of clinical documentation and coding may differ from other smaller hospitals in regional areas that may use paper charts. However, regular internal auditing processes at a hospital, health service and jurisdictional level are regularly conducted for quality assurance purposes, which are supported by national data validation activities. Therefore, we are confident that our data represent an accurate sample of patients with cirrhosis in Southeast Queensland, Australia. The relatively small number of patients with HBV also limits conclusions.

### Alcohol-associated liver disease mortality [^114qzfQM]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major public health concern, accounting for one-quarter of cirrhosis-related deaths and becoming the leading indication for liver transplantation in the US, with concerning increases in mortality during and following the COVID-19 pandemic onset.

Objective

To evaluate comprehensive national trends in ALD mortality in the US from 1999 to 2022, with a particular focus on disparities related to sex, race, ethnicity, and age.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cross-sectional analysis used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research mortality database from 1999 to 2022, examining death certificates across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The study included individuals aged 25 years and older. Data analysis was performed from September to November 2024.

Exposure

ALD mortality was identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes (K70.xx) for both alcohol-associated hepatitis (K70.1x) and alcohol-associated cirrhosis (K70.3x).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes included age-adjusted annual mortality rates per 100 000 population, stratified by sex, age groups (25–44, 45–64, 65–84, and ≥ 85 years), race and ethnicity, and geographic regions. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to calculate average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) and to identify significant trend changes.

Results

In this study, a total of 436 814 ALD deaths were recorded (308 923 men [70.7%]), with ALD mortality increasing from 6.71 to 12.53 deaths per 100 000 between 1999 and 2022 and significant acceleration during 2018 to 2022 (annual percentage change [APC], 8.94%; 95% CI, 6.27% to 14.51%; P = 0.001). Women showed more rapid increases than men (AAPC, 4.29% [95% CI, 3.09% to 5.51%] vs 2.50% [95% CI, 1.51% to 3.51%]), whereas young adults (aged 25–44 years) demonstrated concerning trends (AAPC, 4.23%; 95% CI, 3.47% to 4.83%; P = 0.001). American Indian and Alaska Native populations experienced the highest mortality rates, increasing from 25.21 to 46.75 deaths per 100 000 (AAPC, 4.93%; 95% CI, 3.45% to 5.96%; P = 0.001). Alcohol-associated hepatitis mortality increased from 0.47 to 0.76 deaths per 100 000 (AAPC, 2.08%; 95% CI, 1.27% to 3.05%; P = 0.001), with women showing steeper increases than men (AAPC, 3.94% [95% CI, 2.58% to 5.46%] vs 1.56% [95% CI, 0.73% to 2.42%]). Alcohol-associated cirrhosis mortality increased from 4.09 to 9.52 deaths per 100 000 (AAPC, 4.00%; 95% CI, 3.63% to 4.40%; P = 0.001), with particularly concerning trends among women (APC from 2011 to 2022, 8.32%; 95% CI, 7.40% to 9.82%; P = 0.01) and adults aged 25 to 44 years (APC from 2018 to 2022, 19.51%; 95% CI, 15.00% to 28.53%; P = 0.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database, ALD mortality increased significantly across demographic groups, with particularly concerning trends among women, younger adults, and American Indian and Alaska Native populations. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted public health interventions and enhanced surveillance, especially given the sustained impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in alcohol consumption patterns.

Methods

Data Sources

This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies. We obtained national mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER). The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes E24.4, F10, G31.2, G62.1, G72.1, I42.6, K29.2, K70, K85.2, K86.0, R78.0, X45, X65, and Y15 were used to identify alcohol-related deaths recorded in the US between 1999 and 2020. Alcohol-induced causes specifically exclude deaths resulting from unintentional injuries, homicides, and other causes of death that are only indirectly or partially associated with alcohol use. A summary list of the ICD-10 codes, along with their descriptions and distributions, is provided in the eTable in Supplement 1. This study was deemed exempt from review and the requirement for informed consent by the Hofstra University institutional review board because the data obtained from the CDC WONDER are deidentified and publicly available.

We defined the study period as being from 1999 to 2020 based on data availability, with 2020 being the most recent year for which data are accessible. Crude or age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) were abstracted by age (15–24, 25–44, 45–64, or ≥ 65 years), sex (male or female), race and ethnicity (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, or non-Hispanic White), cause of death (alcohol poisoning, alcoholic liver disease, mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol, or other), and census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West).

Race and ethnicity data of the deceased individuals were collected from their death certificates, adhering to the guidelines set by the Office of Management and Budget. The information documented on the death certificate relied primarily on the input of the funeral director, a report by an informant or, in the absence of an informant, physical observation. Sex information is recorded as "male" or "female" in CDC WONDER and reflects mortality data obtained from death certificates. These certificates are collected by state registries and subsequently shared with the National Vital Statistics System for US residents.

Alcoholic hepatitis — liver biopsy role and classification indicate that a NIH-sponsored consensus proposed defining AH as definite, probable, or possible based on clinical features, confounding serology for other liver disease etiology, and liver histology; definite AH was categorized as a compatible clinical diagnosis with liver biopsy confirming the existence of criteria of AH, probable AH as classic clinical syndrome without confounding serology, and possible AH as clinically suspicious with confounding factors or uncertain alcohol use. It was proposed that patients with possible AH should undergo liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, especially if specific pharmacologic interventions are proposed.

### Alcohol drinking patterns and liver cirrhosis risk: analysis of the prospective UK million women study [^111bzn7m]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Added value of this study

This large prospective study with long follow-up permitted detailed examination of cirrhosis risk in relation to the amount of alcohol consumed, consumption with meals, and the frequency of consumption, adjusted for drinking patterns and other potential confounding factors. During a mean of 15 years (SD 3) of follow-up of 401 806 UK women who consumed alcohol, 1560 developed or died from cirrhosis. As expected, cirrhosis risk increased with the amount of alcohol consumed. After allowing for the amount consumed, the excess risk of cirrhosis was consistently lower among those who usually drank alcohol with meals, both overall (RR 0.69, p < 0.0001) and separately in women who drank wine only and all other drinkers. Among women who drank seven or more alcoholic drinks per week, the excess risk of cirrhosis was greater with daily consumption than with less frequent consumption (RR 1.61, p < 0.0001). Drinking daily and not with meals was associated with a doubling of cirrhosis risk.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our study confirms that even moderate levels of alcohol consumption increase the risk of cirrhosis. It also shows that, after adjusting for the amount of alcohol consumed, this excess incidence of cirrhosis is higher if consumption is usually without meals or with daily drinking.

Women were excluded from the analyses if, before baseline, they were registered with cancer, except non-melanoma skin cancer (n = 47 378), or if, at or before baseline, they self-reported or had a hospital admission with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis (WHO International Classification of Diseases tenth revision [ICD-10] codes K70, K73, and K74; n = 1369) or viral hepatitis (ICD-10 B15–B19; n = 723). Women were also excluded if, at baseline, they did not report the number of alcoholic drinks they consumed per week (n = 106 329) or if they did not report whether they usually drank the alcohol with meals (n = 42 114).

The study was approved by the Oxford and Anglia multicentre research ethics committee, and all participants provided written consent for follow-up. Access to hospital admission data was approved by NHS Digital in England and by the Information Services Division in Scotland.

### Predictors of leaving against medical advice in patients with alcohol-related hepatitis [^1168VANi]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Data source

We obtained data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, the largest openly accessible all-payer inpatient healthcare database in the United States (US). The NIS database was created by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) to frame health policies at the federal, state and county levels. The HCUP is a program developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. It contains de-identified hospitalization records for more than 7 million unweighted annual hospital stays and 35 million weighted annual hospitalizations in the US. We included data for hospitalizations from 2016–2019.

Study population

Patients from the dataset were selected based on the codes of the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification-10 th Revision (ICD-10-CM), which can be found in. Patients hospitalized with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of alcohol-related hepatitis were included in the study (ICD-10-CM codes K70.4 and K70.1). We excluded patients for whom data on age, race, sex, primary insurance status or income were missing. We also excluded pregnant patients, patients aged less than 18 years, patients transferred out to another facility, and those who died during the hospitalization.

Study outcomes and variables

The primary outcome of the study was to assess the percentage of patients who LAMA. We collected data on patient demographics such as age, race, insurance status and income quartile. Data were collected on hospital characteristics such as region, hospital size, the location of the hospital, as well as whether the institution is academic or not. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to identify the comorbidity burden between the 2 groups. Data were also collected on the common conditions associated with alcoholic hepatitis, such as HIV, substance abuse, hepatitis C and tobacco use. We also collected information on complications and common infections in these patients, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), ascites and variceal bleeding. Data were also collected on the interventions done on these patients, such as blood transfusion, endoscopy, colonoscopy, need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

Results

Patient characteristics

A total of 228 patients were hospitalized in the Calgary region between January 2008 and August 2012 with a diagnosis code for AH (71% [n = 161] as the primary diagnosis). Their characteristics are outlined in Table 1. The median age was 49 years (interquartile range [IQR] 43–55) and 61% of the cohort was male. A similar proportion was hospitalized at each of the three adult hospitals in Calgary (P = 0.69). The majority of cases (62%, n = 142) had a severe presentation. Overall, median length of stay was 7 days (IQR 5–15) and in-hospital mortality was 6% (n = 13). Compared with those with a mild presentation, patients with a severe presentation had a prolonged median LOS (5 vs. 10 days; P < 0.001) and greater in-hospital mortality (0% vs. 9%; P = 0.002).

### Detecting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk factors in health databases: accuracy and limitations of the ICD-10-AM [^1159mAru]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Interestingly in this 'real-world' study, a substantial proportion of patients with NAFLD (48.4%) had a concurrent liver disease, particularly alcohol excess or chronic HCV. Although the currently accepted nomenclature by the American and European Associations for the Study of Liver Diseases excludes excessive alcohol consumption or other liver diseases in the definition of NAFLD, there is increasing acceptance that NAFLD often coexists with other hepatic disorders. In fact, the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver has recently endorsed a proposal to redefine NAFLD based on the detection of steatosis together with the presence of overweight/obesity, or T2DM, or clinical evidence of metabolic dysfunction ('metabolic-associated fatty liver disease' or 'MAFLD'), regardless of alcohol consumption or other concomitant liver disease. Recognition of dual aetiology is important because coexistent NAFLD has a synergistic role in liver disease progressionand may increase the risk of cardiometabolic problems. However, lack of clarity about the terminology (NAFLD vs MAFLD) or its diagnosis in the presence of coexisting liver diseases may result in under-reporting of the true burden of NAFLD and highlights the need for consensus within the hepatology community and appropriate dissemination of this information.

Our data show that notation of 'obesity' in the medical records was poor (based on recorded BMI in clinical documentation) and was largely responsible for the low sensitivity of obesity codes. These findings support a recent study from Australia that examined the agreement between medical records and ICD-10-AM comorbidity codes in trauma patients. The authors found that, based on clinician documentation, the prevalence of obesity was only 9.3% (compared with the Australian population prevalence of 31%), with an even lower prevalence based on administrative data. Multiple previous studies have also shown that the completeness of ICD diagnosis coding for overweight/obesity is low compared with its prevalence in medical records based on clinical weight/height or BMI measurements. Although it is a potential risk factor for many diseases, obesity is not usually the primary cause of admission and may therefore be overlooked by clinicians when registering diagnoses. This systemic under-reporting currently limits the value of using administrative coding for obesity as part of an 'extended definition' of NAFLD in patients admitted with cirrhosis. Further review of coding practices and improved clinician documentation of BMI and obesity is urgently required in order to improve reporting of obesity in healthcare administrative databases.

### Changing trends of hospitalisation of liver cirrhosis in beijing, China [^1155ukCn]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Study patients

We obtained 3 821 987 hospitalisation records for the years 2006–2010. Because the unit of analysis is an individual patient rather than a hospitalisation record when hospitalisation rate is calculated, we selected the first hospitalisation record of each patient as study record. After excluding readmission, a total of 2 517 628 hospitalised patients were included in the study. Furthermore, we also excluded inpatients who were younger than 20 years of age (N = 227 484), and then had 2 290 144 hospitalised patients (988 178 men and 1 301 966 women).

On the basis of the hospitalised patient population, we used ICD-10 K70.2, K70.3 and K74 codes to identify hospitalisation records on liver cirrhosis occurring in any of the eight listed diagnostic codes. A total of 26 691 records with liver cirrhosis were identified. To better conduct analyses, we excluded records with missing data on Chinese diagnostic name (N = 53) and records with a diagnosis of schistosomiasis (N = 90). After these exclusions, 26 548 hospitalised patients with liver cirrhosis remained (18 371 men and 8177 women).

To explore the cause of trend, we distinguished viral hepatitis cirrhosis from non-viral hepatitis cirrhosis by examining whether patients had a diagnosis of viral hepatitis (ICD-10 codes: B15 — B19, Z22.5) in any of the eight diagnoses. Lastly, we acquired 15 404 patients with viral hepatitis cirrhosis and 7621 with non-viral hepatitis cirrhosis. In addition, we also acquired 3523 hospitalised patients with non-viral hepatitis alcoholic cirrhosis (K70.2 and K70.3).

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113vXZDg]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidance — purpose and scope describe alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) as a spectrum from hepatic steatosis to alcoholic hepatitis (AH), alcohol-associated cirrhosis (AC), and acute AH presenting as acute-on-chronic liver failure, with progression dependent on continued heavy alcohol use and risk factors including female sex, genetic susceptibility, diet, and comorbid liver disease. The guidance notes that a change from the term "alcoholic" to "alcohol-associated" will help reduce stigma and that "alcohol-associated liver disease, alcohol-associated steatohepatitis, and alcohol-associated cirrhosis are suggested", retaining ALD, ASH, and AC. It states that "This 2019 ALD Guidance provides a data-supported approach to the prevalence, clinical spectrum, diagnosis, and clinical management of ALD and alcohol use disorders (AUDs)", developed by expert panel consensus, and that the quality and strength of guidance statements "are not formally rated"; updates to the prior guidance include emphasis on AUD definition, screening and treatment, new alcohol biomarkers, and additional genetic and environmental susceptibility factors.

### Higher-than-expected burden of alcohol-related liver diseases during COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, with a tapering trend [^112B2oe6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an increase in alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the magnitude of ALD hospitalization surge during the pandemic in the USA.

Main Measures

A retrospective trend analysis of adult hospitalizations for ALD at acute care hospitals across the USA in 2016–2020 was conducted. Hospitalizations were identified using the International Classification of Diseases 10 codes for ALD and non-alcoholic-related liver disease. Outcomes measured included the predicted monthly volume of hospitalizations for ALD and inpatient mortality rates.

Key Results

During the 2020 pandemic, monthly ALD hospitalizations reached 10,247 representing a 20.7% increase compared to pre-pandemic monthly average of 8490. Additional 4163 ALD hospitalizations occurred during the pandemic, in addition to a pre-pandemic uptrend. The peak of excess ALD hospitalizations was from May to October (monthly excess of 1138) decreasing to monthly excess of 280 in November and December. The excess increase in ALD hospitalizations was primarily observed in young adults, totaling 5256 cases affecting both male (2101 excess cases) and females (2041 excess cases). The age-standardized monthly mortality rate during the pandemic was notably higher than expected at 0.9% (95% CI 0.4 to 1.4%).

Conclusions

The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in ALD hospitalizations, above and beyond the pre-existing upward trend, which tapered towards the end of 2020, suggesting a possible decline in the pandemic's impact. The excess increase in ALD hospitalizations was observed primarily in young adults and affected both males and females. These findings highlight the need for further attention to the long-term consequences of the pandemic.

### Liver abnormalities following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children 1 to 10 years of age [^11131qic]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of study population before and after matching (age 1–10 years)

Table 2 summarises the counts and hazard of hepatic complications after COVID-19 versus ORI for both age groups (1–4 years, 1–10 years) for all cases and for the subset with an associated hospitalisation. During the 1–6 months after the encounter diagnosis for the respiratory infection, patients with COVID-19 had a significantly greater hazard of elevated AST or ALT, and TBili with HR point estimates ranging from 2.13 to 4.40. HR point estimates were significantly increased for the composite outcome of diseases of the liver or viral hepatitis (K70–K77, B15–19: HR point estimate range, 1.48–4.50), and for diseases of the liver alone (K70–K77: HR point estimate range, 1.67–4.38). Few encounters were coded with the following ICD-10 encounter diagnoses: alcoholic liver disease (K70); toxic liver disease (K71); hepatic failure, not elsewhere classified (K72) (except for all patients aged 1–10 years with 12 in the COVID-19 cohort and 10 in the ORI cohort (HR (CI) 11.42 (1.49 to 87.83))); chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified (K73); fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver (K74). ICD-10 terms with sufficient counts to allow comparison had elevated HRs: other inflammatory diseases of the liver (K75: HR point estimate range, 2.85–9.85) which includes autoimmune hepatitis (K75.4) and other specified inflammatory liver diseases (K75.8); and other diseases of the liver (K76: HR point estimate range, 1.46–3.97) which includes fatty change of liver, not elsewhere classified (K76.0). The composite outcome of ICD-10 codes used for surveillance of hepatitis of unspecified aetiology surveillance also had significantly elevated HRs (HR point estimate range, 2.62–6.23). All HRs had 95% CIs that were greater than 1 except the outcome of other inflammatory diseases of the liver in the 1–4 years age group. The Cox proportionality assumption at p ≥ 0.05 was met for all comparisons except elevated ALT/AST for 1–4 years age group with inpatient stay (p = 0.049), and elevated TBil for 1–10 years age group with inpatient stay (p = 0.01). A comparison of these outcomes without excluding patients with the encounter diagnosis for one of these outcomes during the acute period had increased RR estimates for all comparisons. See online supplemental eTable 4. Analyses conducted with cohorts of patients without excluding patients with pre-existing liver abnormalities showed similar results. Furthermore, additional ICD-10 terms had sufficient counts to report from this analysis, showing an elevated risk in the COVID-19 cohort for viral hepatitis (B15–B19) and hepatic failure, not otherwise classified (K72). See online supplemental eTable 5.

### Binge-pattern alcohol consumption and genetic risk as determinants of alcohol-related liver disease [^113YC2rH]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Liver-related endpoints

The primary objective was to investigate the relationship between pattern of alcohol consumption, genetic factors, and risk of alcohol-related cirrhosis (ARC; ICD-10 codes K70.2, K70.3, and K70.9). A secondary objective was to similarly investigate associations between pattern of alcohol consumption, genetic factors, and risk of alcoholic hepatitis (AH; K70.1). Importantly, less advanced stages of ARLD, such as alcoholic fatty liver (K70.0), were excluded. Baseline data was linked to hospital episode statistics and national mortality register, which are provided in the UK Biobank dataset. The primary endpoint event for this study was first liver-related hospitalization or death due to ARC. Secondary outcomes included first hospitalization or death due to AH.

Polygenic risk score

We searched the PRS Catalog for alcoholic liver cirrhosis and selected the score with the best performance indicator at the time (May 2022). This was a PRS based on a weighted combination of multiple biomarker polygenic scores using 183,271 genetic variants. The PRS was calculated as the linear combination of the beta (i.e. weight) coefficient multiplied by the number of effect alleles an individual carries for each genetic variant using PLINK2. Further details of the PRS are available at:(risk score ID: PGS000704). The PRS was normally distributed across participants (Supplemental Fig. 1) and grouped according to quintiles as low risk (quintile 1), middle risk (quintiles 2, 3, and 4), and high risk (quintile 5).

Covariates

Diabetes mellitus and obesity have been shown to contribute to risk of ARLD, and consequently both these factors were adjusted for in our models. Diabetes was physician-diagnosed, at baseline, and reported as a binary variable. Body mass index (BMI) was also calculated at baseline and categorized into < 18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, and ≥ 30 kg/m 2. Other covariates adjusted for included sex, age, ethnicity (white vs. non-white), area-deprivation based on a Townsend score — a standard measure of area deprivation that was assigned based on participants' residence and included as a continuous variable. Self-reported smoking status (never smokers/ex-smokers/current smokers) and physical activity based on the number of days engaged in vigorous activity for 10 min or more categorized into approximately equal groups (0/1–2/3–7 days).

### Weekend admission and mortality for gastrointestinal disorders across england and wales [^116U4aK5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal disorders

The study covered all 'major' GI disorders that carry substantial mortality. These were defined by a principal ICD-10 diagnostic category at discharge that led to at least 50 deaths in England and Wales within 30 days of acute hospitalization during the study interval. Nineteen ICD-10 categories relating to GI disorders fulfilled these criteria. These were designated as 'general surgical or medical GI disorders' (11 conditions), 'hepatic disorders' (2) and 'GI malignancy' (6).

The 11 general surgical or medical GI disorders were: upper GI bleeding, perforated peptic ulcer and peritonitis, gastritis, non-hiatal hernia, inflammatory bowel disease, non-infective gastroenteritis, intestinal obstruction, diverticular disease, gallstone disease, acute pancreatitis and intestinal infections.

The hepatic disorders were alcoholic liver disease and hepatic failure, which were also grouped together as 'severe liver disease', as they are the most life-threatening forms of liver disease (ICD-10 codes are shown in Appendix S1, supporting information). Additionally, alcoholic liver disease was differentiated according to the following aetiologies, which each led to more than 50 deaths at 30 days in England and Wales: alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis of liver and alcoholic hepatic failure. GI malignancies were assessed overall and by major cancers (oesophageal, gastric, colorectal, liver, pancreatic and gallbladder).

### Detecting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk factors in health databases: accuracy and limitations of the ICD-10-AM [^111pCxC5]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ICD-10-AM codes

In the ICD-10-AM, two codes may be used to record NAFLD/NASH: K75.8 'Other specified inflammatory liver diseases (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)' and K76.0 'Fatty (change of) liver, not elsewhere classified (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease)'. NAFLD/NASH cirrhosis may also attract code K74.6 'Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver'. Obesity may be represented by ICD-10-AM codes under the E66 code block or by the chronic condition supplementary code U78.1. T2DM codes are contained in the E11 code block. Codes for other causes of CLD are outlined in table 1.

Table 1
ICD-10-AM codes for aetiologies of chronic liver disease

All ICD-10-AM codes were obtained from the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection registry (QHAPDC) for every hospital encounter within the study cohort during a minimum 12-month follow-up period. For the current study, one encounter was randomly selected for each patient to be included in the audit sample. In a subset of patients who had ≥ 1 encounter with and ≥ 1 encounter without code K74.6, a second encounter was selected (one encounter containing code K74.6 and one encounter that did not contain code K74.6) to ensure the sample contained a representative number of patients with possible NAFLD.

In Australia, assignment of ICD-10-AM diagnosis codes is impacted by the Australian Coding Standards, which stipulate the condition must be either the chief reason for admission or required commencement, alteration or adjustment of therapeutic treatment, diagnostic procedures or increased clinical care and/or monitoring during the encounter. T2DM and HCV are exceptions to this assignment process, as these conditions are always coded when documented. In addition, a supplementary 'U' coding capability was introduced on 1 July 2015, to capture conditions (such as obesity) that contribute to a patient's health status during the admission, but do not otherwise meet the criteria for coding. The index pathway used by coders for coding of cirrhosis, CLD aetiology, obesity and T2DM remained consistent during the audited time period.

### ICD-10-AM codes for cirrhosis and related complications: key performance considerations for population and healthcare studies [^116XGCXH]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Objective

The utility of International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) codes relies on the accuracy of clinical reporting and administrative coding, which may be influenced by country-specific codes and coding rules. This study explores the accuracy and limitations of the Australian Modification of the 10th revision of ICD (ICD-10-AM) to detect the presence of cirrhosis and a subset of key complications for the purpose of future large-scale epidemiological research and healthcare studies.

Design/Method

ICD-10-AM codes in a random sample of 540 admitted patient encounters at a major Australian tertiary hospital were compared with data abstracted from patients' medical records by four blinded clinicians. Accuracy of individual codes and grouped combinations was determined by calculating sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value and Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ).

Results

The PPVs for 'grouped cirrhosis' codes (0.96), hepatocellular carcinoma (0.97) ascites (0.97) and 'grouped varices' (0.95) were good (κ all > 0.60). However, codes under-detected the prevalence of cirrhosis, ascites and varices (sensitivity 81.4%, 61.9% and 61.3%, respectively). Overall accuracy was lower for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ('grouped' PPV 0.75; κ 0.73) and the poorest for encephalopathy ('grouped' PPV 0.55; κ 0.21). To optimise detection of cirrhosis-related encounters, an ICD-10-AM code algorithm was constructed and validated in an independent cohort of 116 patients with known cirrhosis.

Conclusion

Multiple ICD-10-AM codes should be considered when using administrative databases to study the burden of cirrhosis and its complications in Australia, to avoid underestimation of the prevalence, morbidity, mortality and related resource utilisation from this burgeoning chronic disease.

### Medical management of severe alcoholic hepatitis: expert Review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA institute [^116d6Efn]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute alcoholic hepatitis — patient counseling points emphasize that patients should be encouraged to abstain completely from drinking but offered support even if they fail to achieve abstinence because a reduction in alcohol consumption improves survival, adequate nutrition including calories and protein is necessary for recovery from AH, and patients who drink alcohol at hazardous levels (> 40 g/day) should be advised to report jaundice as soon as it develops because this symptom is a harbinger of serious injury.

### NASH is the most rapidly growing etiology for acute-on-chronic liver failure-related hospitalization and disease burden in the United States: a population-based study [^111282UE]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by multiple organ failure (OF) with high short-term mortality. There is lack of population-based data on trends on etiology specific ACLF related burden. National Inpatient Sample (2006–2014) was queried using ICD-09 codes for admissions with cirrhosis and ACLF (≥ 2 extrahepatic OF). Of 1,928,764 admissions for cirrhosis between 2006 and 2014, 112,174 (5.9%) had ACLF (4.5%, 1.2%, and 0.2% with ACLF 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The brain was the most common OF in 11.9%, followed by respiratory failure in 7.7%, cardiac failure in 6.3%, and renal failure in 5.6%. ACLF increased by 24% between 2006 and 2014 with a 63% increase in 179,104 patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis (3.5% to 5.7%); a 28% increase in patients with 429,306 alcoholic cirrhosis (5.6% to 7.2%); a 25% increase in patients with 1,091,053 with other etiologies (5.2% to 6.5%); and no significant change in 229,301 patients with viral hepatitis (VH) (4.0% to 4.1%). In-hospital mortality was higher among ACLF patients compared with patients without ACLF (44% versus 4.7%; P < 0.0001). Each NASH-related ACLF patient compared with other etiologies had a longer mean length of stay (14 versus 12 days), was associated with higher median total charges (US $151,196 versus US $134,597), and had more frequent use of dialysis (45% versus 36%) and longterm care (32% versus 26%; P < 0.0001 for all). Results remained similar in a subgroup analysis after including half of admissions with cryptogenic cirrhosis as NASH. In conclusion, NASH cirrhosis is the most rapidly growing indication for ACLF-related hospitalization and use of hospital resources. In the setting of improved treatment options for chronic hepatitis, the health care burden of chronic viral-related liver disease remains stable. Population-based strategies are needed to reduce the health care burden of cirrhosis, particularly related to NASH.

### Limitations of conventionally derived chronic liver disease mortality rates: results of a comprehensive assessment [^1165f2LL]. Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Standard death certificate-based methods for ascertaining deaths due to chronic liver disease (CLD), such as the U.S. vital statistics approach, rely on a limited set of diagnostic codes to define CLD. These codes do not include viral hepatitis or consider hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) deaths, and thus, underestimate the true burden of CLD mortality. Deaths associated with CLD may be further misunderstood because of the inherent limitations of death record information. Using a comprehensive list of CLD-related codes to search death records, we investigated the CLD mortality rate and associated etiologies (derived from medical records) in a large managed care health plan. From the 16,970 deaths among health plan members in 2000, we confirmed 355 (2.1%) as CLD related, including 75 with HCC. The age-adjusted CLD mortality rate using the comprehensive codes was 11.9 per 100,000 compared with 6.3 per 100,000 using only conventional codes. Based on medical records, the underlying CLD was attributed to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in 44% of deaths, HCV infection with ALD in 16%, HCV without ALD in 18%, and chronic HBV infection in 7%. Only 64% of HCV-associated, 48% of HBV-associated, and 64% of ALD-associated deaths ascertained by medical record had that specific etiology mentioned on the death certificate.

Conclusion

CLD mortality burden was almost doubled by using a comprehensive list of mortality codes and considering HCC deaths as CLD related. Furthermore, the contributions of viral hepatitis and ALD to CLD mortality may be underestimated if based solely on death records.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^111YKHvC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Alcoholic liver disease — clinical spectrum, diagnosis, severity, and management highlights are as follows: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications, and most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages with limited data on early disease. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. Alcoholic hepatitis presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice and, in severe cases, may transition to acute on chronic liver failure with risk for mortality that may be as high as 20–50% at 1 month depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH, and long-term mortality is related to the severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures for hospitalized ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation is a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis and may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.

### A call to standardize definitions, data collection, and outcome assessment to improve care in alcohol-related liver disease [^116vVb9f]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is highly prevalent and appears to be increasingly reported with worsening mortality; thus, optimizing care in this patient population is imperative. This will require a multidisciplinary, multifaceted approach that includes recognizing alcohol use disorder (AUD) and existing treatments for AUD. We must also acknowledge the full spectrum of ALD clinically and histologically. For example, our current clinical definitions of alcohol-related hepatitis (AH) do not address that > 95% of severe AH occurs in the setting of cirrhosis with < 60% of liver explants having hepatitis. Given that the majority of ALD studies rely on clinical diagnosis and lack pathologic confirmation, prior data on the efficacy of medical treatment or use of transplantation are likely limited by intertrial and intratrial heterogeneity. Added limitations of the current field include the inconsistent reporting of relapse with the use of varying definitions and unreliable assessments. Moreover, studies fail to consistently capture the data variables that likely influence the main outcomes of interest in this population-mortality and relapse-and a global effort to create a standardized data collection tool moving forward could help effectively and efficiently aid in the advancement of this field. Conclusion: To optimize patient care and make best use of a limited resource, a systematic change in the approach to research in this population must be undertaken that creates consistent definitions for use in future research to generate reliable and reproducible results. With this in mind, we concisely reviewed the literature to summarize the current state of treating and managing ALD, the heterogeneity in definitions, and the significant opportunities for clinical and research improvement.

### Validation of coding algorithms for the identification of patients hospitalized for alcoholic hepatitis using administrative data [^111WXxW6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Data extraction and definition of AH

Admissions were randomly assigned to one of three physicians experienced in the care of patients with AH (MB, ER, JP) who reviewed the paper and electronic medical records for each individual to confirm the diagnosis of AH during their index admission. Using a structured data collection instrument, the following details were recorded: age, sex, year and site of hospitalization, liver biochemistry (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase [GGT], bilirubin, albumin concentrations, and international normalized ratio [INR]) and serum creatinine at admission, clinical evidence of hepatic encephalopathy (based on the impression of the attending physician) or ascites (detected clinically or radiologically), and self-reported recent average daily alcohol intake. Since alcohol intake varied throughout some medical records, a hierarchical approach was taken. Specifically, data was first taken from consultation notes by addictions specialists where available, followed by the admission history, and otherwise, from patient progress notes. The severity of hepatic dysfunction was described using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and Maddrey DF, validated prognostic scoring systems for patients with AH. Patients with a Maddrey DF ≥ 32 and/or the presence of hepatic encephalopathy were classified as severe. Length of stay (LOS) and mortality (in-hospital and at 90 and 180 days) were also recorded.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) — consensus clinical criteria and categories — define clinical diagnosis by onset of jaundice within prior 8 weeks; ongoing consumption of > 40 (female) or 60 (male) g alcohol/day for ≥ 6 months with < 60 days of abstinence before the onset of jaundice; AST > 50, AST/ALT > 1.5, and both values < 400 IU/L; and serum total bilirubin > 3.0 mg/dL. Potential confounding factors include possible ischemic hepatitis (e.g., severe upper gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension, or cocaine use within 7 days), possible drug-induced liver disease (suspect drug within 30 days of onset of jaundice), uncertain alcohol use assessment, and presence of atypical laboratory tests such as AST < 50 or > 400 IU/L, AST/ALT < 1.5, ANA > 1:160 or SMA > 1:80. Categorization includes Definite AH (clinically diagnosed and biopsy proven), Probable AH (clinically diagnosed without potential confounding factors), and Possible AH (clinically diagnosed with potential confounding factors); biopsy needed for confirmation of AH.

Exclusion Criteria

Criteria for exclusion from the UKB cohort were missing body mass index (BMI), age, and survival data; HIV (ICD-10 codes B20-B24); or chronic hepatitis (ICD-10 code B18) (Figure). We excluded individuals with any liver disease diagnosis (ICD-10 codes K70, alcohol-associated liver disease; K71, toxic liver disease; K72, hepatic failure, not elsewhere classified; K73, chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified; K74, fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver; K75, other inflammatory liver diseases; K76, other diseases of liver; and K77, liver disorders in diseases classified elsewhere) or HCC (ICD-10 code C22.0) at baseline as well as pathological alcohol consumption (> 60 g/d for men and > 40 g/d for women). Alcohol consumption and quantity were evaluated using a cascading questionnaire. First, it was determined how often alcoholic beverages were consumed. The second question was asked when a choice other than never was given and referred to the amount of alcohol consumed in a day. A drink was evaluated by the UKB as 1 U of alcohol. The third question asked how many alcohol-containing drinks were consumed on a typical day when drinking. Response options included 1 or 2; 3 or 4; 5 or 6; 7, 8, or 9; or 10 or more.

### Hepatitis D-associated hospitalizations in the United States: 2010–2018 [^1116QhUX]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

In the United States, hepatitis D is not a reportable condition, leading to gaps in epidemiological and clinical knowledge. We aim to estimate the incidence of hepatitis D-associated hospitalizations in the United States and describe the clinical, demographic and geographic characteristics of those hospitalizations. We utilized hospitalization data from the 2010–2018 National Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Hepatitis D and hepatitis B only (HBV only) hospitalizations were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. We identified 3825 hepatitis D-associated hospitalizations. The hospitalization rate of hepatitis D was between 6.9 and 20.7 per 10,000,000 but did not change significantly over time. Compared to HBV only, the hepatitis D cohort had a greater proportion of males, Hispanics, hospitalizations in the Northeast region. The hepatitis D-associated hospitalizations also had significantly greater frequencies of liver failure, non-alcoholic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, ascites and thrombocytopenia. While mortality in hepatitis D was similar to that of HBV only, age > 65 years (odds ratio [OR] = 3.79; p = .020) and having a diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis (OR = 3.37; p = .044) increased the odds of mortality within the hepatitis D cohort. Although the hepatitis D-associated hospitalizations were relatively uncommon, they were associated with severe complications.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113sRip8]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) prevalence and burden — key United States and international estimates are reported. In the United States, mortality due to ALD was estimated at 5.5 per 100,000 in 2012, and alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) mortality increased from 2008 to 2016, particularly among patients ages 25–34 years old. Cirrhotic and noncirrhotic ALD prevalence has been estimated at approximately 2% in the general US population, with AC estimated at 327 per 100,000 enrollees in the US Veterans' population and approximately 100 per 100,000 enrollees in privately insured US patients. Worldwide, AC deaths account for about 10% of all alcohol-attributable deaths, resulting in the loss of 22.2 million disability-adjusted life years annually, and in the United States ALD competes with chronic HCV as the leading indication for liver transplantation. Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) burden indicators also rose: US admissions for AH increased to 0.83% of all admissions for 2010, Denmark's AH incidence during 1999–2008 rose from 37 to 46 per million persons per year in men and 24 to 34 per million persons per year for women, and Finland reported increases from 37 to 65 cases per million persons per year for men and from 13 to 27 cases per million persons per year for women. In women, AC prevalence may be increasing at a faster rate than in men.

### Underestimation of liver transplantation for alcoholic hepatitis in the national transplant database [^116pEuYr]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) can be coded in United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) as either alcoholic cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis (AH), without having specific criteria to assign either diagnosis. In this multicenter American Consortium of Early Liver Transplantation for Alcoholic Hepatitis (ACCELERATE-AH) study, we sought to assess the concordance of the clinician diagnosis of AH at liver transplantation (LT) listing versus UNOS data entry of AH as listing diagnosis. In a prior study, consecutive early LT recipients transplanted for AH between 2012 and 2017 were identified by chart review at 10 ACCELERATE-AH sites. In this current study, these same LT recipients were identified in the UNOS database. The primary UNOS diagnostic code was evaluated for concordance with the chart-review assignment of AH. In cases where the primary listing diagnosis in UNOS was not AH, we determined the reason for alternate classification. Among 124 ACCELERATE-AH LT recipients with a chart-review diagnosis of AH, only 43/124 (35%) had AH as listing diagnosis in UNOS; 80 (64%) were listed as alcoholic cirrhosis, and 1 (1%) as fulminant hepatic necrosis. Of the 81 patients missing AH as a UNOS listing diagnosis code, the reasons for alternate classification were 44 (54%) due to a lack of awareness of a separate diagnosis code for AH; 13 (16%) due to concomitant clinical diagnosis of AH and alcoholic cirrhosis in the chart; 12 (15%) due to clinical uncertainty regarding the diagnosis of AH versus acute decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis; and 12 (15%) due to a data entry error. In conclusion, in a large cohort of LT recipients with AH, only 35% were documented as such in UNOS. Increased education and awareness for those performing UNOS data entry, the establishment of specific criteria to define AH in the UNOS database, and the ability to document dates of alcohol use would allow future research on ALD to be more informative.

### Alcohol-related mortality in deprived UK cities: worrying trends in young women challenge recent national downward trends [^117M2Xf9]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources

Scottish population and death data were obtained from the National Records of Scotland. Death data by local authority were available from 1979, and population data from 1981. Population and death data for Liverpool and Manchester were obtained from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Definitions

Current local authority boundaries were used to define cities. Seven birth cohorts were included in the analysis, those born in decades 1910–1919; 1920–1929, 1930–1939; 1940–1949; 1950–1959, 1960–1969 and 1970–1979.

Alcohol-related deaths were defined using the ONS definition (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes: F10 (mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol), G31.2 (degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol), G62.1 (alcoholic polyneuropathy), I42.6 (alcoholic cardiomyopathy), K29.2 (alcoholic gastritis), K70 (alcoholic liver disease), K73 (chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified), K74 excluding K74.3–K74.5 (fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver, excluding biliary cirrhosis), K86.0 (alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis), X45 (accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol), X65 (intentional self-poisoning by and exposure to alcohol) and Y15 (poisoning by and exposure to alcohol, undetermined intent). ICD-9 codes: Alcohol-related deaths are defined using the ICD-9 codes: 291 (alcoholic psychoses), 303 (alcohol dependence syndrome), 305.0 (non-dependent abuse of alcohol), 425.5 (alcoholic cardiomyopathy), 571.0 (alcoholic fatty liver), 571.1 (acute alcoholic hepatitis), 571.2 (alcoholic cirrhosis of liver), 571.3 (alcoholic liver damage, unspecified), 571.4 (chronic hepatitis), 571.5 (cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol), 571.8 (other chronic non-alcoholic liver disease), 571.9 (unspecified chronic liver disease without mention of alcohol) and E860 (accidental poisoning by alcohol).

### Trends in the burden of chronic liver disease among hospitalized US adults [^115x6dQr]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

One factor associated with the rapidly increasing clinical and economic burden of chronic liver disease (CLD) is inpatient health care utilization.

Objective

To understand trends in the hospitalization burden of CLD in the US.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study of hospitalized adults in the US used data from the National Inpatient Sample from 2012 to 2016 on adult CLD-related hospitalizations. Data were analyzed from June to October 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Hospitalizations identified using a comprehensive review of CLD-specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Survey-weighted annual trends in national estimates of CLD-related hospitalizations, in-hospital mortality, and hospitalization costs, stratified by demographic and clinical characteristics.

Results

This study included 1 016 743 CLD-related hospitalizations (mean [SD] patient age, 57.4 [14.4] years; 582 197 [57.3%] male; 633 082 [62.3%] white). From 2012 to 2016, the rate of CLD-related hospitalizations per 100 000 hospitalizations increased from 3056 (95% CI, 3042–3069) to 3757 (95% CI, 3742–3772), and total inpatient hospitalization costs increased from $14.9 billion (95% CI, $13.9 billion to $15.9 billion) to $18.8 billion (95% CI, $17.6 billion to $20.0 billion). Mean (SD) patient age increased (56.8 [14.2] years in 2012 to 57.8 [14.6] years in 2016) and, subsequently, the proportion with Medicare also increased (41.7% [95% CI, 41.1%-42.2%] to 43.6% [95% CI, 43.1%-44.1%]) (P for trend < .001 for both). The proportion of hospitalizations of patients with hepatitis C virus was similar throughout the period of study (31.6% [95% CI, 31.3%-31.9%]), and the proportion with alcoholic cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease showed increases. The mortality rate was higher among hospitalizations with alcoholic cirrhosis (11.9% [95% CI, 11.7%-12.0%]) compared with other etiologies. Presence of hepatocellular carcinoma was also associated with a high mortality rate (9.8% [95% CI, 9.5%-10.1%]). Cost burden increased across all etiologies, with a higher total cost burden among hospitalizations with alcoholic cirrhosis ($22.7 billion [95% CI, $22.1 billion to $23.2 billion]) or hepatitis C virus ($22.6 billion [95% CI, $22.1 billion to $23.2 billion]). Presence of cirrhosis, complications of cirrhosis, and comorbidities added to the CLD burden.

Conclusions and Relevance

Over the study period, the total estimated national hospitalization costs in patients with CLD reached $81.1 billion. The inpatient CLD burden in the US is likely increasing because of an aging CLD population with increases in concomitant comorbid conditions.

### The enhanced liver fibrosis test is associated with liver-related outcomes in postmenopausal women with risk factors for liver disease [^115YHcNe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Selection of cases and controls

We performed a case-control study nested in UKCTOCS. Cases comprised all participants in the cohort with risk factors, defined as BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 and / or self-reported alcohol consumption of ≥ 11 drinks per week, with a first presentation of an LRE, defined as first presentation of one or more of the following: a hospital admission, outpatient appointment, cancer registration with, or death from, an ICD-10 code of interest. We searched for the following codes: K70 (alcoholic liver disease), K73 (chronic hepatitis) and K74 (fibrosis and cirrhosis). The use of these codes is consistent with other UK studies of cirrhosis. We also searched for K76.0 (other diseases of the liver, including fat). Codes relating to sequelae of decompensated liver disease were also included; I85 (oesophageal varices), Z944 (liver transplant) and C22.0 (hepatocellular carcinoma). In addition to ICD-10 code, death certificates were also searched for any mention of alcoholic liver disease or fatty liver.

Each case was matched to two controls in order to reduce selection bias. Controls were participants with risk factors who did not experience an LRE. The control matching criteria were: age (+/− 5 years) at recruitment, BMI (+/− 2 kg/m 2), alcohol group and regional trial (recruitment) centre. Cases were not matched for time to spin (the time between sample collection and centrifugation of sample) or storage time of sample.

Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) clinical suspicion and biopsy — among patients with suspected heavy alcohol use and new onset or worsening jaundice, clinicians should have a high suspicion for AH given its high short-term mortality; the NIAAA has proposed clinical criteria for the diagnosis of probable AH, and when the diagnosis is uncertain and 1 or more of the criteria are not met, a liver biopsy should be considered.

### A record-linkage study of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with hepatitis C infection in scotland [^113ienpo]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

We computed standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for HCC in the HCV-diagnosed population by age, sex, and calendar-year standardising to expected incidence rates derived from all HCC registrations in Scotland during 1996–2004 and the national mid-year population estimates for the same period. All data analyses were carried out using R version 2.4.0.

For each person diagnosed with HCV, the occurrence of at least one alcohol-related hospital episode was coded as a time-dependent variable. This involved searching the linked hospital records for alcohol-related discharges occurring before the date of first mention of HCC, or, for those with no HCC admission/death, at any time before 31 December 2006. The set of alcohol-related diagnosis codes comprised alcohol use (ICD-10 Z72.1), mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (ICD-10 F10; ICD-9: 291, 303, 305), degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (ICD-10 G31.2, G62.1, G72.1, I42.6, K29.2; ICD-9 357.5, 425.5, 535.3), toxic effects of alcohol (ICD-10 T51.0, T51.9; ICD-9 980.0), alcoholic liver disease (ICD-10 K70.1–3; ICD-9 571.0–571.2), alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis (ICD-10 K86.0), evidence of alcohol involvement (ICD-10 Y90-1), finding of alcohol in blood (ICD-10 R78.0; ICD-9 790.3), alcohol rehabilitation (ICD-10 Z50.2), personal history of psychoactive substance abuse (ICD-10 Z86.4; captures non-current mental/behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol), and accidental or intentional self-poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (ICD-10 X45, X65; ICD-9 E860.0, E860.9).

### Identifying patients with hepatic encephalopathy using administrative data in the ICD-10 era [^115fVn3L]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of cirrhosis resulting in relapsing-remitting mental status changes ranging from deficits in executive function to coma. Incident HE is associated with an abrupt increase in mortality 1 and frequent hospitalization. 2 To further the understanding of the burden and impact of HE at the population level, valid algorithms are required to identify patients in administrative data. An International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 code is specific for HE (572.2), offering a 0.92 positive predictive value (PPV) and 0.36 negative predictive value (NPV). 3 When applied in an algorithm to patients with ICD-9 codes for cirrhosis (eg, 571.5), Kanwal et al 4 found a PPV and NPV of 0.86 and 0.87. Unfortunately, the switch to ICD-10 in 2015 rendered algorithms validated using ICD-9 invalid. Kaplan et al 5 previously showed that lactulose and rifaximin use correlated with grade of HE for Child classification. Herein, we validate a diagnostic coding algorithm for HE using ICD-10 and medication records.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^113kVZ5f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and data on the prevalence and profile of patients with early disease are limited. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. Prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. AH presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice, and in severe cases may transition to acute on chronic liver failure when the risk for mortality, depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures, may be as high as 20–50% at 1 month. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH and long-term mortality is related to severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures in patients hospitalized with ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation, a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis, may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.

Follow-up for morbidity and mortality

Cause-specific mortality and morbidity was monitored through local death registries, cancer registries, and the national health insurance claim databases. To minimise loss to follow-up and underreporting of events, annual active follow-up through local residential, health insurance, and administrative records was conducted, supplemented where necessary by contacts with participants and/or their family members. All events were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The outcomes studied were incident total liver disease (ICD-10: B18-B19, B94.2, C22, K70-K77, Z22.5) and its main components, including liver cancer (C22), liver cirrhosis (K74), ALD (K70), NAFLD (K76.0), and chronic viral hepatitis (B18-B19, B94.2, Z22.5). By January 1, 2017, 44,037 (8.6%) participants had died and 4781 (0.9%) were lost to follow-up.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1136Egpq]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) prognostic factors include infection burden, inflammatory biomarkers, and SIRS, with abstinence driving long-term outcomes. Infections are common in severe AH with 12%-26% prevalence at the time of admission, with up to half infected at some point while receiving corticosteroids. Infection-related biomarkers like pretreatment serum lipopolysaccharide, bacterial DNA, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin are associated with the risk of infection and 90-day mortality. The presence of SIRS at admission, with or without infection, predicts multiorgan failure (especially AKI) and early death. In the long term, abstinence from alcohol is the main driver of outcome in patients with severe AH surviving beyond 6 months. Improvement in long-term survival after severe AH should include secondary prevention strategies to promote complete alcohol abstinence.
