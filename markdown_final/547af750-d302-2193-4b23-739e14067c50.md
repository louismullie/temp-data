## Question

Is general surgery consult indicated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a general surgery consultation is indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and urgency. Then, I should verify the specific indication or diagnosis driving the question. Next, I will check guideline-based triggers for surgical involvement. After that, I need to consider patient-specific modifiers such as age, frailty, and comorbidities. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and note exceptions or alternatives where appropriate, anchoring to high-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and urgency, because timing and acuity drive whether a general surgery consult is indicated now versus later. Emergency general surgery conditions include acute abdominal pain, suspected obstruction, perforation, ischemia, infection, and trauma, and these often require rapid evaluation and potential operative management, whereas elective scenarios allow for outpatient referral and optimization, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating these pathways [^116e5JPf] [^1133zx6h].

> Wait, let me verify the specific indication or diagnosis, since the answer hinges on it. For example, acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding with brisk, ongoing hemorrhage warrants surgical consultation after initial stabilization and localization efforts, and failure of endoscopic therapy is a classic trigger for surgical intervention, so I should confirm whether the bleeding is brisk and ongoing before recommending a consult [^1166EFEe]. Similarly, suspected incarcerated or strangulated hernia, suspected necrotizing soft tissue infection, and malignant bowel obstruction are scenarios where surgical input is typically indicated, and I need to check for red flags like systemic toxicity, nonreducible mass, or peritoneal signs that would lower the threshold for urgent consultation [^1135xHQE] [^116bFZng] [^114bX54Z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review guideline-based triggers to ensure I'm not overcalling or undercalling the need for a general surgeon. The IDSA recommends prompt surgical consultation for suspected necrotizing fasciitis or gas gangrene, and the ACG advises surgical consultation for brisk, ongoing lower GI bleeding, while hernia algorithms advise urgent surgical evaluation for incarcerated or strangulated hernias, and Crohn's disease guidance supports early surgical consultation for complications such as obstruction, perforation, abscess, or medically refractory disease, so I should align the case with these triggers before concluding [^116bFZng] [^1166EFEe] [^1135xHQE] [^114Ho9J8].

> I need to check patient-specific modifiers next, because age, frailty, and comorbidities can shift the threshold toward consultation even when the presentation is atypical. In older adults, abdominal pain is more likely to reflect serious pathology and carries higher morbidity and mortality, so a lower threshold for surgical consultation is prudent, and frailty, cognitive impairment, and functional decline further complicate risk–benefit assessments, making early surgical input valuable for decision-making and counseling [^111Cvbu8] [^115EQ9u2]. But wait, what if the patient is pregnant? Physiologic changes can obscure classic signs, so maintaining a high index of suspicion and involving surgery early is advised to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment [^116ToBDV].

> Let me consider the role of emergency general surgery versus elective general surgery, because this affects who responds and how quickly. Emergency general surgeons are available 24/7 in many systems and are equipped to manage acute surgical conditions, whereas elective general surgeons typically see patients in clinic and schedule operations; thus, for acute presentations, an EGS consult is indicated, while for stable, chronic, or nonurgent conditions, outpatient referral to general surgery is appropriate [^113aJ6AM] [^115XB81Z]. I should double-check local pathways, as some hospitals use acute care surgery models with dedicated teams and resources that streamline emergency surgical care [^115kfSGf].

> Next, I should review alternatives and exceptions so I don't overgeneralize. Not every abdominal complaint requires surgery, and many conditions are managed nonoperatively with medical therapy, observation, or interventional radiology; for example, some lower GI bleeding resolves with endoscopic therapy, some hernias are reducible and safe for elective repair, and some Crohn's flares respond to medical optimization, so I need to ensure that the indication truly warrants surgical involvement before calling [^1166EFEe] [^1135xHQE] [^114Ho9J8]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "always consult for any hernia", but that's too broad; reducible, asymptomatic hernias often do not require urgent consultation and can be scheduled electively, whereas incarceration, strangulation, or systemic signs demand urgent surgical evaluation [^1135xHQE].

> I will now examine the potential consequences of delaying consultation, because that strengthens the case when time-sensitive disease is suspected. Delays in surgical consultation for emergency general surgery conditions are associated with worse outcomes, and disparities in consultation rates have been documented, underscoring the need to avoid unnecessary delays when surgical disease is on the table [^113aJ6AM]. In elderly or frail patients, prolonged optimization without surgical input can worsen physiologic decompensation, so early involvement of surgery for risk stratification and planning is prudent even if the immediate plan is nonoperative [^115EQ9u2].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, a general surgery consultation is indicated when the clinical scenario matches guideline-based triggers such as brisk ongoing lower GI bleeding, suspected incarcerated or strangulated hernia, suspected necrotizing infection, malignant bowel obstruction, or complicated Crohn's disease, and it is also indicated when patient-specific factors like advanced age, frailty, or pregnancy raise concern for high-risk pathology or atypical presentations, whereas stable, nonurgent conditions should be referred electively rather than as an emergency consult [^1166EFEe] [^1135xHQE] [^116bFZng] [^114bX54Z] [^114Ho9J8] [^111Cvbu8] [^115EQ9u2] [^116ToBDV]. If the indication remains unclear after initial assessment, I should reconsider the differential, escalate diagnostics, and involve surgery early for risk–benefit counseling and disposition planning, because timely consultation can prevent deterioration and guide optimal management [^111Us5dQ] [^115sjUhV].

In general, **general surgery consultation is indicated** for acute abdominal pain with peritoneal signs, suspected bowel obstruction or perforation, uncontrolled bleeding, suspected necrotizing infection, or trauma with penetrating injury. It is also indicated for chronic conditions requiring surgical evaluation, such as persistent hernias, gallstones with symptoms, malignancy, or failed nonoperative management. Early consultation improves outcomes by enabling timely diagnosis, risk stratification, and intervention [^115sjUhV] [^115EQ9u2]. If uncertain, **err on the side of consultation**, especially in high-risk patients (elderly, immunocompromised, pregnant, or with comorbidities) [^111Cvbu8] [^116ToBDV].

---

## Indications for general surgery consultation

### Acute conditions

- **Acute abdominal pain**: Especially with peritoneal signs (rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity), suggesting peritonitis, perforated viscus, or acute appendicitis [^notfound].

- **Suspected bowel obstruction**: Characterized by severe abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and inability to pass gas or stool [^1135xHQE].

- **Suspected bowel perforation**: Sudden severe abdominal pain with free air on imaging or clinical suspicion of hollow viscus perforation.

- **Uncontrolled bleeding**: Gastrointestinal bleeding that fails endoscopic therapy or remains unstable despite resuscitation [^1166EFEe].

- **Suspected necrotizing infection**: Such as Fournier's gangrene or necrotizing fasciitis, characterized by rapid progression, systemic toxicity, and tissue necrosis [^116bFZng].

- **Trauma**: Penetrating abdominal trauma, gunshot wounds, or stab wounds.

---

### Chronic conditions

- **Persistent hernias**: Especially if symptomatic, incarcerated, or strangulated [^1135xHQE].

- **Gallstone disease**: Symptomatic cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, or cholangitis.

- **Malignancy**: Suspected or confirmed malignancies requiring surgical intervention, such as colorectal, breast, or thyroid cancers [^113YeZac] [^111BRyr1] [^111nFHTq].

- **Failed nonoperative management**: Chronic conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or diverticulitis that fail medical therapy [^114Ho9J8].

---

## Patient populations requiring special consideration

Certain patient populations require a **lower threshold** for general surgery consultation due to their increased risk and potential for rapid deterioration:

- **Elderly patients**: Higher likelihood of serious pathology, diagnostic challenges, and poorer outcomes [^111Cvbu8] [^115EQ9u2].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Increased risk of infection, delayed healing, and atypical presentations [^notfound].

- **Pregnant patients**: Physiological changes complicate diagnosis and management, requiring specialized surgical input [^116ToBDV].

- **Patients with multiple comorbidities**: Higher surgical risk and complexity necessitating multidisciplinary care [^113FSz67].

---

## Benefits of early general surgery consultation

Early general surgery consultation provides several **clinical advantages**:

- **Timely diagnosis and intervention**: Reduces morbidity and mortality associated with delayed surgical management [^notfound].

- **Risk stratification**: Allows for appropriate preoperative optimization and planning [^115sjUhV].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Facilitates coordination with other specialties, improving overall patient outcomes [^113YeZac].

- **Patient education**: Enables informed decision-making and shared decision-making regarding surgical options [^113igqtP].

---

## Potential consequences of delayed consultation

Delayed general surgery consultation can lead to **significant clinical consequences**, including:

- **Increased morbidity and mortality**: Particularly in acute conditions such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or necrotizing infection [^1135xHQE] [^116bFZng].

- **Progression of disease**: Chronic conditions may worsen, complicating surgical management and increasing risk [^114Ho9J8].

- **Loss of opportunity for minimally invasive approaches**: Delayed consultation may necessitate more invasive open procedures [^notfound].

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Due to prolonged hospitalization, complications, and readmissions [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Several clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **early general surgery consultation**:

- **Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding**: Surgical consultation recommended for brisk, ongoing bleeding or failure of endoscopic therapy [^1166EFEe].

- **Crohn's disease**: Early surgical consultation indicated for complications such as obstruction, perforation, abscess, or medically refractory disease [^114Ho9J8].

- **Abdominal wall hernias**: Urgent surgical evaluation required for incarcerated or strangulated hernias [^1135xHQE].

- **Trauma**: Immediate surgical consultation indicated for penetrating abdominal trauma or suspected intra-abdominal injury [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

General surgery consultation is indicated for a wide range of acute and chronic conditions, particularly when there is a risk of **rapid deterioration** or when nonoperative management has failed. Early consultation improves outcomes by enabling timely diagnosis, risk stratification, and intervention. Clinicians should maintain a **low threshold** for consultation, especially in high-risk patients, to prevent delays in care and reduce morbidity and mortality.

What is the difference between a general surgeon and an emergency general surgeon?

An EGS surgeon is a general surgeon but one who works primarily in the inpatient/hospital setting rather than in the office/clinic. Many general surgeons usually work in a clinic or an office to see patients who are referred from another doctor with a problem that may need surgery but are not in any immediate danger. A visit to the general surgeon's office allows scheduling of tests, pictures, and operations into the future based on symptoms and availability. Being seen by the surgeon in the hospital, also called a 'consult', means tests and studies will happen during the hospital stay as quickly as possible to help guide treatment. While many general surgeons sometimes cover consults and calls for emergencies, EGS surgeons do so all the time. They treat hospital patients at all hours of every day.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^111BRyr1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Invasive breast cancer — principles of breast reconstruction after surgery outline general principles and state: Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Breast reconstruction may be an option for any patient receiving surgical treatment for breast cancer, and all patients undergoing breast cancer treatment should be educated about breast reconstructive options as adapted to their individual clinical situation; however, breast reconstruction should not interfere with the appropriate surgical, medical, and radiation management of the cancer or the scope of appropriate surgical treatment for this disease. Some patients may choose not to have reconstruction after mastectomy, and the option to undergo mastectomy alone with a surgically optimized closure should be offered to all patients as part of a comprehensive discussion of reconstructive options, with the understanding that achieving the optimal result in this scenario may require additional procedures beyond the initial mastectomy. Smoking and obesity (WHO Class 2 and 3) increase the risk of perioperative complications for all types of breast reconstruction, and patients with these high-risk factors should be counseled about their increased risk for complications following breast reconstruction, including donor site complications/hernias and bulges of the abdominal wall, delayed healing, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, total flap failure (obesity), and implant failure (smoking). Nipple areolar reconstruction should be offered to patients if the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) has been removed as part of their cancer treatment, and three-dimensional (3-D) tattooing can be offered to patients as an option for NAC reconstruction; additionally, patients who are not satisfied with the cosmetic outcome following completion of breast cancer treatment should be offered reconstructive surgery consultation. Patients known to harbor genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer may opt to undergo bilateral prophylactic mastectomies with reconstruction, which can be performed with prosthetic, autologous tissue, or a combination of implant with autologous tissue. Skin-sparing mastectomy should be performed by an experienced breast surgery team that works in a coordinated, multidisciplinary fashion to guide proper patient selection for skin-sparing mastectomy, determine optimal sequencing of the reconstructive procedure(s) in relation to adjuvant therapies, and perform a resection that achieves appropriate surgical margins. Revisional surgery may be necessary after breast reconstruction, may include procedures such as fat grafting, mastopexy, direct excision/suction-assisted lipectomy, and contralateral procedures (in cases of unilateral reconstruction), and patients should be informed before reconstruction that revision surgery may be necessary.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) — surgical considerations: A surgery consultation should be requested in patients with brisk, ongoing LGIB; studies report high overall mortality (up to 27%) after emergent total abdominal colectomy, rebleeding is higher after limited resection than total colectomy (18% vs. 4% in one study of 77 patients), and in general, surgery for acute LGIB should be considered only after other therapeutic options have failed with careful preoperative localization to avoid continued or recurrent bleeding from an unresected lesion.

### The LIFE TRIAD of emergency general surgery [^114Ntth9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Indications and guidelines production is a substantial part to diffuse good clinical and surgical practice. Guideline development is only possible through the availability of high-quality data and experts who develop consensus to define the best strategies for specific scenarios where no definitive data may be obtained. Many diseases in fact have been deeply investigated and plenty of literature works exist. A few others, however, due to the paucity of cases and their scattered diffusion, have not been so effectively studied. This is why registries and experts are vital for EGS. The leading societies have the duty and the responsibility to promote expert discussion and production of guidelines. They must offer open and wide options to allow worldwide coming experts to share data, experiences, and opinions in order to obtain the most shared and diffusible guidelines and indications possible.

### Patterns of preoperative consultation and surgical specialty in an integrated healthcare system [^111C1iZg]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients scheduled for elective surgery are referred for a preoperative medical consultation. Only limited data are available on factors associated with preoperative consultations. The authors hypothesized that surgical specialty contributes to variation in referrals for preoperative consultations.

Methods

This is a cohort study using data from Group Health Cooperative, an integrated healthcare system. The authors included 13,673 patients undergoing a variety of common procedures-primarily low-risk surgeries-representing six surgical specialties, in 2005–2006. The authors identified consultations by family physicians, general internists, pulmonologists, or cardiologists in the 42 days preceding surgery. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the association between surgical specialty and consultation, adjusting for potential confounders including the revised cardiac risk index, age, gender, Deyo comorbidity index, number of prescription medications, and 11 medication classes.

Results

The authors found that 3,063 (22%) of all patients had preoperative consultations, with significant variation by surgical specialty. Patients having ophthalmologic, orthopedic, or urologic surgery were more likely to have consultations compared with those having general surgery-adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) of 3.8 (3.3–4.2), 1.5 (1.3–1.7), and 2.3 (1.8–2.8), respectively. Preoperative consultations were more common in patients with lower revised cardiac risk scores.

Conclusion

There is substantial practice variation among surgical specialties with regard to the use of preoperative consultations in this integrated healthcare system. Given the large number of consultations provided for patients with low cardiac risk and for patients presenting for low-risk surgeries, their indications, the financial burden, and cost-effectiveness of consultations deserve further study.

### A framework to optimize primary care of older surgical patients: a qualitative study of geriatricians [^111eN3W9]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Risk-Benefit Analysis of Surgical Referral

When deciding whether to refer a patient for a surgical consultation, geriatricians perform a comprehensive, multidimensional assessment of their patient, including an evaluation of the patient's baseline medical, cognitive status, functional status, quality of life, and frailty. Geriatricians then perform a risk-benefit analysis comparing surgery to nonoperative management. The synthesis of this analysis is used to determine whether to refer a patient to a surgeon (Table 2).

Table 2.
Factors That Geriatricians Consider in Their Risk-Benefit Analysis When Deciding Whether to Refer a Patient for Surgical Consultation

Abbreviations: ADL, activities of daily living; IDL, instrumental activities of daily living; PEG, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.

After completing this comprehensive patient assessment, geriatricians indicate that there are additional factors that lower the threshold for surgical referral. Some geriatricians feel that surgeons are more able to provide an accurate risk-benefit assessment for the patient:

I have a pretty low threshold to refer to general surgery, because the surgeon has to do their own risk assessment and their own counseling, which is more in-depth than my counseling. The surgeon can speak much more precisely about the pros and the cons. (Participant 9)

Other geriatricians also refer to surgeons for their input on nonoperative management of a condition:

Even if a person I didn't think would benefit from surgery, I think… having the person go see the surgeon for other suggestions can still be helpful. (Participant 6).

### Rates of surgical consultations after emergency department admission in black and white Medicare patients [^113aJ6AM]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A surgical consultation is a critical first step in the care of patients with emergency general surgery conditions. It is unknown if Black Medicare patients and White Medicare patients receive surgical consultations at similar rates when they are admitted from the emergency department.

Objective

To determine whether Black Medicare patients have similar rates of surgical consultations when compared with White Medicare patients after being admitted from the emergency department with an emergency general surgery condition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a retrospective cohort study that took place at US hospitals with an emergency department and used a computational generalization of inverse propensity score weight to create patient populations with similar covariate distributions. Participants were Medicare patients age 65.5 years or older admitted from the emergency department for an emergency general surgery condition between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2018. The analysis was performed during February 2022. Patients were classified into 1 of 5 emergency general surgery condition categories based on principal diagnosis codes: colorectal, general abdominal, hepatopancreatobiliary, intestinal obstruction, and upper gastrointestinal.

Exposures

Black vs White race.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Receipt of a surgical consultation after admission from the emergency department with an emergency general surgery condition.

Results

A total of 1 686 940 patients were included in the study. Of those included, 214 788 patients were Black (12.7%) and 1 472 152 patients were White (87.3%). After standardizing for medical and diagnostic imaging covariates, Black patients had 14% lower odds of receiving a surgical consultation (odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.85–0.87) with a risk difference of -3.17 (95% CI, -3.41 to -2.92). After standardizing for socioeconomic covariates, Black patients remained at an 11% lower odds of receiving a surgical consultation compared with similar White patients (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.88–0.90) with a risk difference of -2.49 (95% CI, -2.75 to -2.23). Additionally, when restricting the analysis to Black patients and White patients who were treated in the same hospitals, Black patients had 8% lower odds of receiving a surgical consultation when compared with White patients (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90–0.93) with a risk difference of -1.82 (95% CI, -2.18 to -1.46).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, Black Medicare patients had lower odds of receiving a surgical consultation after being admitted from the emergency department with an emergency general surgery condition when compared with similar White Medicare patients. These disparities in consultation rates cannot be fully attributed to medical comorbidities, insurance status, socioeconomic factors, or individual hospital-level effects.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^113YeZac]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Non-small cell lung cancer surgical management — principles and referrals note that in general, surgery provides the best chance for cure in patients with stage I or II disease, and thoracic surgical oncology consultation should be part of the evaluation of any patient being considered for curative local therapy; the overall plan of treatment and the necessary imaging studies should be determined before any nonsurgery treatment is initiated; it is essential to determine whether patients can tolerate surgery or whether they are medically inoperable, and some patients deemed inoperable may be able to tolerate minimally invasive surgery and/or sublobar resection; although frailty is an increasingly recognized predictor of surgical and other treatment morbidity, a preferred frailty assessment system has not been established; determination of resectability, surgical staging, and pulmonary resection should be performed by thoracic surgeons who should participate in multidisciplinary clinics and/or tumor boards for patients with lung cancer; surgery may be appropriate for select patients with uncommon types of lung cancer; patients with clinical stage IB or greater disease, or high-risk factors, should be referred to a medical oncologist for evaluation; for patients with stage IIIA NSCLC that is deemed resectable, consider referral to a radiation oncologist; treatment delays, because of poor coordination among specialists, should be avoided; the surgical procedure used depends on the extent of disease and on the cardiopulmonary reserve of the patient; and a preoperative or intraoperative tissue diagnosis of lung cancer should be established before doing a lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy.

### Does occupational therapy delay or reduce the proportion of patients that receives thumb carpometacarpal joint surgery? A multicentre randomised controlled trial [^112jZX5a]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

When planning our study, we could not identify studies that reported the number of referrals that led to surgery. Therefore, the 70% surgery rate used in the sample size calculation was based on surgeon assumptions, rather than facts. The results in our study showed that a much lower proportion had received surgery after 2 years (28%). Thus, even with a lower dropout rate than expected, the study was probably underpowered for detecting the suggested 20% difference between groups with the assigned power and significance levels. Hopefully, these results can be used to ensure a more realistic power calculation in future studies.

The main indication of CMCJ surgery is to reduce pain and improve function. Unlike other studies, we found that these variables were not significant predictors of surgery; in contrast, we identified previous received non-pharmacological treatment and high motivation for surgery as significant predictors. Unfortunately, we do not have information on the success of non-pharmacological treatment in patients with CMCJ OA in general. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that such treatment would sufficiently relieve pain and functional limitations in all patients. Thus, patients with most severe CMCJ OA are likely to revisit their GP, who, consistent with treatment recommendations, may refer them to surgical consultation. Our finding that previous non-pharmacological treatment and motivation for surgery significantly predict surgery indicates that these parameters should be routinely examined in GP consultations. Patient choices should be based on realistic information about possible treatment outcomes, discussed in close dialogue with healthcare professionals.

### Vasectomy: AUA guideline [^115EYcHZ]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association vasectomy — preoperative consultation and evaluation: A preoperative interactive consultation should be conducted, preferably in person; if an in-person consultation is not possible, preoperative consultation by telephone or electronic communication is an acceptable alternative (Expert Opinion). The surgeon performing vasectomy should obtain a general medical history, with particular emphasis on bleeding diatheses and other possible contraindications to surgery. A physical exam of the genitalia should be performed prior to vasectomy and may be performed immediately before the operative procedure if the preoperative consultation was not conducted in person. Physical examination at the time of in-person preoperative consultation is highly desirable because it may identify genital pathology, such as a testis tumor or undescended testis, which would contraindicate routine bilateral vasectomy, and it may identify patients who are not good candidates for local anesthesia because of unusual scrotal sensitivity, those who are too uncomfortable or too anxious to tolerate vasectomy under local anesthesia, or patients whose vasa are especially difficult to palpate. It is preferable to do this examination far enough in advance to allow the surgeon to plan for oral or other sedation if necessary, but if preoperative counseling cannot be done in person the preoperative physical examination may be delayed to a later date or to the day of surgery if necessary.

### Dissemination of the 2022 ASMBS and IFSO guidelines for bariatric surgery: what has reached primary care providers? [^112xUvYp]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Even with improvements in the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery, less than 1% of United States adults meeting the BMI criteria opt for bariatric surgery. A disconnection clearly exists between patients eligible for metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) and those who eventually undergo surgery. The number of eligible patients is expected to rise following the 2022 American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) updated guidelines. In contrast to the prior ASMBS guidelines outlined by the NIH consensus panel in 1991, the new guidelines released in October 2022 lower the BMI thresholds at which MBS referral is suggested in the general population, create separate guidelines for the Asian population, and include the pediatric population (Fig. 1).

### Guideline no. 423: female genital cosmetic surgery and procedures [^113KvukH]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for female genital cosmetic surgery, more specifically with respect to general counseling, SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to counsel females requesting non-medically indicated female genital cosmetic surgery and procedures about the normal variations and physiological changes over the lifespan and the possibility of unintended consequences of cosmetic surgery to the genital area. Discuss the lack of both high-quality evidence and data regarding outcomes in the informed decision-making process.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^112CH51g]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults — surgical procedures and follow-up note that tracheotomy can eliminate OSA but does not appropriately treat central hypoventilation syndromes (Consensus), maxillary and mandibular advancement can improve PSG parameters comparable to CPAP in the majority of patients (Consensus), most other sleep apnea surgeries are rarely curative for OSA but may improve clinical outcomes (Consensus), and laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty is not recommended for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (Guideline). The frequency of post-surgical follow-up will be determined by the type of surgery but should include a surgery-specific evaluation as well a general OSA-related evaluation, after healing a final general OSA outcome evaluation is indicated (Consensus), sleep specialist follow-up is recommended for long-term follow-up after surgical treatment is completed (Consensus), and following adjunctive surgery the patient should be evaluated to assess the effect of surgery on PAP or OA tolerance, adherence, and symptom resolution (Consensus).

### Specialist surgery in the developing world: luxury or necessity? [^116VZxzV]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Patients suffering from conditions requiring specialist intervention cannot obtain treatment when facilities do not exist locally. Specialist visiting teams in a number of surgical disciplines have attempted to address these issues in collaboration with local clinicians. These interventions require careful planning and communication to achieve optimum results. Several teams have been successful in building long-term relationships that have lead to important clinical developments in the local country.

### The role of pre-surgery clinical communication on metabolic and bariatric surgery outcomes: a prospective study [^113fyoZz]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies in MBS have assessed doctor-patient relationship in general. In sum, they indicate that a positive relationship, along with other predictors such as weight loss before surgery, among others, are associated with patients' outcomes, namely, with a greater likelihood of adherence to follow-up care and reduction of post-surgical complications. However, the underutilization of metabolic and bariatric surgery, despite its efficacy and safety, remains a significant issue, driven by factors such as health insurance barriers, weight stigma, and suboptimal patient-provider communication. Shared decision-making (SDM) has been proposed as a strategy to address these challenges, as it promotes effective communication and patient-centered care. While these factors have been well documented, the specific influence of doctor-patient communication during the pre-surgery preparatory consultation (PC) on MBS outcomes remains unclear. Bridging this gap, the goal of this study was to inspect the association between patients' perceptions of doctor-patient communication in the preparatory consultation for MBS and the results of the surgery. In previous research, MBS has been associated with decreased weight and body mass index, and with improved quality of life. The MBS outcomes may be influenced by several factors, including doctor-patient communication in the preparatory consultation.

### Patient education series: understanding trauma and emergency surgical conditions-emergency general surgery and the emergency general surgeon [^111Us5dQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

What is an emergency general surgeon?

An emergency general surgery surgeon, or EGS surgeon, is a doctor who helps people with sudden, serious health problems that might need surgery right away. They help patients who come to the hospital with things like severe belly pain, a bad infection that needs surgery, or other problems requiring surgery that may happen while someone is already in the hospital. EGS surgeons are trained to act fast and are very skilled at deciding if surgery is needed and what type of surgery to do. They treat a wide variety of problems throughout the body. Even if surgery is not needed, their decisions help guide the care patients receive while they are in the hospital.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^114Ho9J8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — when to refer for surgery and common indications: Surgery may be considered for symptomatic CD localized to a short segment of bowel, and surgery is required to treat emergent complications. A resection of a segment of diseased intestine is the most common surgery for a patient with CD. Indications include intractable hemorrhage, perforation, persisting or recurrent obstruction, abscess, dysplasia or cancer, or medically refractory disease; the most common indication for intestinal resection is small bowel obstruction from a fibrostenotic stricture, with penetrating CD as the second most common. Although resection is the most definitive treatment for a stricture, strictureplasty is an option as a bowel‑preserving measure in patients at risk for short bowel syndrome; multidisciplinary management and early surgical consultation are appropriate.

### The LIFE TRIAD of emergency general surgery [^116e5JPf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Emergency General Surgery (EGS) was identified as multidisciplinary surgery performed for traumatic and non-traumatic acute conditions during the same admission in the hospital by general emergency surgeons and other specialists. It is the most diffused surgical discipline in the world. To live and grow strong EGS necessitates three fundamental parts: emergency and elective continuous surgical practice, evidence generation through clinical registries and data accrual, and indications and guidelines production: the LIFE TRIAD.

### High acuity of postoperative consults to emergency general surgery at an urban safety net hospital [^111uRNrW]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency general surgery (EGS) has high rates of morbidity, mortality, and readmission. Therefore, it might be expected that an EGS service fields many consultations for postoperative patients. However, with the known overutilization of emergency department visits for nonurgent conditions, we hypothesized most postoperative consults received by an EGS service would be nonurgent and could be appropriately managed as an outpatient.

Methods

We reviewed all EGS consults at a single urban safety net hospital over a 12-month period, screening for patients who had undergone surgery in the previous 12 mo. This included consultations from the emergency room and inpatient setting. Demographics, admission status, procedures performed, and other details were abstracted from the chart and Vizient reports. Consultation questions were categorized and then reviewed by an expert panel to determine if conditions could have been managed as an outpatient.

Results

The EGS service received a total of 1112 consults, with 99 (9%) for a postoperative condition. Overall, 85% of postoperative consults were admitted after consultation, 19% underwent surgery and 21% underwent a procedure with gastroenterology or interventional radiology. Expert review classified slightly over one-third (36%) of consults as nonurgent.

Conclusions

Most postoperative consults seen at our urban safety net hospital represent true morbidity that required admission, intervention, or surgery. Despite this high acuity, one-third of postoperative consults could have been managed as an outpatient. Efforts to improve discharge instructions and set patient expectations could limit unnecessary postoperative emergency department visits.

### Referral of adults with obstructive sleep apnea for surgical consultation: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114VkGkh]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) initial therapy versus surgical referral — Given that even low surgical risks are elevated as compared to the minimal risk of initial positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, the balance of benefits to harms favors PAP therapy as initial treatment over discussion of referral for surgical evaluation. Based on their combined clinical expertise, the TF judged that the potential benefits of surgical referral discussion in patients with major anatomical obstruction do not exceed the potential benefits of an initial PAP trial for OSA in the absence of other medical conditions affecting upper airway patency, most patients would generally be accepting of a discussion regarding referral for surgical evaluation as there is little harm in the act of offering, patient acceptance of surgical interventions will vary, and the clinical utility of referral may be more limited in patients who are partially PAP adherent; the choice to pursue referral is expected to vary between patients based on personal values, beliefs, and expectations for recovery time or pain with surgery.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2018). Medium credibility.

Severe aortic stenosis appropriate use — general assumptions emphasize that scenarios apply to patients with severe valvular aortic stenosis and that diagnostic testing and interventions such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are performed and interpreted by qualified individuals in facilities meeting national standards. A qualified clinician is assumed to have obtained a complete history and physical so the clinical status stated in an indication is valid, and indications are purposefully broad with clear documentation of the reason for testing in the medical record. For some clinical scenarios, more than 1 table may need to be consulted to determine appropriateness (e.g., consulting a table including surgical risk and comorbidities to differentiate between TAVR and SAVR), and procedures are rated for reasonableness by scenario such that more than 1 procedure type may be considered Appropriate, May Be Appropriate, or Rarely Appropriate. Cost is considered implicitly with clinical benefits prioritized and cost effectiveness considered when supported by evidence; the level of appropriate use does not consider local availability or skill. The designation "May Be Appropriate" is used when data are insufficient or substantial disagreement exists and should not be used as grounds for denial of reimbursement. Decisions are assumed to be made by a Heart Valve Team comprising cardiac surgery, interventional cardiology, cardiac imaging, anesthesiology, and geriatrics, with particularly complex or asymptomatic-case procedures performed at centers with appropriate expertise.

### Altering physician referral practices is challenging, but not impossible: spine assessment clinic quality improvement study [^112s7vcA]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Overall, however, the improvements noted in this study demonstrate that educating referring physicians on spine conditions that warrant surgical consultation likely led to the intended decrease in non-surgical referrals. Although prior studies also demonstrated successful improvement in referral behaviours following guideline distribution, it has been repeatedly reported that passive dissemination of information is one of the least effective methods of implementing guidelines into general practice. Active forms of continuing medical education and multifaceted interventions have been found to be ideal approaches. Therefore, it is reassuring that improvements were made despite using a historically less successful methodology. Although limited improvements were observed in the items indicated for inclusion in a referral letter, alternate and reportedly superior methods of education remain available. Additionally, clinical reminder systems and electronic referral systems, which provide standardised templates, are further methods that have been shown to increase the efficiency of referral systemsand could be leveraged moving forward.

Finally, it should be noted that lack of familiarity with appropriate surgical conditions is not necessarily the only reason for inappropriate referrals. It has been noted that spine pain patients frequently request aggressive treatment. Resultantly, GPs may refer not due to lack of understanding or knowledge, but rather to appease patients. Therefore, providing GPs with tools to deliver conservative care, while also countering requests for unnecessary aggressive surgery, has been described as a further method to manage patients' demands for inappropriate care and to alleviate stress on spine surgery services.

### Optimal resources for children's surgical care in the United States [^1174VnPr]. APSA (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric specialty consultation — availability by designation states that pediatric medical and surgical specialists must be promptly and readily available for consultation and are defined as those eligible for or board certified after relevant specialty fellowship training and recognized by the relevant Board of the American Board of Medical Specialties or equivalent. For the Advanced designation, a specialist must be available for consultation within 60 min; for Comprehensive designation specialists must be on the medical staff and readily available (within 60 min) 24/7 to provide care at the bedside. Relevant surgical specialists will be available to support the entire scope of institutional surgical practice in children. Where pediatric specific training and experience are designated as "available", the expectation is that the care of patients will be demonstrably provided as detailed by these specified providers for patients of ages consistent with these recommendations.

### Opportunities for shared decision-making about major surgery with high-risk patients: a multi-method qualitative study [^113igqtP]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

A significant amount of work took place before patients met with their surgeon to discuss treatment options. This was guided by clinical pathways (e.g. time to reach the surgeon), patients' eligibility for surgical attention, and multi-disciplinary review. All consultations with the surgeon included discussion about the nature of the problem, causation and prognosis and how it was affecting the patient, explanation of proposed surgery, immediate operative risks (e.g. infection), and what would happen after the consultation and after surgery. Beyond this, analysis (derived from study data) showed that consultations varied, with three types – resolution-focused, evaluative, and deliberative – providing different opportunities for shared decision-making (Fig 2).

### Intraoperative assessment of parathyroid pathology in sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism: an institutional experience [^113ZFjuG]. Human Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Intraoperative consultation for assessment of parathyroid tissue is a controversial area of endocrine pathology. This assessment often follows historical institutional and individual surgical practitioner practices rather than documented utility data and adjuvant intraoperative testing data, including intraoperative parathyroid hormone level testing by clinical pathologists and the use of Oil Red O vital stain on frozen tissue sections by anatomic pathologists, as a means of conferring etiology of parathyroid disease. The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES), in 2016, proposed guidelines for the management of primary hyperparathyroidism, including recommendations for intraoperative consultation, recommending against the use of intraoperative frozen section to determine parathyroid functional status but in support for its use for parathyroid identification. In this series, we review a one-year, retrospective cohort of consecutive parathyroid surgeries at Massachusetts General Hospital, including over 200 cases meeting inclusion criteria for which primary hyperparathyroidism was the indication for surgery, discussing outcomes, compliance with AAES guidelines, and overall utility of intraoperative consultation and adjuvant testing.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^11768uj2]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Surgery and laser therapy for infantile hemangiomas — clinicians may recommend surgery and laser therapy as treatment options in managing selected IHs (grade C, moderate recommendation), and decisions regarding their use should be made in consultation with a hemangioma specialist, especially in young infants; with the advent of β-blocker therapy, surgical and laser approaches are used less frequently; in general, surgical interventions are not performed in infancy due to anesthetic risks, vascularity, and higher risk of blood loss, iatrogenic injury, and inferior outcomes, and the decision to undertake surgery during infancy should consider current knowledge of general anesthesia risks; early surgery can be important for IHs that ulcerate, obstruct or deform vital structures (such as the airway or orbit), or involve aesthetically sensitive areas, and may be indicated when the lesion has failed to improve with local wound care and/or pharmacotherapy, when it is well localized and early surgery will simplify later reconstruction (eg, ear or eyelid with ptosis), when in an anatomically favorable area, or when resection will likely be necessary and the resultant scar would be the same; surgery also is an option for residual skin changes after involution; in most cases, deferring surgery until age 3 to 5 years is reasonable, though it is usually unnecessary to wait longer than 3 to 5 years because the adage that 50% of IHs involute by 5 years, 70% by 7 years, and 90% by 9 years is incorrect.

### The LIFE TRIAD of emergency general surgery [^113uKj2r]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The LIFE TRIAD is a concept that must spread and be part of the EGS common practice. As far as it will be the leading light of this great specialty, it will grow and diffuse taking its fruit and effects in each corner of the planet. EGS best practice needs surgeons fully trained to perform general surgical procedures in both elective and emergency settings. They must practice routinely in both fields taking care to accrue data and following the indications and guidelines given by the leading societies in order to provide the best possible care to patients.

### Resuscitation and preparation of the emergency general surgery patient [^115sjUhV]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, the workflow surrounding a general surgery patient allows for a period of evaluation and optimization of underlying medical issues to allow for risk modification; however, in the emergency, this optimization period is largely condensed because of its time-dependent nature. Because the lack of optimization can lead to complications, the ability to rapidly resuscitate the patient, proceed to procedural intervention to control the situation, and manage common medical comorbidities is paramount. This article provides an overview on these subjects.

### Systematic review of shared decision-making in surgery [^115zH2s8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple treatment options are generally available for most diseases. Shared decision-making (SDM) helps patients and physicians choose the treatment option that best fits a patient's preferences. This review aimed to assess the extent to which SDM is applied during surgical consultations, and the metrics used to measure SDM and SDM-related outcomes.

Methods

This was a systematic review of observational studies and clinical trials that measured SDM during consultations in which surgery was a treatment option. Embase, MEDLINE and CENTRAL were searched. Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were conducted by two investigators independently.

Results

Thirty-two articles were included. SDM was measured using nine different metrics. Thirty-six per cent of 13176 patients and surgeons perceived their consultation as SDM, as opposed to patient- or surgeon-driven. Surgeons more often perceived the decision-making process as SDM than patients (43.6 versus 29.3 per cent respectively). SDM levels scored objectively using the OPTION and Decision Analysis System for Oncology instruments ranged from 7 to 39 per cent. Subjective SDM levels as perceived by surgeons and patients ranged from 54 to 93 per cent. Patients experienced a higher level of SDM during consultations than surgeons (93 versus 84 per cent). Twenty-five different SDM-related outcomes were reported.

Conclusion

At present, SDM in surgery is still in its infancy, although surgeons and patients both think of it favourably. Future studies should evaluate the effect of new interventions to improve SDM during surgical consultations, and its assessment using available standardized and validated metrics.

AHA/ACC 2018 adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) noncardiac surgery — risk and care setting: Patients with ACHD may have greater operative risk than patients without ACHD, and case series and administrative data confirm that surgical procedures in patients with ACHD carry greater risk than in patients without ACHD. Noncardiac surgery is usually accomplished without substantial morbidity or mortality, but even minor surgery can be complicated in patients with ACHD, and surgery that is low risk in the general population may be associated with higher risk in the ACHD population. Risk relates to the specific type of ACHD, surgical procedure, urgency of intervention, and availability of specialized resources, and heightened surveillance may mandate extended postoperative intensive or other high-acuity care. Patients with ACHD may present with nonroutine and unusual physiological challenges, including those related to fluid balance in the setting of single ventricle or the impact of vascular resistances on shunts in cyanotic patients. When possible, patients with ACHD, especially those with complex disease (ACHD AP classification II and III) and/or whose disease has progressed (stages B, C, D), should receive preoperative evaluation and surgery or other nonsurgical intervention within an ACHD program; because timely consultation may be precluded, collaboration with members of the multidisciplinary ACHD team may be helpful, and clear processes for timely consultation and support are needed to manage challenges related to fluid balance, vascular resistance, and shunts. The "2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management of Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery" may be applied; however, those guidelines may not apply directly.

LEWIS: I would like to call the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health 4 General and Plastic Surgical Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee. For today's agenda, the Panel will discuss the risks and benefits of dermal fillers in 13 two topic areas. The first topic will address the general issues regarding risks associated 14 with intravascular injections of dermal fillers. The second and final topic will address general issues regarding patient preferences and informed decision making. 16 FDA is convening this meeting to seek expert opinion on the clinical evaluation and 17 regulation of dermal filler products. In my opinion, this is one of the more difficult 18 decisions that we have faced in many of these questions because the incidence of severe 19 complications is quite low, but the consequences of those is catastrophic for the people.

The FDA will present our approach for assessing and monitoring intravascular Free State Reporting, Inc. 1378 Cape Saint Claire Road Annapolis, MD 21409 974–0947. 4 approved for a variety of indications which fall into nine categories. These include:

### Symptom burden in patients with malignant bowel obstruction treated with or without surgery [^114bX54Z]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal obstruction is the most common indication for palliative surgical consultation. We sought to assess patient-reported outcomes and survival after surgical and nonsurgical treatment of malignant bowel obstruction.

Study Design

This was a prospective observational study enrolling patients with advanced malignancy who underwent surgical consultation at a tertiary cancer center. Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated using a previously validated inventory, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Gastrointestinal Obstruction (MDASI-GIO), administered at enrollment and 7 other time points for up to 90 days.

Results

We enrolled 125 patients, of whom 37 underwent surgery and 88 did not. Patients treated nonsurgically were more likely to have carcinomatosis on imaging (71% vs 49%, p = 0.02). Pain medicine, palliative care, and chaplaincy consultations occurred in 17%, 30%, and 15% of patients within the first month of enrollment. Higher mean symptom scores were noted by surgical patients, although the only single scores with effect sizes 0.5 or greater were symptom interference with general activity and work. The composite score for interference in work, activity, and walking had the largest effect size at -0.37, indicating greater interference in patients undergoing surgery. Patients selected for surgery had extended overall survival (median 15 vs 3 months, p < 0.01). Carcinomatosis, palliative care evaluation, and venting gastrostomy tube were associated with increased risk of death, and ability to receive subsequent chemotherapy and surgical management were positive prognostic indicators.

Conclusions

In this first study evaluating patient-reported outcomes after treatment for malignant bowel obstruction, we found that selection for surgical treatment was associated with improved survival, but also more symptom interference in general activities and work. These results may be useful in palliative surgical decision-making and informing patients during consultation for malignant bowel obstruction.

### Defining our destiny: trainee working group consensus statement on the future of emergency surgery training in the United Kingdom [^117LcDX1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The United Kingdom National Health Service treats both elective and emergency patients and seeks to provide high quality care, free at the point of delivery. Equal numbers of emergency and elective general surgical procedures are performed, yet surgical training prioritisation and organisation of NHS institutions is predicated upon elective care. The increasing ratio of emergency general surgery consultant posts compared to traditional sub-specialities has yet to be addressed. How should the capability gap be bridged to equip motivated, skilled surgeons of the future to deliver a high standard of emergency surgical care? The aim was to address both training requirements for the acquisition of necessary emergency general surgery skills, and the formation of job plans for trainee and consultant posts to meet the current and future requirements of the NHS. Twenty nine trainees and a consultant emergency general surgeon convened as a Working Group at The Association of Surgeons in Training Conference, 2015, to generate a united consensus statement to the training requirement and delivery of emergency general surgery provision by future general surgeons. Unscheduled general surgical care provision, emergency general surgery, trauma competence, training to meet NHS requirements, consultant job planning and future training challenges arose as key themes. Recommendations have been made from these themes in light of published evidence. Careful workforce planning, education, training and fellowship opportunities will provide well-trained enthusiastic individuals to meet public and societal need.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: an algorithm of the journal of trauma and acute care surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^1135xHQE]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.
The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on multiple factors. Patients with a reducible hernia, improvement in symptoms, no evidence of complications, and an otherwise normal physical examination should be referred for outpatient surgical follow-up to discuss elective hernia repair. Patients with concern for abdominal wall hernia complications, including strangulation, intestinal obstruction, hernia incarceration, unrelieved severe pain, overlying skin changes, or evidence of systemic illness, should be seen by an acute care surgeon. Ideally, surgical evaluation should precede imaging in patients with nonreducible hernias and worrisome findings on physical examination.
Patients with an incarcerated hernia and concern for strangulation or presence of peritonitis require prompt surgical intervention, as increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention is associated with an increased need for bowel resection. Signs of bowel incarceration causing obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation), in addition to severe pain at the hernia site, are suggestive of strangulation. Systemic signs of strangulation may include hypotension and tachycardia, with elevations in serum lactate (> 2.0 mmol/L) and white blood cell often (although not definitively) found on initial laboratory evaluation. Physical examination may also show erythema or bruising/discoloration of the skin overlying the hernia. When these findings are present, or the patient is otherwise deemed at risk for strangulation within the hernia, an emergent exploration should be undertaken, with assessment of the viability of involved bowel, reduction of the hernia, and definitive hernia repair if practical. In many cases, imaging is not required and may lead to unnecessary delay. Similar to other EGS procedures, patients requiring acute urgent operation for hernia complications are at increased risk of complication compared with their elective counterparts.
In circumstances of diagnostic uncertainty or a difficult-to-interpret examination (as can be found in obesity), imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for high-risk imaging features associated with strangulation. While ultrasound can be used to help with the initial diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography scan is preferred. Even when the diagnosis of hernia is confidently made on physical examination, computed tomography imaging can provide useful clinical information on the fascial defect size and hernia contents to evaluate for signs of intestinal obstruction or ischemia. In the absence of a high index of suspicion for strangulation, attempts should be made to reduce an incarcerated abdominal wall hernia unless it is known that the patient has had a chronically nonreducible incarcerated hernia. Acute hernia incarceration that is not reducible should prompt urgent operative intervention to reduce the hernia, evaluate for the viability of the incarcerated bowel, and repair the hernia defect.
Acutely incarcerated hernias that are reducible but have high-risk features (Table 1) on imaging or physical examination should favor urgent repair (defined as nonemergent but performed during the index admission). These features are related to the patient's presentation and imaging findings. Clinical high-risk features include persistent abdominal pain after reduction or persistent nausea/vomiting. Radiographic findings associated with a higher risk for hernia complications should be considered when determining the need for urgent surgery in patients without clear signs of strangulation. Beyond the typical signs of bowel ischemia (e.g. pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air), the presence of fluid within the hernia sac, a transition point of the bowel at the neck of the hernia, bowel thickening within the hernia, and inflammatory stranding in the tissue along the hernia are considered high-risk features.
While repair of a hernia on initial presentation may be ideal, patient factors or local capacity may not permit this to be reasonably performed in all settings. Patient-specific factors should be considered, including age, frailty, American Society of Anesthesia score, and preadmission anticoagulant use, as each of these variables is associated with an increased risk of complications. – Some patients with hernias that exhibit a higher risk of recurrence may be discharged but with a defined plan to repair it in the short term to minimize patients' loss of follow-up. Variables associated with a higher risk of recurrence include clinical factors and radiographic features of the hernia (Table 2). Acute onset and escalation of symptoms should be considered potential reasons to hasten repair. The need for conscious sedation to achieve a successful visceral reduction marks patients as higher risk, and they should undergo expedited repair (when performed within 4 weeks, reincarceration rates of ~2% have been reported). High-risk anatomical features include certain types of hernias with femoral and Spigelian hernias exhibiting a higher incarceration rate and need for emergent repair; therefore, these should be addressed promptly. Women with groin hernia have a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery compared with men, especially if a femoral hernia is present. The size of the fascial defect is an unreliable predictor of the need for urgent repair, but primary hernia defects between 3 and 4 cm are at higher overall risk of incarceration compared with smaller or larger defects (with a rate of 10%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–5.74; p < 0.0001). Specific measurements comparing the width of a fascial defect and the height of the hernia sack can also be used to estimate an increased risk with a "mushrooming hernia", one with a narrow neck as compared with height creating an acute angle with the abdominal wall being associated with a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–20.00). Similarly, a study by James et al.identified the ratio of hernia size to fascial defect (neck) as a potential aid in surgical decision-making, finding that a hernia-to-neck ratio > 2.5 predicted the need for emergent repair. Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal wall hernia symptoms who do not have an indication for urgent surgery are at high risk of being lost to follow-up. A prior multicenter study of patients with an ED visit for hernia-related symptoms showed that over 50% did not follow up in the outpatient clinic, with 20% returning to the ED with additional hernia-related complaints. Considering socioeconomic factors and health care disparities to determine the need for operative intervention at the index admission will address low clinic follow-up rates and prevent future ED resource utilization. When immediate repair is not required, an effort should be made to ensure follow-up and initiate planning for definitive repair before the patient is discharged from the ED or the inpatient setting. The ability to follow-up in the outpatient clinic and access to elective, outpatient surgery should also be considered.
Nonurgent repair or repair after patient optimization prior to surgery can be pursued for symptomatic hernias without high-risk features. These patients can likely be safely discharged from the ED with elective outpatient follow-up. If modifiable patient risk factors are identified at the time of hernia diagnosis (such as smoking, need for weight loss, or control of diabetes), these should be addressed before surgery. If the hernia is deemed complex, its eventual repair should be scheduled when patient optimization has been achieved and performed by a surgeon experienced in complex abdominal wall reconstruction techniques. Prediction of the need for component separation can be a subjective determination or made in various ways using data from cross-sectional imaging comparing aspects of the hernia to the remaining abdominal wall. Watchful waiting and outpatient follow-up may be considered for asymptomatic ventral, inguinal, and umbilical hernias found incidentally on imaging. While these have a reasonably high rate of requiring an eventual repair, it is likely safe to monitor these hernias after the patient has received counseling on monitoring the hernia for symptoms in the future.

### Appendectomy by senior general surgeons vs general surgery residents… [^115enXgE]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Is it safe practice for general surgery residents to perform appendectomies alone. Findings This cohort study included 1649 emergency appendectomies and compared outcomes of appendectomies performed by senior general surgeons with those performed by general surgery residents. Analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the postoperative early and late complication rates, postoperative length of hospital stay, and overall duration of antibiotic treatment. Meaning The results indicate that residents may safely perform appendectomies without the presence of a senior general surgeon. Importance In some centers, the presence of a senior general surgeon is obligatory in every procedure, including appendectomy, while in others it is not. There is a relative paucity in the literature of reports comparing the outcomes of appendectomies performed by unsupervised general surgery residents with those performed in the presence of an SGS.

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common causes of acute abdomen in the surgical profession, and the preferred method of treatment is appendectomy. 1, 2 As a result, appendectomy is one of the most frequent emergency surgical procedures, and more than 300 000 appendectomies are performed annually in the United States.
3. A retrospective analysis by Graat et al15 of 1538 appendectomy patients demonstrated that it is safe for surgical residents to perform appendectomies, with no increase in complications or negative effect on quality of care. In a multicenter, prospective study by Singh et al16 evaluating 2867 appendectomy cases, no additional patient risk was demonstrated when the operation was performed by an unsupervised surgical resident compared with operations performed by attendings.

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was confirmed by ultrasound, computed tomography, or both in all patients, except for 3 patients who were taken to surgery with no preoperative imaging. The utility of preoperative imaging studies and their influence on decision making did not differ between the groups. Learning to perform an appendectomy is an integral part of any surgical resident's training, providing the resident with basic skills of open and laparoscopic surgery. At some hospitals, a board-certified surgeon attends all cases and assists the junior resident, while at others a more senior GSR suffices. Concerns about patient outcomes have led some training programs, including ours, to determine that appendectomy should routinely be performed under the guidance of an SGS.

For neonates, infants, and children, determine on a case-by-case basis whether to leave the catheter in place and obtain consultation or to remove the catheter nonsurgically. After the injury is evaluated and a treatment plan executed, confer with the surgeon regarding relative risks and benefits of proceeding with elective surgery versus deferring surgery to allow for a period of patient observation.

### Emergency general surgery in the geriatric patient [^115EQ9u2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency general surgery in the elderly is a particular challenge to the surgeon in charge of their care. The aim was to review contemporary aspects of managing elderly patients needing emergency general surgery and possible alterations to their pathways of care.

Methods

This was a narrative review based on a PubMed/MEDLINE literature search up until 15 September 2015 for publications relevant to emergency general surgery in the geriatric patient.

Results

The number of patients presenting as an emergency with a general surgical condition increases with age. Up to one-quarter of all emergency admissions to hospital may be for general surgical conditions. Elderly patients are a particular challenge owing to added co-morbidity, use of drugs and risk of poor outcome. Frailty is an important potential risk factor, but difficult to monitor or manage in the emergency setting. Risk scores are not available universally. Outcomes are usually severalfold worse than after elective surgery, in terms of both higher morbidity and increased mortality. A care bundle including early diagnosis, resuscitation and organ system monitoring may benefit the elderly in particular. Communication with the patient and relatives throughout the care pathway is essential, as indications for surgery, level of care and likely outcomes may evolve. Ethical issues should also be addressed at every step on the pathway of care.

Conclusion

Emergency general surgery in the geriatric patient needs a tailored approach to improve outcomes and avoid futile care. Although some high-quality studies exist in related fields, the overall evidence base informing perioperative acute care for the elderly remains limited.

### Are we achieving the current waiting time targets in lung cancer treatment? Result of a prospective study from a large United Kingdom teaching hospital [^1137DS4M]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent United Kingdom National Cancer Plan guidelines have specified a number of waiting time targets to prevent delays in the treatment of lung cancer. This study was performed to compare our waiting times with national recommendations.

Methods

All newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer presenting to our institution were entered into a prospective tracking study by a dedicated audit officer. From September 2003 to December 2005, a total of 342 patients were entered into the study. Of these, 193 (56%) were referred by general practitioners; the remaining 114 (46%) were internal referrals. The Cancer Plan waiting time targets are mainly applicable to general practitioners referrals, which formed the study group.

Results

All the patients were seen in chest outpatient clinics within the recommended 2-week period. However, there was a delay in starting all forms of treatment. The median waiting time to any form of treatment was 60 days (recommendation, 62 days for all patients). From specialist referrals, the median waiting times for radiotherapy, surgery, and chemotherapy were 43, 25, and 16.5 days compared with recommended maximums of 28, 28, and 7 days, respectively.

Conclusion

These data demonstrate that although patients receive outpatient consultation in the recommended time period, the National Cancer Plan treatment target of 62 days for patients referred by general practitioners is not being achieved. A concerted effort by all clinicians is required to meet the prescribed target times.

### Systematic reviews of surgical interventions [^1127NhQ9]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

All physicians are familiar with the type of general review articles found in many medical journals. Systematic reviews are different. They apply a strict, scientific methodology to the reviewing process to produce a review that is comprehensive, reliable, and as free from bias as possible. As a result, systematic reviews occupy the highest position in the "levels of evidence" tables associated with the practice of evidence-based health care. Systematic reviews relevant to surgery are no less relevant than systematic reviews in other areas of health care. They should be a prerequisite of any new research, a key component in decision making, and an opportunity for all surgical practitioners to get involved in the conduct and interpretation of research.

- insufficient evidence for improvement in QoL

- risk of mesh exposure and non-sexual pain

- possible need for reoperations compared with native tissue repair.

### Initial experience in a vulvovaginal aesthetic surgery unit within a general gynecology department [^1152Cdvg]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate what the appropriate indications are for vulvovaginal (VV) plastic surgeries in our environment.

Materials and Methods

This is a retrospective study of 73 consecutive patients who were seen on consultation at the gynecologic aesthetic unit between January 2008 and January 2009 asking for a VV aesthetic surgery. All patients completed the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire and received information on sexuality.

Results

Of the 73 patients seen on consultation, 32 (43.8%) underwent surgery, and the main reason for this was reduction labioplasty in 19 patients, widening vaginoplasty in 6, reduction vaginoplasty in 1, and resection of asymmetries in 6 patients. None of the patients seen on consultation for vulvar bleaching, G-spot amplification, or augmentation labioplasty underwent surgery. Postoperative complications included wound dehiscence in 3 patients (9.3%) and a vulvar hematoma in 1 patient (3.1%). Postoperative sexual satisfaction was optimal for 30 patients; only 2 complained of dyspareunia.

Conclusions

Most patients seen on consultation for VV plastic surgery had no need for it and only received information regarding female anatomy and sexuality. Reduction labioplasty owing to hypertrophy of the labia minora represented the most frequent reason for consultation and surgery. Indications for VV plastic surgeries should be based not only on surgical results but also on the reported satisfaction achieved by those patients who did not undergo surgery and only received appropriate information during consultation.

### Provision of acute general surgery: a systematic review of models of care [^111VeLZp]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This article systematically reviews currently available models in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand for the provision of acute general surgical service and acute care surgery.

Method

Four hundred and thirty eight articles were identified in a literature search. Of these, 13 were included within the systematic review.

Results

Each acute care model is unique to its local and regional setting but all models have common goals. These include being consultant led, adequate resourcing with junior medical staff, theatre space and anaesthetic support and no competing elective surgical or out-patient commitments. All models require an individual, service and institutional commitment to prioritising the assessment and treatment of acute surgical patients and are characterised by uninterrupted periods of work focussed on the care of acute surgical patients supported by comprehensive patient handover to maintain safe staff working hours.

Conclusion

The provision of acute care for surgical patients is a fundamental role of general surgeons. With the diverse demands on surgeons of teaching, research, elective surgery and patient assessments as well as a family and lifestyle obligations newer systems of service provision based on collective, rather than individualised service commitment, are being developed. These systems emphasise discrete periods of defined service without elective surgical commitments with formal and structured surgeon to surgeon handover. Initial experience indicates that patient care is satisfactory, continuity of care is maintained, and acute care pathways function efficiently.

### Primary care physician follow-up and 30-day readmission after emergency general surgery admissions [^115A4Rx6]. JAMA Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The benefit of primary care physician (PCP) follow-up as a potential means to reduce readmissions in hospitalized patients has been found in other medical conditions and among patients receiving high-risk surgery. However, little is known about the implications of PCP follow-up for patients with an emergency general surgery (EGS) condition.

Objective

To evaluate the association between PCP follow-up and 30-day readmission rates after hospital discharge for an EGS condition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Master Beneficiary Summary File, Inpatient, Carrier (Part B), and Durable Medical Equipment files for beneficiaries aged 66 years or older who were hospitalized with an EGS condition that was managed operatively or nonoperatively between September 1, 2016, and November 30, 2018. Eligible patients were enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service, admitted through the emergency department with a primary diagnosis of an EGS condition, and received a general surgery consultation during the admission. Data were analyzed between July 11, 2022, and June 5, 2023.

Exposure

Follow-up with a PCP within 30 days after hospital discharge for the index admission.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was readmission within 30 days after discharge for the index admission. An inverse probability weighted regression model was used to estimate the risk-adjusted association of PCP follow-up with 30-day readmission. The secondary outcome was readmission within 30 days after discharge stratified by treatment type (operative vs nonoperative treatment) during their index admission.

Results

The study included 345 360 Medicare beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 74.4 [12.0] years; 187 804 females [54.4%]) hospitalized with an EGS condition. Of these, 156 820 patients (45.4%) had a follow-up PCP visit, 108 544 (31.4%) received operative treatment during their index admission, and 236 816 (68.6%) received nonoperative treatment. Overall, 58 253 of 332 874 patients (17.5%) were readmitted within 30 days after discharge for the index admission. After risk adjustment and propensity weighting, patients who had PCP follow-up had 67% lower odds of readmission (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.31–0.36) compared with patients without PCP follow-up. After stratifying by treatment type, patients who were treated operatively during their index admission and had subsequent PCP follow-up within 30 days after discharge had 79% reduced odds of readmission (AOR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.18–0.25); a similar association was seen among patients who were treated nonoperatively (AOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.34–0.39). Infectious conditions, heart failure, acute kidney failure, and chronic kidney disease were among the most frequent diagnoses prompting readmission overall and among operative and nonoperative treatment groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, follow-up with a PCP within 30 days after discharge for an EGS condition was associated with a significant reduction in the adjusted odds of 30-day readmission. This association was similar for patients who received operative care or nonoperative care during their index admission. In patients aged 66 years or older with an EGS condition, primary care coordination after discharge may be an important tool to reduce readmissions.

### Gynecologic oncologist as surgical consultant: intraoperative consultations during general gynecologic surgery as an important focus of gynecologic oncology training [^1179K7LA]. Gynecologic Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to explore the previously unexamined role of the Gynecologic Oncologist as an intraoperative consultant during general gynecologic surgery.

Methods

Demographic and clinical data were collected on 98 major gynecologic surgeries that included both a general Gynecologist and a Gynecologic Oncologist between October 2010 and August 2014. Data were analyzed using XLSTAT-Prov2014.2.02.

Results

Of 794 major gynecologic surgeries, 98 (12.3%) cases that involved an intraoperative consultation were identified. There were 36 (37%) planned consults and 62 (63%) unplanned consults. Significantly more planned consults were during laparoscopy (100% v 58%; p < 0.01) and significantly more unplanned consults were during laparotomy (42% v 0%; p < 0.01). The majority of planned consults were for surgical training (86%) and the most common reasons for unplanned consults were adhesions (40%), bowel injury (19%), inability to identify ureter (19%), and cancer (11%). The most common interventions performed during unplanned consults were identification of anatomy (55%), lysis of adhesions (42%), and retroperitoneal dissection (27%). Average surgeon years in practice were significantly lower for unplanned consults (9 v 15; p < 0.01). A total of 25 major adverse events occurred in 15 cases with the majority occurring in cases with unplanned consults (23% v 3%; p < 0.01). After controlling for laparotomy, unplanned consultation was not significantly associated with major events (OR = 6.67, 95%CI 0.69–64.39; p = 0.10).

Conclusions

Gynecologic Oncologists play a pivotal role in the support of generalist colleagues during pelvic surgery. In this series, Gynecologic Oncologists were consulted frequently for complex major benign surgeries. It is important to incorporate the skills required of an intraoperative consultant into Gynecologic Oncology fellowship training.

### Current practice in obtaining colleague input on challenging emergency general surgery cases: a survey of surgeons in a regional acute care surgery network [^11323C7z]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies have suggested that surgeon years of experience are associated with postoperative outcomes for emergency general surgery (EGS) patients and that there may be a benefit to obtaining input from colleagues in high-risk EGS cases. We aimed to assess current EGS practices regarding obtaining a second opinion for emergency cases and barriers to doing so across an acute care surgery network.

Methods

Surgeons providing EGS coverage across a cohort of hospitals comprising an acute care surgery network were queried in this original research survey study. Survey questions targeted surgeon perception of factors related to increased mortality and current practice regarding barriers to obtaining input from a colleague.

Results

Forty-eight surgeons responded to the survey (80%). Surgeons perceived patient age 70 years or older and American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥ 3 to be the highest risk factors for mortality. Surgeons reported that, in 23% of cases, they obtained input from a colleague most commonly because of case complexity. About a third of the time input impacted the decision to operate or operative approach. The most significant barrier to obtaining input from a colleague was the time of day/night.

Conclusions

Obtaining input from a surgical colleague is not uncommon in current practice and often impacts the care plan. The most significant barrier to obtaining colleague input may potentially be overcome by creating a cohort of trusted surgeons within a health system who are available for consultation at all times of day and night. Future studies to elucidate how to identify trusted surgeons and the impact of such a structure on patient outcomes are needed.

### Understanding of regional variation in the use of surgery [^111xFUpJ]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

The use of common surgical procedures varies widely across regions. Differences in illness burden, diagnostic practices, and patient attitudes about medical intervention explain only a small degree of regional variation in surgery rates. Evidence suggests that surgical variation results mainly from differences in physician beliefs about the indications for surgery, and the extent to which patient preferences are incorporated into treatment decisions. These two components of clinical decision making help to explain the so-called surgical signatures of specific procedures, and why some consistently vary more than others. Variation in clinical decision making is, in turn, affected by broad environmental factors, including technology diffusion, supply of specialists, local training frameworks, financial incentives, and regulatory factors, which vary across countries. Better scientific evidence about the comparative effectiveness of surgical and non-surgical interventions could help to mitigate regional variation, but broader dissemination of shared decision aids will be essential to reduce variation in preference-sensitive disorders.

### Patient education series: understanding trauma and emergency surgical conditions-emergency general surgery and the emergency general surgeon [^1133zx6h]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

How are emergency surgeries different from elective surgeries?

Emergency surgeries/operations, like those handled by an EGS surgeon, are often done urgently (within a few hours or within the same day) or emergently (as soon as possible). The patient is often very sick because the surgical problem they are having is bad enough to make the whole body sick. The surgeries are difficult and the patients can have long, hard recoveries with many complications.

Elective surgeries, on the other hand, are planned and scheduled in advance. These types of surgeries are usually done on patients who are healthy enough to be at their baseline of activity, so the surgeon has time to prepare them for surgery and the patient has a better chance of recovering from surgery without as many complications. The recovery from elective surgery can be easier because it was not an emergency where the whole body was sick at the time of surgery.

### Emergency general surgery in pregnancy [^116ToBDV]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are more than 8000 urgent non-obstetrical surgical procedures performed each year, impacting up to 2% of all pregnancies. The evaluation of the pregnant patient must weigh the risks and benefits of diagnostic methodology and therapy on the mother, and the fetus as well. Complicating care is the fact that the normal physiologic and anatomic changes that occur in pregnancy may make it difficult to interpret signs usually used in early diagnosis of emergency conditions. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of the surgical abdomen in the pregnant patient because of fear of unnecessary procedures and tests contributes to the high complication rate in this patient population. Attention to detail, heightened suspicion, serial physical examination, clinical awareness and systematic evaluation can help avert unnecessary maternal complications and fetal loss from emergency surgical conditions. This review will highlight the more common causes of the acute abdomen in pregnancy with suggested treatment options. Appropriate diagnostic tests or procedures should never be avoided or delayed simply because of pregnancy; never penalize a patient for being pregnant.

### Is the American college of surgeons online communities a safe and useful venue to ask for surgical advice? [^115xJsrW]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many surgeons rely on the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Community Forums for advice on managing complex patients. Our objective was to assess the safety and usefulness of advice provided on the most popular surgical forum.

Methods

Overall, 120 consecutive, deidentified clinical threads were extracted from the General Surgery community in reverse chronological order. Three groups of three surgeons (mixed academic and community perspectives) evaluated the 120 threads for unsafe or dangerous posts. Positive and negative controls for safe and unsafe answers were included in 20 threads, and reviewers were blinded to their presence. Reviewers were free to access all online and professional resources.

Results

There were 855 unique responses (median 7, 2–15 responses per thread) to the 120 clinical threads/scenarios. The review teams correctly identified all positive and negative controls for safety. While 58(43.3%) of threads contained unsafe advice, the majority (33, 56.9%) were corrected. Reviewers felt that a there was a standard of care response for 62/120 of the threads of which 50 (80.6%) were provided by the responses. Of the 855 responses, 107 (12.5%) were considered unsafe/dangerous.

Conclusion

The ACS Community Forums are generally a safe and useful resource for surgeons seeking advice for challenging cases. While unsafe or dangerous advice is not uncommon, other surgeons typically correct it. When utilizing the forums, advice should be taken as a congregate, and any single recommendation should be approached with healthy skepticism. However, social media such as the ACS Forums is self-regulating and can be an appropriate method for surgeons to communicate challenging problems.

### "Is general surgery still relevant to the subspecialised trainee? " A 10 year comparison of general versus specialty surgical practice [^112UcriS]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The splintering of general surgery into subspecialties in the past decade has brought into question the relevance of a continued emphasis on traditional general surgical training. With the majority of trainees now expressing a preference to subspecialise early, this study sought to identify if the requirement for proficiency in managing general surgical conditions has reduced over the past decade through comparison of general and specialty surgical admissions at a tertiary referral center.

Methods

A cross-sectional review of all surgical admissions at Cork University Hospital was performed at three individual time points: 2002, 2007 & 2012. Basic demographic details of both elective & emergency admissions were tabulated & analysed. Categorisation of admissions into specialty relevant or general surgery was made using International guidelines.

Results

11,288 surgical admissions were recorded (2002:2773, 2007:3498 & 2012:5017), showing an increase of 81% over the 10-year period. While growth in overall service provision was seen, the practice of general versus specialty relevant emergency surgery showed no statistically significant change in practice from 2002 to 2012 (p = 0.87). General surgery was mostly practiced in the emergency setting (84% of all emergency admissions in 2012) with only 28% elective admissions for general surgery. A reduction in length of stay was seen in both elective (3.62–2.58 bed days, p = 0.342) & emergency admissions (7.36–5.65, p = 0.026).

Conclusions

General surgical emergency work continues to constitute a major part of the specialists practice. These results emphasize the importance of general surgical training even for those trainees committed to sub-specialisation.

### Safe emergency general surgery-ASGBI statement [^115nFhsp]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The provision of safe emergency general surgical (EGS) care is a global issuewith changing population demographics, incidence of surgical disease and post-pandemic recovery all impacting the delivery of EGS services. Emergency admissions have risen exponentially over the past decade, with ∼750 000 emergency general surgical admissions per year in England alone.

In 2014, the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit reported considerable variation in the organization and delivery of care for emergency laparotomy patients with subsequent recommendations to standardize high-quality care in emergency laparotomy.

Here, we present results from a unique census of EGS activity defining current practice and variation and a series of further recommendations for adult EGS provision.

The EGS Steering Group of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (ASGBI) designed a prospective cross-sectional snapshot survey using a modified Delphi method to cover four areas: hospital infrastructure, EGS workload, surgical workforce and resource availability. Data collection took place between September 2022 and May 2023 with ASGBI members and EGS conference delegates invited to participate via email. Responses were received from 177 NHS Trusts, with a response rate of 88% (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Distribution of responses across the regions of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.

Respondents reported the average number of EGS patient episodes in a 24-hour period, defined as a new patient assessed by the EGS team, irrespective of whether admitted, with activity classified as low (0–10 patient episodes), medium (11–25), high (26–50), and very high (51–75). The majority of sites (86%) reported medium or high activity (Table 1).

Table 1
Distribution of emergency general surgery patient episodes in 24 hours

Eighty per cent of hospital sites had a dedicated surgical assessment unit, 77% provided an ambulatory service, often incorporating a consultant-led 'hot clinic', and 33% had a dedicated primary care advice line. Although more than 90% of sites reported 24/7 access to an emergency theatre list, less than half of sites had a dedicated EGS theatre, especially those with low and medium EGS activity. All except one site reported 24/7 access to CT yet only 10% of sites had 24/7 access to ultrasonography and only ∼50% centres had 24/7 access to interventional radiology.

### Creation and implementation of a novel clinical workflow based on the AAST uniform anatomic severity grading system for emergency general surgery conditions [^1118vGAY]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Clinical workflow integration overview

Our institution integrated AAST EGS grades into our general surgery consult service's clinical workflow in July 2017. Our general surgery service is staffed by acute care surgery (ACS) surgeons (n = 9) as well as surgeons from other specialties (n = 11). Trainees responsible for evaluating patients with EGS conditions and assigning EGS grades were provided a handbook detailing the EGS grading system. The handbook synthesized EGS grading criteria, clinical pearls, and clinical management guidelines for 13 of the 16 EGS conditions. Three conditions not routinely managed by our general surgery consult service — esophageal perforation, pleural space infection, and pelvic inflammatory disease — were excluded from our clinical workflow. A new documentation template that requires EGS grade assignment at the time of consultation was deployed within our EMR. EGS grades were assigned based on the clinical criteria described by Tominaga et al. Imaging, pathologic, and operative criteria were not considered. Figure 1 provides a schematic of our service's clinical workflow and shows areas where integration of AAST EGS grades, the handbook, and the documentation template were hypothesized to improve the efficiency and quality of our care pathway.

Schematic of the current acute care surgery clinical workflow. Gray boxes introduce hypothesized improvements as a result of proposed interventions derived from integration of the AAST EGS grading system. AAST, American Association for the Surgery of Trauma; EGS, emergency general surgery; QI, quality improvement.

The workflow underwent phased implementation (online supplemental figure 1). Phase 1 focused on familiarization with the AAST EGS grading system and its application when evaluating patients. This was accomplished via distribution of the consult handbook, email communications, and in-person education. Phase 2 pilot tested the documentation template, which was formally integrated within the EMR during phase 3. The last phase examined implementation barriers via a written survey of trainees and qualitative interviews of trainees and attending surgeons.

### Communication between primary and secondary care: deficits and danger [^112v83Pb]. Family Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Timely and accurate communication between primary and secondary care is essential for delivering high-quality patient care.

Objective

The aim of this study is to evaluate the content contained in both referral and response letters between primary and secondary care and measure this against the recommended national guidelines.

Methods

Using an observational design, senior medical students and their general practice supervisors applied practice management software to identify 100 randomly selected adults, aged greater than 50 years, from a generated list of consults over a 2-year period (2013–2015). All data included in referral and response letters for these adults were examined and compared with the gold standard templates that were informed by international guidelines.

Results

Data from 3293 referral letters and 2468 response letters from 68 general practices and 17 hospitals were analysed. The median time that had elapsed between a patient being referred and receiving a response letter was 4 weeks, ranging from 1 week for Emergency Department referral letters to 7 weeks for orthopaedic surgery referral letters. Referral letters included the reason for referral (98%), history of complaint (90%) and current medications (82%). Less commonly included were management prior to referral (65%) and medication allergies (57%). The majority of response letters included information on investigations (73%), results (70%) and follow-up plan (85%). Less commonly, response letters included medication changes (30%), medication lists (33%) and secondary diagnoses (13%).

Conclusions

Future research should be aimed at developing robust strategies to addressing communication gaps reported in this study.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: gastrointestinal stromal tumors, version 2.2022 [^1163YbtU]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) surgery — principles, perioperative imatinib, and nodal management: Surgery is the primary treatment of choice for localized or potentially resectable lesions. Preoperative imatinib can be considered to decrease surgical morbidity, and if persistent metastatic or residual tumor remains after surgery, imatinib should be continued as soon as oral intake is tolerated. GIST are fragile and should be handled with care to avoid tumor rupture, with the goal of complete gross resection with an intact pseudocapsule; after removal of suspected GIST, postoperative pathology is essential, and segmented or wedge resection to obtain negative margins is often appropriate. Lymphadenectomy is usually not required, but resection of pathologically enlarged nodes should be considered in SDH-deficient GIST; resection should aim for minimal morbidity and avoid complex multivisceral resection, and re-resection is generally not indicated for microscopically positive margins. If abdominoperineal resection would be necessary to achieve a negative margin, preoperative imatinib should be considered, and if a complex surgical procedure is anticipated, multidisciplinary consultation regarding preoperative imatinib is recommended.

### Neuroblastoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113ZCZUG]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Neuroblastoma — general principles of surgery emphasize that understanding the heterogeneous nature of neuroblastoma is critical when determining the optimal timing and extent of surgical resection. Patients with intermediate-risk disease most often require treatment with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, and if more than minimal risks of surgical morbidity exist, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be administered initially, as systemic therapy may reduce subsequent surgical risk. In the setting of high-risk disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is nearly always indicated prior to resection. For all risk groups, the surgical approach should limit morbidity and mortality, avoid resection of vital structures, and preserve organ function. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Non-enhancing bowel dilatation and secondary ileus on CT as a surgical red flag in geriatric patients with atypical presentations [^1154cpoz]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Contrast-Enhanced Abdominal CT (November 20, 2024)

General surgery consultation was invited, Emergency general surgery consultation identified three critical red flags: Inflammatory indicators increase progressively; CT evidence of non-perfused bowel (absence of mural enhancement); Failure of conservative therapy despite 48-hour intensive monitoring. After general surgery consultation and multidisciplinary evaluation, surgical intervention was determined to be necessary. The patient was transferred to the general surgery ward and underwent exploratory laparotomy on November 20, 2024. Upon initial entry into the abdominal cavity, no inflammatory reaction, effusion, or pus was observed. However, upon retracting the omentum superiorly, segmental necrosis of the splenic flexure of the transverse colon was identified, along with surrounding exudate, as well as dilated and swollen ileum and ascending colon (Fig. 4). Subsequently, a necrotic colon resection with proximal colostomy was performed. After the operation, the patient was transferred to the ICU due to ventilator dependence. After anti-infection, nutritional support and cardiopulmonary function regulation, the patient recovered and was discharged on the 14th day after the operation.

Fig. 4
Intraoperative exploration showed partial necrosis of the transverse colon (November 20, 2024)

Discussion and conclusions

The patient, presenting with intestinal obstruction and significant abdominal distension, underwent open exploratory laparotomy without prior laparoscopic assessment due to restricted abdominal space. Initial intraoperative exploration revealed a clean abdomen without inflammation, explaining the absence of preoperative peritonitis signs. Further examination showed localized necrotizing colitis in the transverse colon, encapsulated by the omentum and mesentery, restricting infection spread and accounting for the patient's atypical presentation of no fever and slow - progressing inflammatory markers.

The transverse colon's blood supply mainly comes from the middle colic artery, a superior mesenteric artery branch, with additional supply from the marginal artery, an anastomotic arch between the left and right colic arteries. The colon has a relatively low blood flow and reduced perfusion during functional inactivity, making it vulnerable to ischemia. The splenic flexure has few vascular collaterals, being the most susceptible to ischemic changes when blood flow decreases. The colonic mucosa and submucosa receive 70% of the mesenteric blood, while the muscularis propria and serosa receive the remaining 30%. Ischemic injury first occurs in the colonic mucosa, most commonly on the anti - mesenteric side.

It is often that the acute care surgeon will be called on to evaluate the pregnant patient with abdominal pain. Most of the diagnostic and management decisions regarding pregnant patients will follow the usual tenets of surgery; however, there are important differences in the pregnant patient to be aware of to avoid pitfalls which can lead to complications for both mother and fetus. This review hopes to describe the most common emergencies facing the surgeon caring for the pregnant patient and the latest management options.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: gastrointestinal stromal tumors, version 2.2022 [^113LRmsZ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor surgery — Surgery is the primary treatment of choice for patients with localized or potentially resectable GIST lesions, and preoperative imatinib can be considered to decrease surgical morbidity. If persistent metastatic or residual tumor remains after surgery, then imatinib should be continued as soon as the patient is able to tolerate oral intake. GIST are fragile and should be handled with care to avoid tumor rupture; the goal is to achieve complete gross resection of the tumor with an intact pseudocapsule, and after removal of any suspected GIST, postoperative pathology assessment is essential to confirm the diagnosis. Segmented or wedge resection to obtain negative margins is often appropriate. Lymphadenectomy is usually not required given the low incidences of nodal metastases, but resection of pathologically enlarged nodes should be considered in patients with SDH-deficient GIST. Resection should be accomplished with minimal morbidity and complex multivisceral resection should be avoided; re-resection is generally not indicated for microscopically positive margins on final pathology. If abdominoperineal resection would be necessary to achieve a negative margin, then preoperative imatinib should be considered, and if the surgeon feels that a complex surgical procedure is required, then a multidisciplinary consultation regarding the use of preoperative imatinib is recommended.

### Defining burden and severity of disease for emergency general surgery [^1112fgbK]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

As general surgery trainees continue to enter specialty practice at a high rate, fewer and fewer are caring for emergency general surgery (EGS) patients. Thus EGS has become one of the cornerstones of the practice of acute care surgery. With the centralization of this area of surgical care in many areas of the country, a clear understanding of the issues associated with this becomes vital. Understanding the public health implications with respect to burden of care and cost will allow for appropriate planning and resource allocation in the future. In addition, the development of validated severity modeling will help with risk stratification in future study of these diseases.

### WSES worldwide emergency general surgery formation and evaluation project [^114VWyN9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Optimal management of emergency surgical patients represents one of the major health challenges worldwide. Emergency surgical procedures may interfere with the daily planned surgical activity and therefore overwhelm the unprepared system. Many medical systems are not ready to deal with concurrent emergency and elective surgical procedures. Emergency general surgery (EGS) was identified in the 2000s as multidisciplinary surgery performed for traumatic and non-traumatic acute conditions during the same admission in the hospital. EGS represents the easiest viable way to provide affordable and high-quality level of care to emergency surgical and trauma patients taking into account the pathophysiology, surgical and trauma emergencies, and critical care. In several countries, it may result from the association of different physicians with other specialties in a cooperative model (i.e. emergency physicians, intensivists). In low-resource settings, these different providers may even be represented by the only general surgeon. The critically ill EGS patient requires prompt evaluation and, in many cases, early surgical intervention because of the uniqueness of the surgical acute conditions which are accompanied by high rates of complications and death. The aforementioned landscape of EGS highlights the difficulty for the emergency general surgeon to plan and endorse appropriate management schemes to optimize timely treatment.

### Comparison of outcomes in below-knee amputation between vascular and general surgeons [^115K983E]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence to suggest outcomes may be related to surgeon experience or skill level. Lower extremity amputations are performed by both general surgeons (GSs) and vascular surgeons (VSs); however, the effect of specialty on postoperative outcome in below-knee amputation is not known. This retrospective study compares outcomes in below-knee amputations (BKA) between VS and GS.

Methods

Patients who underwent below-knee amputations between 2005 and 2014 were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database. Data collected included patient demographics, comorbid conditions, and indication for procedures. Univariate and multivariate unconditional logistic regression models and linear regression models were employed to evaluate the associations between various outcomes and indications for surgery, emergency and teaching status, and surgical specialty.

Results

Amputations performed by GSs experienced an increased risk of developing pneumonia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–1.86), pulmonary embolism (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.10–4.01), and sepsis (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.05–1.59). When stratified by indications for BKA, similar outcomes were noted between GS and VS if indication for surgery was diabetes or peripheral vascular disease; however, there was increased risk of pneumonia (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.26–2.74), sepsis (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.39–2.75), and death (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.04–2.07, P = 0.027) when GS performed BKA for infectious indications. Overall complications were higher when GS performed BKA emergently (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01–1.36).

Conclusion

There are less postoperative complications when VSs performed BKA for infectious indications, during emergencies, and at nonteaching hospitals. Clinicians should consider vascular consultation for these specific scenarios.

### Guideline compliance in bariatric surgery: a French nationwide study [^116yT8ak]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Strict adherence to guidelines with a comprehensive preoperative assessment and rigorous follow-up are essential to improve postoperative and long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery (BS).

Objectives

To investigate the trends in BS in France and to assess the compliance to guidelines in people with obesity before and after BS.

Setting

University Hospital of Bordeaux, France.

Methods

Data on patients who were admitted for a primary BS procedure in France between January 1 and April 1, 2014, were extracted from the French national health insurance system database. Data on patients' characteristics, preoperative assessment, hospitalization, and postoperative follow-up, including medical consultations, laboratory tests, and drug consumption, during the year preceding and the 2 years after BS were collected.

Results

Most of the 11,824 patients (60.4%) had sleeve gastrectomy. Rates of reimbursement for preoperative consultations with general practitioners, digestive surgeons, and endocrinologists or internists were 94.5%, 89.2%, and 63%, respectively. Laboratory tests for nutritional and obesity-related co-morbidity evaluations were performed in 94.3% and 91.4%, respectively. Rates of consultation with general practitioners, digestive surgeons, and endocrinologists or internists dropped from 93.1%, 91.2%, and 29.2%, respectively, the first year to 88.4%, 50.3%, and 20%, respectively, the second year after BS (P < .001). Reimbursements for vitamin, iron, and calcium supplementation dropped from 66.6%, 24.9%, and 21%, respectively, the first year to 52.1%, 19.3%, and 11.7%, respectively, the second year after BS (P < .001).

Conclusion

Overall compliance with guidelines is improving. While preoperative medical assessment is nearly optimal, efforts still should be made in order to improve long-term follow-up in general and patient adherence to micronutrient supplementation in particular.

### Performance of general surgical procedures in outpatient settings before and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic [^114p9uNk]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the COVID-19 pandemic associated with an accelerated transition from inpatient to outpatient general surgery procedures in hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program?

Findings

In this cohort study of 988 436 patients who underwent 16 common general surgery operations, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significantly increased odds of outpatient surgery for 8 procedures (above and beyond secular trends). However, the actual percentage increase in outpatient cases was small (ie, < 10%) for all but 4 procedures.

Meaning

These findings suggest that despite calls for the expansion of outpatient surgery to mitigate the growing backlog of surgical cases in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, uptake of this practice occurred in only a small subset of operations.
