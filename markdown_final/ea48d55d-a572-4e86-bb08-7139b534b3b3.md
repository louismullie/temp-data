## Question

Is it a good idea to just perform an ECG to establish a baseline heart?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether doing an ECG just to establish a baseline in an asymptomatic person is a good idea and when, if at all, it would change management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between screening versus diagnostic ECG use. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (USPSTF, ACP/AAFP, ESC) recommend for asymptomatic adults at different risk levels. Next, I will check specific high-risk contexts where a baseline ECG is clearly indicated by labeling or specialty guidelines. After that, I need to review outcome data and risk reclassification evidence. Then, I will assess harms and cost-effectiveness. Finally, I should synthesize a risk-based framework and give a clear recommendation, ensuring I have not conflated athlete-specific programs or drug-specific safety requirements with general population screening.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual frame: a "baseline ECG" in an asymptomatic person constitutes screening, not diagnostic testing, and the value of any screening test depends on whether it changes management in a way that improves clinical outcomes; hold on, I should verify that the evidence base for ECG screening specifically assesses downstream outcomes rather than predictive associations alone, because prediction without action rarely translates to benefit.

> I should confirm guideline positions next before drawing conclusions; the USPSTF recommends against screening low-risk asymptomatic adults with resting or exercise ECG because it does not improve outcomes beyond traditional risk factor assessment, and evidence is insufficient for intermediate or high-risk groups, while the ACP advises against low-value cardiac screening with resting ECG in asymptomatic low-risk adults, and AAFP guidance similarly discourages screening for CAD with exercise ECG in asymptomatic low-risk people; importantly, the ESC recommends resting ECG for patients who report chest pain but does not endorse routine asymptomatic screening, which I need to keep separate from targeted diagnostic use [^112AU8CT] [^117VTJqh] [^111pPkuJ] [^114MSTvt].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale behind these recommendations; in low-prevalence populations, positive ECG findings seldom meaningfully reclassify risk or change preventive therapy beyond what is already indicated by standard risk calculators, and although observational cohorts show that minor and major ECG abnormalities correlate with events and can improve statistical risk prediction, this has not translated into demonstrated outcome benefit from screening-directed interventions, and there is concern that incidental ECG findings could drive overtreatment without improving mortality [^116MzaVD] [^116NC6Fi] [^112Gp3t9].

> Now, I need to check for specific high-risk scenarios where a baseline ECG is actually indicated; hold on, I should verify drug labeling and disease-specific guidance first: before initiating certain QTc-prolonging or bradycardic agents such as methadone, a baseline ECG is recommended or required depending on the patient's risk factors and recent ECG availability, and for S1P modulators like ponesimod or ozanimod, labels call for a pre-treatment ECG to detect preexisting conduction disease; in systemic diseases with potential cardiac involvement, such as extracardiac sarcoidosis and Turner syndrome, specialty guidelines recommend a baseline ECG to screen for silent cardiac manifestations; pre-participation screening of competitive athletes is recommended to include ECG by some European sports cardiology pathways, but this remains controversial in the U.S., where many societies still prioritize history and physical alone due to false positives and infrastructure needs, so I should not generalize athlete-specific programs to the general population without careful consideration [^111wDEQy] [^115L4e2X] [^117EygZF] [^113jSrPZ] [^1143muct] [^114BR6nw] [^1152G6ii] [^113fvbwr] [^111Z96Fr] [^111kPnYW].

> I will now examine how ECG is used diagnostically rather than for screening, because I need to ensure I don't conflate the two; in patients with chest pain, a resting ECG is recommended as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation, and ambulatory ECG is appropriate when an arrhythmia is suspected, while exercise ECG remains useful in selected patients to assess exercise tolerance, symptoms, arrhythmias, blood pressure response, and risk, but these are targeted diagnostic or risk-stratification applications rather than routine screening of asymptomatic low-risk adults [^114MSTvt] [^115sNi4A] [^116XvyzG] [^11227zxo].

> Next, I should review outcomes evidence to confirm there is no mortality benefit to screening; randomized trials in asymptomatic diabetics showed no reduction in cardiovascular events with exercise ECG screening versus usual care, and there are no RCTs of resting ECG screening in asymptomatic adults; this aligns with guideline conclusions that added ECG information rarely triggers management changes that improve outcomes beyond aggressive risk factor control [^116NC6Fi] [^112AU8CT] [^114aGFiQ].

> But wait, what about harms and costs; I need to check the magnitude of false positives, downstream testing, and potential iatrogenesis; population and athlete data show substantial false-positive ECGs leading to cascades of testing, potential invasive angiography with its own risks, cost-inefficiency, anxiety, possible disqualification from sports, and even a signal that overtreatment could increase all-cause mortality, which reinforces the caution against routine screening in low-risk settings and highlights the need for expert interpretation and structured pathways if screening is pursued in select programs [^115K4wCn] [^117FgKnv] [^117VTJqh] [^112Gp3t9] [^112ffpXb].

> Let me synthesize a risk-based framework and double-check that it aligns with the above evidence; do not screen asymptomatic, low-risk adults because benefits are unproven and harms are real, do screen when a clear indication exists such as drug-specific labeling requirements, systemic diseases with known cardiac involvement, or organized athlete programs with appropriate infrastructure and expert ECG interpretation, and individualize intermediate-risk decisions by asking whether an ECG result would change management and outcomes, ensuring systems are in place to manage abnormal findings responsibly [^112AU8CT] [^111xxGnv] [^112ffpXb] [^114MSTvt].

> Final recommendation, with one last self-check to avoid overgeneralization: No, it is generally not advisable to "just" obtain a baseline ECG in an asymptomatic, low-risk person without a specific indication; reserve baseline ECG for contexts where results will alter management or are required by guidelines or labeling, and otherwise focus on rigorous risk factor modification and guideline-directed prevention, documenting the rationale if an individualized exception is made [^117VTJqh] [^111pPkuJ] [^112AU8CT].

It is **generally not recommended** to obtain a routine baseline ECG for asymptomatic, low-risk adults, as it does not improve outcomes [^112AU8CT] and may prompt unnecessary testing and anxiety [^111pPkuJ] [^117VTJqh]. Baseline ECG is appropriate for patients with **cardiac symptoms** [^114MSTvt] or **known heart disease**, and before starting **QT-prolonging drugs** [^111wDEQy] [^113NPQTL]. In athletes, ECG may be considered in high-risk or competitive settings but is not universally required [^113fvbwr] [^111kPnYW]. For low-risk patients, prioritize risk factor management and lifestyle; **use ECG selectively** based on clinical context [^117VTJqh].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

### General adult population

- **USPSTF recommendations**: Routine ECG screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults at low risk of cardiovascular events (10-year risk < 10%) [^112AU8CT] [^116NC6Fi].

- **ESC guidelines**: Resting ECG is recommended for patients with chest pain or suspected myocardial ischemia, but not for routine screening in asymptomatic individuals [^114MSTvt].

- **AAFP guidelines**: Routine ECG screening is not recommended for asymptomatic individuals at low risk of cardiovascular events [^111pPkuJ].

---

### Specific populations

- **Athletes**: Pre-participation cardiovascular evaluation, including ECG, may be considered for competitive athletes, particularly those at higher risk [^113fvbwr] [^1117L2nX].

- **Patients initiating QT-prolonging medications**: Baseline ECG is recommended before starting medications known to prolong the QT interval, such as methadone or certain oncology drugs [^111wDEQy] [^113NPQTL].

- **Patients with specific medical conditions**: Baseline ECG is recommended for patients with conditions such as Kawasaki disease, Turner syndrome, or sarcoidosis, where cardiac involvement is a concern [^113iBE3Y] [^1152G6ii] [^114BR6nw].

---

## Benefits of baseline ECG

Baseline ECG can **detect asymptomatic arrhythmias**, conduction abnormalities, or structural heart disease [^112Gp3t9], enabling early intervention [^11111RNm]. It also establishes an individual's cardiac baseline for future comparisons and supports risk stratification to guide further diagnostic evaluation and management [^116MzaVD].

---

## Limitations and potential harms

- **False positives and unnecessary testing**: Routine ECG screening in low-risk populations can lead to false positives [^112AU8CT], resulting in unnecessary diagnostic procedures, anxiety, and increased healthcare costs [^117VTJqh].

- **Limited predictive value**: ECG abnormalities alone have limited predictive value for future cardiovascular events, particularly in asymptomatic individuals without risk factors [^116NC6Fi].

- **Resource utilization**: Routine ECG screening in low-risk populations may not be cost-effective and can strain healthcare resources [^117VTJqh].

---

## Clinical scenarios where baseline ECG is particularly useful

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for baseline ECG** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic patients (chest pain, palpitations, syncope) | Strongly recommended [^114MSTvt] |
| Patients with known cardiovascular disease | Strongly recommended [^114MSTvt] |
| Patients initiating QT-prolonging medications | Strongly recommended [^111wDEQy] [^113NPQTL] |
| Competitive athletes (high-risk or elite) | Considered [^113fvbwr] [^114JaLuj] |
| Patients with specific medical conditions (Kawasaki disease, Turner syndrome, sarcoidosis) | Strongly recommended [^113iBE3Y] [^1152G6ii] [^114BR6nw] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where baseline ECG is not recommended

Avoid routine ECG screening in **Asymptomatic, low-risk adults**, given its limited benefit and potential harms [^112AU8CT] [^111xPUqj], and in **Patients without cardiovascular risk factors**, for whom it is likewise not recommended [^111pPkuJ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine baseline ECG is **not recommended** [^112AU8CT] for asymptomatic, low-risk adults because of limited predictive value and potential harms. Baseline ECG is valuable for symptomatic patients [^114MSTvt], those with known cardiovascular disease, individuals starting QT-prolonging medications [^111wDEQy], competitive athletes, and patients with specific medical conditions [^114BR6nw]. Use clinical judgment and individual risk assessment to decide whether to obtain a baseline ECG.

### Screening for cardiovascular disease risk with electrocardiography: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112AU8CT]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which encompasses atherosclerotic conditions such as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease, is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States. Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by CVD risk assessment with tools such as the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equations, which stratify individual risk to inform treatment decisions.

The objective of this review was to update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for coronary heart disease with electrocardiography (ECG).

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether screening with resting or exercise ECG improves health outcomes compared with the use of traditional CVD risk assessment alone in asymptomatic adults.

For asymptomatic adults at low risk of CVD events (individuals with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 10%), it is very unlikely that the information from resting or exercise ECG, beyond that obtained with conventional CVD risk factors, will result in a change in the patient's risk category, as assessed by the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations, that would lead to a change in treatment and ultimately improve health outcomes. Possible harms are associated with screening with resting or exercise ECG, specifically the potential adverse effects of subsequent invasive testing. For asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events, there is insufficient evidence to determine the extent to which information from ECG improves health outcomes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for coronary artery disease, particularly with respect to resting ECG, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a resting 12-lead ECG in all patients reporting chest pain, unless an obvious non-cardiac cause is identified. This is especially important during or immediately after an episode suggestive of myocardial ischemia.

### The electrocardiogram as a prognostic tool for predicting major cardiac events [^116eQ8EB]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Among patients with cardiac disease, identifying those at low risk versus those at high risk for major cardiac events is crucial for the rational clinical management of individuals. Correct noninvasive risk stratification of cardiac patients has significant clinical implications. It can prevent unnecessary exposure to potentially risky invasive diagnostic or interventional procedures in low-risk patients while allowing an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach in high-risk patients.

Moreover, the appropriate identification of low- and high-risk patients has social and economic implications by optimizing resource distribution and costs. Numerous studies in previous decades have provided evidence that several methods and variables derived from the analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) are powerful predictors of major cardiac events in various clinical conditions. Despite this, there has been limited attention to how these findings can be utilized in clinical practice.

In recent years, the focus of studies on risk stratification of cardiac patients has shifted mainly to serum/plasma biomarkers, with less attention to ECG variables. Surprisingly, there have been few attempts to determine whether the proposed risk markers provide significant additional information beyond that derived from ECG methods. This article examines the evidence for the prognostic value of variables from the assessment of the ECG signal.

### Routine ECG screening in infancy and early childhood should not be performed [^115ouQA7]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

For all of us working in the field of inherited heart conditions, our ultimate aim is the prevention of sudden cardiac death in young people in our communities. We share the passion and drive to this aim with our colleagues, Saul et al, who write to advocate screening of infants for LQTS. Although Saul et al. aimed to write an unbiased review of the subject, they present data that support screening while underrepresenting evidence against it. Their illustrative Figure 1 is arguably misleading, presenting a graph of freedom from any cardiac event in symptomatic individuals with familial LQTS. We know that 87% of deaths from LQTS occur in those who were previously symptomatic. This discussion, however, is not about symptomatic patients with LQTS; it is about the detection of presymptomatic individuals on a community level.

Our aim is to present evidence that has led us to oppose the conclusions and suggestions of their article. Most pediatric cardiologists do not wish to see ECG screening in infancy, and we are among them. Saul et al. state that there is sufficient evidence to propose ECG screening in infancy for LQTS. We disagree. We disagree with this view for a number of reasons:

- **The effectiveness of such a program**: This has not been evaluated in terms of outcome.
- **The ECG as a diagnostic tool**: The ECG is an unreliable diagnostic tool with unacceptable reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity.
- **Adverse effects**: The adverse effects of overdiagnosing or underdiagnosing LQTS in thousands of individuals have not been evaluated.
- **Definitive criterion standards**: There are no definitive criterion standards by which LQTS can be excluded once tested.

The article by Williams et al. explores the ongoing debate concerning the efficacy of incorporating ECGs into screenings for cardiovascular disease in young individuals. The authors argue against replacing comprehensive history and physical screenings, as recommended by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, with ECGs alone. They contend that the traditional methods provide valuable information and that an over-reliance on ECGs could lead to unnecessary anxiety and medical interventions.

### Major adverse cardiac event rates in moderate-risk patients: Does prior coronary disease matter [^115vyJpk]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

This study indicates that moderate-risk patients (History, ECG, Age, and Risk factors score ≥ 4; nonischemic electrocardiogram; and negative serial troponin measures) with no prior coronary artery disease have a low 30-day major adverse cardiac events rate. However, patients with a history of coronary artery disease are at higher risk for adverse events, even in the absence of elevated troponins or acute ischemic electrocardiogram changes. These data suggest that routine objective cardiac testing may not be indicated in moderate-risk patients without a history of coronary artery disease. Prospective research evaluating the safety and efficacy of avoiding hospitalization and objective cardiac testing among moderate-risk patients without prior coronary artery disease is needed.

### Cardiac repolarization and the safety of new drugs defined by electrocardiography [^115YaWk9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

A compelling assessment of both short- and long-term cardiac safety is increasingly emphasized before regulatory marketing approval. In that context, cardiac adverse effects that were otherwise unexpected become manifest when large numbers of subjects are treated after market approval, many of whom take multiple medications, have co-morbidities, and are subject to other conditions that were not represented in the original clinical trial population. Since 2005, dedicated, robust, and well-controlled electrocardiogram (ECG) trials are required, usually conducted in Phase II, to define the cardiac risk of a new therapy before large-scale Phase III trials are conducted or marketing is approved.

### Meta-analysis on the effectiveness of ECG screening for conditions related to sudden cardiac death in young athletes [^112NY1fT]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes is a devastating event that may be preventable by effective pre-participation screening. However, there is no universally accepted screening method for the conditions associated with SCD. In Italy, a pre-participation electrocardiogram (ECG) screening program has been in place since 1982, and a previous study by Corrado et al. has shown that it significantly decreased the incidence of SCD. However, a comparative study by Maron et al. has disputed these findings. The American Heart Association (AHA) and the Association for European Paediatric Cardiology (AEPC) both recommend a screening history and physical examination (H&P) be performed. The AEPC guidelines also recommend a 12-lead ECG be performed before clearing an athlete to play, while the AHA does not. The last meta-analysis on the subject was published in 2015. That same year, an international group of cardiologists came to a consensus on an update to ECG interpretation criteria in athletes. This was the third such update since 2010, following the publication of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) criteria in 2010 and the Seattle criteria in 2013, indicating a need for a new meta-analysis to reflect these updates. Therefore, we sought to conduct a meta-analysis of the literature between 2015 and 2020 to compare the value of H&P with that of a 12-lead ECG as a screening tool for detecting cardiac disease.

### Prevalence of abnormal electrocardiograms in a large, unselected population undergoing pre-participation cardiovascular screening [^115K4wCn]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The implementation of 12-lead ECG in the pre-participation screening of young athletes remains controversial, with several issues being actively debated, including the prevalence and spectrum of ECG abnormalities found in individuals undergoing such screenings.

- **Methods and results**: We assessed a large, unselected population comprising 32,652 subjects [26,050 (80%) males], who were prospectively examined in 19 clinics associated with the Italian Sports Medicine Federation. Most participants were young amateur athletes aged between 8 and 78 years (median age 17), predominantly students (68%). The sports they engaged in included soccer (39%), volleyball or basketball (8% each), athletics (6%), cycling (5%), and swimming (4%). The ECG patterns were evaluated according to commonly used clinical criteria. The 12-lead ECG patterns were considered normal in 28,799 of the 32,652 athletes (88.2%) and abnormal in 3,853 (11.8%). The most frequent abnormalities included prolonged PR interval, incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB), and early repolarization pattern (total 2,280, 7.0%). Distinct ECG abnormalities included deeply inverted T-waves in more than 2 precordial and/or standard leads (751, 2.3%), increased R/S wave voltages suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy (247, 0.8%), conduction disorders, such as RBBB (351, 1.0%), left anterior fascicular block (162, 0.5%), and left bundle branch block (19, 0.1%). Rare findings included cardiac pre-excitation pattern (42, 0.1%) and prolonged QTc interval (1, 0.03%).

- **Conclusion**: In a large, unselected population of young athletes undergoing pre-participation screening, the prevalence of markedly abnormal ECG patterns was documented.

### Does this patient with chest pain have acute coronary syndrome? The rational clinical examination systematic review [^112Zsapb]. JAMA (2015). High credibility.

About 10% of patients with acute chest pain are ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Early and accurate estimation of the probability of ACS in these patients using the clinical examination could prevent many hospital admissions among low-risk patients and ensure that high-risk patients are promptly treated.

- **Objective**: To review systematically the accuracy of the initial history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and risk scores incorporating these elements with the first cardiac-specific troponin.

- **Study selection**: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched (January 1, 1995-July 31, 2015), along with reference lists from retrieved articles, to identify prospective studies of diagnostic test accuracy among patients admitted to the emergency department with symptoms suggesting ACS.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: We identified 2992 unique articles; 58 met inclusion criteria.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio (LR) of findings for the diagnosis of ACS. The reference standard for ACS was either a final hospital diagnosis of ACS or occurrence of a cardiovascular event within 6 weeks.

- **Results**: The clinical findings and risk factors most suggestive of ACS were prior abnormal stress test (specificity, 96%; LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 2.0–4.7]), peripheral arterial disease (specificity, 97%; LR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.5–4.8]), and pain radiation to both arms (specificity, 96%; LR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.8–3.7]). The most useful electrocardiogram findings were ST-segment depression (specificity, 95%; LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–8.6]).

### Routine electrocardiogram screening and cardiovascular disease events in adults [^112Gp3t9]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Our findings highlight the potential role of baseline minor ECG abnormalities. We identified an association between the presence and number of minor ECG abnormalities with the risk of incident CVD and the development of new major ECG abnormalities over time in a more generalizable population, supported by previous studies performed in limited populations. Our analysis further enabled a comprehensive distinction between minor ECG abnormalities associated with clinical outcomes and those that were not. While some major ECG abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation, have indications for further diagnostics and possibly treatment, minor ECG abnormalities have often been overlooked, and there is currently no guideline recommendation specifically addressing the management of multiple minor ECG abnormalities. Thus, our findings could shed new light on the clinical importance of minor ECG abnormalities incidentally detected in health screening settings.

The critical challenge persists on whether appropriate interventions following the identification of high-risk cases by ECG are available. Although our findings indicate an association between ECG results and CVD events, they do not imply that ECG results themselves or additional interventions based on the ECG results mitigate the outcomes of CVD. In addition, there is a possibility that the observed increased risk of all-cause mortality among individuals with ECG abnormalities could be partially due to overtreatment, such as potentially unnecessary invasive procedures. Furthermore, effective intervention is not necessarily available for patients identified through routine screening.

### Cardiac screening with electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, or myocardial perfusion imaging: Advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians [^117VTJqh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac screening in adults using resting or stress electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, or myocardial perfusion imaging can reveal findings associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease events. However, inappropriate cardiac testing of low-risk adults has been identified by several professional societies as an important area of overuse.

- **Methods**: Narrative review based on published systematic reviews, guidelines, and articles on the yield, benefits, and harms of cardiac screening in low-risk adults.

- **Results**: Cardiac screening has not been shown to improve patient outcomes. It is also associated with potential harms due to false-positive results, as they can lead to subsequent, potentially unnecessary tests and procedures. Cardiac screening is likely to be particularly inefficient in adults at low risk for coronary heart disease given the low prevalence and predictive values of testing in this population, and the low likelihood that positive findings will affect treatment decisions. In this patient population, clinicians should focus on strategies for mitigating cardiovascular risk by treating modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and overweight, and encouraging healthy levels of exercise.

- **High-value care advice**: Clinicians should not screen for cardiac disease in asymptomatic, low-risk adults using resting or stress electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, or stress myocardial perfusion imaging.

### Ponvory [^113jSrPZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present. In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for initiation of Ponvory treatment to help reduce cardiac effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

In patients with sinus bradycardia, first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure with onset more than 6 months prior to initiation, first-dose monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)].

Ponvory is not recommended in patients with a history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease (e.g. TIA, stroke occurring more than 6 months prior to treatment initiation), uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy.

Use of Ponvory in patients with a history of syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment to determine the most appropriate monitoring.

Experience with Ponvory is limited in patients receiving therapy with drugs that decrease heart rate (e.g. beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil, and other drugs that may decrease heart rate).

### The pre-sports cardiovascular evaluation: Should it depend on the level of competition, the sport, or the state [^116DKwfi]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in an athlete is a rare but tragic event, and significant controversy exists regarding the most effective method to define those at highest risk. Recommendations of the American Heart Association require that a history and physical examination be used for preparticipation screening, with an abnormal cardiac finding expected to prompt further evaluation. Given the lack of data documenting that electrocardiogram (ECG) screening in all competitive athletes is either feasible or appropriate, these guidelines state that such screening is optional, but not mandatory. The extremely low incidence of SCD events, in conjunction with the low sensitivity and specificity of ECG as a screening tool in athletes, contributes to this recommendation.

Although these guidelines target all competitive athletes, there may be subgroups of athletes, based on age, level of competition, individual sport, or state of residence, for which mandatory ECG screening may be both appropriate and sensible. Given the lack of resolution of the ongoing ECG debate, it is perhaps reasonable to consider screening specific high-risk subgroups of athletes rather than continuing to dispute whether to screen all competitive athletes or none at all. Recent data suggest that such a program may be feasible and may provide a rational basis for subsequent expansion of cardiovascular screening programs.

### Association of 6-minute walk performance and physical activity with incident ischemic heart disease events and stroke in peripheral artery disease [^114m6E76]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Baseline and follow-up data collection - Baseline measures included the ABI, medical history, phlebotomy, a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and height and weight for calculating body mass index (BMI). After baseline testing, we asked participants to return every 2 months. At each follow-up visit, participants underwent an ECG and questionnaire administration to identify new hospitalizations. We made home visits to participants unwilling or unable to attend a follow-up visit. If a home visit was refused, we called participants to obtain information about hospitalizations.

- **Baseline measures**: We ascertained and confirmed baseline comorbidities using patient reports obtained from questionnaire administration, medical record review, medication use, and results of a primary care physician questionnaire. We entered these data into comorbidity algorithms, developed and validated by the Women's Health and Aging Study, to ascertain and confirm the presence of baseline comorbidities including diabetes, angina, heart failure, pulmonary disease, history of myocardial infarction (MI), and cancer. Symptomatic angina at baseline was defined as exertional chest pain that did not begin at rest, that resolved within 10 minutes of rest, or that resolved with nitroglycerin.

- **Ankle-brachial index**: We used a hand-held Doppler probe (Nicolet Vascular Pocket Dop II) to measure systolic blood pressures after the participant rested supine for 5 minutes. Measured pressures were right brachial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial arteries and left dorsalis pedis.

### Simple electrocardiographic measures improve sudden arrhythmic death prediction in coronary disease [^11111RNm]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

The study aims to determine whether the combination of standard electrocardiographic (ECG) markers reflecting domains of arrhythmic risk improves sudden and/or arrhythmic death (SAD) risk stratification in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).

The association between ECG markers and SAD was examined in a derivation cohort (PREDETERMINE; N = 5462) with adjustment for clinical risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and competing risk. Competing outcome models assessed the differential association of ECG markers with SAD and competing mortality. The predictive value of a derived ECG score was then validated (ARTEMIS; N = 1900).

In the derivation cohort, the 5-year cumulative incidence of SAD was 1.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–1.9) and 6.2% (95% CI 4.5–8.3) in those with a low- and high-risk ECG score, respectively (P for Δ < 0.001). A high-risk ECG score was more strongly associated with SAD than non-SAD mortality (adjusted hazard ratios = 2.87 vs. 1.38 respectively; P for Δ = 0.003), and the proportion of deaths due to SAD was greater in the high vs. low-risk groups (24.9% vs. 16.5%, P for Δ = 0.03). Similar findings were observed in the validation cohort.

The addition of ECG markers to a clinical risk factor model inclusive of LVEF improved indices of discrimination and reclassification in both derivation and validation cohorts, including correct reclassification of 28% of patients in the validation cohort (net reclassification improvement 28% [7–49%], P = 0.009).

In conclusion, for patients with CHD, an externally validated ECG score enriched for predicting SAD provides improved risk stratification.

### Cardiac evaluation of young athletes: Time for a risk-based approach [^111xxGnv]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Electrocardiogram-detectable etiologies are implicated in 117 cases of sudden cardiac arrest and death in US competitive athletes aged 11–29 years. When ample sports cardiology resources are available, the routine use of ECG is possible in the PPSC of all athletes. However, reserving the ECG for smaller populations of higher-risk groups may offer a more pragmatic approach for institutions that are not equipped with the infrastructure and expertise to adequately support an ECG-based model on a larger scale.

It is prudent to consider the ethical issues of such an approach. Institutions may argue that equivalent screening services should be available to all athletes under their care and not differentiated based on sex, race, or sport. This notion is supported by data from France, Denmark, and the United States, which have demonstrated that the incidence of SCD in recreational athletes and nonathletic individuals is higher than previously thought. While recreational athletes are not required to undergo a PPCS prior to sports participation, should these individuals be precluded from primary preventative strategies? Critics may also argue that a larger number of epidemiological studies using mandatory reporting systems for case identification is warranted before we can reliably define "high-risk" populations. However, nearly all preventive practices in medicine base the rigor of the screening evaluation on the individual risk of the patient. Thus, there is justification in the setting of limited resources to provide the most intensive screening.

### Cost analysis of the history, ECG, age, risk factors, and initial troponin (HEART) Pathway randomized control trial [^113yZ5ft]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The HEART Pathway is a diagnostic protocol designed to identify low-risk patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain who are safe for early discharge. This protocol has been shown to significantly decrease health care resource utilization compared with usual care. However, the impact of the HEART Pathway on the cost of care has yet to be reported.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a cost analysis of patients enrolled in the HEART Pathway trial, which randomized participants to either usual care or the HEART Pathway protocol. For low-risk patients, the HEART Pathway recommended early discharge from the emergency department without further testing. We compared index visit cost, cost at 30 days, and cardiac-related health care cost at 30 days between the two treatment arms. Costs for each patient included facility and professional costs. Cost at 30 days included total inpatient and outpatient costs, including the index encounter, regardless of etiology. Cardiac-related health care cost at 30 days included the index encounter and costs adjudicated to be cardiac-related within that period. Of the 282 patients enrolled in the trial, 270 had cost data available for analysis. There was a significant reduction in cost for the HEART Pathway group at 30 days, with a median cost savings of $216 per individual. This was most evident in low-risk (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction score of 0–1) patients, with median savings of $253 per patient, driven primarily by lower cardiac diagnostic costs in the HEART Pathway group.

### Independent and incremental value of ECG markers for prediction of cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction [^114iBwae]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

The association between ECG changes and cardiovascular outcomes has been reported in several prior studies. In the Copenhagen Heart Study, multiple ECG findings (i.e. Q waves, ST and T wave changes, conduction defects, and LV hypertrophy) were associated with cardiovascular disease events, and adding ECG findings to conventional risk factors improved cardiovascular disease risk prediction. A similar analysis of the Women's Health Initiative Study also demonstrated that minor and major ECG abnormalities were associated with the risk for cardiovascular disease, independent of established risk factors.

Evidence on the association of ECG with incident cardiovascular toxicity in patients with cancer is more limited. Potential ECG predictors that have been identified include T wave changes, QT prolongation, QRS duration, fragmented QRS morphology, and repolarization indices. Limitations of these prior studies include qualitative or semi-quantitative visual methodology for ECG analysis, small sample size, and lack of assessment for incremental value when ECG is added to established clinical risk variables.

We hypothesize that baseline ECG variables identified in this study may reflect subclinical cardiomyopathic (i.e. increased LV voltage or abnormal LV axis), arrhythmogenic (i.e. P or R wave duration), or ischemic (i.e. Q wave or ST deviation) changes that may increase susceptibility to further cardiovascular injury upon exposure to sequential cardiovascular insults, such as cardiotoxic cancer therapy.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^114aGFiQ]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Candidates for cardiac testing include those with 1) typical or atypical cardiac symptoms and 2) an abnormal resting ECG. The screening of asymptomatic patients remains controversial. Intensive medical therapy, which would be indicated anyway for diabetic patients at high risk for CVD, seems to provide equal outcomes to invasive revascularization, which raises questions about how screening results would change management. There is also some evidence that silent myocardial ischemia may reverse over time, adding to the controversy concerning aggressive screening strategies. Finally, a recent randomized observational trial demonstrated no clinical benefit to routine screening of asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes and normal ECGs. Despite abnormal myocardial perfusion imaging in more than one in five patients, cardiac outcomes were essentially equal (and very low) in screened versus unscreened patients. Accordingly, the overall effectiveness, especially the cost-effectiveness, of such an indiscriminate screening strategy is now questioned.

Newer noninvasive CAD screening methods, such as computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography, have gained in popularity. These tests infer the presence of coronary atherosclerosis by measuring the amount of calcium in coronary arteries and, in some circumstances, by direct visualization of luminal stenoses. Although asymptomatic diabetic patients found to have a higher coronary disease burden have more future cardiac events, the role of these tests beyond risk stratification is not clear. Their routine use leads to radiation exposure.

### Screening for cardiovascular disease risk with resting or exercise electrocardiography: Evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^116NC6Fi]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. This research reviews the evidence on screening asymptomatic adults for CVD risk using electrocardiography (ECG), aiming to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

The data sources included MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries up to May 2017, along with expert references and literature surveillance through April 4, 2018. The study selection comprised English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies. These studies reported on reclassification, calibration, or discrimination comparing risk assessment using ECG combined with traditional risk factors against traditional risk factors alone. Additional study designs were considered for harms, while studies involving patients with symptoms or a CVD diagnosis were excluded.

The data extraction and synthesis involved dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality, followed by a qualitative synthesis of findings. The main outcomes and measures included mortality, cardiovascular events, reclassification, calibration, discrimination, and harms.

The results incorporated sixteen studies (N = 77,140). Two RCTs (n = 1151) showed no significant improvement in screening with exercise ECG compared to no screening in adults aged 50 to 75 years with diabetes for primary cardiovascular composite outcomes (hazard ratios were 1.00 [95% CI, 0.59–1.71] and 0.85 [95% CI, 0.39–1.84] for each study). No RCTs evaluated screening with resting ECG. Evidence from five cohort studies (n = 9582) demonstrated that adding exercise ECG to traditional risk factors — such as age, sex, smoking, diabetes, total cholesterol level, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level — did not yield significant benefits.

### Major and minor ECG abnormalities in asymptomatic women and risk of cardiovascular events and mortality [^116MzaVD]. JAMA (2007). High credibility.

Data are sparse regarding the prevalence, incidence, and independent prognostic value of minor and/or major electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities in asymptomatic postmenopausal women. There is no information on the effect, if any, of hormonal treatment on the prognostic value of the ECG.

- **Objective**: To examine the association of minor and major baseline and incident ECG abnormalities with long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

- **Design, Setting, and Participants**: This study involves a post-hoc analysis of the estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative study, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial of 14,749 postmenopausal asymptomatic women with an intact uterus. Participants received a daily tablet containing 0.625 mg of oral conjugated equine estrogen and 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate or a matching placebo. Enrollment occurred from 1993 to 1998, and the estrogen plus progestin trial was halted on July 7, 2002.

- **Main Outcome Measures**: The Novacode criteria were used to define minor, major, and incident ECG abnormalities. Cardiovascular endpoints included incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.

- **Results**: Among women with absent (n = 9744), minor (n = 4095), and major (n = 910) ECG abnormalities, there were 118, 91, and 37 incident CHD events, respectively. The annual incident CHD event rates per 10,000 women with absent, minor, or major ECG abnormalities were 21 (95% confidence interval, 18–26), 40 (95% CI, 32–49), and 75 (95% CI, 54–104), respectively. After 3 years of follow-up, 5% of women who h

### Cardiac evaluation of young athletes: Time for a risk-based approach [^112xG5rB]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Determining what constitutes the most effective pre-participation cardiovascular screening (PPCS) strategy for young athletes has created an intense debate regarding the need and feasibility of electrocardiogram (ECG)-based screening programs. Critics of a widespread ECG-based screening program highlight concerns related to the lack of robust evidence for its efficacy in reducing athlete fatalities, the reliability of outcomes (false positives), and overall cost. Proponents of ECG screening recognize the relative failure of the history and physical examination to meet the primary objective of PPCS — specifically, to detect athletes with at-risk cardiac conditions — and the wealth of evidence demonstrating the high false-positive response rate and very low positive predictive value of symptom and family history questionnaires.

The paradigm of ECG screening has been debated in a binary "all or nothing" form, whereby programs are mandated to include ECG for all young athletes or none at all. These polarized options contradict the fundamental approach to preventative medicine, which ordinarily requires assessment of individualized patient risk and the available medical resources. This article will address the landscape of PPCS and review the epidemiological data of sudden cardiac arrest/sudden cardiac death (SCA/SCD) in young athletes, which may support a novel risk-based approach to PPCS.

### ECG as a part of the preparticipation screening programme: an old and still present international dilemma [^1117L2nX]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Long-term Italian experience has provided evidence that preparticipation screening in competitive athletes with a 12-lead ECG, history, and physical examination is effective in identifying potentially lethal cardiovascular diseases. However, it is not being routinely practiced in other countries.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the usefulness of a preparticipation screening programme in a sample of players belonging to different disciplines.

- **Material and methods**: From September 2006 to June 2008, 1,220 young athletes from different sports disciplines underwent a cardiovascular examination that included personal and family history, physical examination, and a resting 12-lead ECG. Those with abnormal findings were referred for additional tests.

- **Results**: A total of 1,220 athletes were screened: 96% males; mean age 23 (4) years. Ninety players (7.4%) were referred for additional tests because of abnormal findings on baseline examination: 11 (0.9%) due to personal or family history, 4 (0.08%) due to physical examination, and 75 (6.14%) with abnormalities on the 12-lead ECG. Echocardiographic assessment fulfilled left ventricular hypertrophy criteria in 8 of the 90 players. Of those, one case was considered an athlete's heart, and one case was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (septal thickness of 23 mm). Further tests were needed in the remaining six, who were included in the "grey area", with one additional case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (apical variant) suggested by cardiac MRI.

- **Conclusion**: Given the ability of the 12-lead ECG to detect individuals with structural heart disease, we suggest its inclusion as a part of preparticipation screening programs.

### Screening asymptomatic adults with resting or exercise electrocardiography: A review of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^115cMxrr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in adults. Screening for abnormalities by using resting or exercise electrocardiography (ECG) might help identify persons who would benefit from interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk.

- **Purpose**: To update the 2004 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force evidence review on screening for resting or exercise ECG abnormalities in asymptomatic adults.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE (2002 through January 2011), the Cochrane Library database (through the fourth quarter of 2010), and reference lists.

- **Study selection**: Randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies.

- **Data extraction**: Investigators abstracted details about the study population, study design, data analysis, follow-up, and results, and assessed quality by using predefined criteria.

- **Data synthesis**: No study evaluated clinical outcomes or use of risk-reducing therapies after screening compared with no screening. No study estimated how accurately resting or exercise electrocardiography classified participants into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk groups compared with traditional risk factor assessment alone. Sixty-three prospective cohort studies evaluated abnormalities on resting or exercise ECG as predictors of cardiovascular events after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Abnormalities on resting ECG (ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block, or left-axis deviation) or exercise ECG (ST-segment depression with exercise, chronotropic incompetence, abnormal heart rate recovery, or decreased exercise capacity) were considered.

### Deep neural network-estimated electrocardiographic age as a mortality predictor [^116GpshY]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

In this paper, we use a data-driven approach to obtain a model that predicts age from the raw ECG tracing. By having the chronological age of the person as the prediction target, we expect the trained model to learn to capture, on average, how aging affects the ECG exam. Indeed, having a predicted ECG-age higher than one's actual age is an indication that the exam is similar to those of older people, who have a higher associated cardiovascular risk and are more likely to die from cardiovascular diseases. We show that classical cardiovascular risk factors are associated with having an ECG-age more than 8 years greater than the chronological age. For some risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking, the association remains even when only normal ECGs were considered (cf. Fig. 3). Moreover, this study shows, in three different cohorts, that the difference between the ECG-age and the chronological age can be used as a marker of the risk of death.

### Sports cardiology: A glorious past, a well-defined present, a bright future [^111Z96Fr]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

The attention towards sports cardiology has dramatically grown after the introduction of preparticipation screening (PPS) and the need for specific education on ECG interpretation in athletes, given the differences between athletes and the general population. The PPS is a medical evaluation conducted on athletes before sports competitions aimed to detect a clinically silent cardiac condition that may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) or that may worsen with intensive exercise. It may be periodical (e.g. annually) or once in a lifetime. The rationale behind the PPS is that young adults who participate in competitive sports tend to exercise to their limits, thus increasing the risk of SCD, particularly when they are unaware of suffering from a cardiac disease predisposing them to life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

Interest in medical evaluation for competitive athletes before sports competitions began in Italy in the 1950s. The PPS was established by the Italian government in 1982, with an annual screening that was mandatory by law across the entire nation for all athletes wishing to compete, irrespective of their professional or nonprofessional status. The screening is conducted by sports medicine physicians and includes history, physical examination, 12‐lead resting ECG, and exercise testing or an ECG‐monitored step test.

### Major adverse cardiac event rates in moderate-risk patients: Does prior coronary disease matter [^115S9qQn]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Another key finding in this analysis is the importance of known CAD in predicting 30-day MACE, even among patients with initial negative troponin measures and nonischemic ECGs. The 7.1% 30-day MACE rate among moderate-risk patients with a history of CAD was much higher than those without known CAD. This finding suggests that ED providers need to be cautious in the evaluation of patients with prior CAD, even in the absence of ischemic ECG findings or elevated troponin measures. Our findings agree with prior studies that have demonstrated that prior CAD confers a higher downstream risk of MACE. Furthermore, our findings may be important in light of newer high-sensitivity troponin-based pathways, such as the European Society of Cardiology's 0/1-h algorithm, which do not differentiate between patients with and without prior CAD.

### Meta-analysis on the effectiveness of ECG screening for conditions related to sudden cardiac death in young athletes [^112PHUim]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Controversy exists over the use of electrocardiograms (ECGs) in sports pre-participation screening. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness of history and physical examination (H&P) with ECG in detecting both cardiac disease and sudden cardiac death–associated conditions (SCD-AC). Pre-participation studies published from 2015 to 2020 with athletes aged 10 to 35 years were included. This yielded 28,011 athletes screened and 124 cardiac diagnoses, 103 of which were SCD-AC. A meta-analysis of log odds ratios (ORs) was conducted using a random-effects model.

- **Odds ratios for H&P**: The ORs for the association between H&P and detecting both cardiac disease and SCD-AC were not statistically significant (OR = 3.4, P = 0.076; OR = 2.9, P = 0.078).

- **Odds ratios for ECG**: The ORs for the association between ECG and detecting both cardiac disease and SCD-AC were statistically significant (OR = 60, P < .001; OR = 148, P < .0001).

In conclusion, the odds of detecting both cardiac disease and conditions related to SCD with ECG are greater than with H&P during sports pre-participation screening.

### The impending dilemma of electrocardiogram screening in athletic children [^1118rCvH]. Pediatric Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) affects 2 out of 100,000 young, active athletes per year, with 40% being less than 18 years old. In 2004, the International Olympic Committee accepted the Lausanne Recommendations, which included a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as a pre-participation screening tool for adult Olympic athletes. The debate on extending those recommendations to the pediatric population has recently begun.

The aims of our study were to highlight the characteristics of the young athlete ECG, the phenotypical manifestations of SCD-related disease in children, and the challenges of implementing ECG screening in athletic children. A systematic review of the literature was performed. We searched available electronic medical databases for articles relevant to SCD, ECG, silent cardiac diseases, and athletic children, focusing on ECG screening and descriptions in a pediatric population.

We identified 2,240 studies, from which 62 relevant articles and one book were selected. In children, prepubertal ECG and the ECG phenotype of most SCD-related diseases differ notably from adults. The characteristics of the prepubertal ECG and the phenotypical manifestation of SCD-related disease in children will result in less specific and less sensitive ECG-based screening programs. These limitations advise against extending the adult recommendations to children without further studies. Until then, history and physical examination should remain the cornerstone of screening for SCD-related pathologies in children.

### Performance of emergency department screening criteria for an early ECG to identify ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^112KEv5M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Despite decades of quality improvement efforts, the timely diagnosis of STEMI patients in the ED presents significant operational challenges. In managing the timely care of patients with STEMI, EDs encounter three distinct types of patients who differ on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment continuum.

- **Prediagnosed patients**: These are patients who have been prediagnosed with STEMI and have had an ECG performed and interpreted by another provider. They are usually transferred to an ED or a hospital capable of definitive treatment, most often percutaneous coronary intervention. The expectation is that treatment will be initiated on arrival.

- **Prescreened patients**: These patients have been evaluated by another provider and referred to the ED with an ECG concerning for ischemia. In these cases, the diagnosis needs to be confirmed with a repeat ECG or reinterpretation of the ECG on arrival. The burden of screening for STEMI from the report of symptoms has already been met in these two scenarios; however, treatment has not yet been initiated.

- **Undifferentiated symptom patients**: These are the patients at greatest risk of delays in care, arriving in the ED with undifferentiated symptoms and primarily screened by that ED. In these instances, timely STEMI diagnosis is dependent on the patient's condition and symptoms triggering ED intake staff to perform an early ECG.

The ECG is often considered the screening test for STEMI. In the context of emergency care, however, treatment is initiated with ECG evidence of STEMI, making it a diagnostic test. The true screening test is the criteria by which ED care providers initiate an ECG.

Although both U.S. and European guidelines recommend screening athletes for suspected heart disease before participation in competitive sport, they disagree on which findings are associated with increased risk, as well as which athletes' activities should be restricted. Recent Italian data suggest that screening programs can save lives, but few countries have fully adopted such practices. It is time to develop an international consensus on who should receive pre-participation screening, who should perform the screening, what tests the screening should consist of, and what criteria should be used to restrict participation.

### There is no reason to adopt ECGs and abandon American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology history and physical screening for detection of cardiovascular disease in the young [^111ktmPA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Williams et al. have presented a large retrospective observational study addressing methods for screening young healthy competitive student-athletes for cardiovascular disease. Their proposed strategy adds the 12-lead ECG, which the authors have advocated for several years, to the time-honored targeted history and physical screening examination recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology. Inferences are drawn about the screening efficacy of each of these two approaches.

Williams et al. assembled data from a large nonconsecutive cohort of high school athletes and other students, adding to the ongoing controversy surrounding the value of universal ECG screening for cardiovascular diseases in competitive athletes. This practice of ECG screening has been mandated in Italy for over 40 years but remains the subject of substantial scientific controversy, including the fact that the most common cause of sudden death in the Italian data is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and not hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is the most common cause of sudden death in the US athlete population. For a variety of reasons, ECG screening has met repeated opposition in societal guidelines from the US cardiology community and was published in Circulation on three occasions over 25 years, most recently just five years ago.

### Defining a rational approach to screening for cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic patients [^111ugk5m]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Screening for coronary artery disease or other forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a superficially attractive idea that has been proposed by many cardiovascular experts. However, guidelines panels that employ medical outcomes and evaluate a full range of benefits, risks, and harms of screening have repeatedly advised against the adoption of screening programs for CVDs.

In this commentary, we discuss the limitations of the predictive capacity of selected cardiovascular screening tools.

- **Possible harms and risks**: The conclusion is reached that the available evidence does not support the adoption of a strategy for routine screening of asymptomatic people for CVD with existing testing tools or devices. More evidence is needed to justify a policy of screening for CVD.

### An overview of the electrocardiographic monitoring devices in sports cardiology: Between present and future [^11724knu]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

The intense and continuous exercise training induces multiple physiological cardiovascular (CV) adaptations, better known as the athlete's heart. This condition is characterized by several adaptations, including an increase in left ventricular (LV) mass, a harmonious remodeling of the cardiac chambers to enhance cardiac output, downregulation of sympathetic tone, upregulation of parasympathetic tone, and dispersion of ventricular depolarization that is recognizable at the resting electrocardiogram (ECG).

However, aside from these beneficial adaptations, both athletes and sedentary individuals might present early-stage or covert structural CV diseases that need to be identified to prevent a dramatic event such as sudden cardiac death (SCD), which can be triggered by intense exercise and other modulating factors such as competition.

The primary purpose of preparticipation screening (PPS) is the early identification of cardiac conditions that could potentially cause SCD in athletes. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that physical activity might reveal the arrhythmic substrate and accelerate the progression of some cardiomyopathies, such as arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. An athlete reporting exercise-induced symptoms is a rather unusual event for two different reasons: athletes are generally healthy, and they rarely report symptoms to physicians even when aware of them, due to the possible risk of disqualification. Hence, when an athlete spontaneously reports palpitations or other symptoms to the team personnel, including doctors, it should be taken seriously for further evaluation.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^113UH4p8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Candidates for cardiac testing include those with 1) typical or atypical cardiac symptoms and 2) an abnormal resting ECG. The screening of asymptomatic patients remains controversial, especially as intensive medical therapy, indicated in diabetic patients at high risk for CVD, has an increasing evidence base for providing equal outcomes to invasive revascularization, including in diabetic patients. There is also some evidence that silent myocardial ischemia may reverse over time, adding to the controversy concerning aggressive screening strategies.

Finally, a recent randomized observational trial demonstrated no clinical benefit to routine screening of asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes and normal ECGs.

### Is an exercise tolerance test indicated before beginning regular exercise? A decision analysis [^117FgKnv]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The present study, using a decision analysis, evaluates whether an exercise tolerance test (ETT) is indicated before initiating regular physical activity to reduce the risk of sudden death during exercise training.

- **Design**: The study encompasses a decision tree, Monte Carlo simulation, and utility analysis for adults at low to high risk for coronary disease, with a time horizon of five years, with or without routine ETT screening before initiating physical activity.

- **Measures**: Mortality in Monte Carlo simulation; expected values in utility analysis.

- **Results**: Routine screening decreases mortality in intermediate to high-risk populations but not in low-risk persons. At all risk levels, the number of exercise-induced deaths prevented is less than the added number of deaths from angiography. Utility analysis indicates inferiority of routine screening, regardless of risk. Personal preferences (perceived stigma from having coronary disease and perceived benefit of regular exercise on quality of life) have a strong influence on the optimal choice.

- **Conclusion**: Routine screening before initiating regular exercise is not recommended for the purpose of reducing the risk of sudden death during exercise training.

### Large-scale screening studies for atrial fibrillation - is it worth the effort [^115p1cSb]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The distribution of screening yield in a population of 1000 individuals shows an undetected disease prevalence of 5% and a sensitivity and specificity of both 95%.

One could speculate that many patients falsely diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) during screening, particularly when using one-lead ECG recordings, have an excess of premature atrial contractions (PACs) and/or short runs of PACs. An excess of PACs and runs of PACs is associated with an increased risk for incident AF, stroke, and mortality. Thus, one could further speculate that individuals falsely diagnosed with AF due to supraventricular activity could have some benefit from oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment; however, there are no prospective trials yet on the benefit of OAC on this indication.

The diagnostic performance of several newer ECG recording devices has been reported. However, these validation studies are mostly performed in an office setting, compared to the gold standard of 12-lead ECG. In most cases, this setting does not resemble the actual screening setting in which participants are expected to record multiple intermittent ECG recordings or a continuous ECG in an ambulatory setting. Furthermore, patients diagnosed with AF in screening studies using long-term ECG often have multiple paroxysmal AF episodes, which should increase the diagnostic accuracy. The true diagnostic performance of newer ECG devices during ambulatory use is therefore partly unknown, as most detected cases of AF are paroxysmal and comparison with the gold standard of 12-lead ECG in this setting is not possible.

### The ageing athlete: Screening prior to vigorous exertion in asymptomatic adults without known cardiovascular disease [^113Y7mo8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely considered the best available test for screening asymptomatic adults without known cardiovascular (CV) disease prior to initiating a vigorous exercise program due to its prognostic value, widespread availability, and low cost. Observational studies have demonstrated an increased relative risk of CV events with positive screening exercise ECG tests in men with diabetes, advanced age, or multiple cardiac risk factors. Recent observational studies have not demonstrated similar prognostic value for exercise ECG testing in asymptomatic healthy women. Despite the predictive ability of exercise ECG testing in several groups, there have been no studies demonstrating a significant impact of screening on morbidity and mortality in completely asymptomatic patients, leading to significant discordance in consensus guidelines on screening.

One prospective observational study is ongoing in Italy that may, for the first time, demonstrate the ability to decrease incident CV events using preparticipation screening exercise ECG testing in adult athletes with targeted exclusion from athletics. Until more conclusive data is available, the authors currently recommend screening exercise ECG testing in asymptomatic men with diabetes and asymptomatic men over age 45 with two or more CV risk factors prior to initiating a vigorous exercise program. Consideration should also be given to screening asymptomatic patients younger than 45 with particularly strong risk factor exposure or elderly patients with fewer than two risk factors.

### Cardiac evaluation of young athletes: Time for a risk-based approach [^112zpdJB]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Pre-participation cardiovascular screening (PPCS) is recommended by several scientific and sporting organizations on the premise that early detection of cardiac disease provides a platform for individualized risk assessment and management, which has been proven to lower mortality rates for certain conditions associated with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). What constitutes the most effective strategy for PPCS of young athletes remains a topic of considerable debate. The addition of the electrocardiogram (ECG) to the medical history and physical examination undoubtedly enhances early detection of disease, which meets the primary objective of PPCS. The benefit of enhanced sensitivity must be carefully balanced against the risk of potential harm through increased false-positive findings, costly downstream investigations, and unnecessary restriction/disqualification from competitive sports.

To mitigate this risk, it is essential that ECG-based PPCS programs are implemented by institutions with a strong infrastructure and by physicians appropriately trained in modern ECG standards with adequate cardiology resources to guide downstream investigations. While PPCS is compulsory for most competitive athletes, the debate surrounding ECG-based programs exists in a binary form, whereby ECG screening is mandated for all competitive athletes or none at all. This polarized approach fails to consider individualized patient risk and the available sports cardiology resources. The limitations of a uniform approach are highlighted by evolving data.

### A negative T-wave in electrocardiogram at 50 years predicted lifetime mortality in a random population-based cohort [^113DWx7r]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a powerful and easily available tool for the detection of cardiac disorders in asymptomatic individuals, often preceding symptoms by a considerable time. Several studies have linked ECG abnormalities with cardiovascular (CV) events and prognosis in asymptomatic adults, predominantly for major ECG aberrations.

Minor ECG abnormalities are common from middle age and frequently seen in clinical practice in asymptomatic subjects. They are generally regarded as unspecific, not linked to specific myocardial disease. The prognostic value of minor ECG abnormalities is not fully known but has potential for preventive considerations. Here, we present a longitudinal population-based observational cohort study of 50-year-old men, investigating the correlation between a negative T-wave in resting ECG and mortality during 48 years of follow-up.

### Preparticipation athletic screening including an electrocardiogram: An unproven strategy for prevention of sudden cardiac death in the athlete [^116DE2r4]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

One of the fundamental principles of evidence-based medicine is that clinical practice should be based on evidence derived from sufficiently robust data to ensure that the benefits, risks, and costs of an intervention are known. Although intuitively appealing, athletic screening programs with routine electrocardiograms (ECGs) followed by the restriction of at-risk individuals have not been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing the inherent risk of athletic sudden death. The incremental use of a screening ECG alongside a history and physical examination remains debatable due to insufficient evidence to conclusively resolve the issue.

Long-term outcomes with a large group of athletes undergoing screening and restriction are limited to a small number of observational trials. One supports, and many do not support, ECG screening with athletic restriction of at-risk athletes. Although programs and policies to decrease sudden death are laudable, they need further evaluation before being implemented on a large-scale basis. Currently, athletes are best protected by a strategy of secondary prevention with improvements in resuscitation and emergency action plans.

### Dynamic electrocardiogram changes are a novel risk marker for sudden cardiac death [^113c9yKH]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities have been evaluated as static risk markers for sudden cardiac death (SCD), but the potential importance of dynamic ECG remodelling has not been investigated. In this study, the nature and prevalence of dynamic ECG remodelling were studied among individuals who eventually suffered SCD.

- **Background and aims**: The study population was drawn from two prospective community-based SCD studies in Oregon (2002, discovery cohort) and California, USA (2015, validation cohort). For this present sub-study, 231 discovery cases (2015–2017) and 203 validation cases (2015–2021) with ≥ 2 archived pre-SCD ECGs were ascertained and were matched to 234 discovery and 203 validation controls based on age, sex, and duration between the ECGs. Dynamic ECG remodelling was measured as the progression of a previously validated cumulative six-variable ECG electrical risk score.

- **Results**: Oregon SCD cases displayed a greater increase in electrical risk score over time compared to controls [+1.06 (95% confidence interval +0.89 to +1.24) vs. −0.05 (−0.21 to +0.11); P < 0.001]. These findings were successfully replicated in California [+0.87 (+0.7 to +1.04) vs. −0.11 (−0.27 to 0.05); P < 0.001]. In multivariable models, abnormal dynamic ECG remodelling improved SCD prediction over baseline ECG, demographics, and clinical SCD risk factors in both Oregon [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.770 (95% confidence interval 0.727–0.812) increased to 0.869 (95% confidence interval 0.837–0.902)] and California.

### ECG-based cardiac screening programs: Legal, ethical, and logistical considerations [^112ffpXb]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Low credibility.

Screening asymptomatic people with a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) has been theorized to detect latent cardiovascular disease. However, resting ECG screening is not recommended for numerous populations, such as asymptomatic middle-aged sedentary people, as it is not sufficiently sensitive to detect coronary artery disease. While the issues raised in this article are largely common to all screening programs, this review focuses on two distinct programs:

- **Screening elite athletes**: This is done for conditions associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD).
- **Screening people aged ≥ 65 years**: This is done to detect atrial fibrillation (AF).

These two settings have recently gained attention for their promise and concerns regarding the prevention of SCD and stroke, respectively. If screening is to be done, it must be done well. Organizations conducting screening must consider a range of legal, ethical, and logistical responsibilities that arise from the beginning to the end of the process. This includes considerations of who to screen, timing of screening, whether screening is mandatory, consent issues, and auditing systems to ensure quality control.

Good infrastructure for the interpretation of ECG results according to expert guidelines and follow-up testing for abnormal screening results, including a pathway to treatment, are essential. Finally, there may be significant implications for those diagnosed with cardiac disease, including concerns related to insurance, employment, the ability to play sports, and mental health issues.

There are several legal risks, and the best protective measures are good communication systems and thorough clinical oversight.

### Performance of the American Heart Association (AHA) 14-point evaluation versus electrocardiography for the cardiovascular screening of high school athletes: A prospective study [^114ai2W4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading cause of death in young athletes during sports. Preparticipation cardiovascular screening, aimed at the detection of disorders associated with SCD, is universally supported by major medical societies; however, the best method for cardiovascular screening of young athletes remains controversial. At the center of the debate is the addition of a resting ECG to the traditional history and physical examination (H&P). Since 1996, the American Heart Association (AHA) has recommended a comprehensive personal and family H&P as the primary screening protocol and has opposed the routine use of ECG during the preparticipation assessment. In contrast, a 2005 consensus guideline by the European Society of Cardiology recommended the systematic use of ECG in the cardiovascular screening of athletes.

Cardiovascular screening by H&P or by ECG presents unique challenges and limitations. Several studies have documented the low sensitivity and high positive response rate of preparticipation history questionnaires. Likewise, concerns about inaccurate ECG interpretation, high false-positive rates, and unnecessary testing or restriction from sports have been raised regarding ECG screening. In an attempt to improve the sensitivity of the H&P, the AHA in 2014 expanded its 12-point evaluation by including 2 additional history questions. At the time of writing, no study has evaluated the performance of the AHA 14-point evaluation for the cardiovascular screening of athletes. The purpose of this study was to address this gap.

### Zeposia starter kit [^1143muct]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Before the initiation of treatment with ZEPOSIA, it is essential to conduct the following assessments:

- **Cardiac evaluation**: Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present. In patients with certain preexisting conditions, advice from a cardiologist should be sought [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Complete blood count**: Obtain a recent (i.e. within the last 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS or UC therapy) complete blood count (CBC), including lymphocyte count [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Liver function tests**: Obtain recent (i.e. within the last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Ophthalmic assessment**: Obtain a baseline evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, near the start of treatment with ZEPOSIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

- **Skin examination**: Obtain a baseline skin examination prior to or shortly after initiation of ZEPOSIA. If a suspicious skin lesion is observed, it should be promptly evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

- **Other considerations**: If patients are taking anti-neoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies, or if there is a history of prior use of these drugs, consider possible unintended additive immunosuppressive effects before initiating treatment with ZEPOSIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Determine if patients are taking drugs that could slow heart rate or atrioventricular conduction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Screening for coronary heart disease with electrocardiography: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111xPUqj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) updated its 2004 recommendation statement on screening for coronary heart disease (CHD).

- **Methods**: The USPSTF reviewed new evidence regarding the benefits of screening with electrocardiography (ECG) in asymptomatic adults to reduce the risk of CHD events versus not screening. This included assessing the effect of identifying high-risk persons on treatment to reduce risk, evaluating the accuracy of stratifying individuals into risk categories, and examining the potential harms of screening.

- **Recommendations**: The USPSTF recommends against screening with resting or exercise ECG for the prediction of CHD events in asymptomatic adults at low risk for CHD events (D recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening with resting or exercise ECG for the prediction of CHD events in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk for CHD events (I statement).

### Cardiovascular screening in college athletes with and without electrocardiography: A cross-sectional study [^116MeXK7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Although cardiovascular screening is recommended for athletes before participating in sports, the role of 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) remains uncertain. At the time of writing, no prospective data that compare screening with and without ECG have been available.

- **Objective**: To compare the performance of preparticipation screening limited to medical history and physical examination with a strategy that integrates these with ECG.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional comparison of screening strategies.

- **Setting**: University Health Services, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

- **Participants**: 510 collegiate athletes who received cardiovascular screening before athletic participation.

- **Measurements**: Each participant had routine history and examination-limited screening and ECG. They received transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to detect or exclude cardiac findings relevant to sports participation. The performance of screening with history and examination only was compared with that of screening that integrated history, examination, and ECG.

- **Results**: Cardiac abnormalities relevant to sports participation risk were observed on TTE in 11 of 510 participants (prevalence, 2.2%). Screening with history and examination alone detected abnormalities in 5 of these 11 athletes (sensitivity, 45.5% [95% CI, 16.8% to 76.2%]; specificity, 94.4% [CI, 92.0% to 96.2%]). Electrocardiography detected 5 additional participants with cardiac abnormalities (for a total of 10 of 11 participants), thereby improving the overall sensitivity of screening to 90.9% (CI, 58.7% to 99.8%).

### Meta-analysis on the effectiveness of ECG screening for conditions related to sudden cardiac death in young athletes [^114JaLuj]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Controversy exists over the use of electrocardiograms (ECGs) in sports pre-participation screening. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness of history and physical examination (H&P) with ECG at detecting both cardiac disease and sudden cardiac death-associated conditions (SCD-AC). Pre-participation studies published from 2015 to 2020 with athletes aged 10 to 35 years were included, yielding 28,011 athletes screened and 124 cardiac diagnoses, 103 of which were SCD-AC.

A meta-analysis of log odds ratios (ORs) was conducted using a random-effects model. The ORs for the association between H&P and detecting both cardiac disease and SCD-AC were not statistically significant (OR = 3.4, P = 0.076; OR = 2.9, P = 0.078). In contrast, the ORs for the association between ECG and detecting both cardiac disease and SCD-AC were statistically significant (OR = 60, P < .001; OR = 148, P < .0001). In conclusion, the odds of detecting both cardiac disease and conditions related to SCD with ECG are greater than with H&P during sports pre-participation screening.

### Evaluation and management of cardiac safety using the electrocardiogram in oncology clinical trials: Focus on cardiac repolarization (QTc interval) [^113NPQTL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Non-antiarrhythmic drugs have been reported to prolong the QTc interval and induce potentially fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias. An increasing number of drugs used for treating malignancies are no exception. Therefore, both oncologists and regulators expect sponsors of oncology drugs to evaluate, during the development of the drugs, their effects on the electrocardiogram (ECG), particularly on the QTc interval.

In cases where agents cannot be administered to healthy volunteers, the primary approach is to carry out an intense ECG evaluation. This involves employing robust ECG recordings during early-phase clinical trials, characterizing the concentration-QTc interval relationship, and following this up with appropriate intensity ECG monitoring in the later phases of development. This article describes the broad principles of these approaches, including recommendations for exclusion criteria relative to baseline QTc interval and cardiac comorbidity. It also describes methods for conducting ECG monitoring and a proposed scheme for managing any QTc-related effects that may emerge.
