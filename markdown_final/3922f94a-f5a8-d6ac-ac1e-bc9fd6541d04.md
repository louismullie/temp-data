## Question

AIM2 inflammsomes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about AIM2 inflammasomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the molecular definition and core components of the AIM2 inflammasome. Then, I should verify the ligand-sensing mechanism and how dsDNA length governs activation. Next, I will examine the assembly kinetics and structural templating that amplify signaling. After that, I need to check the downstream effector outputs and cell death pathways. Then, I will review key regulators and cross-talk, especially with cGAS-STING and PANoptosis. Finally, I will consider disease relevance and therapeutic implications, making sure I distinguish where AIM2 is causal versus contributory and where human data are limited.

> Let me first confirm the core definition and components. AIM2 is a PYHIN family cytosolic DNA sensor that detects double-stranded DNA and nucleates an inflammasome complex with ASC and pro-caspase-1, leading to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and pyroptosis; this is distinct from NLRP3 and other inflammasomes in both ligand specificity and assembly logic [^290e6b7d] [^0fdf8eea] [^c7e269ab].

> Wait, let me verify the ligand-sensing rules before I overgeneralize. AIM2 binds dsDNA in a sequence-independent manner via its HIN domain, with binding affinity and oligomerization efficiency rising sharply with dsDNA length, typically requiring around 70–80 bp to form a stable threshold oligomer and peaking near 280 bp; this creates a switch-like, length-dependent activation that helps explain why long, naked foreign DNA is more stimulatory than short or chromatinized host DNA [^d4f93aa1] [^ef12ee98] [^3baea4eb].

> I will now examine the assembly mechanism and kinetics. Single-molecule studies show AIM2 does not scan along DNA like IFI16; instead, stochastic binding events and lateral clustering on dsDNA drive rapid oligomer growth, with observed rates up to roughly 28 molecules per second, and multiple AIM2 clusters of varying sizes can coexist on the same DNA molecule, consistent with a nucleation-and-growth model rather than a single-speck monopoly [^e495c32d] [^908b7202] [^a8472bdf].

> Hold on, I should verify the structural templating step. AIM2 PYD filaments formed on DNA exhibit helical symmetry that matches the ASC PYD filament, enabling a direct polymerization template for ASC speck formation; this architectural coupling underlies signal amplification and helps explain the speed and robustness of caspase-1 activation once a threshold oligomer is reached [^f5585e1b] [^d2ac2330] [^98e968f8].

> Next, I should review downstream outputs and cell death. Active caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to their mature forms and also cleaves gasdermin D, generating pore-forming fragments that drive pyroptosis; in some contexts, AIM2 participates in PANoptosome complexes with pyrin and ZBP1 that integrate pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, expanding the cell death repertoire beyond canonical pyroptosis alone [^c7e269ab] [^b3159ce5] [^737302ae].

> Let me consider regulation and cross-talk, and I need to be careful not to conflate NLRP3-specific mechanisms with AIM2. Unlike NLRP3, AIM2 activation is not dependent on potassium efflux or NEK7, but AIM2 signaling can be modulated by interferon-inducible expression, by PYRIN-only proteins such as POP2, and by crosstalk with cGAS-STING; notably, caspase-1 can cleave cGAS to dampen type I interferon responses, illustrating a negative regulatory loop between inflammasome and interferon pathways [^886cf29a] [^4bc28806] [^db4eb7ff].

> But wait, what if mitochondrial DNA is the trigger rather than pathogen DNA. AIM2 can sense cytosolic mitochondrial DNA released during mitochondrial damage, linking organelle stress to inflammasome activation; however, I should confirm that this is distinct from NLRP10, which senses mitochondrial damage independently of mtDNA, underscoring that multiple inflammasomes monitor mitochondrial integrity through different mechanisms [^438a5877] [^f38c6fe8].

> I should double-check disease relevance before drawing causal conclusions. AIM2 has been implicated in antibacterial defense against Francisella and Listeria, in antiviral responses to HSV-1, in psoriasis where keratinocyte cytosolic DNA and AIM2 drive IL-1β, in cancer where AIM2 contributes to immunogenic cell death and may enhance checkpoint blockade, and in sterile inflammatory settings such as CAR-T–associated macrophage activation; however, many human data remain correlative, so I need to flag where causality is strongest in models versus humans [^b3159ce5] [^e83872f6] [^c967ac83] [^35a0bebf] [^472da36d].

> Let me reconsider therapeutic implications and make sure I separate validated targets from hypotheses. While NLRP3 inhibitors are advancing clinically, direct pharmacologic modulation of AIM2 is less mature; nonetheless, mechanistic studies support the plausibility of targeting AIM2 oligomerization, ASC speck formation, or downstream effectors like GSDMD, and emerging data suggest that manipulating inflammasome components can tilt the balance between host protection and pathology in disease-specific contexts [^401078b2] [^7f112a5b].

> In summary, AIM2 functions as a cytosolic dsDNA sensor that assembles into filaments on DNA, templates ASC polymerization, and rapidly activates caspase-1 to produce IL-1β/IL-18 and pyroptosis; its activation is gated by dsDNA length, shaped by interferon-inducible expression, and integrated with broader cell death and interferon networks, placing AIM2 at the intersection of antimicrobial defense, sterile inflammation, and therapeutic opportunity [^290e6b7d] [^d4f93aa1] [^b3159ce5].

AIM2 inflammasomes are **cytosolic DNA sensors** that detect double-stranded DNA and assemble a multiprotein complex with ASC and pro-caspase-1, driving caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and pyroptotic cell death [^290e6b7d] [^0fdf8eea]. They are **essential for host defense** against DNA viruses and intracellular bacteria, and their dysregulation contributes to autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases [^c7e269ab] [^7f112a5b]. AIM2 activation is tightly controlled by DNA length, with a threshold of ~70 bp, and is regulated by interferon signaling and negative regulators such as POP2 and cGAS-STING crosstalk [^d4f93aa1] [^0074a748] [^4bc28806] [^db4eb7ff]. Therapeutic targeting of AIM2 is under exploration for infectious, inflammatory, and oncologic indications [^notfound].

---

## Molecular structure and assembly

AIM2 belongs to the PYHIN family and contains an **N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD)** and a **C-terminal HIN-200 DNA-binding domain** [^290e6b7d]. Upon binding dsDNA, AIM2 oligomerizes and recruits ASC via PYD–PYD interactions, forming a large supramolecular complex that nucleates pro-caspase-1 clustering and activation [^f5585e1b] [^d2ac2330]. This assembly generates the **ASC speck**, a hallmark of inflammasome activation [^e4dc47dc].

---

## Activation mechanisms

AIM2 is activated by **cytosolic dsDNA** from pathogens or damaged host cells, with no sequence specificity [^290e6b7d] [^3baea4eb]. DNA length is critical: a minimum of ~70 bp is required for stable binding and oligomerization, with optimal responses at ~280 bp, supporting a molecular ruler model for activation [^d4f93aa1] [^ef12ee98]. Interferon-γ upregulates AIM2, priming cells for DNA sensing [^c967ac83].

---

## Signaling pathways and effector functions

Activated AIM2 drives **caspase-1–dependent proteolysis** of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature, secreted forms, and induces pyroptosis via gasdermin D pore formation and membrane rupture [^c7e269ab] [^ea3453ec]. Pyroptosis releases inflammatory mediators and amplifies immune responses [^043bfa87].

---

## Physiological roles

AIM2 inflammasomes are **central to host defense** against DNA viruses (e.g. HSV-1, vaccinia) and intracellular bacteria (e.g. Francisella, Listeria) by promoting pathogen clearance through cytokine release and pyroptosis [^290e6b7d] [^e83872f6]. They also shape adaptive immunity by enhancing antigen presentation and T cell priming [^e83ff5fb].

---

## Regulation and crosstalk

AIM2 activity is **tightly regulated** at multiple levels:

- **DNA length threshold**: Prevents spurious activation by short DNA fragments [^d4f93aa1].
- **Interferon signaling**: Induces AIM2 expression, balancing sensitivity and autoimmunity risk [^0074a748].
- **Negative regulators**: POP2 inhibits AIM2 inflammasome assembly; caspase-1 cleaves cGAS, dampening cGAS-STING signaling and preventing excessive interferon responses [^4bc28806] [^db4eb7ff].
- **PANoptosis**: AIM2 can integrate into PANoptosomes with pyrin and ZBP1, coordinating multiple cell death pathways during infection [^b3159ce5] [^737302ae].

---

## Pathological implications

Dysregulated AIM2 signaling is implicated in several diseases:

| **Disease category** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Autoinflammatory diseases | SLE, psoriasis, AGS | Excessive sensing of self-DNA; chronic IL-1β/IL-18 release [^c967ac83] [^3b1a9421] |
| Infectious diseases | HSV-1, Francisella, Listeria | Essential for pathogen control; defects impair clearance [^b3159ce5] [^e83872f6] |
| Cancer | Melanoma, breast cancer | Tumor-suppressive via inflammasome-mediated immunity; tumor-derived DNA can activate AIM2 [^35a0bebf] [^472da36d] |

---

## Therapeutic targeting

Therapeutic strategies targeting AIM2 include **small-molecule inhibitors** of AIM2–ASC interactions or caspase-1, and **biologics** such as IL-1β/IL-18 blockade or anti-AIM2 antibodies. These approaches are under investigation for infectious diseases, autoinflammatory disorders, and cancer immunotherapy [^401078b2] [^7f112a5b].

---

AIM2 inflammasomes are **key cytosolic DNA sensors** that coordinate innate immune responses through caspase-1 activation, cytokine maturation, and pyroptosis. Their activity is finely tuned by DNA length, interferon signaling, and regulatory crosstalk, and dysregulation contributes to infectious, inflammatory, and oncologic disease, making AIM2 a promising therapeutic target.

### Sensing cytoplasmic danger signals by the inflammasome [^0ce79c91]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The innate immune system depends on molecules collectively known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to survey the extracellular space and the cytoplasm for the presence of dangerous pathogens, pathogen-derived molecules, or even self-derived molecular danger signals, which arise from tissue damage. Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) is a newly discovered PRR involved in the sensing of dangerous cytosolic DNA produced by infection with DNA viruses.

Discussion

Remarkably, recent studies in AIM2-deficient mice showed that AIM2 is uniquely involved in sensing infection with the intracellular bacteria Francisella tularensis and subsequently triggering caspase-1-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production and macrophage cell death, which activate other components of the immune system and eliminate the infected macrophages. Here, we provide an overview of our current understanding of the role of AIM2 in innate immunity against F. tularensis in particular, and how infection of macrophages with this pathogen is thought to activate AIM2.

Fundamental roles of the inflammasomes in the innate immunity

The immune system initiates clearance of pathogens and repairs damaged tissues upon recognition of microbial infection, injuries, etc. thereby restoring cellular homeostasis. One of the key complexes essential for the operation of such innate immune responses is the inflammasomes. The innate immune system employs an array of germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to sense invariant microbial motifs. PRRs are expressed in many different types of cells which are at the front line of defense, including macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. As important components of inflammasomes, the PRRs contain the nucleotide-binding domain, the leucine-rich repeat containing proteins (also known as NOD-like receptors, NLRs) and the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM)-like receptor (ALRs). Upon inflammasome activation by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), NLRs, AIM2, or pyrin recruits ASC to form a multimeric complex. Oligomerized ASC subsequently recruits pro-caspase-1 to this complex, which is converted into catalytically active caspase-1 by proximity-induced self-cleavage. The bioactive caspase-1 subunits p20 and p10 then proteolytically cleave pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to generate mature form of bioactive IL-1β and IL-18, respectively (Fig. 1). Activation of the inflammasomes triggers an alarm to alert adjacent cells and tissues by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines. This ends up with amplification of inflammatory cascade by promoting recruitment of effector cell populations required for the immune responses and tissue repair.

### Inflammasomes in health and disease [^c7e269ab]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Inflammasomes are a group of protein complexes built around several proteins, including NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2 and NLRP6. Recognition of a diverse range of microbial, stress and damage signals by inflammasomes results in direct activation of caspase-1, which subsequently induces secretion of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines and a form of cell death called pyroptosis. Inflammasome-mediated processes are important during microbial infections and also in regulating both metabolic processes and mucosal immune responses. We review the functions of the different inflammasome complexes and discuss how aberrations in them are implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases.

### Sensing and reacting to microbes through the inflammasomes [^b07a6e38]. Nature Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that activate caspase-1, which leads to maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 and the induction of pyroptosis. Members of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family, including NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRC4, and the cytosolic receptor AIM2 are critical components of inflammasomes and link microbial and endogenous danger signals to the activation of caspase-1. In response to microbial infection, activation of the inflammasomes contributes to host protection by inducing immune responses that limit microbial invasion, but deregulated activation of inflammasomes is associated with autoinflammatory syndromes and other pathologies. Thus, understanding inflammasome pathways may provide insight into the mechanisms of host defense against microbes and the development of inflammatory disorders.

### Aim2 and nlrp3 are dispensable for vaccine-induced immunity against Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain [^227f8755]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Francisella tularensis is a facultative, intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium that causes a fatal disease known as tularemia. Due to its extremely high virulence, ease of spread by aerosolization, and potential to be used as a bioterror agent, F. tularensis is classified by the CDC as a tier 1 category A select agent. Previous studies have demonstrated the roles of the inflammasome sensors absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and NLRP3 in the generation of innate immune responses to F. tularensis infection. However, contributions of both the AIM2 and NLRP3 to the development of vaccine-induced adaptive immune responses against F. tularensis are not known. This study determined the contributions of Aim2 and Nlrp3 inflammasome sensors to vaccine-induced immune responses in a mouse model of respiratory tularemia. We developed a model to vaccinate Aim2- and Nlrp3-deficient ( Aim2-/- and Nlrp3-/- ) mice using the emrA1 mutant of the F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS). The results demonstrate that the innate immune responses in Aim2-/- and Nlrp3-/- mice vaccinated with the emrA1 mutant differ from those of their wild-type counterparts. However, despite these differences in the innate immune responses, both Aim2-/- and Nlrp3-/- mice are fully protected against an intranasal lethal challenge dose of F. tularensis LVS. Moreover, the lack of both Aim2 and Nlrp3 inflammasome sensors does not affect the production of vaccination-induced antibody and cell-mediated responses. Overall, this study reports a novel finding that both Aim2 and Nlrp3 are dispensable for vaccination-induced immunity against respiratory tularemia caused by F. tularensis.

### Modulation of inflammasome activity for the treatment of auto-inflammatory disorders [^859d7bbd]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The innate immune system orchestrates inflammatory responses to microorganisms or danger-associated molecular patterns generated, for example, by the deposition of uric acid in the joints of gout patients. The innate immune system comprises multiple germ-line encoded receptors, of which the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing receptors (NLRs) are crucial for the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. NLRs oligomerize to form large multi-protein complexes termed inflammasomes that generate active caspase-1 fragments leading to the cleavage and secretion of mature cytokines such as IL-1beta and IL-18. THE REGULATION OF MULTIPLE INFLAMMASOMES: At least four independent inflammasomes have been identified, NLRP1, NLRP3, IPAF, and AIM2. These inflammasomes assemble in response to different stimuli to confer specificity and are also subject to negative regulatory mechanisms to ensure that once a productive inflammatory response has been mounted, inflammatory cytokine production is restrained. TREATMENT OF AUTO-INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS: A number of human conditions are characterized by unrestrained inflammasome activation. As much is now known about how inflammasomes are regulated, it is hoped that this can be channeled into the development of novel therapeutics, for example, those that may block the upstream activation and assembly of inflammasomes.

### Assembly-driven activation of the AIM2 foreign-dsDNA sensor provides a polymerization template for downstream ASC [^f5585e1b]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

AIM2 recognizes foreign dsDNA and assembles into the inflammasome, a filamentous supramolecular signalling platform required to launch innate immune responses. We show here that the pyrin domain of AIM2 (AIM2(PYD)) drives both filament formation and dsDNA binding. In addition, the dsDNA-binding domain of AIM2 also oligomerizes and assists in filament formation. The ability to oligomerize is critical for binding dsDNA, and in turn permits the size of dsDNA to regulate the assembly of the AIM2 polymers. The AIM2(PYD) oligomers define the filamentous structure, and the helical symmetry of the AIM2(PYD) filament is consistent with the filament assembled by the PYD of the downstream adaptor ASC. Our results suggest that the role of AIM2(PYD) is not autoinhibitory, but generating a structural template by coupling ligand binding and oligomerization is a key signal transduction mechanism in the AIM2 inflammasome.

### AIM2 forms a complex with pyrin and ZBP1 to drive PANoptosis and host defence [^b3159ce5]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Inflammasomes are critical components of the innate immune response. Following exposure to PAMPs and DAMPs, inflammasome sensors form a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1, leading to cleavage of its downstream substrates, inflammatory signaling and inflammatory cell death. Individual inflammasome sensors detect and respond to specific PAMPs and DAMPs, but emerging evidence suggests that multiple inflammasome sensors can be activated in response to disease, particularly live pathogen infection, due to the presence of multiple PAMPs and DAMPs –.

The AIM2 inflammasome is known to sense dsDNA and plays essential roles in development, infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer –. However, several critical functions for AIM2 beyond its canonically described role in inflammasome formation and pyroptosis have been observed that cannot be explained by our current understanding of the AIM2 inflammasome. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), a dsDNA virus that causes lifelong incurable, recurrent pathologies, and Francisella, a gram-negative bacteria that can cause rapid lethality upon infection, are two diverse pathogens that are known to activate the AIM2 inflammasome and cell death,–. To investigate whether cells exposed to numerous PAMPs and DAMPs during these viral and bacterial infections can simultaneously engage multiple inflammasome sensors, we infected wild type (WT) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and BMDMs singly deficient in several major inflammasome sensors with HSV1 or F. novicida. Both HSV1 and F. novicida infections induced AIM2-dependent and NLRP3- and NLRC4-independent cleavage of caspase-1, release of the inflammasome-dependent cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and cell death (Fig. 1a – o, Extended Data Fig. 1a – i). However, inflammasome activation and cell death were also partially reduced in Mefv –/– BMDMs during HSV1 and F. novicida infections (Fig. 1p – t, Extended Data Fig. 1j – l), suggesting that these infections activate Pyrin to drive AIM2-mediated inflammatory signaling and cell death.

7.1.2 AIM2 inflammasome

Cytoplasmic dsDNA sensor AIM2 is a member of IFI20X/IFI16 family. 133 In normal conditions, the N‐terminal PYD of AIM2 maintains an autoinhibitory state through interaction with C‐terminal hematopoietic IFN‐inducible nuclear proteins with a 200‐amino acid repeat (HIN‐200) domain, which directly binds to the sugar‐phosphate backbone of dsDNA in a sequence‐independent manner. 134, 135 The ligand binding to the HIN‐200 domain triggers the activation of the AIM2 inflammasomes, leading to pyroptosis and the production of IL‐1β and IL‐18. 136, 137, 138, 139 The AIM2 inflammasomes play an important role in infection, cancer, and autoimmunity 140 by sensing of virus/bacteria‐derived dsDNA and tumor‐derived DNA. 141, 142 A recent study shows that AIM2 is dispensable for inflammasome activation in some primary human myeloid cells, where STING‐dependent cell death can trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inducing potassium efflux. 143 This result implicates the presence of a cell‐type‐specific alternative pathway in the dsDNA sensing system. Inflammasome‐derived caspase‐1 binds to cGAS and restricts its downstream STING‐TBK1‐IRF‐3/7‐IFN‐dependent signaling pathway by cutting out cGAS, 142 implicating a crosstalk between type I IFN production and the inflammasome. cGAMP also functions in the priming and activation of AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes. 144

7.1.3 Other inflammasomes

NLRC4 inflammasomes are activated by NLR family apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) harboring three baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR) domains at N‐terminus. 145, 146 NAIP family proteins detect monomeric flagellin or the needle/rod regions of type III secretion system (T3SS), 147, 148, 149, 150 leading to the activation of downstream NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome responses. The transcription of Naips is regulated by the transcription factor IRF‐8. 151 NLRC4 is implicated in the exacerbation of psoriatic lesions, 152 and NLRP4 mutation is associated with exacerbation of asthma in smoking adults. 153 Polymorphisms of NACHT‐LRR in NLRP12 and the promoter regions of NLRC4 and NLRP1 are associated with atopic dermatitis. 113 The elusive other inflammasomes remain of outstanding interest.

### Assembly mechanism of the inflammasome sensor AIM2 revealed by single molecule analysis [^e495c32d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Pathogenic dsDNA prompts AIM2 assembly leading to the formation of the inflammasome, a multimeric complex that triggers the inflammatory response. The recognition of foreign dsDNA involves AIM2 self-assembly concomitant with dsDNA binding. However, we lack mechanistic and kinetic information on the formation and propagation of the assembly, which can shed light on innate immunity's time response and specificity. Combining optical traps and confocal fluorescence microscopy, we determine here the association and dissociation rates of the AIM2-DNA complex at the single molecule level. We identify distinct mechanisms for oligomer growth via the binding of incoming AIM2 molecules to adjacent dsDNA or direct interaction with bound AIM2 assemblies, resembling primary and secondary nucleation. Through these mechanisms, the size of AIM2 oligomers can increase fourfold in seconds. Finally, our data indicate that single AIM2 molecules do not diffuse/scan along the DNA, suggesting that oligomerization depends on stochastic encounters with DNA and/or DNA-bound AIM2.

### Inflammasomes and adaptive immune responses [^e83ff5fb]. Nature Immunology (2021). High credibility.

A fundamental concept in immunology is that the innate immune system initiates or instructs downstream adaptive immune responses. Inflammasomes are central players in innate immunity to pathogens, but how inflammasomes shape adaptive immunity is complex and relatively poorly understood. Here we highlight recent work on the interplay between inflammasomes and adaptive immunity. We address how inflammasome-dependent release of cytokines and antigen activates, shapes or even inhibits adaptive immune responses. We consider how distinct tissue or cellular contexts may alter the effects of inflammasome activation on adaptive immunity and how this contributes to beneficial or detrimental outcomes in infectious diseases, cancer and autoimmunity. We aspire to provide a framework for thinking about inflammasomes and their connection to the adaptive immune response.

### AIM2 recognizes cytosolic dsDNA and forms a caspase-1-activating inflammasome with ASC [^290e6b7d]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

The innate immune system senses nucleic acids by germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors. RNA is sensed by Toll-like receptor members TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, or by the RNA helicases RIG-I (also known as DDX58) and MDA-5 (IFIH1). Little is known about sensors for cytoplasmic DNA that trigger antiviral and/or inflammatory responses. The best characterized of these responses involves activation of the TANK-binding kinase (TBK1)-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signalling axis to trigger transcriptional induction of type I interferon genes. A second, less well-defined pathway leads to the activation of an 'inflammasome' that, via caspase-1, controls the catalytic cleavage of the pro-forms of the cytokines IL1beta and IL18 (refs 6, 7). Using mouse and human cells, here we identify the PYHIN (pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein) family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as a receptor for cytosolic DNA, which regulates caspase-1. The HIN200 domain of AIM2 binds to DNA, whereas the pyrin domain (but not that of the other PYHIN family members) associates with the adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain) to activate both NF-kappaB and caspase-1. Knockdown of Aim2 abrogates caspase-1 activation in response to cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA and the double-stranded DNA vaccinia virus. Collectively, these observations identify AIM2 as a new receptor for cytoplasmic DNA, which forms an inflammasome with the ligand and ASC to activate caspase-1.

### Assembly-driven activation of the AIM2 foreign-dsDNA sensor provides a polymerization template for downstream ASC [^a2a6264e]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

AIM2 recognizes foreign dsDNA and assembles into the inflammasome, a filamentous supramolecular signalling platform required to launch innate immune responses. We show here that the pyrin domain of AIM2 (AIM2 PYD) drives both filament formation and dsDNA binding. In addition, the dsDNA-binding domain of AIM2 also oligomerizes and assists in filament formation. The ability to oligomerize is critical for binding dsDNA, and in turn permits the size of dsDNA to regulate the assembly of the AIM2 polymers. The AIM2 PYD oligomers define the filamentous structure, and the helical symmetry of the AIM2 PYD filament is consistent with the filament assembled by the PYD of the downstream adaptor ASC. Our results suggest that the role of AIM2 PYD is not autoinhibitory, but generating a structural template by coupling ligand binding and oligomerization is a key signal transduction mechanism in the AIM2 inflammasome.

### Role of inflammasomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^73adecee]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is present in >10% of all people admitted to critical care and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Despite more than half a century since its first description, no efficacious pharmacological therapies have been developed, and little progress has been made in improving clinical outcomes. Neutrophils are the principal drivers of ARDS, with their priming and subsequent aberrant downstream functions, including interleukin (IL) 1β and IL-18 secretion, central to the disease pathogenesis. The dominant pathways through which IL-1β and IL-18 are believed to be elaborated are multimeric protein structures called inflammasomes that consist of sensor proteins, adaptor proteins and an effector enzyme. The inflammasome’s initial activation depends on one of a variety of damage-associated (DAMP) or pathogen-associated (PAMP) molecular patterns. However, once activated, a common downstream inflammatory pathway is initiated regardless of the specific DAMP or PAMP involved. Several inflammasomes exist in humans. The nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), inflammasome is the best described in the context of ARDS and is known to be activated in both infective and sterile cases. The NLR family, caspase activation and recruitment domain-containing 4 (NLRC4) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes have also been implicated in various ARDS settings, as have inflammasome-independent pathways. Further work is required to understand human biology as much of our knowledge is extrapolated from rodent experimental models. Experimental lung injury models have demonstrated beneficial responses to inflammasome, IL-1β and IL-18 blockade. However, findings have yet to be successfully translated into humans with ARDS, likely due to an underappreciation of the central role of the neutrophil inflammasome. A thorough understanding of inflammasome pathways is vital for critical care clinicians and researchers and for the development of beneficial therapies. In this review, we describe the central role of the inflammasome in the development of ARDS and its potential for immunomodulation, highlighting key areas for future research.

### The inflammasomes: mechanisms of activation and function [^89d40696]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

In response to injurious or infectious agents caspase-1 activating multiprotein complexes, termed inflammasomes, assemble in the cytoplasm of cells. Activated caspase-1 cleaves the proforms of the interleukin-1 cytokine family members leading to their activation and secretion. The IL-1 family cytokines have multiple proinflammatory activities implicating them in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases. While defined ligands have been identified for the NLRP1, IPAF, and AIM2 inflammasomes, little is known about the activation mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Numerous different molecular entities, such as various crystals, pore-forming toxins, or extracellular ATP can trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome. Recent work proposes that NLRP3 is activated indirectly by host factors that are generated in response to NLRP3 triggers.

### Involvement of the AIM2, NLRC4, and NLRP3 inflammasomes in caspase-1 activation by Listeria monocytogenes [^e83872f6]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Infection with Listeria monocytogenes can cause meningitis and septicemia in newborn, elderly, or immunocompromised individuals. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to Listeria, leading to a potentially fatal infection. Cytosolic Listeria activates the proinflammatory caspase-1 and induces the processing and secretion of interleukins IL-1beta and IL-18 as well as caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis. This study elucidates the role of various inflammasome components of host macrophages in the proinflammatory response to infection with Listeria. Here, we have used macrophages from AIM2-, NLRC4-, NLRP3-, and ASC-deficient mice to demonstrate that AIM2, NLRC4, and NLRP3 inflammasomes as well as the adaptor protein ASC all contribute to activation of caspase-1 in Listeria-infected macrophages. We show that Listeria DNA, which escapes into the cytosol of infected macrophages, triggers AIM2 oligomerization, caspase-1 activation, and pyroptosis. Interestingly, we found that flagellin-deficient Listeria, like Francisella tularensis, is recognized primarily by the AIM2 inflammasome, as no caspase-1 activation or cell death was observed in AIM2-deficient macrophages infected with this Listeria mutant. We further show that prior priming of NLRC4-deficient macrophages with LPS is sufficient for Listeria-induced caspase-1 activation in these macrophages, suggesting that TLR4 signaling is important for activation of the AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes by Listeria in the absence of NLRC4. Taken together, our results indicate that Listeria infection is sensed by multiple inflammasomes that collectively orchestrate a robust caspase-1 activation and proinflammatory response.

### Inflammasomes on the crossroads of innate immune recognition and metabolic control [^b62c084c]. Cell Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Inflammasomes are protein complexes formed upon encounter of microbial or damage-associated stimuli. The main output of inflammasome assembly is activation of caspase-1, a protease involved in both pro-inflammatory and host-protective responses. Defined bacterial or viral ligands have been identified for the inflammasome-forming receptors AIM2, NLRP1, and NLRC4. The signals activating other inflammasomes, NLRP3, NLRP6, and pyrin, are less well understood. Recent studies implicated several low-molecular-weight compounds traditionally linked to metabolism, not immunity, in modulation of inflammasome signaling. Furthermore, genetic, pharmacological, or pathogen-mediated interference with energy metabolism also affects inflammasome activation. Here we review the findings on how microbial- and host-derived metabolites regulate activation of the NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasomes. We discuss the different models of how glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism control the NLRP3 inflammasome. Finally, we summarize the findings on metabolic control of pyrin and point to open questions to be addressed to broaden our understanding of metabolism-inflammasome interactions.

### Assembly mechanism of the inflammasome sensor AIM2 revealed by single molecule analysis [^e4dc47dc]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The innate immune system recognizes cues associated with cellular damage and molecular patterns arising from invading pathogens. Recognition by sensor proteins triggers the assembly of large signaling platforms known as inflammasomes that activate inflammatory caspases –. Inflammasome formation involves sensor oligomerization –, leading to the self-assembly of the adaptor protein ASC (Apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a CARD) into the so-called “ASC speck, ”. ASC recruits the effector procaspase 1,, increasing its local concentration and promoting caspase activation, thus resulting in the maturation of proinflammatory cytokinesand cell death by pyroptosis and PANoptosis,. In the process of inflammasome activation, a filamentous punctum (ASC speck) with a diameter of ~ 0.5–1 μm forms via self-association and oligomerization of multiple protein components (Supplementary Fig. 1). At the molecular level, it has been shown that the inflammasome adaptor ASC and its isoform ASCbwith two oligomerization Death Domains, PYD (Pyrin Domain) and CARD (Caspase Activation and Recruitment Domain), can polymerize into different macrostructures –. ASC connects PYD-containing sensorsand procaspase 1 via homotypic interactions to facilitate speck assembly and activation.

Inflammasome sensors show specificity for different molecular patterns. For instance, foreign dsDNA activates the sensors AIM2 (Absent In Melanoma 2) and IFI16 (Interferon gamma Inducible protein 16) –. Both sensors carry an N-terminal PYD for self-assembly and polymerization with ASC (Supplementary Fig. 1) leading to the formation of the inflammasome, and a C-terminal HIN (Hematopoietic, Interferon-inducible, Nuclear localization) domain(s) for DNA binding. However, AIM2 is a cytosolic sensor, whereas IFI16 is the only sensor identified thus far that recognizes foreign DNA in the nucleus,. Detailed functional and structural studies of complexes between dsDNA and the DNA binding domains of the cytosolic and nuclear sensors explain the lack of sequence specificity, as the intermolecular interactions involve the dsDNA phosphate backbone. Importantly, the authors indicate that dsDNA serves as an oligomerization platform for the inflammasome and inform on the estimated size of the oligomers. Specifically, the X-ray structure shows 2 HIN domains of AIM2 bound to a 20-mer dsDNA(Supplementary Fig. 1).

### Structures of the HIN domain: DNA complexes reveal ligand binding and activation mechanisms of the AIM2 inflammasome and IFI16 receptor [^3baea4eb]. Immunity (2012). Low credibility.

Recognition of DNA by the innate immune system is central to antiviral and antibacterial defenses, as well as an important contributor to autoimmune diseases involving self DNA. AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) and IFI16 (interferon-inducible protein 16) have been identified as DNA receptors that induce inflammasome formation and interferon production, respectively. Here we present the crystal structures of their HIN domains in complex with double-stranded (ds) DNA. Non-sequence-specific DNA recognition is accomplished through electrostatic attraction between the positively charged HIN domain residues and the dsDNA sugar-phosphate backbone. An intramolecular complex of the AIM2 Pyrin and HIN domains in an autoinhibited state is liberated by DNA binding, which may facilitate the assembly of inflammasomes along the DNA staircase. These findings provide mechanistic insights into dsDNA as the activation trigger and oligomerization platform for the assembly of large innate signaling complexes such as the inflammasomes.

7 INFLAMMASOME

NLRP family proteins, a subgroup of NLR family, and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) form a complex with apoptosis‐associated speck‐like protein containing a CARD (ASC, PYCARD) through their PYD domains and recruit the CARD domain of pro‐caspase‐1, forming the inflammasome 120 (Figure 5). Inflammasomes are cytosolic multimeric protein complexes sensing and responding to pathogenic microbes and cellular damage. 121 To date, various inflammasomes including NLR subfamily proteins (NLRP1 [CARD7], NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP4, NLRP6, and NLRC4 [CARD12]) and PYD‐containing non‐NLR proteins (AIM2, pyrin (MEFV), and IFN‐γ‐inducible protein (IFI) 16) have been identified. Based on the activation mechanism, the inflammasomes are categorized as canonical or noncanonical.

### AIM2 activates the inflammasome and cell death in response to cytoplasmic DNA [^0fdf8eea]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

Host- and pathogen-associated cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA triggers the activation of a NALP3 (also known as cryopyrin and NLRP3)-independent inflammasome, which activates caspase-1 leading to maturation of pro-interleukin-1beta and inflammation. The nature of the cytoplasmic-DNA-sensing inflammasome is currently unknown. Here we show that AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2), an interferon-inducible HIN-200 family member that contains an amino-terminal pyrin domain and a carboxy-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain, senses cytoplasmic DNA by means of its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain and interacts with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) through its pyrin domain to activate caspase-1. The interaction of AIM2 with ASC also leads to the formation of the ASC pyroptosome, which induces pyroptotic cell death in cells containing caspase-1. Knockdown of AIM2 by short interfering RNA reduced inflammasome/pyroptosome activation by cytoplasmic DNA in human and mouse macrophages, whereas stable expression of AIM2 in the non-responsive human embryonic kidney 293T cell line conferred responsiveness to cytoplasmic DNA. Our results show that cytoplasmic DNA triggers formation of the AIM2 inflammasome by inducing AIM2 oligomerization. This study identifies AIM2 as an important inflammasome component that senses potentially dangerous cytoplasmic DNA, leading to activation of the ASC pyroptosome and caspase-1.

### Inflammasomes: mechanism of action, role in disease, and therapeutics [^7f112a5b]. Nature Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The inflammasomes are innate immune system receptors and sensors that regulate the activation of caspase-1 and induce inflammation in response to infectious microbes and molecules derived from host proteins. They have been implicated in a host of inflammatory disorders. Recent developments have greatly enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which different inflammasomes are activated. Additionally, increasing evidence in mouse models, supported by human data, strongly implicates an involvement of the inflammasome in the initiation or progression of diseases with a high impact on public health, such as metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, recent developments pointing toward promising therapeutics that target inflammasome activity in inflammatory diseases have been reported. This review will focus on these three areas of inflammasome research.

### Emerging activators and regulators of Inflammasomes and pyroptosis [^ea3453ec]. Trends in Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

The inflammasome is a cytosolic immune signaling complex that induces inflammation and pyroptosis. Inflammasome complexes respond to a variety of pathogens, as well as danger or homeostasis-altering signals; they can play critical roles in the development of autoinflammatory conditions and cancer. Studies have now provided additional insights into the activation mechanisms and regulation of established inflammasome complexes, including NLRP1b, NLRP3, NOD-like receptor family apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP)-NLRC4, absent in melanoma (AIM)2, caspase-11, and pyrin. New activators and regulators of emerging NLRP6 and NLRP9b inflammasome complexes have also been described. We highlight the latest progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, including the discovery of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). We also discuss the importance of inflammasome activators and regulators in health and disease.

### Control of innate and adaptive immunity by the inflammasome [^d5697463]. Microbes and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

The importance of innate immunity lies not only in directly confronting pathogenic and non-pathogenic insults but also in instructing the development of an efficient adaptive immune response. The Nlrp3 inflammasome provides a platform for the activation of caspase-1 with the subsequent processing and secretion of IL-1 family members. Given the importance of IL-1 in a variety of inflammatory diseases, understanding the role of the Nlrp3 inflammasome in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses cannot be overstated. This review examines recent advances in inflammasome biology with an emphasis on its roles in sterile inflammation and triggering of adaptive immune responses.

### PANoptosome signaling and therapeutic implications in infection: central role for ZBP1 to activate the inflammasome and PANoptosis [^737302ae]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

The innate immune response provides the first line of defense against infection and disease. Regulated cell death (RCD) is a key component of innate immune activation, and RCD must be tightly controlled to clear pathogens while preventing excess inflammation. Recent studies have highlighted a central role for the innate immune sensor Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) as an activator of a form of inflammatory RCD called PANoptosis, which is regulated by a multifaceted cell death complex called the PANoptosome. In response to influenza A virus infection, ZBP1 activates the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which then acts as an integral component of the ZBP1-PANoptosome to drive inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis. In this context, the NLRP3 inflammasome is critical for caspase-1 activation and proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 maturation, but dispensable for cell death due to functional redundancies between PANoptosome molecules. Similarly, ZBP1 is also central to the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-PANoptosome; this PANoptosome forms in response to Francisella novicida and herpes simplex virus 1 infection and incorporates the AIM2 inflammasome as an integral component. In this review, we will discuss the critical roles of ZBP1 in mediating innate immune responses through inflammasomes, PANoptosomes, and PANoptosis during infection. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of innate immunity and cell death will be essential for the development of targeted modalities that can improve patient outcomes by mitigating severe disease.

### The PYRIN domain-only protein POP2 inhibits inflammasome priming and activation [^e4752910]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To mount an inflammatory response, which is crucial for host defence and tissue repair, against infections and tissue damage, cytosolic pathogen/microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs or danger signals) are sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs belonging to the AIM2-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR) families trigger the assembly of large protein platforms, called inflammasomes. The NLRP3 inflammasome has an important function in response to infectious and sterile activators, and its activation depends on a two-step mechanism, referred to as priming and activation. Priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome depends on Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling that induces NF-κB-dependent expression and post-translational modification of NLRP3 and interleukin (IL)-1β. Then, NLRP3 is activated by a variety of PAMPs/MAMPs and DAMPs, including the gout-causing uric acid crystals, which ultimately trigger K + efflux as a shared signal. Recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC to NLRP3 nucleates ASC polymerization and subsequently leads to caspase-1 activation through an induced-proximity mechanism. Active caspase-1 then executes the proteolytic cleavage, maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and induces pyroptotic cell death. Although caspase-1 is activated by the canonical inflammasome pathway, caspases-4 (mouse caspase-11) and -5 are activated by the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. In contrast to caspase-1 activation in the canonical inflammasome complex, the non-canonical pathway does not rely on receptor- and ASC-mediated sensing of molecular patterns; instead, non-canonical inflammasome-linked caspases bind directly to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through their caspase recruitment domain, thus causing their activation. Although caspase-1 induces IL-1β and IL-18 maturation as well as pyroptotic cell death, caspases-4 and -5 only induce pyroptosis, which causes the release of IL-1α and HMGB1 (refs,). Pyroptosis also releases extracellular oligomeric ASC particles, which can be opsonized and phagocytized by neighbouring cells to propagate and perpetuate inflammasome responses. Upon blocking the NLRP3 inflammasome with POP1, the ASC particle release is prevented. The mechanism for canonical inflammasome complex assembly depends on specific protein–protein interactions, which are mediated by homotypic PYRIN domain (PYD) interactions between PRRs and ASC, and by homotypic CARD interactions between ASC and pro-caspase-1 (ref.). The PRR-initiated nucleation of the prion-like, self-perpetuating ASC polymerization into filaments or spheres is a crucial step. Hence, the PYD is essential for inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation, but we are just beginning to understand the molecular processes that regulate inflammasome activation and resolution. Since excessive inflammasome activation causes inflammatory diseases, a balanced inflammasome response is crucial for the host.

### Pyrin-only protein 2 limits inflammation but improves protection against bacteria [^4bc28806]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

POP2 is a primate-restricted protein that inhibits NF-κB signalling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro, and implicated in controlling macrophage inflammatory cytokine responses. However, POP2 regulation of inflammatory responses in vivo and how such regulation influences pathologic and/or beneficial aspects of inflammation has not been demonstrated. Using mice-expressing human POP2, this study confirms the anticipated in vivo functions of POP2, that NF-κB and Nlrp3 inflammasome-dependent cytokine responses to inflammatory challenge and infection are tempered by POP2. Despite this reduction in inflammatory cytokines important for innate immunity, POP2 mice were significantly more resistant to lethal bacterial infections. Mechanistically, POP2 enhances production of IFN-γ improving macrophage anti-bacterial function while concomitantly limiting inflammatory cytokine levels and reducing cellular inflammation, which promotes calculably diminished inflammation-derived tissue damage. Thus, although POP2 is an important modifier of inflammatory cytokine responses, it also enhances innate immunity, effectively serving to balance detrimental and beneficial aspects of the inflammatory response. We also provide insight into regulation of POP2 expression by identifying the ‘minimal’ promoter region and a 3′ARE controlling mRNA stability. Further, we reveal that POP2 regulates the AIM2 inflammasome in vivo and in human cells.

### Assembly mechanism of the inflammasome sensor AIM2 revealed by single molecule analysis [^a8472bdf]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Detailed studies on the operating mode of the inflammasome sensor AIM2 have revealed that dsDNA binding and protein oligomerization are connected and cooperative. Compelling evidence support a mechanism in which the dsDNA acts as a platform for AIM2 oligomerization,. In addition, it has been shown that filaments formed by AIM2 oligomerization upon dsDNA binding function as a template for the polymerization of the inflammasome adaptor ASC. This mechanism helps explain the robust inflammatory response observed upon cell treatment with dsDNA fragments sufficiently long to trigger the formation of the AIM2 inflammasome.

We have presented here fundamental information on the kinetics and mechanism of propagation of AIM2-DNA assemblies to further our understanding of the initial stages of inflammasome formation at the molecular level. AIM2 oligomerizes into distinct, individual assemblies of different sizes coexisting on the same dsDNA molecule (Fig. 1b). Most small oligomers composed of 1–20 molecules grow with a rate ranging from 0.2–7 molecules/s at low nanomolar concentrations; however, we have observed growth rates up to 28 molecules/s. This time scale aligns with previously reported kinetic studies in live cells showing that the ASC speck assembles in approximately 3 min once ASC concentration redistributes upon AIM2 inflammasome activation. The long-lived nature of the ASC speck is demonstrated in these studies by its persistence for several hours. Our results on the permanent attachment of AIM2 oligomers are in accord with these observations.

### Targeting TMEM176B enhances antitumor immunity and augments the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers by unleashing inflammasome activation [^35a0bebf]. Cancer Cell (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate a central role of the inflammasome in reinforcing CD8 + T cell-dependent antitumor immunity and enhancing the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapies. In particular, we demonstrate a key role of TMEM176B as negative regulator of inflammasome activation. Whereas most immunotherapeutic modalities have focused on drugs targeting adaptive components of the immune system, innate immune pathways may represent additional anticancer targets.

Although recently proposed to play a role in immunotherapy, the direct contribution of IL-1β/IL-18 inflammasomes to antitumor immunity and adaptive checkpoint blockade remains elusive. Here we identify a therapeutic strategy that reinforces antitumor responses by targeting TMEM176B and promoting inflammasome disinhibition. Our results suggest that inflammasome activation plays a central role in antitumor immunity triggered by anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 mAb. Although experiments in Nlrp3 −/− animals did not reach statistical significance, studies in animals lacking the downstream effectors Casp1/11 did. These observations suggest that different inflammasomes could mediate the antitumoral effect triggered by anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies. Accordingly, analysis of anti-PD-1-treated melanoma patients suggested that NLRP6, NLRP7, AIM2, and NLRC4 inflammasomes might contribute to antitumor responses unleashed by checkpoint blockers. Although the requirement of caspase-1 autoproteolysis can differ among different inflammasomes, and caspase-1 may cleave other proteins than IL-1β and IL-18, to our knowledge, caspase-1/11 activation mostly depends on inflammasomes. Thus, it is unlikely that observations in Casp1/11 −/− and Tmem176b −/− Casp1 −/− mice could involve inflammasome-independent mechanisms.

### Inflammasomes: mechanism of assembly, regulation and signalling [^1b79f701]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Inflammasomes are multiprotein signalling platforms that control the inflammatory response and coordinate antimicrobial host defences. They are assembled by pattern-recognition receptors following the detection of pathogenic microorganisms and danger signals in the cytosol of host cells, and they activate inflammatory caspases to produce cytokines and to induce pyroptotic cell death. The clinical importance of inflammasomes reaches beyond infectious disease, as dysregulated inflammasome activity is associated with numerous hereditary and acquired inflammatory disorders. In this Review, we discuss the recent developments in inflammasome research with a focus on the molecular mechanisms that govern inflammasome assembly, signalling and regulation.

### Recent advances in inflammasome biology [^e1654018]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The inflammasome is a complex of proteins that through the activity of caspase-1 and the downstream substrates gasdermin D, IL-1β, and IL-18 execute an inflammatory form of cell death termed pyroptosis. Activation of this complex often involves the adaptor protein ASC and upstream sensors including NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and pyrin, which are activated by different stimuli including infectious agents and changes in cell homeostasis. Here we discuss new regulatory mechanisms that have been identified for the canonical inflammasomes, the most recently identified NLRP9b inflammasome, and the new gasdermin family of proteins that mediate pyroptosis and other forms of regulated cell death.

### Inflammasome diversity: exploring novel frontiers in the innate immune response [^5b083060]. Trends in Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathogens elicit complex mammalian immune responses by activating multiple sensors within inflammasomes, which recognize diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This simultaneous activation induces the formation of protein complexes referred to as multiple inflammasomes, that orchestrate a spectrum of programmed cell death pathways, including pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. This concept is crucial for comprehending the complexity of the innate immune system's response to diverse pathogens and its implications for various diseases. Novel contributions here include emphasizing simultaneous sensor activation by pathogens, proposing the existence of multiple inflammasome complexes, and advocating for further exploration of their structural basis. Understanding these mechanisms may offer insights into disease pathogenesis, paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions targeting inflammasome-mediated immune responses.

Overview of the NLRP3 Inflammasome Pathway

The NLRP3 inflammasome pathway plays a key role in the development and progression of several cardiovascular diseases. Innate immunity is mediated by evolutionarily conserved receptors, the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), that sense tissue injury by recognizing “danger” molecules sharing similar chemical properties.These include pathogen-associated molecular-patterns (PAMPs), generated during infection, and damage-associated molecular-patterns (DAMPs), generated in sterile injury. Binding of DAMPs or PAMPs to PRRs initiates an innate immune response.The most characterized PRRs are NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs; reviewed elsewhere).NLRs include proteins forming the NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular macromolecular complex that produces active cytokines of the IL-1 family and promotes pyroptosis.NLRP3 is the most studied and engaged in cardiovascular pathology, however, other inflammasomes such as NLRP1, NLRC4, and AIM2 have been identified.

### The lncRNA neat1 promotes activation of inflammasomes in macrophages [^fd3d9bc6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Inflammasomes are a group of multicomponent signaling platforms in the cytoplasm that control inflammatory response and anti-pathogen defense against a wide range of infection and damage signals –. These signals, including pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs),, directly or indirectly activate one or more innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing receptors (NLRs, e.g. NLRP1, NLRP3, and NLRC4), cytosolic DNA sensors (AIM2), and Pyrin (also known as TRIM20) –. Upon activation, the sensor proteins bind to and induce the oligomerization of a common adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC), leading to the formation of a single macromolecular aggregate known as ASC speck –. Oligomerized ASC recruits pro-caspase-1, facilitating its auto-processing into the mature subunits. Active caspase-1 mediates proteolytic maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 and elicits pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that exhibits features of both apoptosis (e.g. DNA fragmentation) and necrosis (e.g. plasma membrane rupture),,–.

While adequate inflammasome activation is crucial for the elimination of pathogens and damaged cells,, dysregulation of inflammasome contributes to autoimmune, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and other diseases. Nevertheless, the regulation of inflammasomes is not well understood. Several inflammasomes respond to a limited set of signals. For example, the AIM2 and NLRC4 inflammasomes are assembled upon the sensing of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and specific bacterial proteins, respectively,, while the inflammasome formed with NLRP1 or its murine homolog Nlrp1b is activated by anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) and 2-deoxy-D-Glucose (2DG),. In contrast, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by an extraordinarily diverse array of PAMPs including several viral, bacterial, fungal pathogens, and DAMPs, such as crystalline, particulate (e.g. uric acid crystals, asbestos, and alum), extracellular ATP, pore-forming toxins, as well as change in cellular environment, notably hypoxia,,. A salient unresolved issue is how various inflammasomes collectively are able to respond to such a wide spectrum of stimuli.

### Assembly mechanism of the inflammasome sensor AIM2 revealed by single molecule analysis [^21620574]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Finally, we have shown here that AIM2 does not diffuse along the dsDNA. Because only aberrant host dsDNA can be found in the cytosol, AIM2 might not follow the proposed mechanism for IFI16 to discriminate between host and foreign dsDNA, which involves diffusing on sufficiently long stretches of dsDNA to facilitate oligomerization. We hypothesize that specific interactions of the HIN domains of AIM2 and IFI16 with dsDNA, as well as the presence of one versus two HIN domains, lead to different binding behavior. In fact, the reported binding affinity between full-length IFI16 and dsDNA is significantly smaller than that of AIM2 (Table 1),. Another discrepancy in the behavior of AIM2 and IFI16 is that the HIN domain of AIM2 has been shown to oligomerize in the DNA, unlike the HIN domains of IFI16. Moreover, the X-ray structures of the complexes between AIM2-HIN and IFI16-HINb with DNA revealed that the former leads to a larger solvent-accessible surface area buried upon complex formation. Interdomain dynamics of IFI16 HIN domains, which are absent in AIM2, could play a role in diffusion. Additional studies are required to fully understand the different diffusion behavior of dsDNA sensors.

### Inflammasome activation negatively regulates MyD88-IRF7 type I IFN signaling and anti-malaria immunity [^73bfff2c]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The inflammasome plays a critical role in inflammation and immune responses against pathogens. However, whether or how inflammasome activation regulates type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in the context of malaria infection remain unknown. Here we show mice deficient in inflammasome sensors AIM2, NLRP3 or adaptor Caspase-1 produce high levels of IFN-I cytokines and are resistant to lethal Plasmodium yoelii YM infection. Inactivation of inflammasome signaling reduces interleukin (IL)-1β production, but increases IFN-I production. Mechanistically, we show inflammsome activation enhances IL-1β-mediated MyD88-TRAF3-IRF3 signaling and SOCS1 upregulation. However, SOCS1 inhibits MyD88-IRF7-mediated-IFN-I signaling and cytokine production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. By contrast, ablation of inflammsome components reduces SOCS1 induction, and relieves its inhibition on MyD88-IRF7-dependent-IFN-I signaling, leading to high levels of IFN-α/β production and host survival. Our study identifies a previously unrecognized role of inflammasome activation in the negative regulation of IFN-I signaling pathways and provides potential targets for developing effective malaria vaccines.

### Assembly mechanism of the inflammasome sensor AIM2 revealed by single molecule analysis [^757f7fa0]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Based on the association and dissociation rates of AIM2 and dsDNA at the single molecule level, we have determined the affinity of AIM2 for dsDNA devoid of self-association effects. The K D falls in the sub-micromolar range, likely due to the lack of sequence specificity for dsDNA. As expected, AIM2-DNA affinity is significantly low (approximately two orders of magnitude) compared to sequence-specific proteins such as transcription factors.

We have shown here that AIM2 oligomerizes to some extent in the absence of dsDNA at sub-nanomolar concentration. The use of single molecule techniques likely has facilitated the detection of these assemblies. AIM2 self-association unaccompanied by dsDNA binding could lead to sterile inflammation. A potential mechanism to tightly control AIM2 self-association might involve keeping a low basal concentration. In addition, it has been proposed that AIM2 self-association could be controlled by an autoinhibitory mechanism involving interactions between the PYD and HIN domains of AIM2. Intramolecular interactions in AIM2 could compete with oligomerization and dsDNA binding at very low basal concentrations. Based on our results and in accordance with previous reports, we hypothesize that once pathogenic dsDNA enters the cytoplasm, AIM2 concentration increases, thus facilitating protein oligomerization and irreversible dsDNA binding, which subsequently leads to active inflammasome formation and downstream signaling until the cell dies.

### ASC filament formation serves as a signal amplification mechanism for inflammasomes [^d2ac2330]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Recently, a unified assembly mechanism was proposed for the PYD-containing receptors AIM2 and NLRP3: the receptors nucleate clusters of ASC through PYD–PYD interactions, which in turn nucleate caspase-1 filaments. In analogy, it was proposed that the CARD-containing receptor NLRC4 directly nucleates caspase-1 filaments, as in theory CARD-containing receptors do not require ASC for caspase-1 recruitment. Although direct recruitment of pro-caspase-1 to NLRC4 might indeed happen in Asc -deficient cells as we hypothesized before, it does not seem to efficiently activate caspase-1, because we and others have reported that caspase-1 processing into its p20/p10 subunits and the levels of released mature cytokines are reduced. Furthermore, a large number of ASC specks can be observed in WT cells on NLRC4 activation, indicating that ASC nevertheless plays an important role in NLRC4 signalling. Our results now indicate that the ASC CARD lacks the ability to form higher-order oligomers at physiological concentrations, and that even on NLRC4 activation ASC speck formation relies on the ASC PYD. Our data thus support a model in which CARD-containing receptors initiate ASC speck formation with the help of ASC bridging molecules, and that the PYDs of these ASC molecules nucleates an ASC PYD filament. Thus, the ASC CARD can have a triple function in inflammasome signalling on CARD-receptor activation.

In conclusion, our study gives insights into the architecture of the ASC speck and the mechanism by which ASC filaments assemble this structure. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that ASC filament formation serves as an amplification mechanism in inflammasome signalling, and that this amplification serves to generate sufficient mature cytokines before the onset of pyroptotic cell death. Nevertheless, important questions remain; the higher-resolution structure of the activated NLRC4 receptor has been recently reported, yet how exactly such receptor complexes with C 10 –C 12 stoichiometry initiate the 3-start ASC PYD filaments is still unknown. Furthermore, the structure of the whole ASC speck assembly, including receptor, ASC and caspase-1, is still lacking and it remains unknown whether other proteins participate in its formation. Finally, additional theoretical and experimental approaches will be necessary to understand if and how ASC speck formation might impart threshold responses, reduce biological noise and control temporal and spatial control of inflammasome signalling.

### Assembly-driven activation of the AIM2 foreign-dsDNA sensor provides a polymerization template for downstream ASC [^0074a748]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have presented here evidence supporting an oligomerization-driven activation mechanism for initiating the assembly of the AIM2 inflammasome in the absence of the currently prevailing autoinhibitory mechanism(Fig. 9). For instance, the basal concentration of AIM2 is presumably sub-nanomolar under normal conditions, but is dramatically raised on pathogenic invasion (AIM2 is overexpressed by type-1 interferons by at least 200-fold). Thus, in the absence of cytosolic dsDNA, we propose that AIM2 would fail to oligomerize and induce the polymerization of ASC, due to its low basal concentration. For instance, in physiologically relevant reaction conditions, AIM2 can assemble into a filament on dsDNA larger than 300 bp even at pico-molar concentrations, but it requires nearly 10,000-fold more AIM2 molecules to auto-assemble filaments without dsDNA (Figs 2 and 5, and Supplementary Fig. 2a). On the other hand, because oligomerization is coupled with dsDNA binding, individual AIM2 molecules are capable of finding one another even in the presence of excess dsDNA (Fig. 5). Thus, when foreign dsDNA invades, basal AIM2 would rapidly cluster into a seed filament necessary to nucleate the polymerization of ASC.

### The MUC1 mucin specifically inhibits activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [^9ef08169]. Genes and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

MUC1 is a cell membrane-associated mucin, expressed ubiquitously on the mucosal epithelia as well as by immune cells, that limits the inflammatory response to multiple pathogens. We have recently shown that MUC1 controls inflammation resulting from Helicobacter pylori infection by suppressing interleukin-1β (IL-1β) produced via the NLRP3 inflammasome. Here, we demonstrate that MUC1 also regulates IL-1β secretion induced by the NLRP3-activating bacteria Haemophilus influenzae but not bacteria that activate other inflammasomes. Using purified ligands, we further demonstrate that MUC1 regulation of NLRP3 is specific, as it has no effect on the NLRP1b, NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes. This indicates a unique role for MUC1 in the regulation of NLRP3-activating bacterial infections.

### Role of inflammasomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^d5912abb]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Extra-pulmonary infective causes

Aberrant inflammatory responses are also seen in patients with sepsis, where approximately 6% of patients progress to develop ARDS.The initial inflammasome activated will depend on the initiating pathogen, but a common final pathway is seen as the systemic inflammatory response develops.The inflammasome has been highlighted as a critical protagonist of this systemic inflammatory response in mice, with activation peaking at day 1, coinciding with peak serum IL-1β concentrations.NLRP3 is the most studied inflammasome in sepsis and may be stimulated by bacterial, viral and fungal infection alongside the various DAMPs released during sepsis (table 1).Huang et al found that increased NLRP3 expression is associated with worsening multi-organ failure in humans with sepsis, and Fukui et al demonstrated that the neutrophil NLRP3 inflammasome is the principal driver of early inflammation in murine experimental peritonitis.Inhibition of GSDMD and caspase-1 activation and blockade of NLRP3 and ASC upregulation have all been shown to protect against lung injury in a murine caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model.This beneficial effect of NLRP3 blockade has been reproduced in studies investigating CLP and LPS-induced murine lung injury.

While NLRP3 is the most studied inflammasome in sepsis-induced lung injury, alternative inflammasomes have been implicated.NLRC4 gene expression is raised in the innate immune cells of septic patients, the extent of which was associated with increasing mortality.The NLRC4 inflammasome is also implicated in the development of sepsis in humans in response to pathogens, including Salmonella and P. aeruginosa. Additionally, isolated upregulation of the NLRC4 inflammasome in neutrophils is sufficient to cause severe systemic inflammation, and Wang et al demonstrated that silencing of NLRC4 ameliorated lung injury and inflammation in murine CLP.In contrast, the AIM2 inflammasome is protective in the initial response to infection in mice, with their blockade associated with worsened outcomes.

### Three cases of autoinflammatory disease with novel NLRC4 mutations, and the first mutation reported in the CARD domain of NLRC4 associated with autoinflammatory infantile enterocolitis (AIFEC) [^b9d2ea65]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammasomes are large cytosolic multiprotein complexes that serve as the innate immunity system receptors. They are triggered and assembled in response to different forms of stress, such as infections, and activate caspase-1-mediated inflammatory responses. This leads to cleavage and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, initiation of inflammatory cascades, and a form of cell death referred to as pyroptosis. The role of inflammasomes in autoimmunity and autoinflammation has been well studied, and today we believe they play a part in the pathogenesis of many other disorders as well, such as neurologic and metabolic diseases. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), Leucine-rich Repeat and Pyrin domain containing (NLRP)1, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP12, NOD-like receptor (NLR)-family caspase activating and recruitment domain (CARD) domain‐containing protein 4 (NLRC4), NLR Family Apoptosis Inhibitory Protein (NAIP), and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) are the main identified inflammasomes.

### Cytosolic DNA triggers inflammasome activation in keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions [^c967ac83]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) plays a central role in the pathogenesis and the course of inflammatory skin diseases, including psoriasis. Posttranscriptional activation of IL-1β is mediated by inflammasomes; however, the mechanisms triggering IL-1β processing remain unknown. Recently, cytosolic DNA has been identified as a danger signal that activates inflammasomes containing the DNA sensor AIM2. In this study, we detected abundant cytosolic DNA and increased AIM2 expression in keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions but not in healthy skin. In cultured keratinocytes, interferon-γ induced AIM2, and cytosolic DNA triggered the release of IL-1β via the AIM2 inflammasome. Moreover, the antimicrobial cathelicidin peptide LL-37, which can interact with DNA in psoriatic skin, neutralized cytosolic DNA in keratinocytes and blocked AIM2 inflammasome activation. Together, these data suggest that cytosolic DNA is an important disease-associated molecular pattern that can trigger AIM2 inflammasome and IL-1β activation in psoriasis. Furthermore, cathelicidin LL-37 interfered with DNA-sensing inflammasomes, which thereby suggests an anti-inflammatory function for this peptide. Thus, our data reveal a link between the AIM2 inflammasome, cathelicidin LL-37, and autoinflammation in psoriasis, providing new potential targets for the treatment of this chronic skin disease.

### Molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial DNA release and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway [^f38c6fe8]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

DNA, the blueprint of life, contains the genetic information needed for all organisms to develop, survive, and reproduce. In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA signals the host immune system to pathogens, such as DNA viruses and bacteria, inducing its response. Pathogen-derived nucleic acids, such as single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds) DNA and RNA, and RNA–DNA hybrids are recognized by various sensors in host cells and trigger signaling pathways to elicit innate immune responses involving the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines,.

Host cells initiate innate immune responses upon recognition of various types of conserved pathogen structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), yeast zymosan, and bacterial flagellin, as well as pathogen-derived nucleic acids. Recent studies have indicated that damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are endogenous factors released from damaged, dead, or transformed cells, also activate innate immune responses,. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are critical for sensing both PAMPs and DAMPs in the extracellular space, endosome, and cytoplasm,. Over the over the past two decades, various classes of PRRs have been identified, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), c-type lectin-like receptors (CLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I–like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors (ALRs), and cytosolic DNA receptors –. In infected cells, pathogen-derived nucleic acids are commonly exposed in subcellular compartments, and each type of PRR recognizes them depending on the location and polynucleotide species of the nucleic acids,. For instance, the RIG-1 in the RLR family senses 5′-tri/diphosphorylated dsRNAs, the cytosolic replication intermediates of RNA viruses,. In the TLR family, TLR-3 and TLR-7/8 detect dsRNAs and ssRNAs, respectively, and TLR-9 recognizes CpG-hypomethylated DNA in endosomes,. AIM2 in the ALR family binds to cytosolic DNA to induce the formation of the inflammasome, which consists of multiprotein complexes, in myeloid cells,–. Subsequently, inflammasome assembly leads to the maturation of pro-interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and pro-IL-18 through the activation of the protease caspase-1,.

### Integrating inflammasome signaling in sexually transmitted infections [^5d024b5d]. Trends in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Outstanding Questions 

Which inflammasome types are critical in the genital tract? What are the molecular pathways that activate inflammasomes in the genital mucosa? We have increased understanding of inflammasome signaling in hematopoietic cells but our knowledge of immune receptors and inflammasome activation mechanisms in the mucosal epithelium is rather limited.

What are the roles of the noncanonical NLRP3-dependent and NLRP3-independent inflammasomes? Recent reports have suggested key roles for inflammasomes other than NLRP3 during a wide variety of infections. However, their roles in STIs remain ambiguous. For example, activation of the AIM2 inflammasome by Candida sp. was recently described in macrophages. Does AIM2 also influence progression of vulvovaginal candidiasis?

What is the role of autophagy during STIs? Both autophagy of pathogens (xenophagy) and autophagic degradation of inflammasomes and precursor IL-1β by macroautophagy are now considered important mechanisms contributing to infection outcome. However, these mechanisms have not been characterized in STIs.

Which host pathways function as rheostats between pathogen elimination and exaggerated inflammatory responses? Since inflammasomes have both beneficial and detrimental roles, there is a need to identify targets that can specifically activate or dampen inflammasome activity. Knowledge in this area can help us develop appropriate therapeutic interventions.

What are the functional consequences of inflammasome gene polymorphisms in the human population? Numerous studies report that specific alleles of genes encoding inflammasome components are associated with increased propensity to infection or severe disease, but the functional consequences of these alleles and how they predispose patients to disease are unknown.

### The lncRNA neat1 promotes activation of inflammasomes in macrophages [^aa73b6a2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The assembly of inflammasomes requires a common priming event, such as LPS-induced activation of TLRs, which induces the expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β,. However, the NLRC4, AIM2, and especially NLRP3 inflammasomes are versatile inflammasome, collectively responding to a wide range of stimuli,,–. It remains unclear whether these stimuli also employ a general mechanism to modulate inflammasomes. Of note, the expression of Neat1 is highly regulated by various signals, including those that activates the tumor suppressor p53 (refs.). Moreover, hypoxia is a key physiological stressor present within both normal and tumor microenvironmentsand a critical determinant of the immune response. Here we show that Neat1 links the effect of hypoxia with the activation of NLRP3, NLRC4, and AIM2 inflammasomes. Both human NEAT1 and murine Neat1 are thought to maintain the structural integrity of the paraspeckles, the function of which remains unclear. We find that the paraspeckles are disrupted in response to various inflammasome-activating signals, leading to the release of Neat1 and subsequent translocation to the cytoplasm, implying that paraspeckles may serve as a storage depot for Neat1. Therefore, the upregulation and translocation of Neat1 may be a converging event leading to the activation of the various caspase-1-associated canonical inflammasomes by a wide range of stimuli, underscoring a common mechanism for the assembly of these inflammation signaling platforms. In addition, our finding, along with previous observation that ASC and NLRP3 are recruited from other cellular components to mitochondria and associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes upon both priming and activation processes, also highlights the trafficking of inflammasome components as a major mechanism for the regulation of inflammasome activity.

Finally, by generating Neat1 knockout mice and analyzing their response to alum-induced peritoneal inflammation and flagellin-induced lung inflammation, we demonstrate that Neat1 enhances the activation of NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes and promotes pyroptosis in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 11). Therefore, Neat1 may represent a therapeutic target for inflammasome-associated diseases such as gout and autoinflammatory syndromes.

### Policing the cytosol – bacterial-sensing inflammasome receptors and pathways [^4a16f51b]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Pattern recognition receptors recognize signals originating from pathogens and comprise a large part of the arsenal in innate immune responses. The NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are one particular class of these receptors that survey the cytoplasm for signs of pathogen invasion. Upon detection, they trigger the formation of a macromolecular complex called the inflammasome that is required for elimination of the pathogen, as well as amplifying a pro-inflammatory response. Although the core machinery has been defined, recent data emphasize the complexity of how NLR inflammasomes function. Here, we highlight new discoveries that reveal how precisely fine-tuned NLR inflammasome functions are, and how that may be modulated by antagonistic effects of concomitant inflammasome activation as well as novel regulatory factors.

### Inflammasomes: threat-assessment organelles of the innate immune system [^18ed2bc2]. Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

Inflammasomes are supramolecular organizing centers that operate to drive interleukin-1 (IL-1)-dependent inflammation. Depending on context, inflammatory caspases act upstream or downstream of inflammasome assembly, serving as the principal enzymes that control activities of these organelles. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of inflammasome assembly and signaling. We posit that upstream regulatory proteins, classically known as pattern-recognition receptors, operate to assess infectious and non-infectious threats to the host. Threat assessment is achieved through two general strategies: (1) direct binding of receptors to microbial or host-derived ligands or (2) indirect detection of changes in cellular homeostasis. Upon activation, these upstream regulatory factors seed the assembly of inflammasomes, leading to IL-1 family cytokine release from living (hyperactive) or dead (pyroptotic) cells. The molecular and physiological consequences of these distinct cell fate decisions are discussed.

### Assembly-driven activation of the AIM2 foreign-dsDNA sensor provides a polymerization template for downstream ASC [^d9d7cae0]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Unlike the HIN200 domains of IFI16 (ref.), we found that AIM2 Hin oligomerizes on dsDNA, which appears to be at least partially responsible for the more robust dsDNA-binding activity of AIM2 than IFI16 in vitro. It is tempting to speculate that the oligomerization of AIM2 Hin has not been selected against because cytosolic AIM2 is much less likely to encounter self-dsDNA than nuclear IFI16. On the other hand, p202 HinB does not bind dsDNA, but forms a tetramer that prevents AIM2 from clustering on dsDNA. Our finding of the oligomerization activity of AIM2 Hin further strengthens this finding, as p202 HinB would physically interfere with clustering of AIM2 Hin on dsDNA. Moreover, not all the side chains implicated in the tetramerization of p202 HinB are conserved in AIM2 (ref.; Fig. 4a,b), thus preventing spurious auto-oligomerization. Nevertheless, our experiments showed that isolated AIM2 Hin oligomerizes into random clusters on dsDNA without any filamentous architecture (Fig. 8a) and that disrupting the oligomerization of AIM2 Hin still results in filaments isomorphic to wild type (Fig. 8e–g). Thus, we hypothesize that the role of AIM2 Hin oligomerization is essential, yet limited to generating a ‘seed' nucleation unit preceding the filament growth (Fig. 9).

AIM2 is overexpressed by type-1 interferon pathways on pathogenic invasion. Our finding of auto-assembly suggest that in principle, dsDNA binding is not a priori required to initiate assembly. We hypothesize that the auto-oligomerization of AIM2 (Fig. 6) can also enhance the host defence response (Fig. 9). For example, the pre-assembled AIM2 platforms would be able to survey the cytoplasm more effectively because of the larger contiguous surface area. The AIM2 Hin clusters could also increase the dsDNA-binding activity via avidity, and the AIM2 oligomers would immediately nucleate the polymerization of ASC without binding foreign dsDNA. However, this could be a double-edged sword: the auto-oligomerization activity of AIM2 could also underlie several autoimmune disorders in which AIM2 is overexpressed via hyperactive interferon pathways, as it could cause persistent inflammasome activity without any pathogenic dsDNA.

### PKM2-dependent glycolysis promotes NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome activation [^39e426be]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To further investigate which inflammasome is responsible for the activation of caspase-1/11 and cytokine release after lactate treatment, we treated NLRP3 −/−, AIM2 −/−, NLRC4 −/− and NLRP1 − / − LPS-primed BMDMs with lactate. Interestingly, loss of NLRP3 and AIM2 (but not NLRC4 and NLRP1) partly limited lactate-induced caspase-1/11 activity and cytokine (IL-1β and HMGB1) release in LPS-primed BMDMs (Fig. 5j). These findings indicate that both NLRP3 and AIM2 contribute to lactate-induced inflammasome activation in LPS-primed BMDMs.

### FACS-based detection of extracellular ASC specks from NLRP3 inflammasomes in inflammatory diseases [^064f8c57]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome is a critical intracellular pattern recognition receptor involved in mediating innate immune responses and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in the formation of a multimolecular complex containing the sensory component NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), and caspase-1. Central to the inflammasome activation is the re-localization of the ASC protein from being diffusely distributed within the cell, to compression into a dense speck in the cytosol within minutes of the inflammasome activation. This ASC protein aggregate provides a platform for overall inflammasome organization, caspase-1 recruitment, and activation, and ultimately as a support for caspase-1 mediated cleavage of pro-interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and pro-IL-18 into their active forms. The catalytically active ASC specks are released into the extracellular space following cytolytic execution of the pyroptosis. The presence of these extracellular ASC specks has also been detected in the sera of patients with several conditions where the NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been implicated in the disease pathogenesis.

However, ASC is an adaptor protein, which is also found in other inflammasome complexes including NLRP1, NLRC4, pyrin, AIM2, and NLRP10. The methodologies used for detecting the ASC specks so far have relied on detecting the ASC protein only, without investigating whether ASC was in complex with another inflammasome component. Therefore, these methods were only partially informative, since they could not reliably determine the inflammasome origin of such specks. Previous studies have shown the potential for extracellular ASC specks to be used as a novel biomarker for both diagnosis and/or disease monitoring. The diagnostic utility of the extracellular ASC specks could potentially be improved if the inflammasome receptor at the initiation of extracellular specks could be accurately identified. To this end, we developed a novel assay which detects ASC/NLRP3 inflammasome events in the sera of patients with inflammatory conditions.

### The lncRNA neat1 promotes activation of inflammasomes in macrophages [^e458bfb8]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Neat1 mediates the effect of HIF-2α on inflammasomes

The expression of Neat1 is induced by infection of viruses (e.g. influenza virus and herpes simplex virus),, and is also regulated by the tumor suppressor p53, a central sentinel for various internal and external stresses,. In addition, hypoxia, which promotes inflammation via HIF-1α-mediated induction of NLRP3 and IL-1β,, can induce Neat1 through HIF-2α-mediated transcriptional activation,. Thus, Neat1 may function as a stress sensor for associated inflammasomes. To test this possibility, we investigated the role of Neat1 in hypoxia-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. iBMDMs cultured under hypoxic conditions exhibited increased levels of Neat1 (Supplementary Fig. 9a), HIF-1α, HIF-2α, p65, NLRP3, and IL-1β (Fig. 9a), which was accompanied by enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome formation, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β secretion (Fig. 9a). However, knockout of Neat1 not only reduced the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome under normoxic conditions, but also effectively prevented the increase of inflammasome activation under hypoxic conditions (Supplementary Fig. 9b), underscoring a critical role for Neat1 in hypoxia-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition, activation of NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes was also increased under hypoxic conditions, along with increased expression of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and IL-1β (Fig. 9b, c). Knocking down either HIF-1α (Fig. 9d, f, h) or HIF-2α (Fig. 9e, g, i) reduced hypoxia-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β maturation under the condition of NLRP3, NLRC4, or AIM2 inflammasome activation (Fig. 9d–i), indicating that both HIF-1α and HIF-2α mediate the effect of hypoxia on canonical inflammasomes. HIF-1α knockdown, but not HIF-2α knockdown, reduced the activation of diverse inflammasomes in iBMDMs devoid of Neat1 (Fig. 9d–i), which claims that Neat1 silencing could efficiently block the effect of HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α, on inflammasomes activation. These results suggest that hypoxia-induced activation of the NLRP3, NLRC4, and AIM2 inflammasomes and associated inflammatory responses are in part due to HIF-2α-mediated upregulation of Neat1.

### Negative regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by A20 protects against arthritis [^0664457e]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoinflammatory disease that affects 1-2% of the world's population and is characterized by widespread joint inflammation. Interleukin-1 is an important mediator of cartilage destruction in rheumatic diseases, but our understanding of the upstream mechanisms leading to production of interleukin-1β in rheumatoid arthritis is limited by the absence of suitable mouse models of the disease in which inflammasomes contribute to pathology. Myeloid-cell-specific deletion of the rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility gene A20/Tnfaip3 in mice (A20(myel-KO) mice) triggers a spontaneous erosive polyarthritis that resembles rheumatoid arthritis in patients. Rheumatoid arthritis in A20(myel-KO) mice is not rescued by deletion of tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (ref. 2). Here we show, however, that it crucially relies on the Nlrp3 inflammasome and interleukin-1 receptor signalling. Macrophages lacking A20 have increased basal and lipopolysaccharide-induced expression levels of the inflammasome adaptor Nlrp3 and proIL-1β. As a result, A20-deficiency in macrophages significantly enhances Nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis and interleukin-1β secretion by soluble and crystalline Nlrp3 stimuli. In contrast, activation of the Nlrc4 and AIM2 inflammasomes is not altered. Importantly, increased Nlrp3 inflammasome activation contributes to the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis in vivo, because deletion of Nlrp3, caspase-1 and the interleukin-1 receptor markedly protects against rheumatoid-arthritis-associated inflammation and cartilage destruction in A20(myel-KO) mice. These results reveal A20 as a novel negative regulator of Nlrp3 inflammasome activation, and describe A20(myel-KO) mice as the first experimental model to study the role of inflammasomes in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis.

### Inflammasomes in chronic liver disease: hepatic injury, fibrosis progression and systemic inflammation [^4798e31a]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Canonical inflammasomes

The NLRP1 was the first subset of NLRs that was shown to assemble, oligomerise and activate the CASP1 cascade.For a detailed description of the mechanisms of NLRP1 inflammasome assembly and activation, readers are referred to another excellent review.

NLRP3 is currently the best characterised canonical inflammasome and was shown to be induced by a wide range of molecules, such as PAMPs derived from bacteria,virusesor fungi,or from host-derived factors (DAMPs) such as extracellular ATP,urates,β-amyloid protein,and reactive oxygen species (ROS).Despite extensive research, no unified mechanism for NLRP3 activation was agreed upon and many different theories have been proposed. The most accepted pathway is the “two-step” activation cascade (Fig. 1A).

The NLRC4/NAIP inflammasome is involved in host defence and plays a crucial role in the restriction of intra-epithelial bacterial colonisation during early stages of enterobacterial infection. The activation of NLRC4 is slightly different from the NLRP3, since this inflammasome mainly responds to bacterial flagellin and components of the bacterial type III secretory system, (Fig. 1B).

Another class of inflammasomes do not contain NLRs, but instead contain pyrin and HIN200 domains (PYHIN) and are a family of IFN-induced proteins.From these, AIM2 was shown to activate CASP1. AIM2 binds directly to its ligand, which is double-stranded DNAand can detect both bacteria- and virus-derived cytosolic double-stranded DNA, as well as DNA from damaged cells,– (Fig. 1C).

The NLRP6 inflammasome has also been shown to be capable of activating CASP1, which is linked to homeostatic IL-18 secretion from intestinal epithelial cells and the maintenance of a healthy microbiota.

Non-canonical inflammasome

Mouse CASP11 and human CASP4/5 can be directly activated in the host cell cytosol by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released by Gram-negative bacteria – (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, LPS directly binds to non-canonical caspases determining their oligomerisation and activation.CASP4/5 (human) and CASP11 (mouse) can also trigger pyroptosis in the absence of TLR stimulation and indirectly determine the secretion of mature cytokines by activating the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequently activating CASP1. –

Taken together these mechanisms underline the different host cell mechanisms for recognising DAMPs/PAMPs in the extracellular and intracellular space and responding via activation of canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes.

### Assembly mechanism of the inflammasome sensor AIM2 revealed by single molecule analysis [^d4f93aa1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Equally elegant studies on the function and operating modes of AIM2 and IFI16 found that DNA binding and sensor self-association are integrated and cooperative processes,. The PYD domain was found to be essential for these functions and specifically required for strong binding to dsDNA and polymerization in the presence of excess dsDNA. These studies show that AIM2-DNA and IFI16-DNA binding affinity depends on the DNA length, as the affinity increases steeply for dsDNA longer than a threshold of ~70 bp (hosting ~6 AIM2 protomers) until reaching a maximum value for ~280 bp DNA (hosting ~24 AIM2 protomers). This work thus indicates that the DNA acts as a molecular ruler for AIM2 inflammasome assembly following a switch-like mechanism.

Furthermore, the interaction between the nuclear sensor IFI16 and dsDNA has been studied using single molecule fluorescence imaging by TIRF microscopy (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence). This study shows single IFI16 molecules diffusing several μm along the λ-phage dsDNA. IFI16 scans the dsDNA to find other molecules already bound to DNA for oligomerization. A sufficiently long stretch of free dsDNA is required for scanning and oligomerization, thus elegantly explaining how IFI16 discriminates between self- and foreign-DNA, as the former does not expose sufficiently long dsDNA fragments available for self-assembly due to nucleosome packing.

Despite the challenges associated with protein oligomerization, combined efforts using a variety of biophysical, biochemical, and microscopy techniques are significantly advancing our understanding of AIM2 inflammasome formation,–. However, there are unresolved questions on the mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the AIM2-DNA assembly process. First, we do not know whether AIM2 forms individual, distinct oligomers on the DNA, and in this case, whether oligomers of different sizes can coexist and what their shapes are. Second, what are the association and dissociation rates of a single AIM2-DNA complex? Third, how fast do oligomers grow and what mechanisms are followed for oligomerization and propagation? Finally, since the function of AIM2 does not require to discriminate between self and foreign DNA, does the cytosolic sensor follow the same scanning mechanism as the nuclear sensor IFI16? Here, we provide answers to these questions by combining optical traps and confocal fluorescence microscopy to study the initial stages of the AIM2 inflammasome.

### Blockade of AIM2 inflammasome or α ₁-AR ameliorates IL-1 β release and macrophage-mediated immunosuppression induced by CAR-T treatment [^472da36d]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Upon binding to dsDNA, AIM2 recruits the adapter protein, which is the speck-like protein associated to apoptosis (ASC) and initiates the assembly of AIM2/ASC, leading to auto-cleavage of procaspase-1 and release of its active form.By using co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated increased binding of AIM2 to ASC in the coculture of CAR-T cells/Raji cells/macrophages (figure 2E), suggesting that the CAR-T treatment induces the formation and activation of the AIM2 inflammasome in the macrophages. Moreover, the caspase-1-specific inhibitors VX765 or AC-YVAD-CMK repressed the production of bioactive IL-1β in the macrophages cocultured with CAR-T/Raji cells (figure 2F, G). These data support that the CAR-T treatment induces the release of tumor cell DNA. The latter is then phagocytozed by macrophages and sensed by AIM2, resulting in AIM2 inflammasome formation, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β release.

Inflammasomes are molecular machines that carry out inflammatory responses on challenges by pathogens and endogenous dangers. Dysregulation of inflammasome assembly and regulation is associated with numerous human diseases from autoimmunity to cancer. In recent years, significant advances have been made in understanding the mechanism of inflammasome signaling using structural approaches. Here, we review inflammasomes formed by the NLRP1, NLRP3, and NLRC4 sensors, which are well characterized structurally, and discuss the structural and functional diversity among them.

### NLRP3 licenses NLRP11 for inflammasome activation in human macrophages [^ef02bc70]. Nature Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Here, we report the identification of NLRP11 as an NLRP3 inflammasome component in human macrophages. NLRP11 bound to ASC and NLRP3 and was required for NLRP3 oligomerization and ASC polymerization. In the absence of NLRP11, NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 activation and release of IL-1β and IL-18 were defective, but activation of AIM2, NLRC4 and NLRP7 inflammasomes was not affected. The NLRP3–ASC–NLRP11 complex only assembled after NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which required NLRP11 PYD. NLRP11 was also necessary for the release of IL-1β induced by the CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutant NLRP3 R260W, which placed NLRP11 at an essential step in human NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Our study therefore provides important insights into NLRP3 inflammasome regulation in human macrophages.

### Inflammasomes in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis [^8207366c]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Inflammasomes are molecular platforms assembled in response to infection or danger signals, and they regulate the activation of caspase-1 and the maturation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. In this review, we will summarize the centrality of Nod-like receptor proteins that assemble inflammasomes and regulate intestinal homeostasis by controlling host defense responses, microbiota composition, intestinal inflammation and tissue damage.

Recent Findings

In the intestine, the innate immune system evolved to tolerate commensal microorganisms while maintaining the capacity to trigger host defense responses to invading pathogens. Recent findings suggest that inflammasomes play a critical role in the intricate interplay between the local microbial community and the mucosal immune system by sensing commensal bacteria, regulating microbial ecology, establishing the host defense response that discriminates pathogenic from commensal microbes and preventing the emergence of pathobionts. A model to reconcile the conflicting results in the literature on the role of inflammasomes in experimental colitis will be discussed.

Summary

A better understanding of the relationship between inflammasome signaling and the intestinal microbiota might provide insight into the complex interaction of the innate immune system with the intestinal environment, and identify new approaches for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and gastrointestinal cancer.

### Mitochondrial damage activates the NLRP10 inflammasome [^438a5877]. Nature Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Upon detecting pathogens or cell stress, several NOD-like receptors (NLRs) form inflammasome complexes with the adapter ASC and caspase-1, inducing gasdermin D (GSDMD)-dependent cell death and maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18. The triggers and activation mechanisms of several inflammasome-forming sensors are not well understood. Here we show that mitochondrial damage activates the NLRP10 inflammasome, leading to ASC speck formation and caspase-1-dependent cytokine release. While the AIM2 inflammasome can also sense mitochondrial demise by detecting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytosol, NLRP10 monitors mitochondrial integrity in an mtDNA-independent manner, suggesting the recognition of distinct molecular entities displayed by the damaged organelles. NLRP10 is highly expressed in differentiated human keratinocytes, in which it can also assemble an inflammasome. Our study shows that this inflammasome surveils mitochondrial integrity. These findings might also lead to a better understanding of mitochondria-linked inflammatory diseases.

### Assembly-driven activation of the AIM2 foreign-dsDNA sensor provides a polymerization template for downstream ASC [^ef12ee98]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The assembly of Rig-I and MDA5 filaments on foreign dsRNA is intrinsically regulated by the ATP turnover at their helicase domains; the filament assembly of Rig-I is further regulated by the recognition of 5′-triphosphate of dsRNA. However, ALRs lack any dsDNA sequence specificity and auto-assemble into filaments without any cofactors. These observations raise the question of whether ALRs are regulated at all. We propose that the dsDNA length-dependent binding provides a key to answering this question. Although MDA5 can assemble into filaments along the length of dsRNA, the ability to discriminate between ‘short' and ‘long' dsRNA by MDA5 is not as pronounced as that of AIM2 or IFI16 (refs,), as if separating the ligand-binding domain from the polymerization domain generates greater dependence on the size of the nucleic acid scaffold for assembly. ‘Long,' naked cytosolic dsDNA is rare, and Knipe and colleagues postulated that IFI16 would selectively recognize foreign dsDNA by the degree of chromatinization. Indeed, the highly cooperative relationship between the binding affinity and the size of dsDNA can clearly define an ‘off' and ‘on' state for assembling the AIM2 nucleoprotein filament (Figs 2 and 5). Moreover, the size of dsDNA required to build the ‘threshold oligomer' (Figs 2 and 5) also correlates with a previous in vivo study in which about 80-bp cytosolic dsDNA was required to induce robust interleukin-1β secretion. Taken together, our data suggest that the size of dsDNA can act as a powerful ‘molecular ruler' that can regulate the initiation of the AIM2 inflammasome assembly in a switch-like mechanism.

### The inflammasome and lupus: another innate immune mechanism contributing to disease pathogenesis? [^3b1a9421]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of innate immunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been a rapidly expanding area of research over the last decade. Included in this rubric is the concept that activation of the inflammasome, a molecular complex that activates caspase-1 and in turn the cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, is important in lupus pathogenesis. This review will summarize the recent discoveries exploring the role of the inflammasome machinery in SLE.

Recent Findings

Immune complexes can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, and SLE-derived macrophages are hyper-responsive to innate immune stimuli, leading to enhanced activation of the inflammasome and production of inflammatory cytokines. Work in several murine models suggests an important role for the NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating lupus nephritis. Caspase-1, the central enzyme of the inflammasome, is essential for the development of type I interferon responses, autoantibody production, and nephritis in the pristane model of lupus. The absence of melanoma 2 inflammasome may have protective and pathogenic roles in SLE.

Summary

Recent evidence suggests that the inflammasome machinery is dysregulated in SLE, plays an important role in promotion of organ damage, and may mediate cross-talk between environmental triggers and the development of lupus. Further research should focus on whether inhibition of inflammasome components may serve as a viable target for therapeutic development in SLE.

### The inflammasome regulatory pathway and infections: role in pathophysiology and clinical implications [^a8a5872f]. The Journal of Infection (2011). Low credibility.

The innate immune system serves to generate immediate host defenses against pathogens. Advance in the mechanism of innate immunity has provided new insights into host-pathogen microbial interactions. The cytosolic multi-protein complex called the inflammasome, which regulates the caspase-1 dependent processing of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, is critical for the innate defense against pathogens. We summarize the current knowledge regarding the regulatory functions of the inflammasome in the pathogenesis of infections by various microbes (e.g., bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa), and discuss its potential application in a clinical setting. Understanding of the unique role of the inflammasome signaling pathway in initiating and regulating inflammation is pivotal for the development of innovative approaches to optimize management of these infections.

### Regulation of inflammasome signaling [^447e66e1]. Nature Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Innate immune responses have the ability to both combat infectious microbes and drive pathological inflammation. Inflammasome complexes are a central component of these processes through their regulation of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-18 and pyroptosis. Inflammasomes recognize microbial products or endogenous molecules released from damaged or dying cells both through direct binding of ligands and indirect mechanisms. The potential of the IL-1 family of cytokines to cause tissue damage and chronic inflammation emphasizes the importance of regulating inflammasomes. Many regulatory mechanisms have been identified that act as checkpoints for attenuating inflammasome signaling at multiple steps. Here we discuss the various regulatory mechanisms that have evolved to keep inflammasome signaling in check to maintain immunological balance.

### Emerging inflammasome effector mechanisms [^043bfa87]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2011). Medium credibility.

Caspase 1 activation by inflammasome complexes in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) induces the maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. Recent reports have begun to identify additional inflammasome effector mechanisms that proceed independently of IL-1β and IL-18. These include the induction of pyroptotic cell death, the restriction of bacterial replication, the activation of lipid metabolic pathways for cell repair and the secretion of DAMPs and leaderless cytokines. These non-canonical functions of caspase 1 illustrate the diverse mechanisms by which inflammasomes might contribute to innate immunity, repair responses and host defence.

Summary

Initiation of a successful immune response requires a working set of sensors that detect any noxious agent within the cellular microenvironment and molecular platforms that process this signal to trigger an appropriate effector response. Pattern recognition receptors can engage different signalling cascades that lead to proinflammatory gene expression. At the same time, transcription-independent events such as activation of proteases and/or phagocytosis are also initiated. The inflammasome pathway constitutes a signalling platform that leads to the activation of so-called inflammatory caspases, most notably caspase-1, which plays a pivotal role in the cleavage and thus maturation of proinflammatory cytokines, but also in the induction of pyroptosis, a special type of cell death. In this review we elaborate on the currently known inflammasome complexes with a special focus on the mechanism behind their activation. Understanding these mechanisms could provide important information regarding the potential signalling nodes that might be targeted for therapeutic intervention.

### Activation and regulation of the inflammasomes [^d1e1d65c]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Inflammasomes are key signalling platforms that detect pathogenic microorganisms and sterile stressors, and that activate the highly pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. In this Review, we discuss the complex regulatory mechanisms that facilitate a balanced but effective inflammasome-mediated immune response, and we highlight the similarities to another molecular signalling platform - the apoptosome - that monitors cellular health. Extracellular regulatory mechanisms are discussed, as well as the intracellular control of inflammasome assembly, for example, via ion fluxes, free radicals and autophagy.

### CrkII / abl phosphorylation cascade is critical for NLRC4 inflammasome activity and is blocked by Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoT [^8ffffdc5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

NLRP1b, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and Pyrin are the five well- characterized subtypes of caspase-1-dependent canonical inflammasomes,. Depending on the host and/or cell line, P. aeruginosa has been shown to activate NLRC4 or NLRP3 inflammasomes –,, suggesting that eukaryotic hosts may utilize different caspase-1 inflammasome subtypes to mount inflammatory responses to P. aeruginosa infection. To determine which caspase-1-dependent canonical inflammasome subtype(s) contributed to P. aeruginosa recognition and response in BMDMs, we extracted BMDMs from knockout mice defective in these inflammasomes (Nlrp1 –/–, Nlrp3 –/–, Nlrc4 –/–, Aim2 –/–, and Pyrin –/–) and infected them with P. aeruginosa and assessed their supernatants for the production of IL-1β and IL-18 by ELISA. Data indicated that NLRC4 was the response in BMDMs, as defect in this inflammasome reduced IL-1β and IL-18 production to levels comparable to Cas-1 –/– BMDMs (Fig. 2g–h and Supplementary Fig. 3e). Moreover, infection with ExoT-deleted mutant strains resulted in nearly 3-fold increase in the number of NLRC4 inflammasome foci and complementing this strain with pExoT, but not empty vector, significantly reduced NLRC4 inflammasome foci numbers in BMDMs (Fig. 2i–j), indicating that ExoT interferes with NLRC4 inflammasome assembly.

### Acapsular cryptococcus neoformans activates the NLRP3 inflammasome [^d13f509d]. Microbes and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that mainly infects immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS patients. Although cell surface receptors for recognition of C. neoformans have been studies intensively, cytoplasmic recognition of this pathogen remains unclear. As an important detector of pathogen infection, inflammasome can sense and get activated by infection of various pathogens, including pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Our present study showed that acapsular C. neoformans (cap59Δ) activated the NLRP3-, but not AIM2-nor NLRC4- inflammasome. During this process, viability of the fungus was required. Moreover, our in vivo results showed that during the pulmonary infection of cap59Δ, immune cell infiltration into the lung and effective clearance of the fungus were both dependent on the presence of NLRP3 inflammasome. In summary, our data suggest that the capsule of C. neoformans prevents recognition of the fungus by host NLRP3 inflammasome and indicate that manipulation of inflammasome activity maybe a novel approach to control C. neoformans infection.

### FACS-based detection of extracellular ASC specks from NLRP3 inflammasomes in inflammatory diseases [^2ef2377f]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Inflammasomes are critical intercellular platforms that play essential roles in sensing and propagating signals associated with tissue damage and infection. Central to inflammasome activation is the formation of ASC oligomers, which interact with the sensing components defining various inflammasomes (NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, Pyrin, and AIM2), ultimately leading to caspase-1 activation. Caspase-1, in turn, processes several proteins within the cell, including gasdermin D (GSDMD), and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Several studies have suggested that detecting ASC oligomers (specks) in human sera could serve as a novel method to determine inflammasome activation and act as a useful biomarker. Most of these studies implied that ASC specks originate from NLRP3 inflammasome activation, albeit without providing concrete evidence. To address this gap, we refined our ASC speck detection methodology to investigate their origin.

We developed an FACS-based approach that enables the simultaneous detection of ASC specks in serum and the exploration of their association with other inflammasome components, thereby determining their origin. Initially, we validated our methodology using commercially sourced THP-1 cell lines modified for easy detection of ASC monomers and oligomers by attaching a fluorescent GFP tag to ASC, alongside ASC-deficient cell lines. Using these models, we induced ASC speck formation with traditional inflammasome stimulants and detected specks both intercellularly and in cell culture supernatants using various techniques, including IF, WB, and FACS. Extending our experiments to human monocytes and MDMs from HCs, we confirmed intercellular ASC specks and their release into cell culture supernatants. Furthermore, we demonstrated the detection of ASC specks in human sera using WB and FACS, and visualized these structures with IF. Through WB and FACS, we also identified sensory NLRP3 components within these ASC specks.

### What do we know about the inflammasome in humans? [^5e5f44f5]. Brain Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

The inflammasome complex is part of the innate immune system, which serves to protect the host against harm from pathogens and damaged cells. It is a term first proposed by Tschopp's group in 2002, with numerous original research articles and reviews published on the topic since. There have been many types of inflammasome identified, but all result in the common pathway of activation of caspases and interleukin 1β along with possible cell death called pyroptosis. Despite a growing body of research investigating the structure and function of the inflammasome in animal models, there is still limited evidence identifying inflammasome components in human physiology and disease. In this review, we explore the molecular structure and mechanism of activation of the inflammasome with a particular focus on inflammasome complexes expressed in humans. Inflammasome components have been identified in several human peripheral and brain tissues using both in vivo and ex vivo work, and the inflammasome complex has been shown to be associated with several genetic and acquired inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the information available on the inflammasome with an emphasis on the importance of prioritizing work on human tissue. There is a huge demand for more effective treatments for a number of inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Modulation of the inflammasome has been proposed as a novel treatment for several of these diseases and there are currently clinical trials ongoing to test this theory.

### SARS-CoV-2 N protein promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation to induce hyperinflammation [^cc949532]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 N protein interacts with NLRP3 protein

The role of SARS-CoV-2 N protein in the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome was then investigated. Initially, the interaction of N protein with the NLRP3 inflammasome components, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1, was explored. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays showed that N protein only interacted with NLRP3 protein and failed to interact with ASC protein or Caspase-1 protein in HEK293T and A549 cells (Fig. 3a, b). Reciprocal Co-IP assays further conformed that NLRP3 protein interacted with N protein (Fig. 3c, d), but failed to interact with 3a protein (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) in HEK293T and A549 cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that purified His-N protein could directly bind to NLRP3 protein (Fig. 3e). There are four types of ASC-dependent inflammasomes (NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, and AIM2) that have been reported. Here we determined the role of N protein in the regulation of NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, and AIM2 inflammasomes. Co-IP assays showed that N protein only interacted with the NLRP3 protein, but failed to interact with the NLRP1, NLRC4, or AIM2 proteins (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Notably, we showed that N protein could induce IL-1β production in the presence of NLRP3, but failed to promote IL-1β production in the presence of NLRP1, NLRC4, or AIM2 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). These results demonstrate that N protein specifically and directly triggers NLRP3. Moreover, confocal microscope analyses showed that in HEK293T and A549 cells, N protein and NLRP3 protein were co-localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3f, g and Supplementary Movie 1), and N protein failed to interact with ASC (Fig. 3h, i and Supplementary Movie 2, 3). Taken together, these results demonstrated that N protein specifically interacts with NLRP3 protein to regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome.

### "How to release or not release, that is the question." A review of interleukin-1 cellular release mechanisms in vascular inflammation [^1340194d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The term inflammasome denotes the collection of several molecules assembled in response to a secondary inflammatory stimulus subsequently causing protein maturation.The NLRP3 (nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain, leucine‐rich repeat family pyrin domain‐containing 3) inflammasome is a multimeric complex containing 3 components: NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis associated speck‐like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), and procaspase‐1. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is tightly controlled and activation and cleavage of procaspase‐1 into active caspase‐1 usually occurs in response to a second hit stimulus and before the release of active/mature IL‐1β (ie, P2X7R [P2X7 receptor] activation by ATP).

Cells in the vascular environment respond to inflammatory stimuli by a variety of other inflammasome mechanisms leading to heterogeneity in responses temporally and locally. NLRP3‐ and AIM2‐directed mechanisms have been detected in monocyte/macrophage intimal infiltrates in early atherosclerotic plaque progression.Additionally, NLRP1 inflammasome activity has also been shown to drive endothelial cell inflammatory largely in in peripheral artery disease.Additionally, caspases also are activated by a variety of other mechanisms within the vascular environment. Caspase‐1 and caspase‐5 expression (along with NLRP3 and AIM2) are overwhelmingly expressed in lymphoid infiltrates of the media and adventitia of the aorta.A comprehensive review of inflammasome pathophysiology in vascular pathology may be found in 37. Classically, however, the pro‐form of IL‐1 (31‐kDa) in immune cells (and vascular cells) is cleaved to a mature biologically active form (17‐kDa) by caspase‐1, a component of the inflammasome.The inflammasome principally referred to herein is the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is predominately activated with the vascular environment (VSMCs, monocytes/macrophages, ECs; Figure 1).

### The inflammasome recognizes cytosolic microbial and host DNA and triggers an innate immune response [^328e35da]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

The innate immune system recognizes nucleic acids during infection and tissue damage. Whereas viral RNA is detected by endosomal toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8) and cytoplasmic RIG-I and MDA5, endosomal TLR9 and cytoplasmic DAI bind DNA, resulting in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and interferon regulatory factor transcription factors. However, viruses also trigger pro-inflammatory responses, which remain poorly defined. Here we show that internalized adenoviral DNA induces maturation of pro-interleukin-1beta in macrophages, which is dependent on NALP3 and ASC, components of the innate cytosolic molecular complex termed the inflammasome. Correspondingly, NALP3- and ASC-deficient mice display reduced innate inflammatory responses to adenovirus particles. Inflammasome activation also occurs as a result of transfected cytosolic bacterial, viral and mammalian (host) DNA, but in this case sensing is dependent on ASC but not NALP3. The DNA-sensing pro-inflammatory pathway functions independently of TLRs and interferon regulatory factors. Thus, in addition to viral and bacterial components or danger signals in general, inflammasomes sense potentially dangerous cytoplasmic DNA, strengthening their central role in innate immunity.

### Assembly mechanism of the inflammasome sensor AIM2 revealed by single molecule analysis [^908b7202]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Based on the data reported here, we suggest a model for the formation of AIM2-DNA assemblies that involves three complementary and likely simultaneous scenarios (Fig. 8). Single AIM2 molecules stochastically and transiently bind to dsDNA with low affinity leading to survival times of approximately 3 s (Fig. 8a). During this time, incoming AIM2 molecules bind to dsDNA in positions that are sufficiently close to prebound AIM2 molecules or oligomers, causing lateral growth of the oligomer and permanent attachment (Fig. 8b). In conjunction or alternatively, incoming AIM2 molecules may also bind to prebound clusters via AIM2-AIM2 interactions (in the absence of dsDNA binding), leading to oligomer growth in direction perpendicular to the dsDNA (Fig. 8c). Overall, AIM2-DNA assembly formation and propagation can be understood as a polymerization process with primary (AIM2-DNA binding) and secondary (AIM2-AIM2) nucleation events. The double-nucleation mechanism is a well-known process demonstrated previously for sickle fiber formation by hemoglobin S polymerization. The different propagation mechanisms proposed here (Fig. 8b, c) likely favor the formation of intertwined and densely packed filamentous structures via (1) AIM2 PYD -AIM2 PYD interactions between nucleoprotein filaments; (2) AIM2 HIN interactions between nucleoprotein filaments and free dsDNA fragments; and (3) AIM2 PYD -ASC PYD interactions between nucleoprotein filaments and ASC or polymerized ASC. This mechanism explains the random appearance of AIM2 clusters of different sizes and shapes (Figs. 1b, 3b), likely resulting from the favored binding of incoming AIM2 molecules to larger pre-existing bound oligomers. Additionally, attached AIM2 clusters of increasing size limit dsDNA availability, thus leading to a higher probability of incoming molecules to interact with prebound oligomers.

### Assembly-driven activation of the AIM2 foreign-dsDNA sensor provides a polymerization template for downstream ASC [^98e968f8]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The symmetry of the AIM2 filament suggests the structure–activity relationships in the assembly. For instance, the three-fold symmetry of the six-start helix correlates with the dimeric minimal binding unit of AIM2 observed from our FRET assays (Fig. 5b,c ; 2 × 3=6). The requirement for clustering about six AIM2 molecules (Figs 2e and 5c) to generate a robust ‘threshold oligomer' also correlates with one hexameric base of the six-start helix. Furthermore, the optimal oligomer size of 20–25 AIM2 molecules (Figs 2e and 5c) also suggests that about four hexameric rings may need to stack up to assemble an optimally stable AIM2 nucleoprotein filament. Finally, because the ASC PYD filament also has the same helical architecture as the AIM2 PYD filament, it is tempting to speculate that the assembly of the upstream filament is directly coupled to the downstream effector activation, thus achieving maximal cooperativity.

Both PYDs and CARDs belong to the death-domain (DD) superfamily. Despite their widely variable primary sequences, all known CARDs and PYDs share essentially the same tertiary structure (six-helix bundles). Several DD proteins are capable of assembling into helical filaments, and the PYDs are mostly distinguished from the CARDs by one extended loop region between helices 2 and 3 (refs,). Thus, a major outstanding question regarding the signalling mechanism of both PYDs and CARDs has been how one DD protein specifically selects its interacting partner. Although all DD proteins utilize essentially the same set of interaction surfaces for oligomerization, it is becoming clear that the resulting oligomers display vastly diverse helical architectures. Indeed, it was recently shown that identical helical symmetry underlies the mechanism by which the Rig-I CARD tetramers nucleate the MAVS CARD filament. It had yet to be tested whether such a symmetric interaction is a unifying theme in assembling filamentous supramolecular signalling platforms by both CARDs and PYDs, especially when both upstream and downstream DD domains can assemble into infinite filaments as observed from AIM2 and ASC. The consistent helical symmetry between the AIM2 PYD and ASC PYD filaments suggests that the corresponding polymerization trajectory between the upstream and downstream oligomers not only underpins the assembly of the inflammasomes but also can be a key to defining the specificity of the DD-family proteins.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update (...) [^2ee05e80]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion. 8, 11-17The proinflammatory microenvironment created by ICPi immune-mediated activity and the unrestrained activity of T cells contribute to the occurrence of irAEs, including cutaneous manifestations. 7, 18-20Although they may occur in the context of anti–PD-1 21-23and anti–PD-L1 therapy, . 72The distribution of colitis has been reported to involve the descending colon more often than other parts of the colon. 64, 72The pathology from patients with ICPi colitis has demonstrated greater inflammatory changes than observed with classic inflammatory bowel disease. 72, 73The histologic picture is often characterized by marked mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates in the lamina propria, consisting of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils, and also features of chronic inflammatory damage.

139, 140Inflammatory markers are usually very elevated in patients with ICPi-induced arthritis and are useful to differentiate these events from other rheumatic syndromes. NSAIDs alone are usually not sufficient to control symptoms, and corticosteroids and synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs might be required. 143-145Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are an option if only one or two joints are affected. Rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody are negative, and inflammatory markers are highly elevated. Creatine kinase levels should generally be within normal limits, differentiating this condition from myositis. Imaging with MRI and electromyography should not show any evidence of myopathy or muscle inflammation. 135, 148It can present as reactivation of pre-existing paraneoplastic polymyositis or dermatomyositis or as a de novo myositis.

The main symptom of inflammatory myositis is weakness, primarily in the proximal extremities, with difficulties in standing up, lifting arms, and moving around. In severe cases, patients can complain of myalgia as well. Discussion. 176 177respectively. If multiple cell lines are affected, 178evaluation for pure red cell aplasia, 179autoantibodies, 180aplastic anemia, and myelodysplasia must be considered. The majority of patients respond after holding the ICPi and are managed successfully with corticosteroids, IVIG, and growth factor support. Hemolytic anemia has been described as having a development of autoantibodies.

### Inflammasome activation triggers caspase-1-mediated cleavage of cGAS to regulate responses to DNA virus infection [^db4eb7ff]. Immunity (2017). Low credibility.

Viral infection triggers host innate immune responses that result in the production of various cytokines including type I interferons (IFN), activation of inflammasomes, and programmed cell death of the infected cells. Tight control of inflammatory cytokine production is crucial for the triggering of an effective immune response that can resolve the infection without causing host pathology. In examining the inflammatory response of Asc -/- and Casp1 -/- macrophages, we found that deficiency in these molecules resulted in increased IFN production upon DNA virus infection, but not RNA virus challenge. Investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed that upon canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation, caspase-1 interacted with cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), cleaving it and dampening cGAS-STING-mediated IFN production. Deficiency in inflammasome signaling enhanced host resistance to DNA virus in vitro and in vivo, and this regulatory role extended to other inflammatory caspases. Thus, inflammasome activation dampens cGAS-dependent signaling, suggesting cross-regulation between intracellular DNA-sensing pathways.

### NLRP3 inflammasome: a key player in the pathogenesis of life-style disorders [^e7b15b50]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines play a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory response, which is essential for the proper functioning of our immune system. When infections or threats to the body’s defense mechanisms are detected, the innate immune system takes the lead. However, an excessive inflammatory response can lead to the production of high concentrations of cytotoxic molecules, resulting in tissue damage. Inflammasomes are significant contributors to innate immunity, and one of the most extensively studied inflammasome complexes is NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3). NLRP3 has a wide range of recognition mechanisms that streamline immune activation and eliminate pathogens. These cytosolic multiprotein complexes are composed of effector, adaptor, and sensor proteins, which are crucial for identifying intracellular bacterial breakdown products and initiating an innate immune cascade. To understand the diverse behavior of NLRP3 activation and its significance in the development of lifestyle-related diseases, one must delve into the study of the immune response and apoptosis mediated by the release of proinflammatory cytokines. In this review, we briefly explore the immune response in the context of lifestyle associated disorders such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, oral disease, and cardiovascular disease.

### Targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in inflammatory diseases [^e82ee259]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2018). Medium credibility.

Danger signals are a hallmark of many common inflammatory diseases, and these stimuli can function to activate the cytosolic innate immune signalling receptor NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3). Once activated, NLRP3 nucleates the assembly of an inflammasome, leading to caspase 1-mediated proteolytic activation of the interleukin-1β (IL-1β) family of cytokines, and induces an inflammatory, pyroptotic cell death. Pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 activation results in potent therapeutic effects in a wide variety of rodent models of inflammatory diseases, effects that are mirrored by genetic ablation of NLRP3. Although these findings highlight the potential of NLRP3 as a drug target, an understanding of NLRP3 structure and activation mechanisms is incomplete, which has hampered the discovery and development of novel therapeutics against this target. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of NLRP3 activation and regulation, highlight the evolving landscape of NLRP3 modulators and discuss opportunities for pharmacologically targeting NLRP3 with novel small molecules.

### Phosphorylation of NLRC4 is critical for inflammasome activation [^d8872451]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

NLRC4 is a cytosolic member of the NOD-like receptor family that is expressed in innate immune cells. It senses indirectly bacterial flagellin and type III secretion systems, and responds by assembling an inflammasome complex that promotes caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis. Here we use knock-in mice expressing NLRC4 with a carboxy-terminal 3×Flag tag to identify phosphorylation of NLRC4 on a single, evolutionarily conserved residue, Ser533, following infection of macrophages with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (also known as Salmonella typhimurium). Western blotting with a NLRC4 phospho-Ser533 antibody confirmed that this post-translational modification occurs only in the presence of stimuli known to engage NLRC4 and not the related protein NLRP3 or AIM2. Nlrc4(-/-) macrophages reconstituted with NLRC4 mutant S533A, unlike those reconstituted with wild-type NLRC4, did not activate caspase-1 and pyroptosis in response to S. typhimurium, indicating that S533 phosphorylation is critical for NLRC4 inflammasome function. Conversely, phosphomimetic NLRC4 S533D caused rapid macrophage pyroptosis without infection. Biochemical purification of the NLRC4-phosphorylating activity and a screen of kinase inhibitors identified PRKCD (PKCδ) as a candidate NLRC4 kinase. Recombinant PKCδ phosphorylated NLRC4 S533 in vitro, immunodepletion of PKCδ from macrophage lysates blocked NLRC4 S533 phosphorylation in vitro, and Prkcd(-/-) macrophages exhibited greatly attenuated caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion specifically in response to S. typhimurium. Phosphorylation-defective NLRC4 S533A failed to recruit procaspase-1 and did not assemble inflammasome specks during S. typhimurium infection, so phosphorylation of NLRC4 S533 probably drives conformational changes necessary for NLRC4 inflammasome activity and host innate immunity.

### The inflammasome: a danger sensing complex triggering innate immunity [^99a633c9]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

The NOD-like receptors (NLR) are a family of intracellular sensors of microbial motifs and 'danger signals' that have emerged as being crucial components of the innate immune responses and inflammation. Several NLRs (NALPs and IPAF) form a caspase-1-activating multiprotein complex, termed inflammasome, that processes proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1beta. Amongst the various inflammasomes, the NALP3 inflammasome is particularly qualified to sense a plethora of diverse molecules, ranging from bacterial muramyldipeptide to monosodium urate crystals. The important role of the NALP3 inflammasome is emphasized by the identification of mutations in the NALP3 gene that are associated with a susceptibility to inflammatory disorders. These and other issues related to the inflammasome are discussed in this review.

### Chloride sensing by WNK1 regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis [^0fedcdac]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

It was shown previously that imiquimod may activate NLRP3 by a K + efflux-independent mechanism. Our results demonstrate that imiquimod-induced NLRP3 activation as measured by caspase-1 activation, IL-1β production and pyroptosis in BMDMs is enhanced by deletion or inhibition of WNK1 (Supplementary Fig. 6). These results indicate that imiquimod-induced NLRP3 activation is also regulated by WNK1.

To investigate the specificity of WNK1 regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, we tested the impact of WNK1 inhibition or deletion on other inflammasomes such as NLRC4, NLRP1, non-canonical caspase-11 and AIM2. Our results show that WNK1 inhibition or deletion does not impact the activity of the NLRC4, NLRP1 and non-canonical caspase-11 inflammasomes (Supplementary Figs. 7 – 9). However, we observed that WNK1 inhibition or deletion increases the activity of the AIM2 inflammasome (Supplementary Fig. 10). Nevertheless, this increased AIM2 activation, unlike the case with the NLRP3 inflammasome (see below), was not regulated by Cl − or K + (Supplementary Fig. 11). Future research should provide more insight on the mechanism of regulation of the AIM2 inflammasome by WNK1.

### Dynamic roles of inflammasomes in inflammatory tumor microenvironment [^025fa24a]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

The inflammatory tumor microenvironment has been known to be closely connected to all stages of cancer development, including initiation, promotion, and progression. Systemic inflammation in the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being recognized as an important prognostic marker in cancer patients. Inflammasomes are master regulators in the first line of host defense for the initiation of innate immune responses. Inflammasomes sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns, following recruitment of immune cells into infection sites. Therefore, dysregulated expression/activation of inflammasomes is implicated in pathogenesis of diverse inflammatory disorders. Recent studies have demonstrated that inflammasomes play a vital role in regulating the development and progression of cancer. This review focuses on fate-determining roles of the inflammasomes and the principal downstream effector cytokine, IL-1β, in the tumor microenvironment.

### Assembly-driven activation of the AIM2 foreign-dsDNA sensor provides a polymerization template for downstream ASC [^f13cc0dd]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

AIM2 PYD is required to oligomerize when dsDNA is in excess

When basal AIM2 encounters foreign dsDNA in the cytoplasm, the individual molecules must assemble into the inflammasome even in the presence of excess binding sites (for example, nearly 400,000 binding sites are in the genome of one F. tularensis). To test this idea, we labelled two separate AIM2 FL populations with a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor and acceptor (Fig. 5a, top). As previously observed for full-length IFI16 (ref.), saturating FRET signals were indeed detected from AIM2 FL in a dsDNA size-dependent manner even when the substrate is present in excess (Fig. 5a,b ; Supplementary Table 8). However, unlike IFI16 that required at least 60-bp dsDNA, FRET signals were detected from dsDNA fragments as short as 24 bp, suggesting that the minimal binding unit for AIM2 oligomerization is a dimer compared with a tetramer for IFI16. Consistent with our competition assays (Fig. 2), plotting the normalized binding efficiency versus dsDNA length from the FRET assay data also suggests a cooperative relationship in which the binding affinity of AIM2 FL can increase as much as 1,000-fold when the size of available dsDNA is 10 times longer (the Hill constant is ∼3; Fig. 5c). Labelled AIM2 Hin populations failed to generate FRET signals at 160 mM KCl (Supplementary Fig. 1j,k); however, we detected FRET signals from labelled AIM2 Hin if the salt concentration of the reaction buffer was lowered to 60 mM KCl (Fig. 5d). Nevertheless, unlike AIM2 FL, FRET signals from labelled AIM2 Hin also peaked at the dsDNA concentration equivalent to the amount of AIM2 Hin present in these assays, but decreased with excess dsDNA (Fig. 5d). Also, unlike AIM2 FL, the peak amplitude was correlated with the size of each dsDNA (Fig. 5d). These observations suggest that the AIM2 Hin oligomers are likely different from those assembled AIM2 FL, and that AIM2 PYD is required for robust dsDNA binding and polymerization in the presence of excess dsDNA. In addition, the observed cooperative relationship between dsDNA size and oligomerization activity (Fig. 5c) is consistent not only with our competition experiments (Fig. 2e) but also with the previous in vivo observation, thus further supporting our ‘digital ruler' concept in the regulation of the AIM2 inflammasome.

### Inflammasome components as new therapeutic targets in inflammatory disease [^401078b2]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Inflammation drives pathology in many human diseases for which there are no disease-modifying drugs. Inflammasomes are signalling platforms that can induce pathological inflammation and tissue damage, having potential as an exciting new class of drug targets. Small-molecule inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome that are now in clinical trials have demonstrated proof of concept that inflammasomes are druggable, and so drug development programmes are now focusing on other key inflammasome molecules. In this Review, we describe the potential of inflammasome components as candidate drug targets and the novel inflammasome inhibitors that are being developed. We discuss how the signalling biology of inflammasomes offers mechanistic insights for therapeutic targeting. We also discuss the major scientific and technical challenges associated with drugging these molecules during preclinical development and clinical trials.

### Assembly mechanism of the inflammasome sensor AIM2 revealed by single molecule analysis [^65faf6e3]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The distribution of the number of molecules per oligomer resulting from the analysis of 155 clusters up to ~100 molecules shows that oligomers smaller than 25 molecules are more abundant (Fig. 2a). There is no clear predominance of a specific oligomer size within this range, except for clusters composed of 13–15 molecules being slightly more frequent (Fig. 2b). Within associated errors, these results are in accord with previous studies indicating a preferred oligomer size of 20–24 AIM2 molecules,. The number of molecules in clusters emitting more than 575 photons is only an approximate value as energy transfer processes are happening more pronouncedly than for smaller clusters (Supplementary Fig. 3). The direct visualization of individual oligomers reveals the coexistence of small and large AIM2 clusters bound to dsDNA (Figs. 1 and 2), thus providing additional insight into an all-or-none process previously proposed for AIM2-DNA binding.

AIM2 oligomers attached to a single dsDNA are predominantly smaller than 25 molecules.

a Cluster size distribution based on the number of molecules up to ~100 molecules and b up to 25 molecules (n = 155). Oligomers of 13–15 molecules are slightly more frequent. The number of molecules associated with clusters emitting photon counts in the 575–1500 range (~52–136 molecules) is likely underestimated due to the increased emission at red wavelengths (Supplementary Fig. 3). Values of oligomer size carry propagated error from the photon count analysis. The smallest error of 17% in these measurements (Supplementary Fig. 6) leads to an error in cluster size;, where S is the size of the cluster (i.e. the number of molecules).

### Inflammasome activation in neutrophils of patients with severe COVID-19 [^0ca000cd]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our clinical study shows that in COVID-19 infection, ASC speck is formed in neutrophils, and the percentage of neutrophils showing a speck is similar to that seen in mononuclear cells. Given their wide presence in the blood and lung compared with other types of leukocytes, we can conclude that neutrophils could be the major producers of specks. These findings support the possibility that both neutrophils and monocytes contribute to the cytokine storm through the inflammasome, and in vivo ASC speck detection could serve as an indicator of innate immune system activation. In bacterial sepsis, Cui et al has shown that assessing ASC speck–positive immune cells by flow cytometry could be used as a potential biomarker of patients at risk of death.

Although the assembly of speck, which depends on the initial inflammasome polymerization, was obvious, we could not definitively determine which types of inflammasome were activated. Coimmunostaining of ASC and inflammasome sensors like AIM2, NLRP1, NLRC4, and NLRP3 showed that many of the ASC specks observed in COVID-19 neutrophils colocalized with NLRC4 or NLRP3 staining (supplemental Figure 2; supplemental Table 3). Interestingly, expression quantitative trait loci associated with higher expression of the 2 inflammasome genes NLRC4 and NLRP3 were also significantly linked to severe COVID-19 disease.Under sterile inflammation, NLRP3 was the backbone of speck in murine neutrophils.However, other inflammasome sensor components recently were seen in human neutrophils besides NLRP3.

### Molecular mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation [^ccb93e7f]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The inflammasome is an intracellular multimolecular complex that controls caspase-1 activity in the innate immune system. NLRP3, a member of the NLR family of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, along with the adaptor protein ASC, mediates caspase-1 activation via assembly of the inflammasome in response to various pathogen-derived factors as well as danger-associated molecules. The active NLRP3 inflammasome drives innate immune response towards invading pathogens and cellular damage, and regulates adaptive immune response. Here, we review identified agonists of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the molecular mechanism by which they induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Three signaling pathways involving potassium efflux, generation of reactive oxygen species, and cathepsin B release are discussed.

### NEK7 is an essential mediator of NLRP3 activation downstream of potassium efflux [^886cf29a]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Inflammasomes are intracellular protein complexes that drive the activation of inflammatory caspases. So far, four inflammasomes involving NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4 and AIM2 have been described that recruit the common adaptor protein ASC to activate caspase-1, leading to the secretion of mature IL-1β and IL-18 proteins. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several acquired inflammatory diseases as well as cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndromes (CAPS) caused by inherited NLRP3 mutations. Potassium efflux is a common step that is essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by many stimuli. Despite extensive investigation, the molecular mechanism leading to NLRP3 activation in response to potassium efflux remains unknown. Here we report the identification of NEK7, a member of the family of mammalian NIMA-related kinases (NEK proteins), as an NLRP3-binding protein that acts downstream of potassium efflux to regulate NLRP3 oligomerization and activation. In the absence of NEK7, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release were abrogated in response to signals that activate NLRP3, but not NLRC4 or AIM2 inflammasomes. NLRP3-activating stimuli promoted the NLRP3-NEK7 interaction in a process that was dependent on potassium efflux. NLRP3 associated with the catalytic domain of NEK7, but the catalytic activity of NEK7 was shown to be dispensable for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activated macrophages formed a high-molecular-mass NLRP3-NEK7 complex, which, along with ASC oligomerization and ASC speck formation, was abrogated in the absence of NEK7. NEK7 was required for macrophages containing the CAPS-associated NLRP3(R258W) activating mutation to activate caspase-1. Mouse chimaeras reconstituted with wild-type, Nek7(-/-) or Nlrp3(-/-) haematopoietic cells showed that NEK7 was required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vivo. These studies demonstrate that NEK7 is an essential protein that acts downstream of potassium efflux to mediate NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation.

### The immunomodulatory metabolite itaconate modifies NLRP3 and inhibits inflammasome activation [^80d74b0f]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The Krebs cycle-derived metabolite itaconate is highly upregulated in inflammatory macrophages and exerts immunomodulatory effects through cysteine modifications on target proteins. The NLRP3 inflammasome, which cleaves IL-1β, IL-18, and gasdermin D, must be tightly regulated to avoid excessive inflammation. Here we provide evidence that itaconate modifies NLRP3 and inhibits inflammasome activation. Itaconate and its derivative, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, but not AIM2 or NLRC4. Conversely, NLRP3 activation was increased in itaconate-depleted Irg1 -/- macrophages. 4-OI inhibited the interaction between NLRP3 and NEK7, a key step in the activation process, and "dicarboxypropylated" C548 on NLRP3. Furthermore, 4-OI inhibited NLRP3-dependent IL-1β release from PBMCs isolated from cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) patients, and reduced inflammation in an in vivo model of urate-induced peritonitis. Our results identify itaconate as an endogenous metabolic regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome and describe a process that may be exploited therapeutically to alleviate inflammation in NLRP3-driven disorders.
