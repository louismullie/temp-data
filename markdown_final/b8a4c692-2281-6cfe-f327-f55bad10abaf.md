symptoms of menopause

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of menopause. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how menopause is defined and when symptoms typically begin. Then, I should categorize the symptom domains and quantify their prevalence and time course. Next, I will examine each domain in detail, noting severity, clustering, and special populations. After that, I should review pathophysiology to connect symptoms to mechanisms. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary and highlight key takeaways for practice, making sure I verify each claim against high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and timing, because I need to ensure I'm anchoring symptoms to the correct phase. Menopause is defined retrospectively as 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea, with the average age around 50–51 years, and symptoms often begin in the perimenopausal years before the final menstrual period, which explains why many women experience symptoms before formally meeting menopause criteria [^1139iWPf] [^113H8w8J] [^1138Y254].

> Next, I should categorize the symptom domains so I don't miss anything important. The most consistently reported clusters are vasomotor symptoms, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, sleep disturbance, mood and cognitive changes, and somatic or musculoskeletal complaints, with vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms generally considered the cardinal menopausal symptoms in guidelines and reviews [^1139iWPf] [^114GX9uF] [^113Cy9hz].

> I will now examine vasomotor symptoms, since they are the most common and often the most bothersome. Hot flashes and night sweats occur in up to 80% of women during the menopausal transition, with moderate-to-severe symptoms in roughly 11–46% and a median duration around 7–9 years, and in about one-third of women symptoms persist beyond 10 years; prevalence and severity vary by region, with higher burdens reported in some European cohorts and substantial undertreatment globally [^115YbQnG] [^115q1RCS] [^115q1RCS] [^1139iWPf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sleep and mood being "just hormones". I should double-check the strength of association. Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent during and after the menopausal transition, often characterized by frequent awakenings and prolonged time awake, and they can occur even in the absence of vasomotor symptoms; mood symptoms, including depressive symptoms and anxiety, increase in some women during the transition, with a recognized window of vulnerability, though not all women are affected and prior history is a key risk factor [^112xyLQA] [^114WHzb9] [^114JTKhf] [^1163ft8p].

> Let me consider genitourinary syndrome of menopause carefully, because I need to distinguish it from transient symptoms. GSM affects about 40–60% of postmenopausal women and is typically progressive without treatment, presenting with vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, irritation, and urinary symptoms such as urgency and frequency; importantly, urinary symptoms overlap with other common urologic conditions like overactive bladder, complicating diagnosis and underscoring the need for a symptom-driven, case-finding approach [^116uyown] [^1139iWPf] [^112TJUNH].

> I should confirm the somatic and musculoskeletal complaints next. Joint and muscle aches are commonly reported and can cluster with other symptoms; fatigue and reduced energy are also frequent and can compound sleep and mood complaints, contributing to quality-of-life impairment during the transition [^1139iWPf] [^114GX9uF].

> But wait, what if symptom expression differs in special populations? I need to check that. Women with HIV report high burdens of menopausal symptoms, with joint pain, exhaustion, sleep problems, and hot flashes commonly co-occurring; cancer survivors, particularly those with treatment-induced menopause, often experience more severe and persistent vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms; and women with premature ovarian insufficiency or early menopause may have more pronounced symptoms and long-term health risks, warranting proactive screening and management [^115ty8Yn] [^116oFS9n] [^115wWLmZ] [^1165eqt2].

> Next, I should review pathophysiology to ensure mechanistic plausibility. The proximate cause is ovarian follicular depletion with falling estradiol and progesterone, which destabilizes hypothalamic thermoregulatory circuits and contributes to vasomotor symptoms; estrogen withdrawal also thins vaginal and urethral tissues and alters lower urinary tract function, while neurobiologic changes involving kisspeptin–neurokinin B–dynorphin pathways likely integrate reproductive, thermoregulatory, sleep–wake, and mood circuits, explaining symptom clustering and persistence in some women [^1149FNSf] [^112xyLQA] [^116M6Lgb].

> I should double-check the time course and clustering, because this affects counseling. Vasomotor symptoms typically peak around one year after the final menstrual period and can last a median of 7–9 years, with a subset persisting beyond a decade; genitourinary symptoms tend to be progressive and do not remit spontaneously; sleep and mood symptoms often co-occur with vasomotor symptoms but can also arise independently; and symptom clusters such as sleep disturbance, fatigue, and anxiety can exert disproportionate effects on quality of life, especially in perimenopausal women who are often employed and caregiving [^1139iWPf] [^115YbQnG] [^112MpUsw] [^114GX9uF].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary, and I will verify each element against the best sources as I go. Most women experience menopausal symptoms, with vasomotor symptoms affecting up to 80% and moderate-to-severe symptoms in 11–46%; genitourinary symptoms affect 40–60% and worsen without treatment; sleep disturbance is common and impactful even without night sweats; mood and cognitive complaints increase in a subset, particularly with prior history; somatic aches and fatigue are frequent; symptom duration commonly spans 7–9 years and can exceed 10 years in about one-third; and prevalence and severity vary by geography, race/ethnicity, and clinical context, with substantial undertreatment worldwide [^115YbQnG] [^116uyown] [^112xyLQA] [^1149FNSf] [^116UDniw].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical takeaways are explicit and actionable. First, screen proactively for vasomotor, genitourinary, sleep, mood, and somatic symptoms at each midlife visit because women often underreport. Second, anticipate symptom clusters and their additive impact on quality of life. Third, individualize management using shared decision-making, considering age, time since menopause, cardiovascular and breast risk, and patient preferences. Fourth, remember that GSM symptoms are progressive and warrant treatment if bothersome. And fifth, recognize special populations such as women with HIV, cancer survivors, and those with early menopause who may have higher burdens and distinct risk–benefit considerations [^1139iWPf] [^114dJzZq] [^115wWLmZ] [^1165eqt2].

Menopause symptoms are driven by **estrogen decline** [^1149FNSf] and typically begin in perimenopause, often persisting for years after menopause [^115YbQnG]. The most common are **vasomotor symptoms** (hot flashes, night sweats) [^115YbQnG], genitourinary symptoms (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, urinary urgency/frequency) [^114dJzZq], sleep disturbances, mood changes, and cognitive complaints ("brain fog") [^11657yuS]. Symptoms vary in severity and duration [^116M6Lgb]; about 80% of women experience vasomotor symptoms [^115YbQnG], which can last a median of 7–9 years and, in some, beyond 10 years [^115YbQnG]. Management should be **individualized**, with hormone therapy as the most effective option for vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms when appropriate [^115TEqN9], and nonhormonal therapies for those who cannot or prefer not to use hormones [^116waCcN].

---

## Vasomotor symptoms

Vasomotor symptoms are the **hallmark of menopause** [^113Cy9hz], occurring in up to 80% of women [^115YbQnG] and often persisting for several years [^115q1RCS].

- **Hot flashes**: Sudden sensations of heat, often accompanied by sweating and flushing, typically lasting 1–5 minutes [^notfound].
- **Night sweats**: Hot flashes occurring during sleep, often causing significant sleep disruption [^112xyLQA].
- **Duration**: Median duration is 7–9 years, with about one-third experiencing symptoms beyond 10 years [^115YbQnG].

---

## Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)

GSM results from estrogen deficiency and affects approximately 40–60% of postmenopausal women [^116uyown], with symptoms that are **progressive without treatment** [^1163783f].

- **Vaginal dryness**: Thinning and dryness of vaginal tissues, often causing irritation and discomfort [^114dJzZq].
- **Dyspareunia**: Painful intercourse due to vaginal dryness and atrophy [^116waCcN].
- **Urinary symptoms**: Urgency, frequency, and recurrent urinary tract infections [^114dJzZq].

---

## Sleep disturbances

Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent during menopause, often related to vasomotor symptoms but also occurring independently [^114WHzb9]. Manifestations include **insomnia** — difficulty falling or staying asleep, frequent awakenings, and poor sleep quality [^112xyLQA] — and **daytime fatigue**, with reduced energy and tiredness impacting daily functioning [^notfound].

---

## Mood and cognitive symptoms

Hormonal fluctuations during menopause can significantly affect mood and cognition [^11657yuS]. Common features include **mood changes** — irritability, anxiety, and depressive symptoms — and **cognitive complaints**, often described as "brain fog", including difficulties with memory, concentration, and attention [^11657yuS].

---

## Somatic symptoms

Many women experience physical symptoms during the menopausal transition, including **joint and muscle pain**, stiffness, and aches, particularly in the morning [^116oFS9n], and **weight gain**, especially increased abdominal fat and changes in body composition [^1139iWPf].

---

## Variability in symptom experience

The experience of menopausal symptoms varies widely among women, influenced by factors such as age, ethnicity, lifestyle, and overall health [^116M6Lgb]. For example, **ethnic variation** shows that African American women report more frequent and severe vasomotor symptoms, while Asian women generally report fewer symptoms [^114mD7F9]. Additionally, **lifestyle factors** such as smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity are associated with increased symptom severity [^1149FNSf].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management of menopausal symptoms requires individualized care, considering symptom severity, patient preferences, and medical history [^117D87TK]. Options include **hormone therapy** — the most effective treatment for vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms, with favorable benefit-risk balance for women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause [^115TEqN9] — and **nonhormonal therapies**, including SSRIs, SNRIs, gabapentin, and cognitive behavioral therapy for vasomotor symptoms, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants for genitourinary symptoms [^116waCcN].

---

Menopause symptoms are diverse and vary widely among women, significantly impacting quality of life. Effective management involves **individualized care**, with hormone therapy as the most effective option for many symptoms, and nonhormonal therapies for those who cannot or prefer not to use hormones [^1139iWPf].

Guideline scope and shared decision-making for menopausal symptom therapy: This guideline covers the full spectrum of therapies for relief of the most common and bothersome menopausal symptoms, while the detailed management of early menopause transition, primary ovarian insufficiency, and prevention of osteoporosis and fracture are considered beyond the current scope. Choice of therapy is ideally based on available evidence regarding safety and efficacy and is generally a shared decision including both patient and provider, and the treatment selected should be tailored to the individual patient and will vary according to each woman's symptom severity, age, medical profile, personal preference, and estimated benefit/risk ratio. An accepted philosophy is that a fully informed patient should be empowered to make a decision that best balances individual QOL benefits against potential health risks.

### Management of perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms [^1139iWPf]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Most women worldwide experience menopausal symptoms during the menopause transition or postmenopause. Vasomotor symptoms are most pronounced during the first four to seven years but can persist for more than a decade, and genitourinary symptoms tend to be progressive. Although the hallmark symptoms are hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, and genitourinary discomfort, other common symptoms and conditions are mood fluctuations, cognitive changes, low sexual desire, bone loss, increase in abdominal fat, and adverse changes in metabolic health. These symptoms and signs can occur in any combination or sequence, and the link to menopause may even be elusive. Estrogen based hormonal therapies are the most effective treatments for many of the symptoms and, in the absence of contraindications to treatment, have a generally favorable benefit:risk ratio for women below age 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause. Non-hormonal treatment options are also available. Although a symptom driven treatment approach with individualized decision making can improve health and quality of life for midlife women, menopausal symptoms remain substantially undertreated by healthcare providers.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and menopausal symptoms [^11112nGf]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

A majority of women will experience bothersome symptoms related to declining and/or fluctuating levels of estrogen during their menopausal transition. Vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, poor sleep, and depressed mood have all been found to worsen during the menopausal transition. While vasomotor symptoms gradually improve after menopause, the time course can be many years. Vaginal dryness does not improve without treatment, while the long-term course of sleep and mood deterioration is not clearly defined at this time. A small minority of women have vasomotor symptoms that persist throughout the remainder of their lives. These common menopausal symptoms all improve with estrogen treatment. Over the last 10 years, we have witnessed a dramatic reduction in enthusiasm for menopausal hormone therapy, despite its high efficacy relative to other treatments. We have also seen the emergence of sound, evidence-based clinical trials of non-hormonal alternatives that can control the common menopausal symptoms. Understanding the natural history of menopausal symptoms, and the risks and benefits of both hormonal and non-hormonal alternatives, helps the clinician individualize management plans to improve quality of life.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^114JTKhf]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

There is little doubt that women experience a heightened psychiatric morbidity compared to men. A growing body of evidence suggests that, for some women, the menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years may represent a period of vulnerability associated with an increased risk of experiencing symptoms of depression, or for the development of an episode of major depressive disorder. Recent research has begun to shed some light on potential mechanisms that influence this vulnerability. At the same time, a number of studies and clinical trials conducted over the past decade have provided important data regarding efficacy and safety of preventative measures and treatment strategies for midlife women; some of these studies have caused a shift in the current thinking of how menopausal symptoms should be appropriately managed. Essentially, most women will progress from premenopausal into postmenopausal years without developing significant depressive symptoms. However, those with prior history of depression may face a re-emergence of depression during this transition while others may experience a first episode of depression in their lives. Here I provide an overview of what is known about risk factors for depression and the risk posed by the menopausal transition, its associated symptoms, and the underlying changes in the reproductive hormonal milieu, discussing the evidence for the occurrence of mood symptoms in midlife women and the challenges that face clinicians and health professionals who care for this population.

### Optimising health after early menopause [^1165eqt2]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The typical age at menopause is 50–51 years in high-income countries. However, early menopause is common, with around 8% of women in high-income countries and 12% of women globally experiencing menopause between the ages of 40 years and 44 years. Menopause before age 40 years (premature ovarian insufficiency) affects an additional 2–4% of women. Both early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency can herald an increased risk of chronic disease, including osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. People who enter menopause at younger ages might also experience distress and feel less supported than those who reach menopause at the average age. Clinical practice guidelines are available for the diagnosis and management of premature ovarian insufficiency, but there is a gap in clinical guidance for early menopause. We argue that instead of distinct age thresholds being applied, early menopause should be seen on a spectrum between premature ovarian insufficiency and menopause at the average age. This Series paper presents evidence for the short-term and long-term consequences of early menopause. We offer a practical framework for clinicians to guide diagnosis and management of early menopause, which considers the nature and severity of symptoms, age and medical history, and the individual's wishes and priorities to optimise their quality of life and short-term and long-term health. We conclude with recommendations for future research to address key gaps in the current evidence.

### Menopausal symptoms and their management [^113Ta1xv]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The menopause transition is associated with various symptoms, which can interact to produce morbidity. Vasomotor symptoms are the most commonly reported, but vaginal dryness/dyspareunia, sleep difficulties and adverse mood changes have all been shown to worsen as women approach menopause. For postmenopausal women changes in cognition are more likely to be related to aging and not to hormones. This article reviews the symptoms of hot flashes (vasomotor symptoms), vaginal dryness/dyspareunia, adverse mood, poor sleep/insomnia, and cognitive complaints, describing their epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. This article thus reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of these common menopausal symptoms.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^111pUBBb]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Robust epidemiologic evidence supports the existence of a 'window of vulnerability' for the occurrence of depression (new onset or recurrent) during the menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years. Similar to that observed in other periods in life, antidepressants and psychotherapies continue to be the treatments of choice for depression occurring in midlife women. Nonetheless, accumulated preclinical and clinical data support the benefits of estrogen-based therapies to improve mood and other menopause-related symptoms during this critical window. As such, estrogen should be considered part of the treatment armamentarium for depression, along with other well established benefits (for example, for vasomotor, sexual and other menopause-related complaints). Lastly, the use of specific screening and diagnostic tools for depression in women should help physicians and health professionals to improve early detection and clinical management. Ultimately, treatment strategies should be tailored and incorporate all the resources available to reduce the significant burden and functional impairment associated with depression in women undergoing menopause.

### Management of menopausal symptoms: a review [^1149FNSf]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on menopause:

- **Definition**: Menopause is defined as the natural biological process in women that signifies the permanent end of menstruation and fertility.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of menopause is primarily related to the depletion of ovarian follicles, which leads to decreased production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. This hormonal change triggers the various symptoms associated with menopause.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of menopause-related vasomotor symptoms differs across geographic regions: estimated at 46% in North America, 45–69% in Latin America, 74% in Europe, and 22–63% in Asia.
- **Risk factors**: Several risk factors are associated with more severe menopausal symptoms. These include a history of depression, certain lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity, and undergoing premature or surgical menopause.
- **Disease course**: Menopause is characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations. The most common symptoms include vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats, genitourinary symptoms like vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, and mood changes.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of menopause is generally favorable, the symptoms eventually subside without intervention.

### Managing menopausal symptoms: common questions and answers [^116waCcN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal symptoms are widespread and significantly impact quality of life. Common symptoms of menopause are vasomotor (i.e., hot flashes and night sweats) and genitourinary (e.g., vulvovaginal irritation and dryness, dyspareunia, urinary problems), although women may also experience changes in sexual function, mood, and sleep. Estrogen-containing hormone therapy is effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms. Nonhormonal medications for vasomotor symptoms include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentin. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should not be administered to women taking tamoxifen. Cognitive behavior therapy and clinical hypnosis are effective for short-term reduction of vasomotor symptoms and associated sleep disturbances, but data are lacking to support the effectiveness of other nonpharmacologic treatments such as herbal or botanicalsupplements, exercise, and acupuncture. Hormone-free vaginal moisturizers are noninferior to estrogen-based therapies for treating genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Other treatment options for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with menopause include ospemifene and intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone. Management of menopausal symptoms should involve shared decision-making that is informed by the best available evidence and individual risks and preferences.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^114dJzZq]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU/AUGS Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) guideline — GSM describes the spectrum of symptoms and physical changes resulting from declining estrogen and androgen concentrations in the genitourinary tract during the menopausal transition, and there has not been a consensus reached about the number or type of symptoms needed to diagnose GSM nor a requirement for identifying concurrent physical signs. Urinary symptoms associated with GSM are also linked with other common urologic conditions in older patients, such as overactive bladder, making identification, evaluation, and treatment complex. The guideline provides information to clinicians regarding identification, diagnosis, counseling, and treatment for patients with GSM to optimize symptom control and quality of life while minimizing adverse events, states that strategies were derived from evidence-based and consensus-based processes, and notes that shared decision-making is the optimal strategy to individualize level of impact and ultimate interventions. It emphasizes outreach to the marginalized and underserved GSM population and aims to give clinicians across a multitude of disciplines the tools to evaluate, manage, and treat GSM patients.

### Acute consequences of the menopausal transition: the rise of common menopausal symptoms [^1159dvhx]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

More than 80% of women experience psychologic or physical symptoms in the late reproductive years, with varying degrees of severity and disruption in their lives. Patients and clinicians have misconceptions about what changes are considered "normal" or"abnormal" during this period. Of importance to clinicians, large-scale longitudinal studies recently have been conducted to better characterize and explore changes during this period. This article re-views the current evidence regarding the acute symptoms of the menopausal transition, including vasomotor symptoms, mood changes, sleep problems, and changes in sexual functioning.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113fU5gr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this document is to generate a practice guideline for the management and treatment of symptoms of the menopause.

Participants

The Treatment of Symptoms of the Menopause Task Force included six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer, all appointed by The Endocrine Society.

Evidence

The Task Force developed this evidenced-based guideline using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned three systematic reviews of published data and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials.

Consensus Process

Multiple e-mail communications, conference calls, and one face-to-face meeting determined consensus. Committees of The Endocrine Society, representatives from endorsing societies, and members of The Endocrine Society reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines. The Australasian Menopause Society, the British Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, the European Society of Endocrinology, and the International Menopause Society (co-sponsors of the guideline) reviewed and commented on the draft.

Conclusions

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric. Benefits may exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference. They should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. Other options are available for those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications because these patients should not use MHT. Low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### Variation in outcome reporting and measurement tools in clinical trials of treatments for genitourinary symptoms in peri-and postmenopausal women: a systematic review [^116uyown]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance

Genitourinary symptoms affect 40% to 60% of postmenopausal women. Evidence-based approaches to diagnosing and managing these symptoms are limited by inconsistencies in outcomes and measures used in clinical trials.

Objective

The aim of the study was to systematically review all outcomes and measurement tools reported in randomized clinical trials of interventions for genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause.

Evidence Review

We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to December 2018. Randomized controlled trials with a primary or secondary outcome of genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, English language, and sample size of 20 or more women per study arm were included. Study characteristics, outcomes, and measurement methods were collected.

Findings

The search yielded 3,478 articles of which 109 met inclusion criteria. Forty-eight different outcomes were reported with "atrophy" as the most common (56/109, 51%) followed by measures of sexual function (19/109, 17%). Almost all (108/109, 99%) trials included patient-reported measures, with 21 different measures and 39 symptom combinations. Clinician-reported scales of vulvovaginal appearance were used in 36 of 109 (33%) trials, with extensive variation in what was measured and reported. Cytological measures from the vaginal epithelium were the most commonly used objective tools (76/109, 70%).

Conclusions and Relevance

There is heterogeneity in reported outcomes and measures used in clinical trials of treatments for genitourinary symptoms at menopause and uncertainty as to which outcomes best reflect patient priorities and symptoms. The findings from this systematic review have informed an international survey of stakeholders to determine priorities for outcome selection and reporting. This survey will then inform the development of a Core Outcome Set for use in future clinical trials by the COMMA (Core OutcoMes in MenopAuse) consortium.: Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A599.

### Sleep disturbance associated with the menopause [^112xyLQA]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objectives

Sleep disturbance is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms experienced by women during the menopause transition. However, there are currently no therapies specifically approved for sleep disturbance associated with the menopause. Here, we consider how to characterize sleep disturbance associated with the menopause and discuss its etiology, including the latest advances in our understanding of the neuronal circuits that regulate reproduction, body temperature, sleep, and mood; and reflect on its impact on women's health and well-being. We also examine the current treatment landscape and look to the future of treatment for this condition.

Methods

We conducted a review of the literature and combined this with discussion with experts in the fields of sleep and menopause as well as experiences from our own clinical practices.

Discussion and Conclusions

Sleep disturbance associated with the menopause is characterized by frequent night-time awakenings and increased awake time after sleep onset. Its impacts are wide-ranging, negatively affecting health as well as personal and social relationships, productivity, and work performance. There is currently an unmet need for effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatments to address this important symptom, and wider recognition of the association between sleep disturbances and the menopause is needed. Sleep disturbances associated with the menopause can result from hormone changes as well as vasomotor and mood symptoms. Growing research has contributed to our knowledge of the role of hypothalamic estrogen-sensitive kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin neurons. These neurons are thought to integrate the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pathway and the pathways responsible for the homeostatic control of body temperature and the circadian regulation of sleep-wake cycles. Understanding these neurons offers the potential to create treatments that target a key cause of sleep disturbance associated with the menopause. Further research to understand their etiology and characterize the neuronal circuits responsible could benefit the development of these targeted treatment approaches.

### Efficacy and safety of fezolinetant for moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy: phase 3b randomised controlled trial [^115q1RCS]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vasomotor symptoms, comprising hot flushes and night sweats, are the most common and bothersome symptoms associated with menopause. Up to 80% of women experience vasomotor symptoms during menopause. Moderate-severe symptoms occur in 11–46% of women older than 40 years, with a median total duration around 7.4 years, whereas the severity of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause varies throughout the course of menopause and among women.

Although vasomotor symptoms are common and often severe enough to warrant medical treatment, approved and effective non-hormonal treatments are limited. Hormone therapy is effective but not appropriate for everyone. Treatment is contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer, uterine cancer, active liver disease, or thromboembolic diseases, and caution is advised in those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and raised triglyceride levels. Hormone therapy is not suitable for many women, and some choose not to use it.

### Menopause [^113Cy9hz]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Menopause is the time of life when menstrual cycles cease, and is caused by reduced secretion of the ovarian hormones oestrogen and progesterone. Although menopause is a normal event for women, individual experiences vary, and some women seek medical advice for the management of symptoms. Many symptoms have been attributed to menopause, but only vasomotor dysfunction and vaginal dryness are consistently associated with this time of life in epidemiological studies. Other common symptoms such as mood changes, sleep disturbances, urinary incontinence, cognitive changes, somatic complaints, sexual dysfunction, and reduced quality of life may be secondary to other symptoms, or related to other causes. Trials of therapies for vasomotor dysfunction have shown improvements with oestrogen, gabapentin, paroxetine, and clonidine, but little or no benefit with other agents; adverse effects of these treatments must also be considered. Many questions about menopausal transition and its effects on health have not been adequately addressed.

### Menopause in multiple sclerosis: therapeutic considerations [^111PaG2k]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

While the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) typically occurs during the childbearing years, many women living with MS are of perimenopausal age. There is frequent overlap between menopausal and MS-related symptoms and co-morbidities (e.g. sexual dysfunction, mood disorders and bladder function). Furthermore, some MS symptoms may be exacerbated by perimenopausal changes such as hot flashes or sleep disturbance. The MS neurologist may frequently be the first to become aware of these symptoms and to play a role in monitoring and managing them. In this review, we describe immunological and neurologic changes at menopause as they may impact MS. We then review common symptoms, including fatigue, depression, sexual function, pain and insomnia, and provide both behavioral and pharmacological suggestions for their management. Next, we discuss the need for osteoporosis and cancer screening in perimenopausal women with MS. Finally, we highlight important research gaps, including what effect, if any, the menopausal transition may play on MS disease course as well as the potential modulatory role of hormone replacement therapies.

### Vasomotor symptoms in menopause: where we' ve been and where we' re going [^113yyVpJ]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

The decline in gonadal hormones during menopause gives rise to a wide range of physiological and psychological changes with the potential to significantly impact a woman's health and quality of life. Most notable among these are menopausal vasomotor symptoms, hot flushes and night sweats, along with mood and sleep disturbances. Given the biological and social significance of menopause, it is remarkable that the language used to describe this event and its associated symptoms is inconsistent. This review traces the history of Western medical writing about menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms and considers how terminology has contributed to the current confusion regarding symptoms and symptom reporting. Although hormone therapy is the only treatment for menopausal symptoms currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, other forms of therapy are under evaluation. Agreement about the definition of menopause and its associated symptoms is critically important for the design and evaluation of new therapies and for the optimal treatment of women during this important phase of their lives.

### Onset of the menopause transition: the earliest signs and symptoms [^112xJQ2f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Although more than 80% of women experience some degree of psychological or physical symptoms around menopause, both women and clinicians have misconceptions about how hormonal changes relate to menopausal symptoms and psychological conditions. Recently, several large-scale, longitudinal studies have been conducted to better characterize symptoms and changes that occur around menopause. This article offers current evidence for symptoms that occur in the early menopause transition, including vasomotor symptoms, mood changes, sleep problems, and changes in sexual functioning.

A clear understanding of the physiology of the menopausal transition, clinical symptoms, and physical changes is essential for individualized patient management, maximizing benefits and minimizing risks for the present and the future. Menopause, defined by amenorrhea for 12 consecutive months, is determined retrospectively and represents a permanent end to menses. Many physical changes occur during the menopausal transition and beyond. Knowledge of symptoms and findings experienced by women undergoing the menopausal transition allow individualized care- improving quality of life and enhancing wellbeing for years to come.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — menopausal symptoms epidemiology and definition — notes that menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation after the loss of ovarian activity and cannot be determined to have occurred until 1 year after the last menstrual period; in North America, the median age of menopause is 51 years. Vasomotor and vaginal symptoms are identified as cardinal symptoms of menopause, with vasomotor symptoms reported in 50–82% of U.S. women who experience natural menopause, and occurrence increases during the transition and peaks approximately 1 year after the final menstrual period.

### Menopause and the workplace: consensus recommendations from the menopause society [^111SpHtu]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Menopause is a natural life transition experienced by half the world's population. Women aged 50 years and older are the fastest growing demographic group in many countries, making essential contributions to the workforce. Although menopause is a universal and natural life transition, the symptom experience is highly variable among women. Some women may experience few or no symptoms, whereas others may be bothered by moderate to severe symptoms for a decade or longer, which can adversely affect quality of life, relationships, job satisfaction, and career advancement. Indeed, menopause symptoms, including vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms, as well as sleep and mood disturbances are associated with multiple adverse work outcomes. Studies to date have demonstrated that these adverse work outcomes related to menopause symptoms include a compromised ability to work, reduced work productivity, absenteeism, and even loss of employment or an early exit from the workforce. Further, the relationship between menopause symptoms and work may be bidirectional, with certain aspects of the work environment being linked with a greater menopause symptom burden, such as insufficient restroom facilities, unpredictable or long work hours, the inability to take breaks, and confined or crowded workspaces. Thus, workplace solutions may need to be tailored based on women's individual needs, the work environment, and the type of work. The Menopause Society, in conjunction with an expert panel of medical and legal experts and women's health advocates, has developed a set of consensus recommendations that challenges employers to create a menopause-supportive workplace for their employees. These recommendations include, among other things, suggestions for employers to review policies and healthcare plans and benefits and to consider flexibility and accommodations that may be needed for some women with menopause symptoms. Guidance for women with menopause symptoms that affect them at work in terms of understanding their resources and empowering them to be self-advocates are also provided, as well as recommendations for what occupational health professionals should know and do for women with bothersome menopause symptoms in the workplace.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) research and standardization priorities — Future studies would be strengthened by a standard definition and uniform diagnostic criteria for GSM, a common set of validated outcome measures and reporting standards, and attention to clinically relevant populations and intervention comparisons. Long-term follow-up for efficacy, tolerability, and safety represents a critical gap needed to guide treatment longer than one year, and mandated within the framework of definitions would be standardized reporting for AE associated with treatments, or lack thereof, for patients with GSM. Qualitative studies of the patient perspective on GSM have identified themes including: the need for education on medical conditions including successful management, concerns on potential side effects, interest in alternative therapies, and needing support for and validation of GSM and GSM symptoms from health care clinicians, and overcoming patient-centered barriers to common treatments is critical for driving both compliance and policy.

Some women experience bothersome symptoms around the time of menopause that may have a negative impact on their quality of life and prompt them to seek treatments. Menopausal hormone therapy was historically the treatment of choice. However, medical contraindications and personal preference for nonhormonal therapy have prompted the evaluation of a range of nonhormonal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies. This review provides an update focusing on the latest evidence-based approach for the management of bothersome symptoms of menopause.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 141: management of menopausal symptoms [^115qwheY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Vasomotor and vaginal symptoms are cardinal symptoms of menopause. Vasomotor symptoms can be particularly troubling to women and are the most commonly reported menopausal symptoms, with a reported prevalence of 50–82% among U.S. women who experience natural menopause (1, 2). The occurrence of vasomotor symptoms increases during the transition to menopause and peaks approximately 1 year after the final menstrual period (3–5). The purpose of this document is to provide evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of vasomotor and vaginal symptoms related to natural and surgical menopause.

### Practical clinical guidelines for assessing and managing menopausal symptoms after breast cancer [^113K8Hp1]. Annals of Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to provide practical, evidence-based guidelines for evaluating and treating common menopausal symptoms following breast cancer.

Methods

Literature review of the causes, assessment and management of menopausal symptoms in breast cancer patients.

Results

A number of nonhormonal treatments are effective in treating hot flashes. Whether pharmacological treatment is given will depend on the severity of symptoms and on patient wishes. For severe and frequent hot flashes, the best data support the use of venlafaxine, paroxetine and gabapentin in women with breast cancer. Side-effects are relatively common with all these agents. For vaginal dryness, topical estrogen treatment is the most effective but the safety of estrogens following breast cancer is not established. There are limited data on effective treatments for sexual dysfunction during menopause.

Conclusion

Menopausal symptoms after breast cancer should be evaluated and managed as warranted using a systematic approach and may benefit from multidisciplinary input.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) evidence and selection — In postmenopausal women, estrogen therapy (ET) improves menopause-associated symptoms and "reduces menopause-related bone loss, lowers the risk of fragility fractures in older women, and reduces the incidence of self-reported diabetes", and combined estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT) "reduced the risk of colorectal cancer and, in cumulative follow-up of the WHI, endometrial cancer". MHT "is not appropriate for all symptomatic menopausal women", and "there are no commonly recognized lists of absolute or relative contraindications to MHT as published in professional society guidelines", although "US product labeling (regulated by the FDA) does include contraindications to MHT… [and] caution is also advised for women with certain additional medical conditions". Women with conditions precluding MHT, those "who are unwilling to take MHT, or at substantial risk for breast cancer or CVD, can consider nonhormonal options for symptom relief".

### Exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms [^113LaY5E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that many perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women will experience menopausal symptoms; hot flushes are the most common. Symptoms caused by fluctuating levels of oestrogen may be alleviated by hormone therapy (HT), but a marked global decline in its use has resulted from concerns about the risks and benefits of HT. Consequently, many women are seeking alternatives. As large numbers of women are choosing not to take HT, it is increasingly important to identify evidence-based lifestyle modifications that have the potential to reduce vasomotor menopausal symptoms.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of any type of exercise intervention in the management of vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Search Methods

Searches of the following electronic bibliographic databases were performed to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Wiley Internet interface), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), the Science Citation Index and the Social Science Citation Index (Web of Science), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (Ovid) and SPORTDiscus. Searches include findings up to 3 March 2014.

Selection Criteria

RCTs in which any type of exercise intervention was compared with no treatment/control or other treatments in the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal/postmenopausal women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Five studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. Two review authors independently selected the studies, and three review authors independently extracted the data. The primary review outcome was vasomotor symptoms, defined as hot flushes and/or night sweats. We combined data to calculate standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for main comparisons using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (733 women) comparing exercise with no active treatment, exercise with yoga and exercise with HT. The evidence was of low quality: Limitations in study design were noted, along with inconsistency and imprecision. In the comparison of exercise versus no active treatment (three studies, n = 454 women), no evidence was found of a difference between groups in frequency or intensity of vasomotor symptoms (SMD -0.10, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.13, three RCTs, 454 women, I(2) = 30%, low-quality evidence). Nor was any evidence found of a difference between groups in the frequency or intensity of vasomotor symptoms when exercise was compared with yoga (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.38, two studies, n = 279 women, I(2) = 61%, low-quality evidence). It was not possible to include one of the trials in the meta-analyses; this trial compared three groups: exercise plus soy milk, soy milk only and control; results favoured exercise relative to the comparators, but study numbers were small. One trial compared exercise with HT, and the HT group reported significantly fewer flushes in 24 hours than the exercise group (mean difference 5.8, 95% CI 3.17 to 8.43, 14 participants). None of the trials found evidence of a difference between groups with respect to adverse effects, but data were very scanty.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence was insufficient to show whether exercise is an effective treatment for vasomotor menopausal symptoms. One small study suggested that HT is more effective than exercise. Evidence was insufficient to show the relative effectiveness of exercise when compared with HT or yoga.

### Perimenopause: from research to practice [^1176wCPP]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

The menopausal transition, or perimenopause, is associated with profound reproductive and hormonal changes. These changes have been well chronicled and matched with concomitant symptoms. The pattern of appearance of menopausal symptoms and their natural history have become increasingly clear thanks to the conduct of several long-term, longitudinal cohort studies that have examined many aspects of women's biology and psychology through this time of life. Menopausal symptoms are highly prevalent; they are sufficiently bothersome to drive almost 90% of women to seek out their healthcare provider for advice on how to cope. (1) The classic symptom of menopause is the hot flash, which is experienced by most women, and is moderately to severely problematic for about 1/3 of women. While most women will have an experience of hot flashes limited to just a year or two, others will experience them for a decade or more, and a small proportion of women will never be free of them. Poor sleep becomes more common in perimenopausal women not only in association with the menopausal transition but also in relation to aging. Depressed mood and increased anxiety also increase during the transition, with an abrupt rise in prevalence as women approach the later stages of the menopausal transition and have longer bouts of amenorrhea. These common symptoms often interact with one another such that depressed women tend to experience worse hot flashes along with worse sleep. As women enter the latter stages of the transition, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia also become more likely, affecting about 1/3 of the population. Unlike hot flashes, mood issues, and sleep, vaginal symptoms will not go away without treatment. Clinical approaches to these problems often involve hormone therapy, which can be safely given to most perimenopausal women on a short-term basis. Therapeutic strategies that are nonhormonal and behavioral can also be deployed.

### "Extracts from "Clinical evidence": menopausal symptoms [^113H8w8J]. BMJ (2000). Excellent credibility.

Definition

Menopause begins one year after the last menstrual period. Symptoms often begin in the perimenopausal years. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE: In the United Kingdom the mean age for the menopause is 50 years 9 months. The median onset of the perimenopause is between 45.5 and 47.5 years. One Scottish survey (of 6096 women aged 45 to 54 years) found that 84% had experienced at least one of the classic menopausal symptoms, with 45% finding one or more symptoms a problem. AETIOLOGY/RISK FACTORS: Urogenital symptoms of menopause are caused by decreased oestrogen concentrations, but the cause of vasomotor symptoms and psychological effects is complex and remains unclear.

Prognosis

Menopause is a physiological event. Its timing may be genetically determined. Although endocrine changes are permanent, menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, which are experienced by about 70% of women, usually resolve with time. However, some symptoms, such as genital atrophy, may remain the same or worsen.

Aims

To reduce or prevent menopausal symptoms, and to improve quality of life with minimum adverse effects.

Outcomes

Frequency and severity of vasomotor, urogenital, and psychological symptoms; quality of life.

Methods

Clinical Evidence search and appraisal December 1999. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews that met Clinical Evidence quality criteria.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — diagnosis of menopause: We suggest diagnosing menopause based on the clinical criteria of the menstrual cycle. If establishing a diagnosis of menopause is necessary for patient management in women having undergone a hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy or presenting with a menstrual history that is inadequate to ascertain menopausal status, we suggest making a presumptive diagnosis of menopause based on the presence of VMS and, when indicated, laboratory testing that includes replicate measures of FSH and serum estradiol. Table 1 summarizes other etiologies of secondary amenorrhea to be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### Defining the menopausal transition [^1121F7Lr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Menopause signifies the permanent cessation of ovarian function and the end of a woman's reproductive potential. A universal experience in women's aging, it is the culmination of some 50 years of reproductive aging — a process that unfolds as a continuum from birth through ovarian senescence to the menopausal transition and the postmenopause. The menopausal transition is known to play a major role in the etiology of many symptoms common in middle age and may contribute to chronic conditions and disorders of aging such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying ovarian senescence and the occurrence of various short- and long-term biological and psychological sequelae are poorly understood. Progress in researching reproductive aging and the menopause has been impeded by the lack of a staging system based on meaningful, reliable, and objective criteria for staging reproductive aging and specifying menopause-related status. Current nomenclature is described and its limitations are discussed. Specifically, contemporary terminology lacks the sensitivity and specificity needed to operationally define a woman's reproductive status in the continuum of reproductive aging. A number of proposed staging systems are currently being evaluated for their suitability in identifying appropriate demarcations across the span of reproductive aging. Further research and a better understanding of the menopausal transition are necessary to establish the validity, practicality, and acceptability of these proposed staging systems.

### Managing menopause after cancer [^115wWLmZ]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Globally, 9 million women are diagnosed with cancer each year. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, followed by colorectal cancer in high-income countries and cervical cancer in low-income countries. Survival from cancer is improving and more women are experiencing long-term effects of cancer treatment, such as premature ovarian insufficiency or early menopause. Managing menopausal symptoms after cancer can be challenging, and more severe than at natural menopause. Menopausal symptoms can extend beyond hot flushes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms). Treatment-induced symptoms might include sexual dysfunction and impairment of sleep, mood, and quality of life. In the long term, premature ovarian insufficiency might increase the risk of chronic conditions such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Diagnosing menopause after cancer can be challenging as menopausal symptoms can overlap with other common symptoms in patients with cancer, such as fatigue and sexual dysfunction. Menopausal hormone therapy is an effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and seems to be safe for many patients with cancer. When hormone therapy is contraindicated or avoided, emerging evidence supports the efficacy of non-pharmacological and non-hormonal treatments, although most evidence is based on women older than 50 years with breast cancer. Vaginal oestrogen seems safe for most patients with genitourinary symptoms, but there are few non-hormonal options. Many patients have inadequate centralised care for managing menopausal symptoms after cancer treatment, and more information is needed about cost-effective and patient-focused models of care for this growing population.

### Approach to the patient with menopausal symptoms [^112bnvcu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Many women experience menopausal symptoms during the menopausal transition and postmenopausal years. Hot flashes, the most common symptom, typically resolve after several years, but for 15–20% of women, they interfere with quality of life. For these women, estrogen therapy, the most effective treatment for hot flashes, should be considered. The decision to use hormone therapy involves balancing the potential benefits of hormone therapy against its potential risks. Accumulating data suggest that initiation of estrogen many years after menopause is associated with excess coronary risk, whereas initiation soon after menopause is not. Therefore, most now agree that short-term estrogen therapy, using the lowest effective estrogen dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate to severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health. Short-term therapy is considered to be not more than 4–5 yr because symptoms diminish after several years, whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with longer duration of hormone therapy. A minority of women may need long-term therapy for severe, persistent vasomotor symptoms after stopping hormone therapy. However, these women should first undergo trials of nonhormonal options such as gabapentin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, returning to estrogen only if these alternatives are ineffective or cause significant side effects. Low-dose vaginal estrogens are highly effective for genitourinary atrophy symptoms, with minimal systemic absorption and endometrial effects.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115TEqN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — treatment of menopausal symptoms states that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric, and that benefits clearly exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference, and they should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. For those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications — because these patients should not use MHT — other options are available; for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### The prevalence and patterns of menopausal symptoms in women living with HIV [^115ty8Yn]. AIDS and Behavior (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2019, over 30,000 women living with HIV attended for HIV care in the UK, one in three (36.2%) of whom were aged over 50. Successes in lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART) mean that women with HIV now have a similar life expectancy to their HIV-negative counterparts. Therefore, this population is now increasingly experiencing age-related conditions including menopause.

Oestrogen depletion marks the beginning of the menopause transition and manifests in a range of symptoms, impacting physical and psychological well-being. It is estimated that 85% of women experience at least one symptom during the peri-menopause phase, which can persist post-menopausally. The most prevalent symptoms reported are vasomotor (such as hot flashes and night sweats), however urogenital symptoms (including vaginal dryness, urinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction), mood changes, sleep disturbance, cognitive changes and joint pain can also be present.

As greater numbers of women with HIV reach midlife, evidence has accrued to suggest a high prevalence of menopausal symptoms in this population, with these symptoms potentially being more severe than in the general population. It is essential that women with HIV are aware of menopause and its associated symptoms. This is particularly important in the context of a clinical condition associated with multi-morbidity. The potential overlap of numerous symptoms (including hot flashes/night sweats, exhaustion, sleep problems and depression) related to both HIV and/or menopause can make it hard for women and their healthcare providers to identify aetiology and implement appropriate management plans.

To date, there has been limited information about women ageing with HIV, with existing published descriptive data primarily relating to age at menopause or prevalence of menopausal symptoms. Understanding which symptoms cluster together, and their trajectory over the menopause transition, may provide insights into potential underlying causes and highlight how and when to screen and offer appropriate support to maintain the health and quality of life of women with HIV. The Positive tRansItions through the MEnopause (PRIME) Study was designed to explore menopause amongst women living with HIV in England aged 45–60 years. In this analysis, we use PRIME study data to describe the prevalence of menopausal symptoms and describe which symptoms commonly co-occur amongst pre-, peri- and post-menopausal women in a large, representative sample of women living with HIV.

### Exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms [^11659ZDc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that many perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women will experience menopause symptoms, hot flushes being the most common. Symptoms caused by fluctuating levels of oestrogen may be alleviated by HRT but there has been a marked global decline in its use due to concerns about the risks and benefits of HRT; consequently many women are now seeking alternatives. As large numbers of women are choosing not to take HRT, it is increasingly important to identify evidence based lifestyle modification interventions that have potential to reduce vasomotor menopausal symptoms.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of any type of exercise intervention in the management of vasomotor menopausal symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Search Strategy

Searches of the following electronic bibliographic databases were performed to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised trials register; Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) (Wiley Internet interface), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index (Web of Science), CINAHL (Ovid) and SPORT Discus. Searches included dates up until 16–24 March 2010.

Selection Criteria

RCTs in which any type of exercise intervention were compared no treatment/control or other treatments in the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal/postmenopausal women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Six studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. Three authors independently extracted data from eligible studies. Three meta-analyses according to comparator the group were performed.

Main Results

In the comparison of exercise versus no treatment/control (three studies), the non-significant effect size Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) for vasomotor symptoms was -0.14 (95% CI: -0.54 to 0.26); SMD was -0.04, -0.25, -0.38. For the analysis of exercise versus HRT (three studies), the non-significant SMD was 0.49 (95% CI: -0.27 to 1.26); SMD across studies was 0.13, 0.19 and 1.52, with all studies favouring HRT. In the comparison of exercise versus yoga (two studies), the non-significant SMD was -0.09 (95%CI:-0.64 to 0.45); SMD was -0.37 and 0.19. All comparisons were based on small samples. One small study reported data that could not be included in the meta-analysis; in this study hot flush scores were significantly lower in the exercise plus soy milk group (83%) than soy milk only group (72%).

Authors' Conclusions

The existing studies provided insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of exercise as a treatment for vasomotor menopausal symptoms, or whether exercise is more effective than HRT or yoga.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^113zpxEK]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) describes the symptoms and physical changes that result from declining estrogen and androgen concentrations in the genitourinary tract during the menopausal transition. There has not been a consensus reached about the number or type of symptoms needed to diagnose GSM, and the associated urinary symptoms are also linked with other common urologic conditions (e.g., overactive bladder) in older patients. This guideline provides information to clinicians regarding identification, diagnosis, counseling, and treatment for patients with GSM to optimize symptom control and quality of life while minimizing adverse events (AEs).

Methods

The systematic review utilized in the creation of this guideline is based on research conducted by the Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) under contract to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and funded by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The EPC extracted and synthesized effectiveness and/or harms outcomes from 68 publications. An additional 66 publications evaluating 46 non-hormonal interventions, were described in an evidence map.

Results

Clinicians diagnose GSM based on symptoms, with or without related physical findings, and after ruling out other etiologies or co-occurring pathologies. There is a large body of evidence examining the use of hormonal and non-hormonal treatment options to manage the symptoms of GSM; however, the local low-dose vaginal estrogen has the most robust evidence base.

Conclusion

The strategies defined in this document were derived from evidence-based and consensus-based processes. Given that there is insufficient information to recommend one hormonal therapy over another, this guideline is not meant to support a stepwise progression through different hormonal approaches. The clinician should make treatment decisions in the context of shared decision-making considering patient goals and preferences, using the evidence of efficacy and AEs of each possible intervention as a guide.

### Vasomotor symptoms in menopause: physiologic condition and central nervous system approaches to treatment [^116RTwcZ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The decline in concentrations of gonadal hormones during menopause gives rise to a range of physiologic and psychologic changes that may impact a woman's health and quality of life significantly. Most notable among these are vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) and mood and sleep disturbances.

Study Design

This article reviews the physiologic condition underlying menopausal vasomotor symptoms and centrally active, nonhormonal therapies that have demonstrated efficacy for their treatment.

Results

Despite the emergence of a range of nonhormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms, a need still exists for safe and effective therapeutic options that directly target the underlying thermoregulatory mechanisms for women who want treatment but prefer to avoid hormone therapy or for whom hormone therapy is contraindicated.

Conclusion

The availability of centrally active therapies for menopausal vasomotor symptoms with risks and benefits clearly defined by results from well-designed clinical trials has the potential to allay safety concerns that are associated with the treatment of these common symptoms.

### The many menopauses: searching the cognitive research literature for menopause types [^112wHGMT]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Menopause is defined as the reproductive condition after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. For a majority of women, menopause occurs at an average age of 51 years, as a result of the complex hormonal changes that accompany the reduction in ovarian follicles. Along with a drop in circulating hormone levels, menopause is often associated with the experience of hot flashes, night sweats, sleep problems, mood changes, and vaginal dryness. Despite similar symptoms and the common name of menopause, there is, however, no single pathway to the end of menses. In fact, menstruation ceases for different reasons, in different ways, at different time points in the lifespan, with different health risks.

For a small but significant number of women, menopause occurs earlier than the normative age range. Included in this spectrum of menopauses is premature (younger than 40 y), early (between 40 and 45 y), and induced (oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [BSO], the removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes, or ovarian ablation through radiation). These different menopause types have distinct hormonal changes both leading up to and after the cessation of menses, potentially leading to different health trajectories. Although not considered an induced menopause, hysterectomy with ovarian sparing has been shown to result in decreased ovarian function. Thus, using menopause as a blanket word to describe any "cessation of menses" erases these differences in the physiology, etiology, and health outcomes of the many menopauses.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116fv8Zt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopause diagnosis and definitions — In a woman with an intact uterus, menopause is a clinical diagnosis based upon cessation of menses for at least 12 months, and sex steroids, gonadotropins, inhibin B, or anti-Mullerian hormone measurements do not further inform the diagnosis, do not indicate precisely when the final menstrual period will occur, and will not influence management unless a woman is seeking fertility. Table definitions specify that spontaneous menopause occurs at an average age of 51 y, early menopause is cessation of ovarian function between ages 40 and 45, and POI is loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 y with the prevalence of POI is approximately 1%.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^111hQpRt]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) — conclusions and research gaps emphasize that despite commonly accepted treatment strategies there remain significant gaps in comparative effectiveness, and individualized treatment decisions make safety and efficacy parameters a critical aspect of patient counseling. The guideline identifies a singular limitation: lack of high-level data on GSM treatment effects on commonly coexistent bladder symptoms and signs including overactive bladder (OAB) and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Future research priorities include directing efforts to understand the influence of local low-dose vaginal estrogen in patients concurrently treated with systemic estrogen therapies, advocating for national efforts to update boxed warnings on estrogen product labels — particularly regarding low-dose vaginal estrogen — and developing studies to define and standardize dosing and scheduling of interventions. The panel also notes the need to evaluate marginalized populations outside the traditional postmenopausal patient to establish best practices. With regard to cost and access, the guideline does not address financial impact of GSM or its treatments, and the panel acknowledges potential financial burden and the need to explore cost and access issues in future research. In closing, GSM is described as a common and underdetected condition affecting patients across the lifespan, safe and effective treatments exist that alleviate bothersome symptoms and improve quality of life (QoL), increased education and awareness is critical, and future research is needed to deepen understanding.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112VASo5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal symptoms and ET/MHT — clinical background: VMS, hot flashes, and night sweats, are the hallmarks of menopause, although not all women experience these symptoms. Symptoms frequently start in the years before the final menstrual period and can last, with unpredictable duration, from a few years to more than 13 years. ET has long been recognized as the most effective treatment for the relief of bothersome vasomotor and vaginal symptoms associated with menopause. During ensuing years, a consensus arose that most healthy symptomatic women, without contraindications and closer to the time of menopause (< 10 y after menopause onset or age < 60 y), were appropriate candidates for MHT for symptom relief, and post hoc WHI analyses and observational data suggest that benefits exceed risks in most of these women.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^113g5aFo]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over the past few decades, growing epidemiological and clinical data support the notion that some, but not all, women may be at a heightened risk for psychiatric morbidity (for example, mood and anxiety symptoms, cognitive complaints) during periods in life that are associated with reproductive cycle events such as the postpartum period and the menopausal transition. These periods are not only marked by extreme hormone variations but may also be accompanied by the occurrence of significant life stressors and changes in personal, family, and professional responsibilities. The complexity of the so-called female-specific 'windows of vulnerability' certainly poses a particular challenge to physicians and other professionals dedicated to women's health issues across the life span.

Among these female-specific 'windows of vulnerability', the menopausal transition constitutes a complex example: this transition is marked by progressive, dynamic changes in sex hormones and reproductive function. At the same time, these changes overlap with the aging process per se, and with modifications in metabolism, sexuality, lifestyle behaviors and overall health. During this period in life, some individuals may seek medical treatment for a constellation of symptoms including vasomotor complaints (VMS; that is, hot flashes, night sweats), aches and stiff joints, trouble sleeping, and lack of energy. Others, on a more preventative approach, will inquire about different strategies (for example, hormonal, non-hormonal, 'natural' remedies) to promote a 'healthier' transition into postmenopausal years. Overall, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to symptomatic women during the menopausal transition and postmenopausal years are, or should be, multifaceted and multidisciplinary in nature (Figure 1).

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115YbQnG]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms epidemiology — hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause and occur in up to 80% of menopausal women; vasomotor symptoms can be bothersome, lasting a mean duration of 7 to 9 years, and in one-third of women, can last more than 10 years.

### Menopausal transition, mood, and cognition: an integrated view to close the gaps [^114WzH2L]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and clinic data support the notion that some women may be at higher risk for developing mood and anxiety symptoms and cognitive complaints during certain periods in life that are marked by intense hormone variations and psychosocial stressors. The complexity of the so-called windows of vulnerability poses a particular challenge to professionals involved in the care of female patients. Menopausal transition is perhaps a paramount example; the process itself is marked by progressive, dynamic changes in hormone levels and reproductive function that interact with the aging process, changes in metabolism, sexuality, lifestyle behaviors, and overall health. The putative compounded burden of health challenges associated with this transition has become a main focus of attention of physicians and researchers who aim to identify preventive and/or early intervention strategies to promote healthy aging in midlife women. Recent studies have provided further evidence that the menopausal transition may be not only a window of vulnerability for depression and cognitive impairment but also a critical "window of opportunity" for the success of hormone-based treatments. The need for further investigation and better understanding of common underlying mechanisms seems intuitive. An ultimate goal could include preventive strategies for women presenting with various risk factors for cardiovascular, cognitive, and mood disorders as well as treatments that could be tailored to multiple symptom domains during the menopausal transition.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^112TJUNH]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) — screening and assessment indicate that several organizations recommend identifying GSM through a case-finding approach by screening patients for symptoms with routine questions, but few tools have been validated for GSM assessment and existing tools are limited to vulvovaginal symptoms. The urinary symptoms associated with GSM are linked with other common urologic conditions in older patients, such as overactive bladder (OAB), making identification, evaluation, and treatment complex. A causal relationship between reduced hormone levels and urinary symptoms remains controversial, and some have even questioned whether GSM meets the definition of a disease syndrome, creating uncertainty around optimal screening, identification, evaluation, and management.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1156ZBTF]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Menopause, vasomotor symptoms, and hormone therapy — stroke and cardiovascular disease risk are outlined as follows: Premature menopause (onset before 40 years of age) and early menopause (before 45 years of age) are described, and reproductive life span if < 30 years has been identified as a potential risk factor for stroke. More than 50% of women experience frequent vasomotor symptoms during the menopausal period, and severe and frequent symptoms are associated with an increased risk of CVD, although whether vasomotor symptoms are independently associated with the risk of stroke is uncertain. Estrogen-based therapies are the most effective treatments for moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms; however, HT, particularly oral HT, has been associated with risk of CVD in multiple RCTs and meta-analyses, and topical estrogen treatments are not associated with stroke risk. Approximately 5% of women experience a natural menopause before 45 years of age.

### Menopause [^116M6Lgb]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopause is an inevitable component of ageing and encompasses the loss of ovarian reproductive function, either occurring spontaneously or secondary to other conditions. It is not yet possible to accurately predict the onset of menopause, especially early menopause, to give women improved control of their fertility. The decline in ovarian oestrogen production at menopause can cause physical symptoms that may be debilitating, including hot flushes and night sweats, urogenital atrophy, sexual dysfunction, mood changes, bone loss, and metabolic changes that predispose to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The individual experience of the menopause transition varies widely. Important influential factors include the age at which menopause occurs, personal health and wellbeing, and each woman's environment and culture. Management options range from lifestyle assessment and intervention through to hormonal and non-hormonal pharmacotherapy, each of which has specific benefits and risks. Decisions about therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women depend on symptomatology, health status, immediate and long-term health risks, personal life expectations, and the availability and cost of therapies. More effective and safe therapies for the management of menopausal symptoms need to be developed, particularly for women who have absolute contraindications to hormone therapy.

### Midlife women: symptoms associated with menopausal transition and early postmenopause and quality of life [^112MpUsw]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of symptoms associated with the menopausal transition and early postmenopause on quality of life and to determine if there is a clustering of symptoms that has a larger effect on quality of life than individual symptoms.

Methods

This study used data from a cross-sectional study on women aged 45 to 60 years. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to analyze the data.

Results

More than 60% of the participants reported three or more symptoms. The symptom clusters that had the highest impact on quality of life were sleep disturbances and vaginal dryness, which accounted for 9.7% of the variance in quality-of-life scores. A parsimonious model of individual symptoms, including sleep disturbances, fatigue, and anxiety, accounted for 16.7% of the variance in quality of life. This group of symptoms, not represented by a cluster, had the highest impact on quality of life.

Conclusions

The symptoms found to most significantly affect quality of life are sleep disturbances, fatigue, and anxiety, suggesting that appropriate management of sleep disorders and anxiety may be beneficial to women undergoing the transition to postmenopause. Unanticipated clusters of symptoms point toward a unique symptom experience influenced by factors other than a decline in ovarian function. In this study, symptoms commonly associated with the menopausal transition and early postmenopause negatively affect quality of life; however, the results indicate that quality of life in midlife women is affected by these symptoms only to a small extent.

### Association of breast cancer and its therapy with menopause-related symptoms [^111y8hK2]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the relationship between current menopause status, occurrence of menopause transition during cancer treatment, and prevalence and severity of possible menopause-related symptoms.

Design

Data from the Cancer and Menopause Study (CAMS), a tumor-registry-based cohort of breast cancer survivors (BCS) diagnosed before age 50, were used. Using a standardized symptom checklist, women reported whether they were not at all, slightly, moderately, quite, or extremely bothered in the past 4 weeks by hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, pain with intercourse, breast sensitivity, joint pains, frequent mood changes, restless sleep, weight gain, forgetfulness, and difficulty concentrating. Current menopause status (by standard categories based on menstruation) and whether a persistent menopause transition occurred during cancer treatment were the main exposures. Linear (symptom severity as continuous outcome) and logistic (symptom present vs absent) regression models were adjusted for age, ethnicity, current smoking, alcohol use, chemotherapy, tamoxifen, body mass index, and depression scores.

Results

Mean age of the participants was 50 years. The prevalence of symptoms was high. Hot flashes occurred in 17%, 51%, and 71% of pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal BCS, respectively. Hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and pain with intercourse were more severe in postmenopausal compared with perimenopausal BCS. Having had a transition during breast cancer treatment was associated with worse hot flash severity, independent of current menopause status.

Conclusions

Menopause-related symptoms are common in BCS. Effective treatment options are needed. Having a treatment-related transition confers a persistent effect on hot flash severity. Clinicians should include this information when counseling women on potential outcomes of their cancer therapy.

### The kronos early estrogen prevention study (KEEPS): what have we learned? [^115EwCaw]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Menopausal symptoms

Menopausal symptoms are linked to overall health and disease risks, as well as to impaired quality of life (QOL), in most - but not allstudies. Women in KEEPS (N = 727) completed brief symptom questionnaires at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months.KEEPS, self-reported symptoms of hot flashes, vaginal dryness/dyspareunia, mood swings, sleep, and palpitations were monitored, and linked to baseline health status and improvements over time. The use of both o-CEE and t-E 2 also permitted direct comparisons between these two widely used forms of hormone therapy.

At baseline, menopausal symptoms were not associated with markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CIMT and CAC). Depressive symptoms and self-reported palpitations tended to associate positively with CAC, and although this association did not achieve statistical significance, it may be worthy of further study in larger cohorts. Symptoms of hot flashes/night sweats, irritability, and insomnia at baseline were more likely among black women, with a very large odds ratio for irritability (19.23, 95% CI, 11.72–31.57), a striking finding that requires confirmation and further exploration in larger cohorts.

Moderate-to-severe symptoms of hot flashes and night sweats were similarly reduced by both o-CEE and t-E 2 compared with placebo. There was no differentiation of either HT versus placebo on relief of symptoms of irritability or mood swings. There was a modest, nonsignificant overall trend toward symptom improvement over time in the placebo group, not associated with BMI or race/ethnicity. These latter findings confirm a natural time course for regression of common menopausal symptoms of hot flashes, night sweats, irritability, and mood swings over time for most but not all women.

### Oestrogen replacement in postmenopausal women [^1116A9rU]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal symptoms can disrupt a woman's personal and social life. Vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) are the most common symptoms and can be treated very effectively with oestrogen-based hormone therapy. The decision to use oestrogen (often simply termed hormone therapy or hormone replacement therapy or HT) therapy involves balancing the potential benefits against the potential risks. Most agree that short-term oestrogen therapy, using the lowest effective dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate-to-severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health (Martin and Manson. 2008. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 93, 4567–75). Whilst effective and safe in most instances, HT is not suitable for all women or for all menopause-related symptoms when alternatives are available. The role of HRT in chronic disease prevention is also discussed.

### The menopause transition: signs, symptoms, and management options [^113db1pe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Menopause, the permanent cessation of menses, reflects oocyte depletion and loss of gonadal steroids. It is preceded by a transition state, the perimenopause, which is characterized by the gradual loss of oocytes, altered responsiveness to gonadal steroid feedback, wide hormonal fluctuations, and irregular menstrual patterns. The goal of this mini-review is to discuss the basic pathophysiology of the menopausal transition and the hormonal and nonhormonal management of clinicopathology attributed to it.

Evidence Acquisition

A Medline search of epidemiologic, population-based studies, and studies of reproductive physiology was conducted. A total of 758 publications were screened.

Evidence Synthesis

The reproductive hormonal milieu of the menopausal transition precipitates bothersome vasomotor symptoms, mood disruption, temporary cognitive dysfunction, genitourinary symptoms, and other disease processes that reduce the quality of life of affected women. The endocrine tumult of the menopause transition also exposes racial and socioeconomic disparities in the onset, severity, and frequency of symptoms. Hormone therapy (HT) treatment can be effective for perimenopausal symptoms but its use has been stymied by concerns about health risks observed in postmenopausal HT users who are older than 60 and/or women who have been postmenopausal for greater than 10 years.

Conclusions

The menopause transition is a disruptive process that can last for over a decade and causes symptoms in a majority of women. It is important for clinicians to recognize early signs and symptoms of the transition and be prepared to offer treatment to mitigate these symptoms. Many safe and effective options, including HT, are available.

### Impact of sleep disturbances on health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women: a systematic review [^114WHzb9]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Sleep disturbances are common during and after the menopause transition, with potential effects on morbidity and quality of life; however, they may be underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Objective

We carried out a systematic literature review to investigate the prevalence and impact of sleep disturbances associated with menopause on women's health-related quality of life across the stages of menopause.

Evidence Review

Searches were conducted in PubMed and Excerpta Medica Database to identify articles published between 2013 and 2023 containing evidence for the impact of sleep quality on health-related quality of life and the epidemiology of sleep disturbances in women in menopause.

Findings

In total, 29 publications focusing on epidemiological outcomes of sleep disturbances and 28 studies focusing on the impact of sleep quality on health-related quality of life were identified. Overall, these studies confirmed the high prevalence of sleep disturbances in postmenopausal women. Risk factors for sleep disturbances included menopausal status, depression, vasomotor symptoms, high glycemic index diets, and age. Notably, sleep disturbances were identified even in the absence of vasomotor symptoms. Sleep disturbances were significantly associated with impaired menopause-specific and general health-related quality of life, including depression, anxiety, and musculoskeletal pain. Sleep disturbances were also associated with reduced work productivity and the ability to perform daily activities.

Conclusions and Relevance

Healthy sleep is important at all life stages, including during menopause. Our review indicates that sleep disturbances are highly prevalent during postmenopausal years, even among women without vasomotor symptoms, and can severely impact women's well-being and quality of life. This study highlights the importance of promoting increased awareness and developing tailored treatment strategies for sleep disturbances in midlife and beyond.

### Prevalence, severity, and associated factors in women in east Asia with moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^116UDniw]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Based on national surveys among perimenopausal or postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years, this study provides valuable evidence about the prevalence of menopausal VMS in East Asia. As a prevalent condition affecting around 80% of perimenopausal or postmenopausal women in East Asia, menopausal VMS is associated with a significant burden in both groups. The current management for moderate-to-severe menopausal VMS is suboptimal, as demonstrated by the high undertreatment rate, low awareness, limited treatment options, and concerns regarding available prescribed therapies. Novel non-HT treatment options with effective symptom management and minimal side effects for menopausal VMS are a significant need.

### Treatment of menopausal symptoms: what shall we do now? [^113woa1M]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

During the past few years, many women and doctors have revised their opinions of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms, and a substantial number of individuals have discontinued its use because of concerns about side-effects. Numerous alternatives to HRT are promoted, and assessment of the quality of evidence about the safety and effectiveness of these compounds can be difficult. In this Review, we summarise the data from studies addressing the efficacy, risks, and benefits of frequently prescribed treatments, and offer evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of menopausal symptoms. Although few comparative studies exist, oestrogen alone or combinations of oestrogen and progestagen are likely to be the most effective treatments for menopausal hot flushes and vaginal dryness. Tibolone is as effective as HRT, however, and might also improve libido. For those who wish to avoid hormonal treatments, there are few effective options. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might be effective in the very short term (less than 12 weeks) and are well tolerated. There is not enough evidence that any of the complementary therapies available are any better than placebo for menopausal vasomotor symptoms, and few safety data exist.

### Androgens for genitourinary and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^111Wornn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a protocol for a systematic review of interventions that has been developed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and using the PRISMA‐P guideline. A systematic review gathers all evidence that meets predefined eligibility criteria to address a specific research question. Undertaking a systematic review involves a comprehensive search for relevant studies to answer the research question, in order to synthesize the available evidence in a rigorous and objective manner. Conducting a Cochrane review also involves evaluating the reliability of the available evidence and assessing where further research is needed.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include all randomized controlled trials, cross‐over trials, and trial protocols with results that are not yet published. We will include studies irrespective of which language they are reported in. Randomized clinical trials are appropriate to answer the questions posed in this review since they provide the most reliable data on the effects of a particular intervention. Non‐randomized studies tend to have a higher risk of bias. We will exclude quasi‐randomized studies (e.g. studies that use methods to randomize participants that are not strictly random, e.g. alternation or date of birth). Based on our scan of existing synthesized evidence, there is sufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to address the review objective. Additionally, we will exclude cluster clinical trials (e.g. when randomization units are communities or health centers).

### Management of menopausal symptoms [^1163783f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Most menopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms with bothersome symptoms often lasting longer than one decade. Hormone therapy (HT) represents the most effective treatment for these symptoms with oral and transdermal estrogen formulations having comparable efficacy. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative and other recent randomized clinical trials have helped to clarify the benefits and risks of combination estrogen-progestin and estrogen-alone therapy. Absolute risks observed with HT tended to be small, especially in younger women. Neither regimen increased all-cause mortality rates. Given the lower rates of adverse events on HT among women close to menopause onset and at lower baseline risk of cardiovascular disease, risk stratification and personalized risk assessment appear to represent a sound strategy for optimizing the benefit-risk profile and safety of HT. Systemic HT should not be arbitrarily stopped at age 65 years; instead treatment duration should be individualized based on patients' risk profiles and personal preferences. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause represents a common condition that adversely affects the quality of life of many menopausal women. Without treatment, symptoms worsen over time. Low-dose vaginal estrogen represents highly effective treatment for this condition. Because custom-compounded hormones have not been tested for efficacy or safety, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved HT is preferred. A low-dose formulation of paroxetine mesylate currently represents the only nonhormonal medication FDA-approved to treat vasomotor symptoms. Gynecologists and other clinicians who remain abreast of data addressing the benefit-risk profile of hormonal and nonhormonal treatments can help menopausal women make sound choices regarding management of menopausal symptoms.

### A review of transdermal nonpatch estrogen therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms [^116kZt3P]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

During the transition into menopause, women may experience a wide range of symptoms that negatively impact quality of life. The vasomotor symptoms (VMS) of hot flushes and night sweats are common and vary widely in frequency and severity. The treatment of menopause-associated VMS is a frequently encountered clinical challenge, with the goal of tailoring treatment for each individual woman's needs. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal VMS. Current guidelines suggest that estrogen therapy be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time. Transdermal estrogen therapy has dominated the menopause prescribing practice in Europe for decades; however, in the United States, oral estrogen therapy is most commonly prescribed. Transdermal estrogen therapy can be prescribed at considerably lower doses than oral therapy yet has similar efficacy on the symptoms of menopause. Emerging research demonstrates transdermal estrogen, particularly 17beta-estradiol, may have the potential for fewer health risks than oral estrogen therapy. This review article discusses the spectrum of menopausal symptoms, addresses prevailing issues in the treatment of menopause, elaborates on the risks and benefits of oral and transdermal hormone therapies, and focuses on five nonpatch transdermal estradiol therapies currently available in the United States.

### Prescribing of FDA-approved and compounded hormone therapy differs by specialty [^112LSPwF]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Menopausal symptoms are common and bothersome to many women. Hormone therapy (HT) was widely used through the 1990s for many indications and to treat menopausal symptoms, but use fell dramatically after the publication of the results from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trials in 2002. Physicians' attitudes regarding HT reflected those of their patients' after the release of the WHI information, and prescribing practices shifted. In a survey of US Midwestern healthcare practitioners (physicians and nurse practitioners practicing gynecology, family medicine, and internal medicine) published in 2007, 74% of practitioners responded to the WHI findings by prescribing lower-dose products, and 73% recommended reducing duration of treatment to patients.

The gap between a need for effective menopausal treatment and available therapies with a perceived acceptable risk/benefit ratio vastly expanded the use of non-Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounded hormone therapy (CHT), which has been marketed as safer than HT and has been promoted as a superior alternative to HT.- Compounded hormones are not FDA-approvedand are not required to demonstrate safety and efficacy through the rigorous clinical trials required for HT. Although the FDA does maintain some oversight of compounding facilities, their authority is limited and varies by state. Thus, CHT products lack rigorous efficacy data and safety validation related to quality, purity, and potency. In addtion, compounded drugs are not required to carry a package insert, outlining the risks associated with HT. Consequently, many physicians and patients are unaware of the risks associated with CHT, and confusion about the differences between CHT and FDA-approved HT is common among consumers and physicians alike.

Up to 80% of women in the United States experience VMS during the menopausal transition, and VMS persist for a median of 7.4 years. Up to two thirds of women who experience VMS find these symptoms bothersome. Furthermore, VMS are the menopausal symptoms for which women most often seek treatment. However, in the United States and most European countries, only about 3% to 10% of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women use menopausal hormone therapy (HT), - the most effective available treatment for VMS associated with menopause. - A recent meta-analysis of prospective studies including more than 100,000 postmenopausal women who developed breast cancer described an increased relative risk of breast cancer associated with use of HT (estrogen alone or combination estrogen/progestogen) as well as with a longer duration of HT use. Also, systemic estrogen/progestogen therapy has been associated with an increased risk of stroke and venous thromboembolism and with common adverse events (AEs) including breakthrough bleeding, breast tenderness, nausea, bloating, and mood swings. Despite recognition of the continued role for HT in international clinical practice guidelines, especially for symptomatic women aged < 60 years or within 10 years of menopause, -, safety and tolerability concerns have discouraged women suffering from VMS from using HT.

### Menopausal hormone therapy use among postmenopausal women [^116aiXXj]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Annually, more than 1.3 million women in the US transition into menopause. Menopausal transition is associated with profound hormonal changes, which can be symptomatic in 80% of women, and these symptoms, including vasomotor, genitourinary, sleep difficulties, and cognition, can be severe in about 30% of women. Vasomotor symptoms, which are episodes of profuse heat accompanied by sweating and flushing, cause anxiety and sleep disruption and tend to be the most lifestyle-limiting symptom in many women.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the treatment of choice for menopausal symptoms and is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. During peak use in the late 1990s, prescriptions for MHT rose rapidly in the US, fueled by observational studies showing a protective effect on coronary heart diseases and cardiovascular deaths. MHT use, however, declined rapidly in 2002 after the Women's Health Initiative trial showed that the health risks associated with MHT outweighed the benefits. Recent studies highlighting nuances in the risks of MHT with suggestions that the absolute risks of adverse events depend on several factors, including age at initiation and timing in relation to menopause, MHT type, dosage, duration, and route of administration, have led to several national societies putting out guidelines on MHT prescribing.

In 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against the use of MHT for primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women, while the North American Menopause Society recommended tailoring MHT in treating menopausal symptoms to each individual need. The US Preventive Services Task Force also highlighted research gaps, including the need to understand the comparative benefits and harms of different MHT formulations and age at initiation. A gap in the current conversation on MHT use is an understanding of recent trends in, and prevalence of, MHT use. To our knowledge, the most recent study on MHT prevalence using a nationally representative sample was based on self-reported data up to 2010; hence, there are no recent MHT use data captured by prescriptions to understand contemporary patterns in the US.

The goal of this cross-sectional study is to comprehensively describe the most recent trends in, and current prevalence and correlates of, MHT use, taking into consideration MHT formulations, among postmenopausal women in the US. Study findings will provide data that can help guide national discussions and policy on MHT use.

### Premenstrual disorders, timing of menopause, and severity of vasomotor symptoms [^114LBGS3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is presence of a premenstrual disorder (PMD) associated with higher risk of early menopause and menopause-related vasomotor symptoms (VMS)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 3635 female participants in the US, presence of a PMD was significantly associated with higher risks of early menopause and moderate or severe VMS.

Meaning

These results suggest a phenotype observable during the reproductive years that may allow clinicians to target women at risk of adverse experiences during menopause transition.

### Discontinuation of postmenopausal hormone therapy [^114QXaeo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend that postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) be used primarily for treatment of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms associated with the menopausal transition and that women use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time necessary. Vasomotor symptoms improve or resolve spontaneously within a few months to a few years of onset in the majority of women, suggesting that most women should be able to discontinue HT within a few years of starting treatment. Approximately 75% of women who try to stop are able to stop HT without major difficulty. However, some women who would like to stop HT are unable to do so, mainly owing to the development of vasomotor symptoms. Troublesome symptoms associated with stopping HT appear to be more common among women who start HT for treatment of symptoms, but they also are reported by women who started HT for other reasons, such as prevention of osteoporosis. Unfortunately, little information is available to guide physicians in helping women who have difficulty stopping HT. Many clinicians recommend slowly tapering HT or adding another drug for treatment of hot flashes, but the effectiveness of these approaches has not been evaluated. For women who cannot tolerate even a slow taper, the value of symptom relief likely outweighs any increased risks due to HT use.

### Prevalence, severity, and associated factors in women in east Asia with moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^113uLbHf]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To understand prevalence, severity, impact, and treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, using cross-sectional survey data.

Methods

This online, two-part survey was conducted in East Asia among women 40-65years recruited from established online panels (Edelman, Beijing; Hankook Research, Seoul; Rakuten Insight, Taipei) using stratified sampling. Part I collected demographics/disease characteristics, including menopausal status and vasomotor symptom severity. Women with moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms completed Part II, including clinical characteristics, health-related quality of life, and healthcare-seeking behavior. Primary endpoints included vasomotor symptom prevalence and severity and proportions of women eligible and willing to take hormone therapy. Results are presented for each of the three online panels separately and as a pooled total. All analyses are descriptive with no formal hypothesis testing across groups.

Results

Numbers of peri- versus postmenopausal women completing Part I were Edelman, 1,588 (55.1% vs 44.9%); Hankook Research, 1,000 (43.6% vs 56.4%); Rakuten Insight, 773 (61.7% vs 38.3%). Vasomotor symptom prevalence was = 80% in each region; overall moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptom prevalence was 55%; > 50% of women were untreated. Most of those treated used non-prescription treatments. Menopausal hormone therapy use was reported by 11.6% of peri- and 7.2% of postmenopausal women. In peri- and postmenopausal women with moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms, 8.6% and 3.4%, respectively, were hormone therapy-willing, 19.3% and 16.8% hormone therapy-contraindicated, 25.4% and 23.0% hormone therapy-cautious, and 10.2% and 8.3% hormone therapy-averse. Women experienced significant burden on health-related quality of life and substantial impairment of work productivity and daily activities.

Conclusions

Vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause affected = 80% of women aged 40 to 65years. A substantial proportion of women are unsuitable for, or choose not to take, menopausal hormone therapy, resulting in an unmet need for nonhormonal treatment options.

### Associations of estrogen with modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for dementia: a narrative review [^113eccX7]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Sleep disturbance is a major recognized symptom of menopause, with up to 60% of women complaining of changes to their sleep during this period. Sleep appears to worsen in menopause beyond what would be expected from normal changes with age, although significant evidence is from subjective reports of sleep and there remains a lack of objective sleep studies during the menopausal transition. The most common changes appear to be increases in nighttime awakenings and spending more time awake during the night. Significantly more research is needed to understand the etiology of sleep changes during the menopausal transition; however, it is likely a combination of hormonal changes as well as vasomotor symptoms, that drive this.

There is some evidence that suggests an association between hormonal contraceptive use and symptoms of insomnia. However, a robust series of meta‐analyses of subjective and objective (polysomnography) measures found only one statistically significant difference, with contraceptive users having a slightly (≈ 7 minutes) shorter wake after sleep onset compared to non‐contraceptive users. However, the analyses were limited by a lack of consistency in measurement of sleep, meaning few studies contribute to each analysis, and type of hormonal contraceptive used. More research would be valuable to understand what, if any, effects there are of hormonal contraceptive use on sleep. Considering HRT, a meta‐analysis including data from 42 trials reported that HRT use had a modest effect on improved sleep quality in women who experienced both sleep problems and vasomotor symptoms, but this effect was not seen in women without vasomotor symptoms. The evidence base does remain mixed, with studies looking at subjective measures of sleep tending to report positive associations, and less consistent evidence when objective measures are used.

In summary, there is evidence suggesting sex differences in sleep between men and women; however, more research is needed to understand what role, if any, endogenous and exogenous estrogen has in the underlying mechanisms of these differences.

Menopausal vasomotor symptoms — duration, pathophysiology, and epidemiology are described as follows: reported durations range of 6 months to 2 years, with median durations of 4 years and 10.2 years. The pathophysiology of the hot flush is not fully understood and is likely related to multiple factors. Hot flushes are reported to be more common in obese women. Racial and ethnic variation is documented by the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, which assessed menopausal symptoms in 14,906 women aged 40–55 years and found African American women reported the most vasomotor symptoms and Asian women the fewest.

### Menopausal symptoms in older women and the effects of treatment with hormone therapy [^116aNv5G]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

In some women, hot flashes and other symptoms attributed to menopause persist for many years after the cessation of menses. The frequency and severity of such symptoms and response to hormone therapy in older women have not been well documented.

Methods

We used data from the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study, a blinded, clinical trial among 2763 women with documented coronary disease and a uterus who were randomized to receive either conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg in one tablet or placebo. Participants were queried at baseline and annually regarding menopausal symptoms. Breast symptoms were self-reported, and uterine bleeding was recorded on a daily diary.

Results

Symptoms associated with menopause were relatively common among Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study participants, whose average age was 67 years and who averaged 18 years since menopause. At baseline, 16% of women reported frequent hot flashes, 26% vaginal dryness, 10% genital irritation, 55% trouble sleeping, and 53% early awakening. Women assigned to hormone therapy reported less frequent hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and trouble sleeping compared with women assigned to placebo, but more frequent vaginal discharge, genital irritation, uterine bleeding, and breast symptoms. The reporting of breast symptoms among women in the hormone group decreased from 40% at 1 year to 13% by the 4th year. Uterine bleeding was reported by 31% and spotting by an additional 33% of women in the hormone group during the 1st year of treatment; by the 4th year, these proportions had fallen to 11% and 20%, respectively.

Conclusion

Symptoms typically attributed to menopause are common in elderly women. Postmenopausal hormone therapy reduces hot flashes, trouble sleeping, and vaginal dryness, but at standard doses in elderly women is associated with vaginal discharge, genital irritation, uterine bleeding, and breast symptoms.

### Global cross-sectional survey of women with vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause: prevalence and quality of life burden [^116kWZry]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Questionnaires and assessments

The screening survey included six screening questions on age, current menstrual status, prior diagnosis of breast cancer, treatments received in the previous 12 months (including HT), menopause symptoms, and whether participants had experienced mild/moderate/severe VMS. The full questionnaire included 37 questions on medical conditions, frequency and duration of VMS, perceptions of menopause, whether they had seen an healthcare professional for advice on menopause symptoms, treatment for VMS symptoms, perceptions of HT use, out-of-pocket costs, and other approaches to coping with menopause.

The Menopause-Specific QOL (MENQOL) questionnairewas included (as Question 4) to assess QOL and impact of menopause symptoms. Participants selected whether they had experienced any of the 30 common menopause symptoms in the past week. If they had experienced a symptom, they indicated how much the symptom bothered them on a scale of 1 (not at all bothered) to 6 (extremely bothered). In addition, the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnairewas included (Questions 7–12) to assess the level of impact of hot flashes or night sweats on daily activities or working activities. Participants indicated the impact of each symptom on a scale of 0 (had no effect) to 10 (completely prevented me from working or daily activities).

### The prevalence and patterns of menopausal symptoms in women living with HIV [^116oFS9n]. AIDS and Behavior (2022). Medium credibility.

Increasing numbers of women with HIV are experiencing menopause. We use data from a large, representative sample of women with HIV to describe the prevalence and clustering of menopausal symptoms amongst pre-, peri- and post-menopausal women using hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis. Of the 709 women included, 21.6%, 44.9% and 33.6% were pre-, peri- and post-menopausal, respectively. Joint pain (66.4%) was the most commonly reported symptom, followed by hot flashes (63.0%), exhaustion (61.6%) and sleep problems (61.4%). All symptoms were reported more commonly by peri- and post-menopausal women compared to pre-menopausal women. Psychological symptoms and sleep problems clustered together at all menopausal stages. Somatic and urogenital symptom clusters emerged more distinctly at peri- and post-menopause. We recommend regular and proactive assessment of menopausal symptoms in midlife women with HIV, with an awareness of how particular patterns of symptoms may evolve over the menopausal transition.

### Prevalence, severity, and associated factors in women in east Asia with moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^115z8FPq]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

The burden on quality of life, participants' eligibility, and willingness to receive menopausal HT, current treatment landscape, and participants' healthcare-seeking behavior and key driving factors were also evaluated based on selfreported data. Moderate-to-severe VMS significantly compromised participants' quality of life across all geographical locations. Although cross-location heterogeneity was observed, the menopausal symptom burden in this study was high and similar to other reports from these locations. Interestingly, while existing evidence commonly focused on the HRQoL impairment among postmenopausal women, the present study suggested that a substantial burden of menopausal symptoms was also present in perimenopausal women; in some cases this burden was higher than in postmenopausal women. Based on the MENQOL scale, vasomotor, psychosocial, and physical symptoms were the most common complaints in the three locations, affecting > 70% of participants, while sexual symptoms were less prevalent (> 50% reported a burden in the sexual domain). The most bothersome symptoms were sweating, night sweats, feeling tired or worn out, poor memory, and hot flashes. Moderate-to- severe menopausal VMS also substantially impaired participants' perceptions of work productivity and daily activities. Productivity loss was seemingly highest in the Edelman panel, followed by the Hankook panel and the Rakuten panels, and the impact was highest among perimenopausal women compared with postmenopausal women, because overall the majority of perimenopausal women were in paid employment.
