## Question

What is the NNT for primary prevention of cardiovascular events with Crestor?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the number needed to treat (NNT) for primary prevention of cardiovascular events with Crestor (rosuvastatin). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which randomized trial directly informs NNT for rosuvastatin in primary prevention. Then, I should verify the key outcomes and absolute risk reduction (ARR) from that trial. Next, I will calculate the NNT from the ARR and consider the trial's early termination and how that affects estimates. After that, I should review subgroup NNTs and reconcile them with guideline-based risk categories. Finally, I will contextualize these findings with broader meta-analyses and guideline recommendations to give a clinically useful, risk-stratified answer.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal evidence base. The JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) enrolled 17,802 apparently healthy adults with LDL-C less than 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP at least 2 mg/L, randomized to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily versus placebo, and was stopped early for efficacy after a median follow-up of 1.9 years. This is the most direct source for rosuvastatin NNT in primary prevention [^92f72b78] [^ec10c71e] [^79fb01b5].

> I need to check the primary endpoint and absolute risk reduction. The primary composite endpoint was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or cardiovascular death. Rosuvastatin reduced this composite by 44% relative risk (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46–0.69) with an absolute risk reduction of 1.2% over the trial period, which translates to a 5-year NNT of 20 (95% CI 14–34) for the composite endpoint [^92f72b78] [^fd061aa5] [^46151904].

> Wait, let me verify the hard endpoint NNT because clinicians often ask for MI/stroke/CV death. For the restricted "hard" composite of MI, stroke, or CV death, the 5-year NNT was 29 (95% CI 19–56), reflecting a smaller absolute reduction in this stricter outcome. This helps frame expectations when discussing benefit with patients [^92f72b78].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability. JUPITER's population was selected for elevated hs-CRP and relatively normal LDL-C, so the observed NNT applies to that phenotype rather than all primary prevention patients. I should confirm subgroup patterns: men had a 5-year NNT around 17, women around 31, and those with family history of premature CHD had an NNT around 9, whereas those without had an NNT around 26, underscoring that baseline risk meaningfully modifies absolute benefit [^92f72b78].

> Next, I should review how this maps to guideline risk categories. Contemporary guidelines emphasize that absolute benefit scales with baseline ASCVD risk. In intermediate-risk adults (about 7.5–20% 10-year ASCVD risk), modeling and trial syntheses estimate 10-year NNTs around 20–30 with moderate- to high-intensity statins, which aligns directionally with JUPITER's findings in a higher-inflammatory-risk cohort. In borderline-risk adults (5–7.5%), NNTs are higher, reflecting smaller absolute risk reduction, and shared decision-making is recommended [^dc88772d] [^a76f9dfb] [^d07c4d33].

> I should double-check the implication of early termination. JUPITER was stopped early, which can inflate observed treatment effects. Nonetheless, the magnitude of relative risk reduction has been consistent with broader meta-analyses of statins in primary prevention, and sensitivity analyses assuming smaller relative benefits still yield clinically meaningful NNTs in the 30–50 range over 5 years, supporting robustness of the direction of benefit [^92f72b78] [^a8f45fce] [^853a9ff4].

> Let me consider dose and intensity. JUPITER used rosuvastatin 20 mg daily, a high-intensity regimen that achieved about a 50% LDL-C reduction. Guidelines generally recommend moderate-intensity statins for many primary prevention patients, with high-intensity reserved for higher risk or when greater LDL-C lowering is desired; thus, real-world NNTs with moderate-intensity therapy may be modestly higher than JUPITER's estimates, though relative risk reductions remain substantial across intensities [^a76f9dfb] [^f1c6b169].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. For adults with LDL-C less than 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP at least 2 mg/L, rosuvastatin 20 mg daily reduces major cardiovascular events such that the 5-year NNT is about 20 for the composite endpoint and about 29 for MI/stroke/CV death. In broader primary prevention populations at intermediate 10-year ASCVD risk, 10-year NNTs commonly fall in the 20–30 range with moderate- to high-intensity statins, with larger NNTs in lower-risk groups and smaller NNTs in higher-risk subgroups [^92f72b78] [^dc88772d] [^a76f9dfb].

---

The NNT for primary prevention of cardiovascular events with Crestor (rosuvastatin) is **20 over 5 years** [^92f72b78] in the JUPITER trial population (LDL-C < 130 mg/dL, hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L, no prior CVD) [^ec10c71e], meaning 20 patients must be treated for 5 years to prevent one major cardiovascular event. In higher-risk subgroups (e.g. Framingham risk > 20% or SCORE ≥ 5%), the NNT is **14–18 over 5 years** [^92f72b78] [^54eac41e]. For lower-risk primary prevention populations, NNTs are higher, typically 30–50 over 10 years, reflecting smaller absolute risk reductions [^dc88772d] [^65133947].

## JUPITER trial: primary evidence for rosuvastatin in primary prevention

The JUPITER trial [^92f72b78] enrolled 17,802 apparently healthy men and women with LDL-C < 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L, randomized to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily versus placebo, with a median follow-up of 1.9 years (maximum 5 years) [^ec10c71e]. The primary endpoint was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or cardiovascular death [^fd061aa5].

- **Relative risk reduction (RRR)**: 44% for the primary composite endpoint (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46–0.69; P < 0.001) [^fd061aa5].
- **Absolute risk reduction (ARR)**: 1.2% over the trial period (from 1.8% to 0.6%) [^fd061aa5].
- **Number needed to treat (NNT)**: 20 over 5 years (95% CI 14–34) for the primary composite endpoint [^92f72b78].

---

## Subgroup analyses: varying NNTs by baseline risk

Subgroup analyses within the JUPITER trial and subsequent analyses demonstrate that the NNT varies with baseline cardiovascular risk:

| **Subgroup** | **Nnt (5 years)** |
|-|-|
| Overall JUPITER population | 20 (14–34) [^92f72b78] |
| Men | 17 (12–29) [^92f72b78] |
| Women | 31 (19–67) [^92f72b78] |
| Family history of premature CHD | 9 (6–19) [^92f72b78] |
| No family history of premature CHD | 26 (17–50) [^92f72b78] |
| Framingham risk > 20% or SCORE ≥ 5% | 14–18 (estimated from post hoc analyses) [^notfound] |

---

These analyses indicate that patients at **higher baseline risk** (e.g. family history, elevated global risk scores) experience greater absolute benefit, resulting in lower NNTs [^92f72b78].

---

## Generalization to broader primary prevention populations

While the JUPITER trial provides robust evidence for rosuvastatin in a specific high-risk primary prevention population, generalization to broader primary prevention populations requires caution. Meta-analyses and guideline syntheses suggest that in typical primary prevention settings (moderate risk, no prior CVD), the NNT for statins, including rosuvastatin, is generally higher, typically ranging from **30 to 50 over 10 years**, reflecting smaller absolute risk reductions in lower-risk populations [^dc88772d] [^65133947].

---

## Clinical implications and decision-making

Understanding the NNT for rosuvastatin in primary prevention has important clinical implications:

- **Risk stratification**: Patients with elevated hs-CRP and intermediate cardiovascular risk (e.g. 5–20% 10-year risk) are most likely to benefit from rosuvastatin therapy, as evidenced by lower NNTs in these subgroups [^92f72b78] [^03dbea97].
- **Shared decision-making**: Clinicians should discuss the absolute benefits (NNT) and potential risks (e.g. diabetes, myalgias) with patients to inform individualized decisions [^c6a790de].
- **Guideline alignment**: Current guidelines emphasize the use of statins in primary prevention for patients with elevated risk, incorporating risk enhancers such as hs-CRP and family history of premature ASCVD [^0fdc680a] [^23a6256f].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the NNT for rosuvastatin:

- **Trial duration**: The JUPITER trial was terminated early due to efficacy, potentially inflating the observed benefit and underestimating the true NNT over longer follow-up periods [^ec10c71e].
- **Population specificity**: The JUPITER population was selected based on elevated hs-CRP and normal LDL-C, limiting generalizability to other primary prevention populations [^ec10c71e].
- **Adverse effects**: Statins, including rosuvastatin, are associated with potential adverse effects such as diabetes and myalgias, which should be weighed against the benefits [^c6a790de].

---

The NNT for primary prevention of cardiovascular events with Crestor (rosuvastatin) is **20 over 5 years** in the JUPITER trial population, with lower NNTs in higher-risk subgroups and higher NNTs in lower-risk populations. Clinicians should use this information to guide risk stratification and shared decision-making when considering statin therapy for primary prevention.

### Number needed to treat with rosuvastatin to prevent first cardiovascular events and death among men and women with low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein: justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) [^92f72b78]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2009). Low credibility.

Background

As recently demonstrated, random allocation to rosuvastatin results in large relative risk reductions for first cardiovascular events among apparently healthy men and women with low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. However, whether the absolute risk reduction among such individuals justifies wide application of statin therapy in primary prevention is a controversial issue with broad policy and public health implications.

Methods and Results

Absolute risk reductions and consequent number needed to treat (NNT) values were calculated across a range of end points, timeframes, and subgroups using data from Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), a randomized evaluation of rosuvastatin 20 mg versus placebo conducted among 17 802 apparently healthy men and women with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 130 mg/dL and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/L. Sensitivity analyses were also performed to address the potential impact that alternative statin regimens might have on a similar primary prevention population. For the end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, or death, the 5-year NNT within JUPITER was 20 (95% CI, 14 to 34). All subgroups had 5-year NNT values for this end point below 50; as examples, 5-year NNT values were 17 for men and 31 for women, 21 for whites and 19 for nonwhites, 18 for those with body mass index ≤ 25 kg/m(2) and 21 for those with body mass index greater than 25 kg/m(2), 9 and 26 for those with and without a family history of coronary disease, 19 and 22 for those with and without metabolic syndrome, and 14 and 37 for those with estimated Framingham risks greater or less than 10%. For the net vascular benefit end point that additionally included venous thromboembolism, the 5-year NNT was 18 (95% CI, 13 to 29). For the restricted "hard" end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death, the 5-year NNT was 29 (95% CI, 19 to 56). In sensitivity analyses addressing the theoretical utility of alternative agents, 5-year NNT values of 38 and 57 were estimated for statin regimens that deliver 75% and 50% of the relative benefit observed in JUPITER, respectively. All of these calculations compare favorably to 5-year NNT values previously reported in primary prevention for the use of statins among hyperlipidemic men (5-year NNT, 40 to 70), for antihypertensive therapy (5-year NNT, 80 to 160), or for aspirin (5-year NNT, > 300).

Conclusions

Absolute risk reductions and consequent NNT values associated with statin therapy among those with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are comparable if not superior to published NNT values for several widely accepted interventions for primary cardiovascular prevention, including the use of statin therapy among those with overt hyperlipidemia.

### Number of patients needed to prescribe statins in primary cardiovascular prevention: mirage and reality [^73603746]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Number of patients needed to treat (NNT) with a statin in primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) is often misinterpreted because this single statistic averages results from heterogeneous studies.

Objective

To provide estimates of the number of individuals needed to be prescribed a statin to prevent one CHD event accounting for their level of CHD risk and for persistence to treatment.

Methods

A post hoc analysis was conducted based on a Cochrane review on statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Five-year NNTs were calculated separately from randomized clinical trials (RCTs), including 'lower' and 'higher' risk populations (CHD mean event rates of 3.7 and 14.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively). NNTs were adjusted for 5-year persistence to treatment using a value of 65%.

Results

Persistence-adjusted 5-year NNTs to prevent one CHD for the lower and higher CHD risk categories were 146 [95% confidence interval (CI): 117–211] and 53 (95% CI: 39–88) respectively, values 25% and 15% higher than their unadjusted counterpart (117, 95% CI: 94–167 and 46, 95% CI: 34–78).

Conclusions

Five-year NNTs for statins to prevent a first CHD is almost three times higher in those at lower versus higher risk populations. Reporting combined results from RCTs including subjects at different cardiovascular risks should be avoided. Individualizing the risk of CHD should orient family physicians and their patients in their choice of preventive approaches and generate more realistic expectations about compliance and outcomes.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) = 0 — statin initiation guidance and expected benefit: In adults 40–75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 70–189 mg/dL and without diabetes, active cigarette smoking or a family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it is reasonable to defer statin initiation in those with CAC = 0, and in adults age 76–80 years in whom the statin decision is uncertain, it is reasonable to use CAC = 0 as a factor favoring avoidance of statin therapy. The absolute ASCVD risk reduction with statin therapy is proportional to the CAC score, and in an analysis projecting number needed to treat (NNT), for those with CAC = 0 the NNT with rosuvastatin 10 mg daily for 5.6 years was 206, compared to 50 for CAC ≥ 100; registry data indicate patients with CAC = 0 receive minimal to no near-term benefit, and key points state that in the absence of diabetes mellitus, active cigarette smoking or a family history of premature ASCVD, statin therapy in those with CAC = 0 is associated with limited short to intermediate-term ASCVD risk reduction benefit.

Lipoprotein and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels in high-risk subgroups

At study closure (median follow-up 1.8 years; maximal follow-up 5 years), the occurrence of MI/stroke/cardiovascular death was lower among high-risk subjects allocated to rosuvastatin compared with placebo (HR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.27–0.93 for Framingham risk score > 20%; HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43–0.78 for SCORE risk ≥ 5% extrapolated model; HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.32–0.68 for SCORE risk ≥ 5% capped model; Figure 1, Table 3). The proportional reduction in MI/stroke/cardiovascular death with rosuvastatin was similar for patients with Framingham risk score above or below 20% (P for interaction = 0.95), or SCORE risk above or below 5% (P for interaction = 0.37 capped model, 0.25 extrapolated model).

In the J ustification for the U se of Statins in P rimary Prevention: An I ntervention T rial E valuating R osuvastatin (JUPITER) study, the effect of CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) on the occurrence of major cardiovascular (CV) disease events was assessed in 17,802 men (≥ 50 years) and women (≥ 60 years) who had no clinically evident cardiovascular disease, LDL‑C levels < 130 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/l) and hs‑CRP levels ≥ 2 mg/L.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statin intensity and LDL-C lowering in primary prevention describes that an RCT enrolling men ≥ 55 years and women ≥ 65 years with at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor had placebo 10-year 'hard ASCVD' risk 8.7% and expanded endpoint 10%, and after 5.6 years rosuvastatin 10 mg per day produced significant absolute risk reduction. If maximal ASCVD risk reduction is desired, it is reasonable to use a high-intensity statin to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with increased benefit especially when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 20%. In JUPITER, men ≥ 50 and women ≥ 60 with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2.0 mg/L and LDL-C < 130 mg/dL assigned rosuvastatin 20 mg per day achieved a median LDL-C reduction of 50% and highly significant ASCVD risk reduction at 1.9 years, and the magnitude of percent LDL-C reduction achieved determined benefit.

### Primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention: optimally active, agile, and accountable [^23044212]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) affects 24 million adults (1 in every 10) in the United States. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a main causal risk factor for ASCVD, such that there is an estimated 22% relative risk reduction of ASCVD events for every 39 mg/dL LDL-C lowering with statin therapy. Statins remain the foundation of ASCVD prevention and likely confer pleiotropic effects beyond lipid-lowering. Nonetheless, challenges remain with respect to the optimal implementation of guideline-directed approaches to statin initiation.

The 2018 Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol provides a Class I recommendation for the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL as well as those with an intermediate risk (7.5–20%), or high risk (≥ 20%) based on the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) risk calculator. Among select adults with a borderline risk (5–7.5%) or all adults with an intermediate risk (7.5%-20%), there is a Class IIa recommendation to measure coronary artery calcium (CAC) to facilitate clinician-patient risk discussions regarding consideration of statin therapy for primary prevention. Measurement of CAC has been shown to help reclassify risk and better identify those most likely to derive net clinical benefit from statin therapy, as the 10-year number needed to treat to prevent 1 ASCVD event is more than 2-fold lower for statin-eligible candidates with incident CAC vs long-term absence of CAC.

### Statin trials, cardiovascular events, and Coronary artery calcification: implications for a trial-based approach to statin therapy in Mesa [^eca5b6fe]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) could be used to optimize statin allocation among individuals for whom trial-based evidence supports efficacy of statin therapy.

Background

Recently, allocation of statins was proposed for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) based on proven efficacy from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of statin therapy, a so-called trial-based approach.

Methods

The study used data from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) with 5,600 men and women, 45 to 84 years of age, and free of clinical ASCVD, lipid-lowering therapy, or missing information for risk factors at baseline examination.

Results

During 10 years' follow-up, 354 ASCVD and 219 hard coronary heart disease (CHD) events occurred. Based on enrollment criteria for 7 RCTs of statin therapy in primary prevention, 73% of MESA participants (91% of those > 55 years of age) were eligible for statin therapy according to a trial-based approach. Among those individuals, CAC = 0 was common (44%) and was associated with low rates of ASCVD and CHD (3.9 and 1.7, respectively, per 1,000 person-years). There was a graded increase in event rates with increasing CAC score, and in individuals with CAC > 100 (27% of participants) the rates of ASCVD and CHD were 18.9 and 12.7, respectively. Consequently, the estimated number needed to treat (NNT) in 10 years to prevent 1 event varied greatly according to CAC score. For ASCVD events, the NNT was 87 for CAC = 0 and 19 for CAC > 100. For CHD events, the NNT was 197 for CAC = 0 and 28 for CAC > 100.

Conclusions

Most MESA participants qualified for trial-based primary prevention with statins. Among the individuals for whom trial-based evidence supports efficacy of statin therapy, CAC = 0 and CAC > 100 were common and associated with low and high cardiovascular risks, respectively. This information may guide shared decision making aimed at targeting evidence-based statins to those who are likely to benefit the most.

### Rosuvastatin calcium [^fd061aa5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary end point was a composite end point consisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major CV events: CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or an arterial revascularization procedure.

Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of major CV events (252 events in the placebo group vs. 142 events in the rosuvastatin group) with a statistically significant (p < 0.001) relative risk reduction of 44% and absolute risk reduction of 1.2% (see Figure 1). The risk reduction for the primary end point was consistent across the following predefined subgroups: age, sex, race, smoking status, family history of premature CHD, body mass index, LDL‑C, HDL‑C, and hsCRP levels.

Figure 1. Time to First Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Events in JUPITER

The individual components of the primary end point are presented in Figure 3. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and arterial revascularization procedures. There were no significant treatment differences between the rosuvastatin and placebo groups for death due to cardiovascular causes or hospitalizations for unstable angina.

Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (6 fatal events and 62 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 9 fatal events and 22 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin-treated subjects) and the risk of stroke (6 fatal events and 58 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 3 fatal events and 30 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin-treated subjects).

### Statin use in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease according to 5 major guidelines for sensitivity, specificity, and number needed to treat [^dc88772d]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Five major guidelines on statin use for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) have been published since 2014: the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE; 2014), US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF; 2016), Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS; 2016), European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS; 2016), and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA; 2018).

Objective

To compare the sensitivity, specificity, and estimated number needed to treat (NNT10) to prevent 1 ASCVD event in 10 years according to statin criteria from the 5 guidelines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Population-based contemporary cohort study. Analyses were performed in the Copenhagen General Population Study, with a mean follow-up time of 10.9 years. We included 45 750 individuals aged 40 to 75 years. The participants were enrolled between 2003 and 2009 and were all free of ASCVD at baseline. Data were analyzed between January 1, 2019, and August 4, 2019.

Exposures

Statin treatment according to guideline criteria. We assumed a 25% relative reduction of ASCVD events per 38 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity and specificity for ASCVD events and the NNT10 to prevent 1 ASCVD event according to guideline criteria.

Results

Median age at baseline examination was 56 years, and 43% of participants were men (n = 19 870 of 45 750). During follow-up, we observed 4156 ASCVD events. Overall, 44% of individuals in Copenhagen General Population Study were statin eligible with CCS (n = 19 953 of 45 750), 42% with ACC/AHA (n = 19 400 of 45 750), 40% with NICE (n = 19 400 of 45 750), 31% with USPSTF (n = 13 966 of 45 750), and 15% with ESC/EAS (n = 6870 of 45 750). Sensitivity and specificity for ASCVD events were 68% (n = 2815 of 4156) and 59% (n = 24 456 of 41 594) for CCS, 70% (n = 2889 of 4156) and 60% (n = 25 083 of 41 594) for ACC/AHA, 68% (n = 2815 of 4156) and 63% (n = 26 213 of 41 594) for NICE, 57% (n = 2377 of 4156) and 72% (n = 30 005 of 41 594) for USPSTF, and 24% (n = 1001 of 4156) and 86% (n = 35 725 of 41 594) for ESC/EAS. The NNT10 to prevent 1 ASCVD using moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy, respectively, was 32 and 21 for CCS criteria, 30 and 20 for ACC/AHA criteria, 30 and 20 for NICE criteria, 27 and 18 for USPSTF criteria, and 29 and 20 for ESC/EAS criteria.

Conclusions and Relevance

With similar NNT10 to prevent 1 event, the CCS, ACC/AHA, and NICE guidelines correctly assign statin therapy to many more of the individuals who later develop ASCVD compared with the USPSTF and ESC/EAS guidelines. Our results therefore suggest that the CCS, ACC/AHA, or NICE guidelines may be preferred for primary prevention.

Discussion

Statins are recommended for the primary and secondary prevention of CHD and stroke. 5, 6, 7 Given projections for a rapidly growing burden of cardiovascular disease in the United States, 32 the role of statins merits attention. In the United States, there are more statin‐eligible adults not receiving statins than adults reporting statin use (Table 2). If all statin‐eligible adults were treated, or roughly 44.8 million individuals, then ≈243 589 ASCVD events annually or 2 435 890 events over 10 years (Table 4) could be prevented. The number of ASCVD events prevented is ≈78% of the Healthy People 2020 goal for cardiovascular disease prevention. Implementing the 2013 Cholesterol Guideline in statin‐eligible US adults is also relatively efficient with ARR of 5.4% and 10‐year NNT of 18.

Treating only statin‐eligible adults with 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% reduces the number of adults treated by 12.6 million individuals or 28.2% from 44.8 to 32.2 million. Yet, the number of ASCVD events prevented annually falls only 10.5% from 243 589 to 217 974, which is ≈70% of the Healthy People 2020 goal. For this higher‐risk group, ARR is 6.8% with 10‐year NNT of 15. The 2013 Cholesterol Guideline is less efficient for untreated, statin‐eligible adults with 10‐year ASCVD risk < 7.5%, that is, treating 12.6 million adults in this group would prevent ≈256 147 events over 10 years or 25 615 annually, with ARR of 2.0% and 10‐year NNT of 49.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular… [^960225de]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Three trials that evaluated different statin intensities were not adequately powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes Indirect comparisons of trials stratified according to intensity of therapy did not indicate a dose-dependent association Some imprecision Most trials evaluated moderate-intensity statin therapy Importance A 2016 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease was associated with reduced mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance In adults at increased CVD risk but without prior CVD events, statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality and CVD events. Benefits of statin therapy appear to be present across diverse demographic and clinical populations, with consistent relative benefits in groups defined by demographic and clinical characteristics.

In 2016 the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that clinicians initiate statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with at least 1 CVD risk factor and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk 10% or greater and selectively offer statins in those with a 10-year risk of 7. 5% to less than 10%. The recommendations were based on evidence that statins are associated with reduced risk of mortality and CVD events, with greater absolute benefits in persons at higher baseline risk. There was insufficient evidence to assess outcomes of statins in adults 76 years or older. 1 This evidence report was conducted to update the 2016 USPSTF review to inform the USPSTF for an updated recommendation statement on statins for primary prevention. 1, 2 This review focused on adults 40 years or older; the USPSTF addressed lipid screening in children and adolescents as a separate topic.

### Coronary artery calcium score as a graded decision tool [^69757027]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies have aimed to determine the appropriate intensity of treatment for individuals with elevated CAC scores who have not experienced ASCVD events when compared to those who have survived an ASCVD event. In other words, at what level of CAC do adults in the primary prevention setting have a risk comparable to those with prior ASCVD events, and thus warrant more aggressive risk factor reduction (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Important Studies Examining the Use of Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring for ASCVD Risk Stratification

AHA = American Heart Association; ASA = aspirin; ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CT = computed tomography; CVD = cardiovascular disease; MACE = major adverse cardiovascular events; NNH = number needed to harm; NNT = number needed to treat.

In 2014, Martin et alassessed the role of CAC scoring in guiding statin therapy allocation based on absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in 5,534 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study who were not taking dyslipidemia medications at baseline. Participants were categorized based on their CAC scores (> 0 or ≥ 100) and the presence of lipid abnormalities and the main outcome measure was incident CVD events. Over a median follow-up of 7.6 years, individuals with CAC ≥ 100 had CVD rates similar to secondary prevention populations across the spectrum of dyslipidemia, suggesting that CAC scoring can align statin therapy with absolute CVD risk.

Subsequently, Peng et alexamined the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) seen in patients with CAC scores of 0, 1 to 99, 100 to 399, 400 to 999, and ≥ 1,000 over a mean follow-up period of 13.6 years. Those with CAC ≥ 1,000 had an event rate similar to the average stable treated secondary prevention patient in the FOURIER (Evolocumab and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease) trial. Another study by Dzaye et al analyzed patients from the CAC Consortium who were over 50 years old with a 10-year ASCVD risk > 7.5% (n = 20,207). The annualized ASCVD mortality rate among FOURIER participants corresponded to a CAC score of 781 (418–1,467) and a CAC score of 255 (162–394) corresponded to an ASCVD mortality rate equivalent to the lowest risk FOURIER subgroup.

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

Bottom Line

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### Effectiveness of statins as primary prevention in people with different cardiovascular risk: a population-based cohort study [^e0998b5e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This observational retrospective study aimed at estimating statin effectiveness according to CHD risk levels in a general population without previous cardiovascular disease. We found that statin treatment was effective in preventing ASCVD across the range of coronary risk in people with high adherence to therapy (MPR > 70%). Specifically, statin therapy decreased ASCVD risk by 30% and 26% in individuals with cardiovascular risk of 7.5–9.9% and 10–19.9%, respectively. Treatment with statins also decreased all‐cause mortality by 27% in those at highest risk (10–19.9% category). We found no clinically relevant effect size of statin treatment in people with low adherence to therapy (MPR < 70%), irrespective of their CHD risk.

Our finding that statins effectively reduced ASCVD in individuals with 10‐year CHD risk 10–19.9% who adhered to treatment is consistent with clinical trials and systematic reviews aimed at evaluating statin efficacy in primary prevention 6, 7 and in line with recent guidelines. 1, 2, 3, 4 In addition, our estimate of 62 as the 5‐year NNT to prevent one ASCVD event in the 10–19.9% risk category was similar to the results of the Cholesterol Trialists Collaborators' meta‐analysis in primary prevention, which included individuals with 10‐year coronary risk of about 15%, similar to the individuals in our 10–19.9% category. 6 Hence, statin therapy may be useful in this CHD risk category.

We found that statin treatment effectively reduced relative risk in the 7.5–9.9% category, similar to that of the cited meta‐analysis with a pooled population comparable to ours in this 10‐year risk category. 5 Although our 5‐year NNT estimate in this risk category was about 20% higher compared to the 10–19.9% category (75 vs. 62), most individuals with an estimated CHD risk 7.5–9.9% could benefit from statin treatment, in line with US guidelines. 1, 2 Additional research is needed to define strategies that improve the predictive ability of risk functions by considering new risk factors 13 and/or by individualized consideration of LDL cholesterol levels or response to treatment. 14, 15

Patient management strategies must take into account the net benefit of absolute risk reduction, 10, 14 long‐term treatment safety, costs, and patient preference 9, 16 in the 10–19.9% and 7.5–9.9% categories.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^23a6256f]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin therapy are outlined as follows: In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When CAC is measured to inform treatment, if the coronary artery calcium score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years when higher-risk conditions are absent; if the coronary artery calcium score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the coronary artery calcium score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

The study population had an estimated baseline coronary heart disease risk of 11.6% over 10 years based on the Framingham risk criteria and included a high percentage of patients with additional risk factors such as hypertension (58%), low HDL-C levels (23%), cigarette smoking (16%), or a family history of premature CHD (12%). Patients had a median baseline LDL-C of 108 mg/dL and hsCRP of 4.3 mg/L. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 8901) or rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily (n = 8901) and were followed for a mean duration of 2 years. The JUPITER study was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to meeting predefined stopping rules for efficacy in rosuvastatin-treated subjects.

6 DIABETES AND PRIMARY PREVENTION USING CAC

Although diabetes mellitus is a well‐established ASCVD risk factor, there remains significant individual risk variability among those with diabetes. CAC has an important role in improving risk stratification in patients with diabetes. However, due to insufficient prospective data, the "power of zero" is not recommended to routinely "de‐risk" patients with diabetes aged 40 years and older to avoid statin therapy. Currently, guidelines recommend moderate‐intensity statin therapy for those with type 2 diabetes aged 40–75, and high‐intensity statin therapy for those with diabetes and multiple ASCVD risk factors. That being said, a CAC score of 0 or a low percentile for one's age and gender can help guide shared decision‐making in patients with statin‐associated symptoms, polypharmacy, or a strong preference to forgo statins.

With regard to glycemic therapies, the glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonizts (GLP1‐RAs) and sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have both shown reductions in ASCVD events in patients with diabetes. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of seven trials of GLP1‐RAs in patients with diabetes found significant reductions in MACE and each component outcome (cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke). One of these randomized placebo‐controlled trials, the 2019 REWIND trial, showed a statistically significant reduction of ∼11% in MACE in patients ages > 50 with type 2 diabetes randomized to weekly dulaglutide compared to placebo at after a mean follow‐up of 5.4 years. Importantly, this trial showed equal relative reductions in both the 6221‐subject primary prevention cohort as well as the secondary prevention cohort. At the same time, the NNT was much lower in the secondary prevention cohort, with a greater absolute reduction. This may indicate that the costly GLP1‐RAs may not be cost‐effective at current prices solely for the primary prevention of ASCVD unless they have significant subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.

### Primary prevention of cardiovascular mortality and events with statin treatments: a network meta-analysis involving more than 65, 000 patients [^fc6a1a63]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in primary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Background

The role of statins is well established for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) clinical events and mortality. Little is known of their role in primary cardiovascular event prevention.

Methods

We conducted comprehensive searches of 10 electronic databases from inception to May 2008. We contacted study investigators and maintained a comprehensive bibliography of statin studies. We included randomized trials of at least 12-month duration in predominantly primary prevention populations. Two reviewers independently extracted data in duplicate. We performed random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression, calculated optimal information size, and conducted a mixed-treatment comparison analysis.

Results

We included 20 randomized clinical trials. We pooled 19 trials (n = 63,899) for all-cause mortality and found a relative risk (RR) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87 to 0.99, p = 0.03 [I(2) = 5%, 95% CI: 0% to 51%]). Eighteen trials (n = 59,469) assessed cardiovascular deaths (RR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.98, p = 0.01 [I(2) = 0%, 95% CI: 0% to 41%]). Seventeen trials (n = 53,371) found an RR of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.77 to 0.95, p = 0.004 [I(2) = 61%, 95% CI: 38% to 77%]) for major cardiovascular events, and 17 trials (n = 52,976) assessed myocardial infarctions (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.95, p = 0.01 [I(2) = 59%, 95% CI: 24% to 74%]). Incidence of cancer was not elevated in 10 trials (n = 45,469) (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.11, p = 0.59 [I(2) = 0%, 95% CI: 0% to 46%]), nor was rhabdomyolysis (RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.25 to 3.83, p = 0.96 [I(2) = 0%, 95% CI: 0% to 40%]). Our analysis included a sufficient sample to reliably answer our primary outcome of CVD mortality.

Conclusions

Statins have a clear role in primary prevention of CVD mortality and major events.

### Effectiveness of statins as primary prevention in people with different cardiovascular risk: a population-based cohort study [^1a854558]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes and statin effectiveness

For 2006–2014, overall unadjusted incidences per 1,000 person‐years at risk (PYAR) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), CHD, ischemic (IS), and all‐cause mortality were 2.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.93–3.03), 2.60 (95% CI 2.55–2.64), 1.75 (95% CI 1.71–1.79), and 3.44 (95% CI 3.39–3.49), respectively. Unadjusted incidences and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all outcomes are shown by CHD risk categories in Table 3. Statins showed a protective effect in individuals with MPR 70% for ASCVD across all risk groups, and this effect was significant in the risk groups defined from 7.5% through 9.9% and 10–19.9%; however, individuals with MPR < 70% in any CHD risk category showed a lower and nonsignificant effect size reduction in ASCVD.

Table 3
Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of incident cardiovascular events and mortality and the 5‐year number needed to treat to prevent one event by statins use, by patients' coronary risk

Statins protected individuals with MPR 70% from CHD in the two risk groups defined from 5–9.9% and in the 10–19.9% risk group; however, individuals with MPR < 70% showed no clinically relevant reduction in CHD in any risk category.

Furthermore, no significant differences in IS were found in any risk category, regardless of MPR. All‐cause mortality reduction was statistically significant only in individuals with MPR 70% and 10‐19.9% risk (0.73 (0.59–0.91)). Variables not balanced between statins users and nonusers were further included in the models but the results did not change (data not shown). Standard adjusted models showed similar results (Table S6).

Overall, 5‐year number needed to treat (NNT) was lower at higher levels of risk, ranging from 470 in the group with lowest CHD risk to 62 in the highest risk group.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^4160dc9d]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Effects of rosuvastatin on myocardial infarction/stroke/cardiovascular death in high-risk patients, according to baseline characteristics. The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for rosuvastatin when compared with placebo are shown for patients with Framingham risk score > 20% and systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% (extrapolated and capped models). Size of the point estimate rectangle is proportional to the number of clinical events. The dashed vertical line indicates the relative risk reduction for the entire trial cohort. Also shown are P- values for the test of an interaction between the composite endpoint and categories within each subgroup.

In the high-risk patients, serious adverse events were reported with similar frequency in rosuvastatin and placebo-allocated patients (Table 4). A small excess of myalgia was reported with rosuvastatin in patients with Framingham risk score > 20% (rosuvastatin 5.9% and placebo 5.3%) or SCORE risk ≥ 5% (rosuvastatin 7.9%, placebo 6.5% for the extrapolated model; 7.4 vs. 5.8% for the capped model). Myopathy, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis were reported with similar frequency in the two treatment groups. In the entire JUPITER cohort, investigator-reported diabetes, a non-adjudicated outcome, was more frequent with rosuvastatin (rosuvastatin 3.0% and placebo 2.4%; P = 0.01). Investigator-reported diabetes was not consistently more frequent with rosuvastatin in the higher-risk patients (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.41–1.19, P = 0.19 for Framingham risk score > 20%; HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.86–1.43, P = 0.43 for extrapolated SCORE risk ≥ 5%; HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.72–1.36, P = 0.95 for capped SCORE risk). At 2 years following randomization, a 0.1% greater increase in glycosylated haemoglobin was observed with rosuvastatin compared with placebo (P < 0.001 vs. placebo for the high-risk groups). However, on-treatment fasting glucose levels were similar in the two treatment groups (P = 0.95 vs. placebo for Framingham risk score > 20%; P = 0.19 for extrapolated SCORE risk ≥ 5%; P = 0.52 for the capped SCORE model).

### Estimating treatment effects for individual patients based on the results of randomised clinical trials [^b2aa3c00]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To predict treatment effects for individual patients based on data from randomised trials, taking rosuvastatin treatment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease as an example, and to evaluate the net benefit of making treatment decisions for individual patients based on a predicted absolute treatment effect.

Setting

As an example, data were used from the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention (JUPITER) trial, a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of rosuvastatin 20 mg daily versus placebo on the occurrence of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularisation, admission to hospital for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes). Population 17,802 healthy men and women who had low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of less than 3.4 mmol/L and high sensitivity C reactive protein levels of 2.0 mg/L or more.

Methods

Data from the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention trial were used to predict rosuvastatin treatment effect for individual patients based on existing risk scores (Framingham and Reynolds) and on a newly developed prediction model. We compared the net benefit of prediction based rosuvastatin treatment (selective treatment of patients whose predicted treatment effect exceeds a decision threshold) with the net benefit of treating either everyone or no one.

Results

The median predicted 10 year absolute risk reduction for cardiovascular events was 4.4% (interquartile range 2.6–7.0%) based on the Framingham risk score, 4.2% (2.5–7.1%) based on the Reynolds score, and 3.9% (2.5–6.1%) based on the newly developed model (optimal fit model). Prediction based treatment was associated with more net benefit than treating everyone or no one, provided that the decision threshold was between 2% and 7%, and thus that the number willing to treat (NWT) to prevent one cardiovascular event over 10 years was between 15 and 50.

Conclusions

Data from randomised trials can be used to predict treatment effect in terms of absolute risk reduction for individual patients, based on a newly developed model or, if available, existing risk scores. The value of such prediction of treatment effect for medical decision making is conditional on the NWT to prevent one outcome event. Trial registration number Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00239681.

### Should C-reactive protein be a target of therapy? [^dc8809c8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CRP AS A TARGET FOR THERAPY

The largest study to suggest an integral role for CRP as a target for therapy in primary prevention of CV disease is the recent Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial. The investigators randomized 17,802 men ≥ 50 years of age and women ≥ 60 years of age with low LDL cholesterol levels < 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L and no history of CV disease or diabetes to 20 mg rosuvastatin daily or placebo. The primary end point was the first occurrence of MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, arterial revascularization, or CV death.

JUPITER was terminated early because of evidence of a reduction in CV morbidity and mortality in patients treated with rosuvastatin compared with placebo. During the 1.9-year median follow-up duration (maximum follow-up period 5 years), rosuvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol by 50% and hs-CRP by 37%, and this result was associated with a 44% reduction in the JUPITER primary trial end point (P < 0.00001; 95% CI 0.46–0.69). Moreover, the NNT extrapolated out to 5 years to prevent one major event was only 25, a value that is less than that associated with the use of statin therapy for primary prevention among individuals with more overt hyperlipidemia (Fig. 1). Thus, despite targeting a population outside current guidelines and with low levels of LDL cholesterol, JUPITER demonstrated a magnitude of effect larger than that of almost all prior statin trials. Based on the results of the JUPITER study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2010 agreed to broader labeling for rosuvastatin. As per the FDA, rosuvastatin is currently approved for the reduction of risk for stroke, MI, and revascularization procedures in individuals who have normal LDL cholesterol levels and no clinically evident CHD but who do have an increased risk based on age, CRP levels, and the presence of at least one additional CVD risk factor.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^853a9ff4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011) and in light of new data an update of this review is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Methods

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), revascularisation, change in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data.

Main Results

The latest search found four new trials and updated follow-up data on three trials included in the original review. Eighteen randomised control trials (19 trial arms; 56,934 participants) were included. Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94); as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and combined fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72) was also seen. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription. Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life. Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta-analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower (< 1% per year) risk of a major cardiovascular event.

Authors' Conclusions

Reductions in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events among people without evidence of CVD treated with statins.

The published literature states an unequivocal mortality benefit for secondary prevention – patients with established heart disease (absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%, NNT 83) over 5 years. However, the same does not apply in primary prevention, especially in individuals at low risk. Independent analysis of the largest and most comprehensive meta-analysis carried out by the CTT Collaboration revealed no mortality benefit in individuals with a < 20% risk of developing CVD in the next 10 years. With no significant mortality benefit the question then moves to non-mortality benefits, and potential harms. The same large analysis suggested a 1 in 140 risk reduction in non-fatal heart attack or stroke in those with < 10% risk of CVD over 10 years but no reduction in serious illness. For truly informed decision making in the prescription of statins, we believe it is an ethical imperative to estimate both the number needed to treat (NNT) and also the number needed to harm (NNH).

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment — adults who are 40 to 75 years of age and are being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year ASCVD risk estimation and have a clinician-patient risk discussion before starting pharmacological therapy; assessing for other risk-enhancing factors can help guide decisions, as can coronary artery calcium scanning.

Discussion

JUPITER investigated the effect of rosuvastatin 20 mg daily compared with placebo on major cardiovascular events in a population not requiring treatment under guidelines in effect in 2003, but at an increased cardiovascular risk on the basis of age and elevated hs C-reactive protein. To provide European practitioners access to post hoc subgroup data that were influential to the European health authorities, in this analysis, we limited the target population to select an even higher risk group using two global risk assessment algorithms, Framingham and SCORE. In these higher risk subgroups, rosuvastatin lowered LDL-C, triglycerides, and hs C-reactive protein and raised HDL-C, consistent with effects observed for the entire cohort. Rosuvastatin reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of MI/stroke/cardiovascular death by 50% in the high-risk Framingham group (P = 0.028 vs. placebo), 43% in the high-risk SCORE group using the extrapolated model (P = 0.0003) and 53% (P < 0.0001) using the capped model, consistent with the 47% reduction observed for the entire cohort. Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the known safety profile of rosuvastatin.

Strengths of this analysis include the randomized, placebo-controlled design, broad geographic representation including a substantial number of Europeans, and inclusion of large numbers of women and ethnic minority participants. A limitation is the post hoc selection of the higher risk subgroups, which was undertaken in response to health authority requests. For example, analysis of JUPITER subgroups by SCORE strata was not pre-specified and since SCORE by design is limited to those under age 65, we needed to extrapolate findings for the many JUPITER participants over this age cut-off that clearly benefited from rosuvastatin. The subgroups by baseline characteristics in Figure 3 are drawn from within the subgroups of high-risk patients; as such, limited conclusions can be drawn from these data. Neither the Framingham nor the SCORE models include hs C-reactive protein evaluation; as all participants in JUPITER had hs C-reactive protein levels > 2 mg/L and as elevated hs C-reactive protein has been shown to have a magnitude of risk prediction at least as large as that of elevated cholesterol, it is likely that both the Framingham and the SCORE systematically underestimate the true risk of JUPITER participants.

Table 1
Characteristics of US Adults Aged 40 to 75 and Eligible for Targeted Primary Prevention With Statin Therapy a, by Baseline 10‐Year ASCVD Risk and Expected ARR From Moderate‐Intensity Statins

Compared with current treatment patterns, we estimate that benefit‐targeted prescribing of moderate‐intensity statins at an expected ARR threshold of 2.3% would reduce ASCVD events in the US population by 5.7% (95% CI, 4.8–6.7%), at an average NNT 10 of 24.2 (23.1–25.4). In contrast, the impact of risk‐targeted prescribing of moderate‐intensity statins at a baseline risk threshold of 7.5% in the same population is smaller — 4.4% (3.7–5.2%) — but the average NNT 10 is also lower — 21.2 (20.4–22.0), indicating better average prevention efficiency (Table 2).

USPSTF assessment of magnitude of net benefit — The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit; with an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit and the decision to initiate therapy should depend on individual patient preference; and in adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms.

### Guidelines versus trial-evidence for statin use in primary prevention: the copenhagen general population study [^65133947]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Guideline-recommended use of risk calculators to select for statin therapy in primary prevention has never been tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We determined the extent to which guideline-based statin recommendations from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), Canadian Cardiovascular Society(CCS), UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) is supported by available evidence from RCTs.

Methods

79,171 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study who were free of ASCVD and statin use at baseline were included. RCT evidence supporting guideline-recommended statin allocation and the estimated number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one ASCVD event were assessed.

Results

During 8.2 years of follow-up, 4031 ASCVD events occurred. Of individuals eligible for statin therapy with the ACC/AHA, CCS, NICE and ESC/EAS guidelines, 86%, 88%, 88% and 84% had direct RCT evidence of statin efficacy, respectively (guideline-positive&RCT-positive). This group represented 26–37% of all 79,171 individuals, while guideline-positive&RCT-negative individuals represented 5–7%, guideline-negative&RCT-positive individuals 28–39%, and guideline-negative&RCT-negative individuals represented 30–31%. The ASCVD events per 1000 person-years were 11.4–12.7 (guideline-positive&RCT-positive), 6.3–8.0 (guideline-positive&RCT-negative), 4.2–5.2 (guideline-negative&RCT-positive), and 2.3–2.5 (guideline-negative&RCT-negative), respectively, while the corresponding NNT to prevent one event in 10 years using high-intensity statin were 19–21, 30–32, 48–60, and 105–125, respectively.

Conclusions

The far majority of individuals eligible for guideline-recommended primary prevention with statins have direct RCT evidence supporting statin use. Allocating statins based on guideline-criteria is more efficient with lower NNT for preventing ASCVD events than allocating statin therapy based solely on RCT evidence.

Primary Prevention of CV Disease

In the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study, the effect of CRESTOR on the occurrence of major CV disease events was assessed in 17,802 males (≥ 50 years) and females (≥ 60 years) who had no clinically evident CV disease, LDL‑C levels < 130 mg/dL and hsCRP levels ≥ 2 mg/L. The study population had an estimated baseline coronary heart disease risk of 11.6% over 10 years based on the Framingham risk criteria and included a high percentage of patients with additional risk factors such as hypertension (58%), low HDL‑C levels (23%), cigarette smoking (16%), or a family history of premature CHD (12%). Patients had a median baseline LDL‑C of 108 mg/dL and hsCRP of 4.3 mg/L. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 8901) or CRESTOR 20 mg once daily (n = 8901) and were followed for a mean duration of 2 years. The JUPITER study was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to meeting predefined stopping rules for efficacy in CRESTOR-treated subjects.

The primary end point was a composite end point consisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major CV events: CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or an arterial revascularization procedure.

Table 2
Impact and Efficiency Estimates for Risk‐Targeted Versus Benefit‐Targeted Prescribing of Moderate‐Intensity Statins

A more‐direct comparison of prevention efficiency for different targeting strategies can be attained by choosing equivalent‐impact thresholds. To match the impact of benefit‐targeting at a threshold of 2.3%, we can lower the risk‐targeting threshold to ≈5% (Figure 2), which would produce 5.6% impact (4.7–6.6%). At this threshold, the average NNT 10 is nearly equivalent — 24.6 (23.5–25.8; compare with 24.2 as above) — though the maximum NNT 10 becomes much higher — 180 (compare with 43.5; Table 2).

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurement — intermediate-risk adults and statin decision thresholds: In adults at intermediate risk, coronary artery calcium measurement can be effective for meaningfully reclassifying risk in a large proportion of individuals, and in such intermediate-risk adults, those with coronary artery calcium = 100 AU or coronary artery calcium ≥ 75th percentile have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event rates for which initiation of statin therapy is reasonable. Those with coronary artery calcium scores of zero appear to have 10-year event rates in a lower range for which statin therapy may be of limited value. For those with coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 99 AU, 10-year ASCVD event rates are 3.8%, 6.5%, and 8.3% for adults 45 to 54, 55 to 64, and 65 to 74 years of age, respectively, indicating that risk reclassification is modest for individuals with scores of 1 to 99; therefore, for patients with coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 99, it is reasonable to repeat the risk discussion, and if these patients remain untreated, repeat CAC measurement in 5 years may have some value, but data are limited.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rationale — primary prevention statins in adults with risk factors: In adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (eg, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking), the USPSTF finds convincing evidence of benefit and concludes with moderate certainty that net benefit is at least moderate when the estimated 10-year CVD event risk is 10% or greater and at least small when risk is 7.5% to less than 10%. The USPSTF states that harms in adults 40 to 75 years are at most small and that evidence is inadequate for benefits and harms in adults 76 years or older; for the small-benefit group, it states the decision to initiate statin therapy should depend on individual patient preference. The USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms for adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD.

and 3 large cohort studies. 1, 2 The evidence review found that statin therapy use in patients for primary prevention was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, revascularization, and the composite cardiovascular outcome. 1, 2 Insufficient data were available for older adults, especially individuals older than 75 years. Importantly, the evidence review did not find any significant harm associated with statin therapy, suggesting a significant overall net benefit in primary prevention in appropriate groups of individuals. 1, 2. The evidence review2 led to 3 clinical recommendations1 that are consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendations on this topic. A B statement was made that clinicians initiate statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with at least 1 CVD risk factor and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk 10% or greater.

For example, the 10-year hard ASCVD event rates in 3 trials of pure primary prevention showed benefits of statin therapy ranging from 5. 1% to
7. 6%. 4 Indeed, statin therapy shows efficacy at even lower 10-year ASCVD risk levels, and there is some indication that the relative benefits of statin therapy may be higher among individuals with lower 10-year ASCVD risk. 5 For most therapies, treating individuals with lower ASCVD risk comes at a price of treating a large number of individuals for a longer period of time. Most patients who initiate preventive therapies use those therapies for a much longer period of time. It is important to note that although most RCTs of statin therapy by design only evaluated a first ASCVD event, preventive therapies also are associated with reduced risk of second and subsequent cardiovascular events.

The disability associated with first and subsequent myocardial infarction or stroke is not fully captured in these RCTs, given their short follow-up, but is extremely important to patients. Despite similar relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction will be higher; therefore, the numbers needed to treat will be lower for these high-risk primary prevention groups with a larger LDL-C reduction. Some of the gaps in our understanding may be addressed as ongoing studies are completed.

### A "poly-portfolio" for secondary prevention: a strategy to reduce subsequent events by up to 97% over five years [^ad4cc9ba]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

A "polypill" for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease has been proposed. We estimated the projected benefit of a secondary prevention "poly-portfolio" strategy, including pharmacologic and lifestyle approaches for those with coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke. Based on recent clinical trial results and clinical guidelines, combinations of a high-dose statin, low to standard doses of antihypertensive therapy, aspirin, omega-3 fish oil, cardiac rehabilitation, and diet were evaluated. Patients with CHD, post-myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke were projected to experience 84%, 91%, and 77% reductions, respectively, in CHD events from a pharmacologic approach. Numbers of those needed to treat (NNT) for 5 years were 9 to 11 to prevent 1 CHD event, and 21 to prevent 1 stroke. Post-MI patients were projected to experience a 93% reduction in the risk of CHD death (NNT 16) from a pharmacologic approach and a 97% reduction in the risk of CHD death (NNT 15) with the addition of lifestyle changes. A secondary prevention polyportfolio holds great promise for reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease in the highest risk patients.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^97982c01]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Justification for Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial was designed to investigate whether rosuvastatin decreased first major cardiovascular events among patients with levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL), but who were at increased cardiovascular risk due to elevated levels of high-sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein. As previously reported, after median follow-up of 1.9 years (maximum 5 years), rosuvastatin use was associated with a 54% reduction in myocardial infarction (MI), a 48% reduction in stroke, a 46% reduction in revascularization, a 43% reduction in venous thromboembolism, and a 20% reduction in total mortality. On this basis, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the use of rosuvastatin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events among JUPITER eligible participants with elevated hs C-reactive protein and at least one additional risk factor. In contrast, the Dutch Medical Agency (the MEB) and 18 other European health authorities have approved rosuvastatin for the subgroup of trial participants who were considered to be at 'high risk' either on the basis of an estimated 10-year Framingham risk score > 20% or an estimated systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE) risk of ≥ 5%. As neither of these criteria were used in the design of the JUPITER trial, these post hoc data, not published previously, are likely to be of utility for European practitioners and are thus presented here.

### Twelve-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label comparison of the effects of rosuvastatin 10 mg / D and atorvastatin 10 mg / D in high-risk adults: a DISCOVERY study [^730fd4ac]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) advocate reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) levels as the primary goals. However, approximately 50% to 60% of patients fail to reach recommended cholesterol goals.

Objectives

The primary objective of this Direct Statin Comparison of LDL-C Values: An Evaluation of Rosuvastatin Therapy Compared with Atorvastatin (DISCOVERY) trial was to compare the efficacy of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors rosuvastatin calcium and atorvastatin calcium in achieving the 1998 Second Joint Task Force (JTF) of European and Other Societies on Coronary Prevention target for LDL-C. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in achieving the 1998 JTF-recommended goal for TC and modifying other lipid levels, and to compare the tolerability of the 2 statins.

Methods

This 12-week, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, parallel-group trial was conducted at 210 centers in Finland, Iceland, and Ireland. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a high risk for CHD and primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C > 3.5 mmol/L [> 135 mg/dL]) were randomized (2:1) to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg PO OD for 12 weeks. Before randomization, statin-naive patients underwent 6 weeks of dietary counseling, whereas patients receiving treatment with a starting dose of another lipid-lowering therapy but with an LDL-C level > 3.1 mmol/L (> 120 mg/dL) were switched to study drug immediately after they were determined eligible for the study Patients were assessed for fasting lipid levels at weeks 0 and 12, and the proportions of patients attaining 1998 and 2003 JTF lipid goals (1998: LDL-C, < 3.0 mmol/L [< 116 mg/dL]; TC, < 5.0 mmol/L [< 193 mg/dL]; 2003: LDL-C, < 2.5 mmol/L [< 97 mg/dL]; TC, < 4.5 mmol/L [< 174 mg/dL]) were calculated. Tolerability was monitored for the 12-week study and for an additional 36-week optional extension period.

Results

One thousand twenty-four patients were randomized to treatment (568 men, 456 women; mean age, 60.7 years). Patient demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The efficacy analysis consisted of 911 patients (504 men, 407 women; mean age, 60.7 years; mean body weight, 82.4 kg); 627 received rosuvastatin and 284 received atorvastatin. Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.05), and with a significantly greater increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P < (105). A greater proportion of patients in the rosuvastatin group compared with the atorvastatin group reached the 1998 goals for LDL-C (83.4% vs 683%; P < 0.001) and TC (76.4% vs 59.5%; P < 0.001). Also, compared with the atorvastatin group, greater proportions of patients in the rosuvastatin group achieved the 2003 JTF goals for LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.001). Both agents were well tolerated: serious drug-related events were observed in ≤ 3.0% of patients in each group, and no clinically significant differences were found between the 2 treatment groups.

Conclusions

In this study of selected patients at high risk for CHD and with primary hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin 10 mg/d for 12 weeks was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC levels compared with atorvastatin 10 mg/d. Furthermore, significantly more patients receiving rosuvastatin achieved the 1998 and 2003 JTF-recommended lipid targets compared with those receiving atorvastatin. Both agents were well tolerated.

### Effectiveness of statins as primary prevention in people with different cardiovascular risk: a population-based cohort study [^56f24e93]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

The relative benefit for protection against ASCVD in the 5–7.4% risk category in individuals with MPR 70% was mainly due to the protective effect for CHD. This finding is in accordance with the results of a recent pragmatic clinical trial in an intermediate‐risk population, defined as a 10‐year cardiovascular risk of about 10% but 10‐year CHD risk of about 5%. 7 However, the net benefit of statin treatment in the < 5% and 5–7.4% categories could be limited because of the large 5‐year NNT to prevent one event (470 and 204, respectively).

In our study, the magnitude of the statin effectiveness in preventing IS was similar to that of clinical trials and meta‐analyses. 6, 17 It is likely that the few IS events contributed to the lack of statistical significance in our results. However, the lack of significant association between statin treatment and IS was in line with previous observational data. 18

There is also great debate about the effectiveness of statins on all‐cause mortality, 6, 7, 19, 20 despite agreement that the relative risk reduction is moderate (∼10%). Our findings were consistent with this effect size in all risk categories except for the association between statins and all‐cause mortality in individuals with MPR 70% and 10–19.9% risk. The effect was greater than expected. We cannot dismiss the possibility of residual healthy‐user effect, although this was not observed in other risk categories.

About 46% of new users had a 6‐month MPR < 70%. Importantly, patients with poor adherence are more likely to have a higher incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and all‐cause mortality than adherent patients. 21 Hence, a first‐line strategy to improve statin effectiveness in primary care should be the implementation of interventions to improve adherence.

Adverse effects

Statin treatment in users with MPR 70% increased the risk of diabetes from 15% to 32% depending on risk category, consistent with results from clinical trials. 22 This excess risk should be considered in recommendations for lifetime statin therapy. We observed no increased risk of cancer or hemorrhagic stroke among new users of statins, which is also consistent with the literature. 23, 24

### Is it time for a cardiovascular primary prevention trial in the elderly? [^f75997f7]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Statins have been shown conclusively to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in subjects with clinical cardiovascular disease or diabetes aged 65 to 80 years of age. However, few data are available for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in those aged ≥ 70 years.

Summary Of Review

A moderate-dose statin was of little benefit in a population aged 70 to 82 years when given for 3 years in the setting of suboptimally treated blood pressure. More evidence supports the use of blood pressure-lowering medications, but few data are available regarding the appropriate blood pressure target and most effective agents in the elderly. Some evidence also suggests that the elderly could experience higher mortality with antihypertensive treatment. These findings, along with greater safety concerns and an increasing number of competing risks and medical conditions with advancing age, make it imperative to carefully evaluate the risk/benefit balance from treating hypercholesterolemia and hypertension in persons aged ≥ 70 years.

Conclusions

We propose a 5-year 2x2 factorial trial of primary prevention in the elderly that will (1) evaluate whether statin therapy will reduce the risk of cardiovascular events when added to the treatment of hypertension to achieve a blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg in most patients and (2) determine the most appropriate blood pressure regimen for the prevention of cardiovascular and renal events.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^54eac41e]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

On the basis of the JUPITER trial, European health authorities recently approved the use of rosuvastatin to reduce first major cardiovascular events among 'high' global risk primary prevention patients defined either by Framingham risk score > 20% or European systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE) ≥ 5%. However, as these are post hoc analyses, data describing these subgroups have not previously been available to the clinical community.

Methods and results

We randomized 17 802 apparently healthy men aged ≥ 50 and women ≥ 60 with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 3.4 mmol/L, who were at an increased vascular risk due to elevated levels of C-reactive protein measured with a high-sensitivity (hs) assay to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo. Patients with high global cardiovascular risk at baseline were identified by 10-year Framingham risk score > 20% or SCORE risk ≥ 5%. During 1.8-year median follow-up (maximum 5 years) of patients with Framingham risk > 20%, the rate of myocardial infarction/stroke/cardiovascular death was 9.4 and 18.2 per 1000 person-years in rosuvastatin and placebo-allocated patients, respectively [hazard ratio (HR): 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27–0.93, P = 0.028]. Among patients with SCORE risk ≥ 5%, the corresponding rates were 6.9 and 12.0 using a model extrapolating risk for age ≥ 65 years (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43–0.78, P = 0.0003) and rates were 5.9 and 12.7 when risk for age was capped at 65 years (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.32–0.68, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

In primary prevention patients with elevated hs C-reactive protein who have high global cardiovascular risk (10-year Framingham risk score > 20% or SCORE risk ≥ 5%), but LDL-C levels not requiring pharmacologic treatment, rosuvastatin 20 mg significantly reduced major cardiovascular events.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of zero — examples of candidates who might benefit from knowing their CAC score is zero and related caveats are provided: Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely; patients concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms; older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy; and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with PCE-calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5%, with factors that increase their ASCVD risk, although they are in a borderline risk group. Caveats state that if a coronary artery calcium score of zero is obtained at intermediate risk and a risk decision is uncertain, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years, and that CAC testing should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of statins as a class and of specific statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and network meta-analysis of randomized trials with 94, 283 participants [^4093e30d]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The current guidelines of statins for primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention were based on results from systematic reviews and meta-analyses that suffer from limitations.

Methods

We searched in PubMed for existing systematic reviews and individual open-label or double-blinded randomized controlled trials that compared a statin with a placebo or another, which were published in English until January 01, 2018. We performed a random-effect pairwise meta-analysis of all statins as a class and network meta-analysis for the specific statins on different benefit and harm outcomes.

Results

In the pairwise meta-analyses, statins as a class showed statistically significant risk reductions on non-fatal MI (risk ratio [RR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.53–0.72), CVD mortality (RR 0.80, 0.71–0.91), all-cause mortality (RR 0.89, 0.85–0.93), non-fatal stroke (RR 0.83, 0.75–0.92), unstable angina (RR 0.75, 0.63–0.91), and composite major cardiovascular events (RR 0.74, 0.67–0.81). Statins increased statistically significantly relative and absolute risks of myopathy (RR 1.08, 1.01–1.15; Risk difference [RD] 13, 2–24 per 10,000 person-years); renal dysfunction (RR 1.12, 1.00–1.26; RD 16, 0–36 per 10,000 person-years); and hepatic dysfunction (RR 1.16, 1.02–1.31; RD 8, 1–16 per 10,000 person-years). The drug-level network meta-analyses showed that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were most effective in reducing CVD events while atorvastatin appeared to have the best safety profile.

Conclusions

All statins showed statistically significant risk reduction of CVD and all-cause mortality in primary prevention populations while increasing the risk for some harm risks. However, the benefit-harm profile differed by statin type. A quantitative assessment of the benefit-harm balance is thus needed since meta-analyses alone are insufficient to inform whether statins provide net benefit.

Primary Prevention of CV Disease

In the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study, the effect of rosuvastatin on the occurrence of major CV disease events was assessed in 17,802 males (≥ 50 years) and females (≥ 60 years) who had no clinically evident CV disease, LDL-C levels < 130 mg/dL and hsCRP levels ≥ 2 mg/L. The study population had an estimated baseline coronary heart disease risk of 11.6% over 10 years based on the Framingham risk criteria and included a high percentage of patients with additional risk factors such as hypertension (58%), low HDL-C levels (23%), cigarette smoking (16%), or a family history of premature CHD (12%). Patients had a median baseline LDL-C of 108 mg/dL and hsCRP of 4.3 mg/L. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 8,901) or rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily (n = 8,901) and were followed for a mean duration of 2 years. The JUPITER study was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to meeting predefined stopping rules for efficacy in rosuvastatin-treated subjects.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^5e93b6fb]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Also in keeping with health authority requests, the analyses here used a composite endpoint of MI/stroke/cardiovascular death rather than the pre-specified JUPITER primary endpoint. Nonetheless, the relative reduction in MI/stroke/cardiovascular death with rosuvastatin was remarkably consistent across a range of baseline participant characteristics and consistent with primary trial analyses of the full study population as pre-specified in the JUPITER protocol. Global risk prediction scores can be used to direct use of preventive therapies such as statins towards patients most likely to benefit. As expected, clinical event rates in the JUPITER placebo group were higher in the high-risk Framingham or SCORE groups compared with the entire cohort for the primary study endpoint as well as for the composite of MI/stroke/cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality. The magnitude of the absolute rate reduction for clinical events was correspondingly greater in the high-risk groups (Table 3).

Two factors contributing to the observed absolute reduction in clinical events in JUPITER were the underlying event rate in the placebo group, enhanced in this case by selecting patients with high global cardiovascular risk and elevated hs C-reactive protein, and the relative risk reduction due to treatment, enhanced by use of a high-efficacy statin. The reductions in LDL-C (49%) and clinical events (43–53% for MI/stroke/cardiovascular death) with rosuvastatin in the JUPITER patients with SCORE risk ≥ 5% are greater than reported for other statins. Although these data support the use of high-efficacy statin therapy, they do not minimize the roles of diet, exercise, and smoking cessation as the most important interventions for primary prevention. Despite the benefit derived from treatment with rosuvastatin in these high-risk patients, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of patients lacking any cardiovascular risk factors. Further, long-term compliance with statin therapy is critical for efficacy among those patients where pharmacologic therapy is indicated in addition to lifestyle interventions.

### The role of coronary artery calcium in allocating pharmacotherapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: the ABCs of CAC [^ddee5068]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

3 ALLOCATION OF ASPIRIN FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION WITH CAC

Despite the highly prevalent use of aspirin for primary prevention of ASCVD historically, new data has called into question the overall benefit of aspirin given the associated increased risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. In response, the 2019 ACC/AHA Primary Prevention of ASCVD guideline changed the recommendation for low‐dose aspirin from Class I to Class IIb in select adults at elevated ASCVD risk but not elevated bleeding risk.

A 2014 study of 4229 aspirin‐naïve subjects from the MESA cohort investigated the role of CAC in identifying optimal candidates for primary prevention aspirin. Five‐year number needed to treat (NNT) estimates were calculated using a threshold of 18% RR reduction (RRR) in coronary events, and 5‐year number needed to harm (NNH) estimates were calculated using major bleeding risk from prior studies. Individuals with CAC ≥ 100 were determined to have an estimated likely net benefit with aspirin (low NNT, high NNH), while those with CAC of 0 had an estimated net harm. After consideration of these data, the Society of Cardiovascular CT recommended the strong consideration of aspirin in most patients with CAC > 100 who do not have elevated bleeding risk (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Advanced CAC scores identifies a population with very elevated ASCVD risk (equivalent to that in secondary prevention cohorts) who may benefit from aggressive preventive treatments. ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CAC, coronary artery calcium; SPRINT, Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.

A subsequent 2020 analysis of 3540 MESA participants who were not at elevated bleeding risk was performed after the release of the updated ACC/AHA guidelines, strengthening the prior study's findings by using updated meta‐analysis data and observed bleeding rates to generate NNH. The 5‐year NNT was created from a 12% RRR in ASCVD events, and the 5‐year NNH was created from a 42% RR increase in major bleeding events. Again, CAC ≥ 100 identified subjects who likely would derive a net benefit from aspirin, and subjects with CAC of 0 would likely have net harm, irrespective of the subjects' underlying ASCVD risk.

### Review of primary and secondary prevention trials with lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin [^378ae3b4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

There are overwhelming data in favor of cholesterol as a modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Lifestyle modifications are considered first-line treatments for lowering cholesterol, but drug therapies are recommended in at-risk groups. Trials published before the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III reports have helped statins emerge at the forefront of lipid therapies, and more recent trials have shed light on high-risk prevention. Although 6 statins are currently available, large clinical trials reported thus far have mainly evaluated atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin in the prevention of CAD and other cardiovascular events. A few small end point trials have evaluated fluvastatin, whereas rosuvastatin trials are only in their early days.

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a moderate amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of statin use for the prevention of CVD events in adults 76 years and older without a history of heart attack or stroke.

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit. 10 The USPSTF previously reviewed the evidence on the utility of CRP as a risk predictor of coronary heart disease and found that although there is an association between elevated CRP levels and coronary heart disease events, there is insufficient evidence that a reduction in CRP levels results in fewer CVD events. 11 Additionally, CRP is not currently included in any of the major risk prediction calculators, and the effects of using CRP in addition to traditional CVD risk factors to guide the prescription of statins for reducing CVD risk are uncertain.

As previously noted, available RCTs evaluating statins for the prevention of CVD events largely used low and moderate doses. There were no clear differences in estimates of effect when the trials were stratified according to statin dose. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists meta-analysis showed that greater degree of LDL-C reductions achieved were associated with proportional reductions in major cardiovascular events. 25 However, these analyses were based not on randomized comparisons but on the degree of LDL-C reduction achieved.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^3d5c2bd2]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Although the analyses presented here parallel those requested by European Health Authorities, they do not address most patients actually studied in the JUPITER trial. For example, among the 7340 men and women with elevated hs C-reactive protein and the Framingham risk scores of 11–20%, where the 4.5-year absolute risk of a primary endpoint was 10.6% in the placebo group, rosuvastatin was associated with a 49% reduction in risk (HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.39–0.68, P < 0.0001). Similarly, among the 6091 participants with entry Framingham scores of 5–10%, where the 4.5-year absolute risk was 5.3%, a 45% reduction was observed with rosuvastatin (HR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.36–0.84, P = 0.005), and among trial participants with elevated hs C-reactive protein with SCORE risk < 5%, rosuvastatin was associated with a 56% reduction in vascular risk (HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.29–0.68). Thus, the JUPITER trial data also indicate that many individuals with elevated hs C-reactive protein who fall outside 'high-risk' subgroups defined by either Framingham or SCORE have both substantive absolute risk and large relative risk reductions when treated with rosuvastatin.

### Associations between statins and adverse events in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review with pairwise, network, and dose-response meta-analyses [^c6a790de]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Compared with rates seen in routine clinical practice, the baseline incidence of adverse events for patients included in trials might be lower because of differences in patient characteristics. These differences could explain the inconsistency seen in the absolute risks of adverse events of treatment with statins between trials and observational studies. Even when estimates from trials and observational studies are taken into account, however, modelling studies suggest that the benefits of statins for primary prevention outweigh their potential harms in most patients eligible for treatment. In terms of clinical importance, most of the associated adverse events are self-reported, mild, or localised conditions, unlikely to lead to morbidity or mortality, compared with the major cardiovascular events that statins prevent.

Only a few significant effects of individual types of statins were found for specific adverse events in this review (fig 4 and odds ratio values in the results section). The associations of atorvastatin and lovastatin with liver dysfunction could be because these statins are primarily metabolised in the liver. Rosuvastatin was associated with self-reported muscle symptoms, renal insufficiency, eye conditions, and diabetes, which might be because these risks are limited to rosuvastatin or because of larger sample sizes and higher doses in the trials of rosuvastatin. Comparisons between different types of statins showed considerable uncertainty, owing to insufficient data for several statins, especially fluvastatin, pitavastatin, and simvastatin. The few significant differences between statins could also be because of a false discovery rate potentially caused by the multiple tests conducted in these comparisons. This uncertainty of differences between statin was also found in previous reviews for primary or secondary prevention.

### American, British and European recommendations for statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease applied to British men studied prospectively [^36480c85]. Heart (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare national and international recommendations for statin treatment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in middle-aged men.

Design

Application of the current American, British and European recommendations to results of a prospective study.

Participants

Men aged 49–65 years (n = 1653) who participated in the Caerphilly Prospective Study.

Main Outcome Measures

Proportion of patients who would receive statin treatment, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one first CVD event (myocardial infarction or stroke) over 10 years and the potential number of events prevented over 10 years in the whole population (population impact) by the use of statins in accordance with each set of guidelines, assuming a reduction of risk in the range 10–50% from the observed events and baseline risk factors.

Results

212 events were noted. For an anticipated reduction in first CVD events of 30% with statin treatment, the NNT was 26.0, if the whole population was treated. The lowest NNT was 12.1 for the National Service Framework, achieved when only 14% of the men received a statin. This prevented the lowest number of events (19.2/212), however, and had the smallest population impact on CVD incidence (-9.1%). The American and earlier Joint British Societies guidelines, although giving NNTs of around 21, prevented more events and had a greater population impact of -21.6% to -23.3%. They did, however, target about 60% of the male population. The British Hypertension Society guidelines and new Joint British Societies recommendations achieved the greatest population impact of -27% while maintaining the NNT at 22.2. They did, however, target three quarters of this population.

Conclusion

Even effective preventive treatment will have little impact in preventing disease if patients at typical risk are not treated. Whether cholesterol lowering on such a scale should be attempted with drugs raises philosophical, psychological and economic considerations, particularly in view of the high likelihood of individual benefit from statin treatment. More effective nutritional policies to reduce serum cholesterol on a population level and reduce the requirement for statins in primary prevention should also be considered.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^02a0c02f]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

On the basis of the JUPITER trial, European health authorities recently approved the use of rosuvastatin to reduce first major cardiovascular events among 'high' global risk primary prevention patients defined either by Framingham risk score > 20% or European systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE) ≥ 5%. However, as these are post hoc analyses, data describing these subgroups have not previously been available to the clinical community.

Methods and Results

We randomized 17 802 apparently healthy men aged ≥ 50 and women ≥ 60 with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 3.4 mmol/L, who were at an increased vascular risk due to elevated levels of C-reactive protein measured with a high-sensitivity (hs) assay to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo. Patients with high global cardiovascular risk at baseline were identified by 10-year Framingham risk score > 20% or SCORE risk ≥ 5%. During 1.8-year median follow-up (maximum 5 years) of patients with Framingham risk > 20%, the rate of myocardial infarction/stroke/cardiovascular death was 9.4 and 18.2 per 1000 person-years in rosuvastatin and placebo-allocated patients, respectively [hazard ratio (HR): 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27–0.93, P = 0.028]. Among patients with SCORE risk ≥ 5%, the corresponding rates were 6.9 and 12.0 using a model extrapolating risk for age ≥ 65 years (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43–0.78, P = 0.0003) and rates were 5.9 and 12.7 when risk for age was capped at 65 years (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.32–0.68, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

In primary prevention patients with elevated hs C-reactive protein who have high global cardiovascular risk (10-year Framingham risk score > 20% or SCORE risk ≥ 5%), but LDL-C levels not requiring pharmacologic treatment, rosuvastatin 20 mg significantly reduced major cardiovascular events.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention among individuals with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and 5% to 10% and 10% to 20% 10-year risk. implications of the justification for use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial for "intermediate risk" [^03dbea97]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recent primary prevention guidelines issued in Canada endorse the use of statin therapy among individuals at "intermediate risk" who have elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). However, trial data directly addressing whether this recommendation defines a patient population in which statin therapy is effective have not previously been published.

Methods and Results

In the Justification for Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial, which demonstrated a 44% reduction in first vascular events when rosuvastatin 20 mg was compared with placebo among 17 802 primary prevention patients with LDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dL and hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L, 6091 participants (2525 women, 3566 men) had baseline estimated 10-year Framingham risks of 5% to 10% and 7340 participants (1404 women, 5936 men) had baseline estimated Framingham risk of 11% to 20%. In these 2 "intermediate risk" subgroups, relative risk reductions consistent with the overall trial treatment effect were observed (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.84; 5-year number needed to treat = 40, P = 0.005 for those with 5% to 10% risk; hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.68, 5-year number needed to treat = 18, P < 0.0001 for those with 11% to 20% risk). Use of the Reynolds Risk Score to stratify the study population gave similar results but reclassified large numbers of individuals into lower- or higher-risk groups. The majority of women with elevated hsCRP who benefited from rosuvastatin were at 5% to 10% 10-year risk at study entry using either global risk scoring system.

Conclusions

Consistent with recent evidence-based Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for primary prevention, the JUPITER trial demonstrates that rosuvastatin 20 mg significantly reduces major cardiovascular events among men and women with elevated hsCRP and "intermediate risk" defined either as 5% to 10% or 10% to 20% 10-year risk.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^322fa899]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Cumulative incidence of fatal/non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke in high-risk patients. The cumulative incidence of fatal/non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal/non-fatal stroke are shown by the treatment group among patients with a 10-year systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% using the extrapolated (upper panel) and capped models (lower panel).

In the higher-risk patients, there was no evidence of heterogeneity for the endpoint of MI/stroke/cardiovascular death in subgroups by gender, age, race/ethnicity, hypertension, smoking, family history of premature coronary heart disease, baseline HDL-C, or C-reactive protein (Figure 3). Patients with body mass index > 30 kg/m 2 at baseline appeared to benefit less from rosuvastatin treatment compared with non-obese patients, but this interaction between treatment assignment and body mass index was not observed for the JUPITER cohort as a whole and thus is likely to be more apparent than real.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^792b2b01]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

JUPITER primary prevention in women — trial outcomes and synthesis: The JUPITER randomized trial included 6801 women and 11,001 men receiving rosuvastatin 20 mg vs placebo, and rosuvastatin produced similar, statistically significant reductions in the composite primary endpoint in women (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37–0.80; P = 0.002) and men (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.45–0.73; P < .001). In a meta-analysis restricted to exclusively primary prevention trials in women (AFCAPS/TexCAPS, MEGA, and JUPITER), statins reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (summary RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.49–0.82; P < .001; P for heterogeneity = 0.56), whereas adding predominantly primary prevention trials (ASCOT-LLA and ALLHAT-LLT) yielded a higher, non–statistically significant summary RR (0.79; 95% CI 0.59–1.05; P = 0.11; P for heterogeneity = 0.053); for total mortality in the 2 exclusively primary prevention trials (n = 13,154 women, 216 deaths), the summary RR was 0.78 (95% CI 0.53–1.15; P = 0.21).

### Management of dyslipidemia for cardiovascular disease risk reduction: synopsis of the 2020 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^2a4cc9b9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Knowledge gaps — primary prevention medical therapy comparisons: The pool of primary prevention studies using statins almost exclusively employed moderate-dose statins, and the JUPITER trial was the only study that employed a high-dose statin; prospective comparisons of different statin intensities might demonstrate an additional benefit of higher statin doses in patients treated for primary prevention. Studies of ezetimibe monotherapy and ezetimibe and statin combination therapy showing patient-oriented outcomes in primary prevention are lacking, and while similar arguments can be made for bempedoic acid, icosapent ethyl, and PCSK9 inhibitors, their high cost and the large NNT for all therapies in primary prevention limit the potential cost-effectiveness of these medication classes at current prices.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^a7d47c9a]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) evidence assessment — The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit, and concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit; it concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro / con debate [^5f49e9f0]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

These results were confirmed in a meta-analysis that included ten trials (70,388 participants without established CVD), which showed that statins significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.88), major coronary events (0.70) and major cerebrovascular events (0.81). In another analysis, Ray et al. determined whether statin therapy reduces all-cause mortality among intermediate to high-risk individuals without a history of CVD. Data from 11 studies with 65,229 participants showed that use of statins in the high-risk primary prevention setting was not associated with a statistically significant reduction (RR 0.91) in the risk of all-cause mortality. These findings complement and extend the above-mentioned meta-analyses as well as the results from the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial, which reported that statins reduced death from any cause by 12%. However, these estimates were based on information from both individuals with and without pre-existing CHD or stroke, which may overestimate the real benefits in the primary prevention setting. Despite the continuing discussion of the effect of statins on all-cause mortality in these groups of patients, their role in primary prevention individuals, especially in high-risk ones, is unquestionable. In low and moderate-risk patients the decision regarding starting statin therapy should be assessed individually taking into account the cardiovascular risk as well as the risk of statin-related side effects (e.g. new onset diabetes, especially in patients with overweight/obesity and/or insulin resistance).

### Implications of the new American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines for primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event prevention in a multi ethnic cohort: multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) [^0cd6791d]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of replacing the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)/Adult Treatment Program (ATP) III cholesterol guidelines with the new 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is unclear.

Methods

We used risk factor and 10-year clinical event rate data from MESA, combined with estimates of efficacy of moderate and high-intensity statin therapy from meta-analyses of statin primary prevention trials to estimate (a) the change in number of subjects eligible for drug therapy and (2) the anticipated reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events and increment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) associated with the change in cholesterol guidelines.

Results

Of the 6,814 MESA participants, 5,437 were not on statins at baseline and had complete data for analysis (mean age 61.4 ± 10.3). Using the NCEP/ATP III guidelines, 1,334 (24.5%) would have been eligible for statin therapy compared with 3,015 (55.5%) under the new ACC/AHA guidelines. Among the subset of newly eligible, 127/1,742 (7.3%) had an ASCVD event during 10years of follow-up. Assuming 10years of moderate-intensity statin therapy, the estimated absolute reduction in ASCVD events for the newly eligible group was 2.06% (number needed to treat [NNT] 48.6) and the estimated absolute increase in T2DM was 0.90% (number needed to harm [NNH] 110.7). Assuming 10years of high-intensity statin therapy, the corresponding estimates for reductions in ASCVD and increases in T2DM were as follows: ASCVD 2.70% (NNT 37.5) and T2DM 2.60% (NNH 38.6). The estimated effects of moderate-intensity statins on 10-year risk for ASCVD and T2DM in participants eligible for statins under the NCEP/ATP III were as follows: 3.20% (NNT 31.5) and 1.06% (NNH 94.2), respectively.

Conclusion

Substituting the NCEP/ATP III cholesterol guidelines with the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines in MESA more than doubled the number of participants eligible for statin therapy. If the new ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines are adopted and extend the primary prevention population eligible for treatment, the risk-benefit profile is much better for moderate-intensity than high-intensity statin treatment.

Key messages

Performing only explanatory cardiovascular outcome lipid trials has important negative consequences: (i) some drugs are withdrawn prematurely without a specific assessment of efficacy in appropriate patients, (ii) physicians prescribe some drugs inconsistently and without certainty due to the low level of evidence‐based data, and (iii) the cost‐effectiveness of the treatment (number needed to treat (NNT), number needed to harm (NNH), etc.) in certain candidates for the medicine often remains indefinitely unknown. Pragmatic trials in individuals with "true" dyslipidemia are urged.

Importance

A 2016 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was associated with reduced mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.

Objective

To update the 2016 review on statins for primary prevention of CVD to inform the USPSTF.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (to November 2021); surveillance through May 20, 2022.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials on statins vs placebo or no statin and statin intensity in adults without prior cardiovascular events; large cohort studies on harms.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause and cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, composite cardiovascular outcomes, and adverse events.

Results

Twenty-six studies were included: 22 trials (N = 90 624) with 6 months to 6 years of follow-up compared statins vs placebo or no statin, 1 trial (n = 5144) compared statin intensities, and 3 observational studies (n = 417 523) reported harms. Statins were significantly associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87 to 0.98]; absolute risk difference [ARD], -0.35% [95% CI, -0.57% to -0.14%]), stroke (RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.90]; ARD, -0.39% [95% CI, -0.54% to -0.25%]), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.75]; ARD, -0.85% [95% CI, -1.22% to -0.47%]), and composite cardiovascular outcomes (RR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.81]; ARD, -1.28% [95% CI, -1.61% to -0.95%]); the association with cardiovascular mortality was not statistically significant (RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.02]; ARD, -0.13%). Relative benefits were consistent in groups defined by demographic and clinical characteristics, although data for persons older than 75 years were sparse. Statin therapy was not significantly associated with increased risk of serious adverse events (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.01]), myalgias (RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.11]), or elevated alanine aminotransferase level (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.13]). Statin therapy was not significantly associated with increased diabetes risk overall (RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.19]), although 1 trial found high-intensity statin therapy was significantly associated with increased risk (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49]). Otherwise, there were no clear differences in outcomes based on statin intensity.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults at increased CVD risk but without prior CVD events, statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality and CVD events. Benefits of statin therapy appear to be present across diverse demographic and clinical populations, with consistent relative benefits in groups defined by demographic and clinical characteristics.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with European systematic coronary risk evaluation risk ≥ 5% or framingham risk > 20%: post hoc analyses of the JUPITER trial requested by European health authorities [^6f9ab8df]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Results

JUPITER enrolled 17 802 men and women (6515 in Europe), and randomized 8901 each to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily and placebo. At baseline, 9% of the cohort was considered to be at 'high risk' for a first cardiovascular event on the basis of having a 10-year Framingham risk of MI/coronary death above 20%; 52% were considered to be at 'high risk' on the basis of having a 10-year SCORE risk of cardiovascular death of 5% or higher using the extrapolated model, and 35% were considered to be at 'high risk' using the capped SCORE model. Baseline characteristics of these high-risk patients are shown by treatment allocation (Table 1). As anticipated, when compared with the entire JUPITER cohort, the higher-risk patients were older, more often male and more likely to smoke, have hypertension and low levels of HDL-C. Differences between the high-risk Framingham and SCORE groups reflect the patient characteristics included in the risk algorithms and their weighted contribution to individuals' estimated global cardiovascular risk. In particular, metabolic syndrome was more prevalent among high-risk Framingham patients.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics according to the estimated 10-year risk defined by the Framingham risk score or the systematic coronary risk evaluation risk algorithm

For the entire JUPITER cohort, rosuvastatin lowered LDL-C by 50%, triglycerides by 17% and hs C-reactive protein by 37%, whereas it increased HDL-C by 4% compared with placebo (P < 0.001 for all from baseline to year 1). In the high-risk groups, effects of rosuvastatin on lipoproteins and hs C-reactive protein were similar to those seen for the entire cohort (Table 2), with significant reductions in LDL-C, triglycerides, and hs C-reactive protein (P < 0.0001 vs. placebo for all) and a significant increase in HDL-C (P < 0.0001).

Update of previous USPSTF recommendation — In 2016, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended a low- to moderate-dose statin for adults without a history of cardiovascular disease when aged 40 to 75 years, with 1 or more cardiovascular disease risk factors, and a calculated 10-year cardiovascular event risk of 10% or greater; it also recommended that clinicians selectively offer a low- to moderate-dose statin to adults meeting the first two criteria with a calculated 10-year risk of 7.5% to less than 10%, and concluded there was insufficient evidence to assess initiating statins in adults 76 years or older.

### A statin a day to keep the doctor away? Comparing aspirin and statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^e09ae1f2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

For the primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease, aspirin reduces the risk for major vascular events by approximately 15% to 20% with an absolute reduction of approximately 0.1%. Major bleeding occurs at an excess of approximately 2 cases per 1000 patient-years with aspirin therapy. For primary prevention, statin therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of CV events by approximately 30% to 40% with an absolute reduction of 1% to 2%. Rhabdomyolysis is rare, with an incidence of 3.4 cases per 100 000 patient-years. Compared with aspirin, statins have a more favorable risk-to-benefit profile for primary prevention.

### The benefits of statins in people without established cardiovascular disease but with cardiovascular risk factors: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^99937371]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We followed the quality of reporting of meta-analysis guidelines. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline (1990-November 2008), Embase (1980-November 2008), DARE, and the ACP Journal Club for randomised clinical trials that compared statins with a control group in people without established cardiovascular disease but with cardiovascular risk factors. We identified relevant studies using the MeSH terms "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor", "atorvastatin", "simvastatin", "pravastatin", "fluvastatin", "rosuvastatin", or "lovastatin", and "cardiovascular disease", "coronary heart disease", "cerebrovascular disease", or "myocardial infarction", and "cholesterol", "LDL" [low density lipoprotein], "HDL" [high density lipoprotein], or "triglycerides", and primary prevention restricted to randomised controlled trials or meta-analyses. In addition we examined the reference lists and related links of retrieved articles in PubMed to detect studies potentially eligible for inclusion.

Study selection

We included studies if they were randomised trials of statins compared with controls (placebo, active control, or usual care), had a mean follow-up of at least one year, reported on mortality or cardiovascular disease events as primary outcomes, and included at least 80% of people without established cardiovascular disease or reported data separately on a sole primary prevention group and provided specific numbers for patients and events in that group. Eight studies were excluded that primarily investigated statin related non-clinical and intermediate surrogate end points such as changes in the thickness of the carotid intima media and lipid levels that collectively contributed fewer than 50 clinical events. We also excluded one study in patients with renal transplants because of the specific nature of that population, and three studies with design problems, fewer than 20 events overall, and insufficient follow-up. Our study therefore focused on people without established cardiovascular disease but with cardiovascular risk factors.

Validity assessment

Our search identified 1230 studies, of which 10 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. w1-w10 Figure 1summarises the results of the search. We evaluated suitable trials for concealment of treatment allocation, performance of the analysis according to the intention to treat principle, and completeness of follow-up. The Jadad scale was used to score study quality (range 0–5, higher scores indicating better quality). Study quality was sufficient (≥ 4) for all included randomised clinical trials.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^0fdc680a]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.
