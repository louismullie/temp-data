## Question

Does womens white blood cell count elevate during pregnancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a woman's white blood cell (WBC) count elevates during pregnancy and how to interpret that change. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline non-pregnant WBC reference range. Then, I should verify the timing and magnitude of WBC changes across gestation. Next, I will examine which leukocyte subsets drive the increase. After that, I need to check whether there is a postpartum peak and how quickly counts normalize. I should also review proposed pregnancy-specific reference intervals and their clinical implications. Finally, I will consider confounders and edge cases that could mimic or mask infection and synthesize a practical takeaway for clinicians.

> Let me first confirm the baseline so I don't jump to conclusions: in non-pregnant adults, the typical WBC range is about 4.0–10.0 × 10^9/L, which anchors how we interpret "elevated" in pregnancy [^115nrZRX] [^112rExHY].

> Now, I should verify the direction of change in pregnancy. Multiple large cohorts consistently show that total WBC rises early in gestation and remains elevated throughout pregnancy, with a rapid early surge and a more gradual rise thereafter, peaking in the second trimester and remaining high into the third trimester, which confirms physiologic leukocytosis of pregnancy rather than a pathologic process per se [^111Ybhd3] [^112N8yJu] [^117Vwsez].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and timing more precisely. Median WBC increases from about 6 × 10^9/L pre-pregnancy to roughly 8.7 × 10^9/L in the first trimester and about 9.3 × 10^9/L in the second trimester, with a plateau near 9.3–9.4 × 10^9/L in the third trimester. Importantly, there is a threshold around 7 weeks' gestation after which the upper limit of normal progressively rises, supporting gestational-age–specific interpretation rather than fixed non-pregnant cutoffs [^111Ybhd3] [^116Ln4WL] [^11136d3c].

> Hold on, I should confirm which cells are responsible. The dominant driver is neutrophilia; neutrophil counts nearly double compared with postpartum baselines, while monocytes increase modestly and lymphocytes tend to decline or remain stable, which explains why the differential shifts toward a higher neutrophil percentage during gestation [^117Vwsez] [^116Ln4WL].

> I will now examine the immediate postpartum period because I recall a spike. Yes, WBC rises sharply after delivery, often reaching its highest levels within the first week postpartum (for example, a median around 11.3 × 10^9/L), and then gradually declines back toward pre-pregnancy levels by about 4 weeks postpartum, reflecting stress, tissue injury, and cytokine-mediated mobilization [^111Ybhd3] [^112N8yJu].

> Next, I should review whether pregnancy-specific reference intervals have been proposed and validated. Several large studies support partitioned intervals: ≤ 2 weeks gestation may still align with the non-pregnant 4.0–10.0 × 10^9/L range, 3–5 weeks suggests 4.7–11.9 × 10^9/L, and from 6 weeks onward a range of about 5.7–14.4 × 10^9/L fits the data. Sensitivity analyses using parametric and nonparametric methods yield similar upper limits near 14.4–15.0 × 10^9/L, reinforcing robustness despite early-gestation sample limitations [^115nrZRX] [^112rExHY] [^1142eDQf].

> But wait, what if the WBC is "too high" even for pregnancy? I need to ensure we don't dismiss pathology. Values exceeding the gestational-age–specific upper limit have been associated with higher risks of placenta previa, oligohydramnios, secondary uterine inertia, and intrauterine growth restriction, and first-trimester leukocytosis has been linked to preterm delivery, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, and small-for-gestational-age infants, so persistent or marked elevations warrant evaluation for infection or other complications rather than attributing everything to physiologic change [^115nrZRX] [^111uYc69] [^112rExHY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also consider confounders that can raise or lower WBC independent of infection. Corticosteroids can acutely increase WBC by roughly 1–3 × 10^9/L within 24–36 hours, which can mislead clinicians if timing is not accounted for; conversely, nucleated red blood cells in maternal or neonatal samples can artifactually elevate automated WBC and require manual correction, and certain drugs like levetiracetam can lower WBC or neutrophils, so medication reconciliation and smear review matter when interpreting unexpected counts [^114Xmgkt] [^117UxPoQ] [^1127r3Yw].

> Let me reconsider the clinical bottom line so I don't overstate anything. Yes, a woman's WBC count elevates during pregnancy, typically rising from a pre-pregnancy median near 6 × 10^9/L to about 8–10 × 10^9/L during gestation, with a postpartum surge and subsequent normalization; this neutrophil-predominant physiologic leukocytosis necessitates gestational-age–specific reference intervals and a cautious differential that still includes infection, inflammatory complications, and medication effects when counts are unusually high or the clinical context is concerning [^111Ybhd3] [^117Vwsez] [^115nrZRX].

---

Yes, women's white blood cell (WBC) counts **rise during pregnancy** due to hormonal and immunologic changes, with neutrophils driving the increase [^117Vwsez]. WBC counts typically rise from 4–10 × 10⁹/L pre-pregnancy to 5.7–14.4 × 10⁹/L after 6 weeks' gestation, peak around 25 weeks, and can transiently spike to 20–30 × 10⁹/L during labor and postpartum [^115nrZRX] [^111Ybhd3]. This physiologic leukocytosis helps maternal immune adaptation and fetal protection, but **excessive elevation (> 15 × 10⁹/L)** may signal infection or complications and should be evaluated [^111uYc69] [^112N8yJu].

---

## Physiological changes in WBC count during pregnancy

Pregnancy triggers **complex immunologic and hormonal changes** that alter leukocyte production and distribution, producing a **physiologic leukocytosis** [^112N8yJu].

---

### Timing and magnitude of WBC elevation

- **Early pregnancy**: WBC begins to rise within weeks of conception, with a rapid increase before 7 weeks' gestation [^111Ybhd3] [^115nrZRX].
- **First trimester**: Median WBC increases from ~6 × 10⁹/L pre-pregnancy to ~8.7 × 10⁹/L [^111Ybhd3].
- **Second trimester**: Median WBC peaks at ~9.3 × 10⁹/L around 25 weeks [^111Ybhd3].
- **Third trimester**: WBC remains elevated (~9.4 × 10⁹/L) until delivery [^111Ybhd3].
- **Labor and postpartum**: WBC can transiently surge to 20–30 × 10⁹/L immediately postpartum, returning to pre-pregnancy levels by 4–6 weeks [^114wuQUK] [^111Ybhd3].

---

### Leukocyte subtypes involved

Neutrophils account for most of the increase, rising from ~4.5 × 10⁹/L pre-pregnancy to ~7.5 × 10⁹/L at term, whereas **lymphocytes** remain stable or slightly decline, and **monocytes** increase modestly; eosinophils and basophils show minimal change [^117Vwsez] [^116Ln4WL].

---

## Reference ranges for WBC count during pregnancy

Pregnancy-specific reference intervals differ from non-pregnant ranges and vary by gestational age [^115nrZRX]:

| **Gestational age** | **Reference interval (× 10⁹/l)** |
|-|-|
| ≤ 2 weeks | 4.0–10.0 |
| 3–5 weeks | 4.7–11.9 |
| ≥ 6 weeks | 5.7–14.4 |

---

These ranges reflect the **physiologic leukocytosis** of pregnancy and help distinguish normal from pathological elevations [^111uYc69].

---

## Factors influencing WBC elevation during pregnancy

Several factors contribute to **WBC elevation** in pregnancy:

- **Hormonal changes**: Estrogen and progesterone stimulate neutrophil production and prolong neutrophil lifespan [^notfound].
- **Stress response**: Pregnancy-induced stress increases cortisol and catecholamines, promoting leukocytosis [^112N8yJu].
- **Inflammatory state**: Mild systemic inflammation during pregnancy increases cytokine-driven leukocyte production [^112N8yJu].
- **Labor and delivery**: Tissue trauma and inflammatory mediators during childbirth cause a transient leukocytosis [^112N8yJu].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated WBC count during pregnancy

Physiologic leukocytosis supports maternal immune adaptation and fetal protection, but **excessive elevation** may indicate pathology:

- **Infection**: Leukocytosis can signal bacterial or viral infections, requiring evaluation [^114QKP5w].
- **Pregnancy complications**: Elevated WBC is associated with preterm delivery, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and adverse outcomes [^111uYc69] [^112rExHY].
- **Inflammatory conditions**: Chronic low-grade inflammation (e.g. PCOS) can exacerbate leukocytosis and increase complication risk [^113sJJdA].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Clinicians should interpret WBC within **pregnancy-specific ranges** and the clinical context. Excessive elevation (> 15 × 10⁹/L) warrants evaluation for infection or complications; physiologic leukocytosis requires no intervention, but pathological causes should be treated according to standard care.

---

## Conclusion

WBC counts **rise during pregnancy** due to hormonal, stress, and inflammatory changes, with neutrophils driving the increase. This physiologic leukocytosis supports maternal–fetal immune adaptation, but **marked elevations** may indicate infection or complications and should be evaluated.

### Platelet and leukocyte counts in pregnancy… [^117Vwsez]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Platelets and leukocytes in venous blood were counted with automated methodology in 23 women studied longitudinally throughout pregnancy and at six weeks after delivery. The average platelet count declined monotonically in a manner consistent with the gestational increase in blood volume. Total leukocyte count rose early in gestation and remained elevated, with neutrophils accounting for the changes. Absolute neutrophil counts during gestation were nearly twice those of the same women postpartum The monocyte count also tended to increase, whereas lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils declined in number.

Regarding medical management for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids and IVIG, ICR 2019 guidelines recommend to consider administering IVIG in pregnant patients with immune thrombocytopenia to urgently increase platelet count during bleeding or for delivery, recognizing that it provides a rapid but often very transient increase in platelet count.

Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is most frequently a benign process that does not require intervention. However, 35% of cases of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy are related to disease processes that may have serious bleeding consequences at delivery or for which thrombocytopenia may be an indicator of a more severe systemic disorder requiring emergent maternal and fetal care. Thus, all pregnant women with platelet counts less than 100,000/μL require careful hematological and obstetric consultation to exclude more serious disorders.

### Levetiracetam injection (levetiracetam) [^112uJVq2]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.6 Withdrawal Seizures

As with most antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam should be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. But if withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction, rapid discontinuation can be considered.

5.7 Hematologic Abnormalities

Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cell counts (RBC); decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

Partial-Onset Seizures

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, minor but statistically significant decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC (0.03 × 106/mm3), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients.

A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 × 109/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1.0 × 109/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Although there were no obvious hematologic abnormalities observed in patients with JME, the limited number of patients makes any conclusion tentative. The data from the partial seizure patients should be considered to be relevant for JME patients.

5.8 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

### Levetiracetam oral (levetiracetam) [^116CUFV6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 4 Years to < 16 Years

Statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the levetiracetam-treated group were -0.4 × 109/L and -0.3 × 109/L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. Mean relative lymphocyte counts increased by 1.7% in levetiracetam-treated patients, compared to a decrease of 4% in placebo patients (statistically significant).

In the controlled trial, more levetiracetam-treated patients had a possibly clinically significant abnormally low WBC value (3% of levetiracetam-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients), however, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count (5% of levetiracetam-treated patients versus 4.2% of placebo-treated patients). No patient was discontinued secondary to low WBC or neutrophil counts.

In the controlled cognitive and neuropsychological safety study, 5 patients (8.6%) in the levetiracetam-treated group and two patients (6.1%) in the placebo-treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (≥ 10% or ≥ 0.7X109/L).

5.10 Increase in Blood Pressure

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, a significantly higher risk of increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in the levetiracetam-treated patients (17%), compared to the placebo-treated patients (2%). There was no overall difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between the treatment groups. This disparity between the levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups was not observed in the studies of older children or in adults.

Monitor patients 1 month to < 4 years of age for increases in diastolic blood pressure.

5.11 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

Normal physiologic and anatomic changes in pregnancy

The physiologic changes that comprise maternal adaptation to pregnancy involve almost every organ system. The plasma volume in pregnancy increases by almost 50%, whereas the red cell mass increases by only 20%, resulting in the 'physiologic anemia of pregnancy'. It is not uncommon to see a baseline hematocrit of 31%–33%. The increased plasma volume allows the pregnant patient to withstand a significant amount of blood loss before any overt manifestations of shock appear. Cardiac output increases beginning in the second trimester. Uterine blood flow also increases as the fetus grows, comprising 20% of cardiac output by term. This system is highly regulated and extremely sensitive to external agents such as catecholamine and maternal intravascular volume loss. Maternal hemorrhage can be compensated by decreased uterine flow. Maternal hypovolemia may be marked by fetal distress before any evidence of maternal tachycardia or hypotension is present.

Oxygen consumption and resting ventilation increase in pregnancy as a result of an increase in tidal volume caused by rising progesterone levels. This results in a respiratory alkalosis with a pCO 2 of approximately 30 mm Hg and a metabolic compensation with bicarbonate levels in the 19–20 mEq/L range. Gastrointestinal motility is decreased, and in addition to the reduction in resting lower esophageal pressure, pregnant patients are more likely to experience gastroesophageal reflux and have an increased risk of aspiration with general anesthesia.

Hematologically, in addition to the decrease in hemoglobin levels seen from the physiologic anemia, there is a relative leukocytosis. Typically, the white cell count will range from 12 000/mm 3 to 15 000/mm 3 and can reach as high as 25 000/mm 3, often complicating the diagnosis of infection. The state of relative hypercoagulability in pregnant patients is well known to increase the risk for thromboembolic complications.

### Maternal physiologic parameters in relationship to systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aANZV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish the normal maternal range in healthy pregnant women for each component of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and compare these ranges with existing SIRS criteria.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched to identify studies of healthy parturients from the first trimester through 12 weeks postpartum that reported maternal temperature, respiratory rate, PaCO2, heart rate, white blood cell count data, or a combination of these.

Methods Of Study Selection

Data were extracted from studies providing maternal values for components of SIRS criteria. The mean, standard deviation, and two standard deviations from the mean for all criteria parameters published in the literature were reported.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Eighty-seven studies met inclusion criteria and included 8,834 patients and 15,237 data points: temperature (10 studies and 2,367 patients), respiratory rate (nine studies and 312 patients), PaCO2 (12 studies and 441 patients), heart rate (39 studies and 1,374 patients), and white blood cell count (23 studies and 4,553 patients). Overlap with SIRS criteria occurred in healthy pregnant women during the second trimester, third trimester, and labor for each of the SIRS criteria except temperature. Every mean value for PaCO2 during pregnancy (and up to 48 hours postpartum) was below 32 mm Hg. Two standard deviations above the mean for temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate were 38.1°C, 25 breaths per minute, and 107 beats per minute, respectively.

Conclusion

Current SIRS criteria often overlap with normal physiologic parameters during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period; thus, alternative criteria must be developed to diagnose maternal sepsis.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^111uYc69]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The white blood cell (WBC) count, also known as leukocyte count, undergoes significant changes during pregnancy and the initial postpartum period. These changes are part of the body's adaptation to accommodate the demands of the developing fetus. Specifically, the WBC count tends to increase from the first to the third trimester and peaks during the initial postpartum period. Understanding these normal variations in WBC counts can assist clinicians in distinguishing between normal leukocytosis (an increase in the number of white blood cells) and pathological elevation of the WBC count during pregnancy and the initial postpartum period. This differentiation is crucial as it can prevent misdiagnosis of physiological leukocytosis as a bacterial infection, which could lead to unnecessary medication use that may harm the fetus.

In addition, a study found that leukocytosis (> 13.8 × 10^9/L) during the first trimester of pregnancy is significantly associated with an increased risk for obstetrical complications. These complications include preterm delivery before 37 weeks, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes mellitus, and cesarean section. Furthermore, women with leukocytosis during the first trimester had significantly higher rates of fetuses who were small for gestational age and with birth weight less than 2,500 g.

The findings of these studies indicate that the currently used reference interval (RI) for WBC count during pregnancy, based on the non-pregnant range (4.0–10.0 × 10^9/L) in China, is inadequate for distinguishing infection and alerting for pregnancy-related complications. Previous studies have reported varying upper limits of the RI during pregnancy, ranging from 13.8 to 19.6 × 10^9/L. However, these studies were conducted on smaller populations, with differences in ethnicity and gestational age at the time of sampling. A large-population study of 24,318 pregnant women in Oxford, UK have mapped the trajectory of WBC between 8 and 40 weeks of gestation and defined 95% RI for total WBC as 5.7–15 × 10^9/L. However, the RI within the 0–7 weeks of gestation was not investigated. The main objective of this study was to define pregnancy-specific RI for WBC count and assess their ability to detect pregnancy-related complications.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^111QTx4S]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Strength and limitation

The strengths of this study lie in its extensive coverage of a large population, encompassing the prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum periods. This comprehensive monitoring of WBC count provides a panoramic view of WBC trends throughout the entire pregnancy journey, ensuring robust and generalizable findings. The utilization of a threshold regression model to establish gestational week-specific RIs for WBC count addresses the limitations of previous studies and improves the accuracy of interpretation. The implementation of partitioned RIs for WBC count demonstrates high clinical applicability and translational potential. Furthermore, the identification of associations between high WBC count and various pregnancy-related complications contributes valuable insights to the existing scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, limitations of the study include its single-center nature and the homogeneity of the racial composition, potentially introducing biases. Additionally, the limited sample size of less than 120 participants per week before 5 weeks of gestation may constrain the generalizability of the RI established for early pregnancy. Finally, our study has excluded many, but not all, diseases and medical conditions known to affect WBC count.

### The potential presence of infection may be indicated through non-invasive prediction of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels within the initial three days after cervical cerclage: a retrospective case-control study [^111pPfMQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

WBC, along with NEU and NEU_P, are commonly used hematological indices to measure infection or inflammation, including in pregnant women. However, recent research has found that total WBC levels can significantly increase in pregnant women compared to the general population, with upper limits ranging from 13.8 to 19.6 × 10^9/L. Similarly, NEU levels can increase by 55% during pregnancy, according to a study of 24,318 healthy pregnant women. In this study, WBC, NEU, and NEU_P were compared between the infected and uninfected groups on different days after CC. While WBC values in the infected group were significantly higher than in the uninfected group on days 3, 5, and 7, these values remained within the normal range, as mentioned in previous research. The same trend was observed for NEU. NEU_P values showed no significant differences between the two groups. Therefore, it is suggested that WBC, NEU, and NEU_P may have limited value in assessing infection in patients after CC surgery. This could be due to the increase in WBC levels during pregnancy, making it difficult to detect abnormal elevations that may occur after infection, as noted in a study by Chang J et al.

### Endogenous control of inflammation characterizes pregnant women with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113KaJi7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect all human beings, including pregnant women. Thus, understanding the immunological changes induced by the virus during pregnancy is nowadays of pivotal importance. Here, using peripheral blood from 14 pregnant women with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, we investigate cell proliferation and cytokine production, measure plasma levels of 62 cytokines, and perform a 38-parameter mass cytometry analysis. Our results show an increase in low density neutrophils but no lymphopenia or gross alterations of white blood cells, which display normal levels of differentiation, activation or exhaustion markers and show well preserved functionality. Meanwhile, the plasma levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1RA, IL-10 and IL-19 are increased, those of IL-17, PD-L1 and D-dimer are decreased, but IL-6 and other inflammatory molecules remain unchanged. Our profiling of antiviral immune responses may thus help develop therapeutic strategies to avoid virus-induced damages during pregnancy.

### Low-grade chronic inflammation in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a prospective controlled clinical study [^113sJJdA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and pregnancy are conditions characterized by an increased low-grade chronic inflammation state. A higher incidence of pregnancy complications has been detected in pregnant PCOS women.

Objective

The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that the low-grade chronic inflammation state typical of PCOS patients persists during gestation and is exacerbated by pregnancy and contributes to the increased risk of obstetric/neonatal complications.

Design

This was a prospective controlled clinical study.

Setting

The study was conducted at the Academic Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the "Pugliese-Ciaccio" Hospital of Catanzaro (Catanzaro, Italy).

Patients

One hundred fifty pregnant PCOS women and 150 age- and body mass index-matched healthy pregnant controls participated in the study.

Interventions

INTERVENTIONS included serial clinical, biochemical, and ultrasonographic assessments before and throughout pregnancy.

Main Outcome Measures

Serum levels of white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin were measured.

Results

Pregnant women with PCOS had higher WBC, CRP, and ferritin levels at study entry and at all gestational ages than controls. Changes in serum WBC and ferritin levels were significantly higher in PCOS than in controls starting from the 12th week of gestation whereas those in CRP from the 20th week of gestation. By multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, in the PCOS group, a significant association with the risk of adverse obstetric/neonatal outcomes was found for WBC [hazard ratio (HR) 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31–1.64; p = 0.010], CRP (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06–1.34; p = 0.019), and ferritin levels (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03–1.26; p = 0.011).

Conclusions

In PCOS patients, the low-grade chronic inflammation persists during gestation and is exacerbated by pregnancy, and it is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Maternal disease with group B. streptococcus and serotype distribution worldwide: systematic review and meta-analyses [^116t3LkX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The influence of the case definition used can be seen when comparing the study focusing on severe maternal sepsis with strictly applied clinical criteria, which found the lowest incidence of maternal GBS disease (0.01/1000 maternities), to studies using microbiological results with less stringent clinical criteria, which reported higher incidence risks. For example, GBS bacteremia in febrile pregnant women had a reported incidence of 0.3 per 1000 births. The latter may overestimate cases, as transient bacteremia can occur in the absence of overt clinical sepsis, though in the presence of fever. These inconsistencies in studies purporting to investigate the same issue arise from a lack of consensus on maternal sepsis case definitions.

There are further issues with case ascertainment. First, clinical signs of sepsis may be obscured to some extent by the physiological changes in pregnancy. For example, leukocytosis, a sign of sepsis (see Supplementary Table 2), is a normal physiological change in pregnancy; in 1 study only 38% of women with pre- or intrapartum bacteremia had a white cell count outside the normal reference range for pregnancy. Second, many studies looked only at cases of bacteremia, and not at cultures from other sterile sites, underestimating the burden of GBS disease. Third, some febrile pregnant or postpartum women might not have had blood samples taken, reducing case ascertainment. Finally, in up to half of cases of severe sepsis the infection is polymicrobial — that is, a single causative organism cannot be identified from a sterile culture site, again leading to an underestimate of the number of cases of maternal GBS disease.

### Establishment of reference intervals of complete blood count for twin pregnancy [^114cLSn4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Twin pregnancy poses a high risk, and its incidence has increased in recent years. Establishment of reference intervals of complete blood count (CBC) for women with twin pregnancies during pregnancy may aid in the prognosis of adverse outcomes.

Methods

The incidence of complications and the intensity associated with adverse outcomes were analyzed in 1153 cases of twin pregnancy. A total of 253 cases in the twin pregnancy reference cohort were screened from all candidates after complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes were excluded. Complete blood count data were collected during the mid- and late-term of pregnancy and analyzed using SPSS to establish the reference intervals for peripheral blood in twin pregnancy.

Results

Premature rupture of the membrane and pelvic inflammatory disease were highly positively correlated with adverse outcomes, with OR values of 3.31 and 3.81, respectively. Within the interval population with normal outcomes, red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), and platelet (PLT) values were lower in twin-pregnant women during gestation than in healthy nulligravida women, but the levels of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NEU), and the NEU% increased, especially in the mid-term. The reference intervals of late-term pregnancy were validated using 20 twin pregnancies samples, and then utilized to determine the distinctive CBC characteristics in preterm birth (PTB) pregnancy. Absolute WBC and NEU values increased in PTB pregnancy based on our established reference intervals, which suggests that these may might be prognostic indicators of this adverse outcome.

Conclusion

Establishing the reference interval of blood cell-related indicators of normal twin pregnancy is helpful for the monitoring and prognosis of gestation.

### Leukocyte telomere dynamics across gestation in uncomplicated pregnancies and associations with stress [^117NqP21]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

The phenomenon of increasing LTLs has been previously described and may be related to the upregulation of telomerase, decreases in shelterin protein activity – which protects telomeres from pathologic lengthening – or even changes in the leukocyte composition of a sample. Furthermore, variability in LTL has been established even within leukocyte subclasses outside of pregnancy. Whether the increases in LTLs we identified points to variabilities in our measurements of LTLs, a regression to the mean phenomenon – where natural variation in longitudinal biologic measurements can result in repeat values being closer to the true mean value – or highlights the complexity of the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated in a larger cohort.

It is also important to note that postpartum LTLs were significantly shorter in participants who underwent cesarean vs. vaginal delivery. The average timing of LTL sample collection was on average more than 1 week postpartum, when patients would likely be outside the immediate post-operative inflammatory window during which a leukocytosis could affect LTLs. While data are lacking concerning the post-operative inflammatory response following cesarean, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been reported at 48 h after abdominal hysterectomy which may serve as a surgical correlate for cesarean. Given the known relation between LTL shortening and inflammation, it is possible that the shorter LTLs seen in this group reflect the post-operative state. Further investigation in this area is warranted given that there are limited data concerning how surgery might affect LTL. At the very least, this highlights the importance of consideration of mode of delivery in future studies investigating telomere length change in pregnancy, specifically when evaluating LTLs collected postpartum.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ICR 2019 guidelines recommend to diagnose immune thrombocytopenia based on the exclusion of other competing conditions, as in non-pregnant patients, using the patient's history, physical examination, blood counts, and blood smear examination.

### Investigating mitochondrial bioenergetics in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of women with childhood maltreatment from post-parturition period to one-year follow-up [^11516NVi]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

So far, mitochondrial bioenergetics were mainly examined in cross-sectional studies without providing information about the temporal stability of findings. For the first time, we investigated longitudinal alterations in mitochondrial respiration and density in PBMC of women with and without a history of CM at shortly after parturition (t 0) and 1 year after pregnancy (t 2). Thereby, we questioned whether our previous observations of upregulated mitochondrial bioenergetic profiles in PBMC of postpartum women with CM (Boeck et al; Gumpp et al.) remain stable over time or temporarily peak during phases of allostatic load, namely temporarily elevated inflammation at the postpartum period. Our results revealed that, independently of the women's CM experiences, the mitochondria of all women exhibited higher flux-control ratios at t 0 as compared to t 2. In contrast, the mitochondrial respiration parameters Leak respiration and Spare respiratory capacity increased from t 0 to t 2.

In healthy postpartum women, the immune system is stimulated by labor as well as delivery to increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in an upregulation of inflammatory processes (Corwin et al; Maes et al.). Across the next weeks to months, women recover from childbirth and inflammation regresses. With recovery, the women's HPA axis function, which is suppressed following delivery, normalizes and its hormones return to confine the inflammation (Mastorakos & Ilias).

In line with this, we found in our cohort a significant decrease of the white blood cell count (number of leukocytes in whole blood) from t 0 to t 2 in both groups indicating a decrease in inflammatory processes from t 0 to t 2. Leukocytes are mediators of inflammation and have a key role in host defense to injury. Increased white blood cell count has been associated with several adverse health conditions, like diabetes (Vozarova et al.), coronary heart disease (Madjid & Fatemi,), or a worse outcome in the general population (De Labry, Campion, Glynn, & Vokonas).

### Chronic myeloid leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116cYJss]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) during pregnancy — treatment and monitoring — states that in patients assigned male at birth, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy need not be discontinued if a pregnancy is planned, whereas in patients assigned female at birth, TKI therapy should be stopped prior to natural conception and patients should remain off therapy during pregnancy. If treatment is needed during pregnancy, it is preferable to initiate treatment with interferon; in the United States, peginterferon alfa‑2a and ropeginterferon alfa‑2b are available for clinical use, and if introduced earlier, peginterferon alfa‑2a can preserve molecular remission after discontinuation of TKI, though there are very limited data for ropeginterferon alfa‑2b in CML during pregnancy. TKI therapy, particularly during the first trimester, should be avoided because of teratogenic risk, and if TKI therapy is considered during pregnancy, the potential risks and benefits must be carefully evaluated in terms of maternal health and fetal risk on an individual basis. The Panel recommends against the use of hydroxyurea during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester; leukapheresis can be used for a rising white blood cell count and/or platelet count although data do not define initiation thresholds; and low‑dose aspirin or low‑molecular‑weight heparin can be considered for patients with thrombocytosis. Monthly monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) with differential and frequent monitoring with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (every 1–3 mo) would be helpful to guide the timing of initiation of TKI therapy.

### Practice bulletin No 166 summary: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^1115nWN4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia in pregnant women is diagnosed frequently by obstetricians because platelet counts are included with automated complete blood cell counts (CBCs) obtained during routine prenatal screening (1). Although most U.S. health care providers are trained using U.S. Conventional Units, most scientists, journals, and countries use Système International (SI) units. The laboratory results reported in U.S. Conventional Units can be converted to SI Units or vice versa by using a conversion factor. The conversion factor for platelet count results is 1.0 (ie, to convert from x 103/μL, multiply by 1.0, to get x 109/L). Thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count of less than 150 x 109/L, is common and occurs in 7–12% of pregnancies (2, 3). Thrombocytopenia can result from a variety of physiologic or pathologic conditions, several of which are unique to pregnancy. Some causes of thrombocytopenia are serious medical disorders that have the potential for maternal and fetal morbidity. In contrast, other conditions, such as gestational thrombocytopenia, are benign and pose no maternal or fetal risks. Because of the increased recognition of maternal and fetal thrombocytopenia, there are numerous controversies about obstetric management of this condition. Clinicians must weigh the risks of maternal and fetal bleeding complications against the costs and morbidity of diagnostic tests and invasive interventions.

### Reference intervals of complete blood count and coagulation tests in Vietnamese pregnant women [^114Cn5zD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy has major effects that make hematology parameters outside of normal reference ranges. Therefore, we conducted this study to establish reference intervals for Vietnamese pregnant women.

Methods

From June 2023 to Augst 2023, blood samples from 879 eligible pregnant women were run on DxH 900 hematology analyzer and ACL TOP 550 coagulation analyzer. The tested parameters are prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), white blood cell (WBC) and its differentials (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), RBC distribution width (RDW), RBC distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV). A non-parametric method was used to establish the 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentile reference intervals.

Results

PT, APTT decrease but fibrinogen increases during pregnancy. Physiological adaptations of pregnancy result in a decrease in RBC count, but an increase in WBC count and no changes in platelet count. The reference intervals for PT (seconds), APTT (seconds), fibrinogen (mg/dL), in the first trimester were 10.30–12.88, 25.40–35.46, 280.28–559.00, in the second trimester were 9.80–11.66, 24.05–33.23, 347.75–593.35, in the third trimester were 9.60–11.40, 23.40–31.80, 330.28–628.56, respectively. The reference intervals for main hematology parameters which are WBC (×10 9 /L), RBC (×10 12 /L), HGB (g/dL), HCT (%), PLT (×10 9 /L) in the first trimester were 6.33–15.24, 3.73–5.32, 10.33–13.95, 32.22–42.29, 169.66–413.88, in the second trimester were 6.99–15.55, 3.33–4.98, 9.71–13.17, 30.26–40.07, 172.34–372.19, in the third trimester were 6.22–14.14, 3.54–4.98, 9.80–13.97, 31.11–42.70, 151.30–417.14, respectively.

Conclusions

Most established referenced intervals from each trimester differ from other trimesters. These trimester-specific reference ranges for Vietnamese pregnant women will aid clinicians in entepreting parameters and help other laboratories adopt these ranges after validating.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^112N8yJu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study analyzed white blood cell (WBC) trends in a large population of 17,737 pregnant women, confirming increased WBC levels during pregnancy, primarily due to neutrophils. In a subpopulation of 16,230 pregnant women, results suggested RIs for ≤ 2 weeks, 3–5 weeks, and ≥ 6 weeks of gestation can utilize the range of 4–10 × 10^9/L, 4.7–11.9 × 10^9/L, and 5.7–14.4 × 10^9/L, respectively. Pregnant women with WBC over the upper limits had higher risk in certain pregnancy complications. These insights can help improve health monitoring and risk assessment during pregnancy.

WBC count, particularly neutrophil count, is known to increase during pregnancy, a phenomenon termed "physiologic leukocytosis of pregnancy". Several factors contribute to this phenomenon. Hormones such as estrogen and cortisol, elevated during pregnancy, stimulate the bone marrow to produce more WBCs. Additionally, these hormones prolong the lifespan of neutrophils by inhibiting their apoptosis, leading to an increased number of circulating neutrophils. Pregnancy itself induces a stress state, triggering the release of stress hormones like cortisol and catecholamines, which can further stimulate WBC production and release from the bone marrow. The mild systemic inflammatory state associated with pregnancy also promotes the production of certain cytokines that drive WBC production. Following labor, the rise in WBC count is a normal and beneficial response to the stress of childbirth. This increase serves to protect the mother from infections and support the healing process. The release of inflammatory mediators during labor and the tissue trauma associated with childbirth contribute to the elevation in WBC count. Moreover, the presence of bacteria in the birth canal can also trigger this response. The rapid increase in WBC count is considered a protective mechanism. Notably, the phenomenon of WBC increase during pregnancy and its subsequent peak after delivery has been observed in previous studies as well, confirming its consistency and significance.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: what obstetricians need to know [^114gUJjg]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging disease with a rapid increase in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019's effects during pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of ∼5 days (range, 2–14 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49–56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54–73%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17–29% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be ∼1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks' gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations. Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly. Clinicians should continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to stay up to date with the latest information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).

### Are complete blood cell counts useful in the evaluation of asymptomatic neonates exposed to suspected chorioamnionitis? [^115NKyGp]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Chorioamnionitis complicates 1% to 10% of pregnancies and increases the risk of neonatal infection. Women with chorioamnionitis receive intrapartum antibiotics, often resulting in inconclusive neonatal blood cultures. Peripheral neutrophil values are used frequently to assist in the diagnosis of neonatal infection and to determine duration of antibiotics; we sought to determine the utility of this approach.

Methods

A prospective observational study was performed in 856 near-term/term neonates who were exposed to suspected chorioamnionitis. Each received antibiotics for 48 hours unless clinical infection or positive blood cultures occurred. Peripheral neutrophils were measured serially and analyzed using the reference ranges of Manroe et al; an additional analysis of only the initial neutrophil values used the normal ranges of Schelonka et al. Results of neutrophil analyses were not used to determine duration of therapy. Fifty percent of asymptomatic neonates were seen postdischarge to ascertain recurrent infection. Local patient charges were examined.

Results

Ninety-six percent of neonates were asymptomatic and had negative cultures, and antibiotics were discontinued at 48 hours. A total of 2427 neutrophil counts were analyzed. Although abnormal neutrophil values were more frequent in infected or symptomatic neonates, 99% of asymptomatic neonates had ≥ 1 abnormal value. The specificity and negative predictive values for abnormal neutrophil values ranged between 0.12 and 0.95 and 0.91 and 0.97, respectively; sensitivity was 0.27 to 0.76. Significant differences in interpretation of the initial neutrophil values were noted, depending on the normal values used. Follow-up was performed for 373 asymptomatic neonates until 3 weeks' postnatal age. Eight required rehospitalization; none had evidence of bacterial infection. If neutrophil values had been used to determine duration of antibiotics, then local costs would have increased by 76,000 dollars to 425,000 dollars per year.

Conclusions

Single or serial neutrophil values do not assist in the diagnosis of early-onset infection or determination of duration of antibiotic therapy in asymptomatic, culture-negative neonates who are ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and are delivered of women with suspected chorioamnionitis.

### Endogenous control of inflammation characterizes pregnant women with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection [^115o9tt4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Concerns are now arising with the second/third wave of the pandemic where more severe illness seems to characterize pregnant women with respect to the first wave, independently from COVID-19 strain. Even though COVID-19 manifestation seems to be less severe in pregnant women than in elderly patients, it could be not completely absent, or silent. Therefore, more investigational studies need to be done to assess the true impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy. A recent review of 63 observational studies on a total of 637 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed that more than 3 out of 4 experienced mild disease.

In order to better understand the severity of the infection, clinical outcomes on pregnant women with COVID-19 were compared with those of SARS and MERS. Interestingly, case fatality was 0%, 18%, and 25%, respectively. In addition, clinical manifestations reported in pregnant women were mild and similar to those reported in nonpregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2, with predominant features including fever, cough, dyspnea, and lymphopenia. Vertical transmission has been reported in SARS as ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in the placenta. Even if the structure of the receptor-binding domain of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 is similar, cases of vertical transmission of COVID-19 are possible, although reported in few cases –.

During pregnancy, the immune system undergoes relevant changes, and the immunological shifts that occur in pregnancy are partially related to changes in hormonal levels. The immune system of pregnant woman is characterized by an anti-inflammatory immunological tolerance, and for this reason, many autoimmune diseases go into remission, only to flare again in the early postpartum period. Clearly, this could leave the mother more susceptible to viral infections, as a Th1 response better helps to contrast viruses, even if little is known about the response to SARS-CoV-2.

The immune system of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection is now receiving more attention, and different questions are under deep investigation. Here we show that pregnant women with or without infection are characterized by different plasma levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, PBMC from all women have similar subset distributions and general functions of, and show normal parameters related to cell activation or exhaustion, except for higher amounts of circulating low-density neutrophils in infected pregnant women. A deep characterization of T- and B- lymphocyte subsets, along with monocytes, natural killer, and dendritic cells, shows a substantial lack of effect of the viral infection on such populations.

### Acute appendicitis during pregnancy: different from the nonpregnant state? [^113A1yVL]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common nonobstetric indication for surgical intervention during pregnancy. However, the current literature is scarce and composed of relatively small case series. We aimed to compare the presentation, management, and surgical outcomes of presumed acute appendicitis between a contemporary cohort of pregnant women and nonpregnant women of reproductive age.

Methods

The study group included 92 pregnant patients who underwent appendectomy for presumed acute appendicitis at a single tertiary medical center in 2000–2014. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical data were derived from medical records and compared to data for 494 nonpregnant patients of reproductive age who underwent appendectomy in 2004–2007 at the same institution.

Results

Median age was 28 years (range 25–33) in the study group and 26 years (range 20–34) in the control group (P = 0.1). There were no between-group differences in mean white blood cell count, patient interval, hospital interval, or operative time. Preoperative abdominal ultrasound was used in a significantly higher proportion of patients in the pregnant group than in the nonpregnant group (73 and 27%, respectively, P < 0.001) and computed tomography, in a significantly lower proportion of patients (1 vs. 16%, respectively, P < 0.001). The two groups had similar rates of negative appendectomy (23 and 22%, P = 0.9), complicated appendicitis (12 and 11%, P = 0.9), and overall postoperative complications (15 and 12%, P = 0.3).

Conclusions

The clinical presentation and outcome of presumed acute appendicitis are similar in pregnant women and nonpregnant women of reproductive age. Therefore, similar perioperative management algorithms may be applied in both patient populations.

### A nomogram based on hematological parameters for prediction of spontaneous abortion risk in pregnancies [^116ra7sQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the exact mechanisms behind miscarriage are not fully understood, the main causes are chromosomal abnormalities, immunologic diseases, infections, endocrine diseases, thrombophilia, and inflammation. At present, the hematological parameters used clinically to predict the outcome of early pregnancy include thromboelastography, lymphocyte subsets, thyroid function, antiphospholipid antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, inflammatory markers, etc. Thrombophilia is positively correlated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Pregnant women with coagulation, anticoagulation dysfunction or disorders can develop a maternal hypercoagulable state, which worsens with the progress of pregnancy and increases the incidence of various pregnancy complications. The thrombophilia workup included blood cell counts, coagulation parameters, factor levels, d-dimer, fibrinogen levels, proteins C and S, etc. Autoimmune diseases can significantly increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortion. It has been confirmed that the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage, stillbirth, and fetal death in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is significantly higher than that in the normal population. The risk of severe complications for SLE pregnant women and newborns is also significantly higher than that in the normal population. Experts suggest that patients with recurrent miscarriages should undergo a comprehensive and systematic screening of immune-related indicators, such as antinuclear antibody, thyroid autoantibodies, antiphospholipid antibody, lupus anticoagulant, etc. to exclude the possibility of autoimmune factors contributing to the miscarriages. Endocrine diseases such as thyroid dysfunction and abnormal glucose metabolism can increase the risk of pregnancy loss. Some literature has pointed out that systemic inflammation markers such as cytokines, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, etc. are also associated with pregnancy loss.

This study aimed to develop a nomogram based on hematological parameters to accurately predict spontaneous abortion risk, enabling personalized care and treatment for high-risk pregnancies.

### The value of eosinophil count in the diagnosis of preeclampsia among pregnant women attending the university of gondar comprehensive specialized hospital, northwest Ethiopia, 2021 [^1165tX8i]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy-related complications, such as gestational diabetes mellitus and preeclampsia (PE) are potent contributors to mortality and morbidity in pregnant women. Early diagnosis and prediction of these complications are crucial to improving their outcomes. PE is defined as a new onset of hypertension associated with proteinuria (blood pressure:140 / 90 mmHg after 20 th GW; proteinuria: ≥ 1 + in urine dipstick) and fluid retention detected for the first time after the 20th week of gestation and affects 2–8% of all pregnancies. It can be classified as early-onset PE when PE was diagnosed before 34 weeks of gestation, late-onset PE when diagnosed after 34 weeks of gestation.

The maternal immune system is strongly stressed during all stages of gestation. It is known that normal pregnancy is accompanied by leukocytosis and the most cause is an increase in neutrophils. Leukocytosis is also significant in PE. Studies have shown that the hematological parameters in pregnant women with hypertensive disorder pregnancy, including PE, are different from Normotensive (NT) pregnant women- (pregnant women with normal blood pressure; less than 120/80 mmHg and negative for urine protein). Specifically, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios (NLR) and platelet count with their indices may predict disease development and may help in monitoring disease and the prognosis of PE. However, differential counts of leukocytes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils) in patients with PE have not been defined precisely.

Eosinophils are granular nucleated white cells representing up to 6% of the bone marrow cells and are routinely measured as part of the complete blood cell count. Their development and maturation occur in the bone marrow underexposure of myeloid precursors to interleukin-3, Granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-5 (IL5). IL5 is particularly important for the final stage of eosinophil differentiation and migration into the circulating blood. Furthermore, it is a key cytokine in the survival of circulating and tissue eosinophils. It prevents eosinophils from apoptosis and promotes cell activation. The activation of eosinophils usually occurs after they have migrated into a tissue site by the integrated interactions of cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules.

Eosinophils play an important role in the immune response to infection including parasites and fungi. They are also known to play important roles in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation by secreting various mediators like eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil derived neurotoxin and major basic protein upon activation by cytokines, immunoglobulins, or platelet-activating factors. They are also important in tissue development, repair, support, and maintenance of tissue integrity.

### Elevated first-trimester neutrophil count is closely associated with the development of maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^117Qon39]. Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic low-grade inflammation plays a central role in the pathophysiology of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). To investigate the ability of different inflammatory blood cell parameters in predicting the development of GDM and pregnancy outcomes, 258 women with GDM and 1,154 women without were included in this retrospective study. First-trimester neutrophil count outperformed white blood cell count and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in the predictability for GDM. Subjects were grouped based on tertiles of neutrophil count during their first-trimester pregnancy. The results showed that as the neutrophil count increased, there was a stepwise increase in GDM incidence as well as in glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, HOMA for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), macrosomia incidence, and newborn weight. Neutrophil count was positively associated with prepregnancy BMI, HOMA-IR, and newborn weight. Additionally, neutrophil count was an independent risk factor for the development of GDM, regardless of the history of GDM. Spline regression showed that there was a significant linear association between GDM incidence and the continuous neutrophil count when it was > 5.0 × 10 9 /L. This work suggested that the first-trimester neutrophil count is closely associated with the development of GDM and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

WARNINGS

Use of Strontium-89 Chloride Injection in patients with evidence of seriously compromised bone marrow from previous therapy or disease infiltration is not recommended unless the potential benefit of the treatment outweighs its risks. Bone marrow toxicity is to be expected following the administration of Strontium-89, particularly white blood cells and platelets. The extent of toxicity is variable. It is recommended that the patient's peripheral blood cell counts be monitored at least once every other week. Typically, platelets will be depressed by about 30% compared to pre-administration levels. The nadir of platelet depression in most patients is found between 12 and 16 weeks following administration of Strontium-89 Chloride Injection. White blood cells are usually depressed to a varying extent compared to pre-administration levels. Thereafter, recovery occurs slowly, typically reaching pre-administration levels six months after treatment unless the patient's disease or additional therapy intervenes.

In considering repeat administration of Strontium-89 Chloride Injection, the patient's hematologic response to the initial dose, current platelet level and other evidence of marrow depletion should be carefully evaluated.

Verification of dose and patient identification is necessary prior to administration because Strontium-89 delivers a relatively high dose of radioactivity.

Strontium-89 Chloride Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.

### Fluphenazine decanoate [^115GGK5x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Fluphenazine Decanoate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue Fluphenazine Decanoate Injection at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm3) should discontinue Fluphenazine Decanoate Injection and have their WBC followed until recovery.

Information for Patients

Given the likelihood that a substantial proportion of patients exposed chronically to neuroleptics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^1142eDQf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

To allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of RI for WBC count during pregnancy, four different approaches for establishing RIs were compared in this study: non-pregnant 95% RI, pregnant 95% RI using threshold regression, parametric pregnant 95% RI, and non-parametric pregnant 95% RI (Table 2). The currently utilized RI for pregnancy is based on the non-pregnant range of 4–10 × 10^9/L, with both the upper and lower limits lower than those established by the other three methods. The new reference interval for ≥ 6 weeks of gestation based on the threshold regression (5.7–14.4 × 10^9/L) was similar to the parametric (5.9–14.5 × 10^9/L) and non-parametric (5.9–14.4 × 10^9/L) methods, indicating the robustness of the results. However, the RI for 3–5 weeks was smaller in the upper limit (4.7–11.9 vs. 4.6–13.2 vs. 4.6–12.9 × 10^9/L), probably due to the impact of low sample size.

Table 2
Reference intervals for white blood cell count during pregnancy

†RI, reference interval

Additionally, the study compared the difference between threshold and linear regressions for establishing RIs. Given the limited sample size in the 0 to 6 weeks gestation period and a changing point at 7th week, this comparison was conducted using samples from 7 to 40 weeks gestation. As depicted in Figure S5, the upper limits in the threshold regression model were only slightly higher than those obtained through linear regression.

High white blood cell count is associated with pregnancy-related complications

As demonstrated in Table 3, women in the high WBC group exhibited a significantly increased risk of placenta previa by 111% (P = 0.003), oligohydramnios by 46% (P = 0.029), secondary uterine inertia by 32% (P = 0.027), and intrauterine growth restriction by 73% (P = 0.032). Furthermore, within the complicated cases, the High group exhibited a higher proportion of women experiencing one, three, and four complications (Figure S6).

### Smoking, oral contraceptives, and obesity… [^114mWeq2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Data from 14, 961 healthy women were analyzed to determine the relative importance of factors that alter the white blood cell count. The effects of smoking, oral contraceptive use, and obesity were most striking. A total leukocyte count greater than 10, 000/cu mm was found in 44% of obese, heavily smoking women who took oral contraceptives as compared to 2% of women without these attributes. Other factors such as age, time of day, phase of the menstrual cycle, and red blood cell variables were of lesser significance. The use of noncontraceptive estrogenic hormones did not affect the WBC count. Recognition of these findings is important because excessive laboratory studies, lost physician time, and patient inconvenience may thereby be avoided. Fisch IR, Freedman SH. Smoking, Oral Contraceptives, and Obesity: Effects on White Blood Cell Count. JAMA. 1975; 234: 500–506.

### Selected hematologic and biochemical measurements in African HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women and their infants: the HIV prevention trials network 024 protocol [^112Byiq9]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Reference values for hematological and biochemical assays in pregnant women and in newborn infants are based primarily on Caucasian populations. Normative data are limited for populations in sub-Saharan Africa, especially comparing women with and without HIV infection, and comparing infants with and without HIV infection or HIV exposure.

Methods

We determined HIV status and selected hematological and biochemical measurements in women at 20–24 weeks and at 36 weeks gestation, and in infants at birth and 4–6 weeks of age. All were recruited within a randomized clinical trial of antibiotics to prevent chorioamnionitis-associated mother-to-child transmission of HIV (HPTN024). We report nearly complete laboratory data on 2,292 HIV-infected and 367 HIV-uninfected pregnant African women who were representative of the public clinics from which the women were recruited. Nearly all the HIV-infected mothers received nevirapine prophylaxis at the time of labor, as did their infants after birth (always within 72 hours of birth, but typically within just a few hours at the four study sites in Malawi (2 sites), Tanzania, and Zambia.

Results

HIV-infected pregnant women had lower red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell counts than HIV-uninfected women. Platelet and monocyte counts were higher among HIV-infected women at both time points. At the 4–6-week visit, HIV-infected infants had lower hemoglobin, hematocrit and white blood cell counts than uninfected infants. Platelet counts were lower in HIV-infected infants than HIV-uninfected infants, both at birth and at 4–6 weeks of age. At 4–6 weeks, HIV-infected infants had higher alanine aminotransferase measures than uninfected infants.

Conclusion

Normative data in pregnant African women and their newborn infants are needed to guide the large-scale HIV care and treatment programs being scaled up throughout the continent. These laboratory measures will help interpret clinical data and assist in patient monitoring in a sub-Saharan Africa context.

### Nucleated red blood cells in uncomplicated prolonged pregnancy [^1128j35z]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Elevated counts of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs), as well as prolongation of pregnancy, have been suggested as predictors of adverse perinatal outcome. However, the association between these 2 variables has received only minimal attention. We sought to evaluate fetal NRBCs in prolonged pregnancies.

Methods

Umbilical cord blood was prospectively collected at delivery from 75 prolonged (at or beyond 287 days) pregnancies. One hundred and fifty term deliveries (260–286 days) served as controls. All pregnancies were accurately dated with the use of first-trimester sonography. Fetal biophysical profile testing was initiated at 40 weeks of gestation. Patients were delivered if they were in spontaneous labor or the biophysical profile was nonreassuring or by 42 weeks of gestation. Nucleated red blood cell counts were expressed per 100 white blood cells (WBC). Umbilical artery pH studies, as well as other demographic and clinical variables, were obtained.

Results

Prolonged pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased incidence of induction of labor and a greater birth weight. There were no other differences between the study group and controls. The median NRBCs per 100 WBCs in prolonged pregnancy was not significantly elevated over the term values (median 3, range 0–35 versus median 3, range 0–34, respectively; p = 0.25). Neonatal outcome was also comparable between groups. The univariate regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between elevated NRBC counts and low arterial cord blood pH (P < .008, R = 0.175), elevated base excess (P = .02, R = 0.149), low platelet counts (P = .046, R = 0.134), and male gender (P = .028). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that low arterial cord blood pH and male gender were the only independent variables predicting elevated NRBC counts at birth.

Conclusion

The findings of this study suggest that elevated NRBC counts are associated with specific pregnancy complications rather than uncomplicated prolonged pregnancies in general.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116E62fe]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

CML — treatment and monitoring during pregnancy: Most literature consists of case reports, and TKI therapy, particularly during the first trimester, should be avoided because of teratogenic risk; if TKI therapy is considered, risks and benefits must be evaluated individually. Leukapheresis can be used for rising white blood cell or platelet counts but there are no data defining initiation levels. Low-dose aspirin or low‑molecular‑weight heparin can be considered for thrombocytosis. The Panel recommends against hydroxyurea during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. If treatment is needed, it is preferable to initiate interferon alfa‑2a; peginterferon alfa‑2a and ropeginterferon alfa‑2b are available in the United States, with peginterferon alfa‑2a able to preserve molecular remission after TKI discontinuation and very limited data for ropeginterferon alfa‑2b in pregnancy. Monitoring with monthly complete blood count (CBC) and frequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (every 1–3 months) would be helpful to guide timing for TKI initiation, although thresholds for reinitiation are not defined.

Results

Overview of the study population

In this study, a total of 19,748 deliveries were initially identified to meet the inclusion criteria. Subsequently, women with age less than 18 years old, infectious diseases, immune diseases, a history of malignant or borderline tumors, other diseases impacting blood cells, incomplete blood routine data, and extreme outliers were excluded from the analysis. As a result, 17,737 pregnancies were included for the analysis of the WBC trend, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The majority of the study population consisted of ethnic Han individuals (97.1%), and the average age was 30.2 ± 4.48 years. Further characteristics of the population are detailed in Table S1.

### Levetiracetam (roweepra) [^112wB54t]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 4 Years to < 16 Years

Statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the levetiracetam-treated group were -0.4 × 10 9 /L and -0.3 × 10 9 /L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. Mean relative lymphocyte counts increased by 1.7% in levetiracetam-treated patients, compared to a decrease of 4% in placebo patients (statistically significant).

In the controlled trial, more levetiracetam-treated patients had a possibly clinically significant abnormally low WBC value (3% of levetiracetam-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients), however, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count (5% of levetiracetam-treated patients versus 4.2% of placebo-treated patients). No patient was discontinued secondary to low WBC or neutrophil counts.

In the controlled cognitive and neuropsychological safety study, 5 patients (8.6%) in the levetiracetam-treated group and two patients (6.1%) in the placebo-treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (≥ 10% or ≥ 0.7x10 9 /L).

5.10 Increase in Blood Pressure

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, a significantly higher risk of increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in the levetiracetam-treated patients (17%), compared to the placebo-treated patients (2%). There was no overall difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between the treatment groups. This disparity between the levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups was not observed in the studies of older children or in adults.

Monitor patients 1 month to < 4 years of age for increases in diastolic blood pressure.

5.11 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^114QKP5w]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

### Levetiracetam in sodium chloride (levetiracetam) [^116sxZ1Z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Hematologic Abnormalities

Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cells counts (RBC); decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

Partial-Onset Seizures

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, minor but statistically significant decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC (0.03 × 106/mm3), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients.

A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 × 109/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1.0 × 109/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Although there were no obvious hematologic abnormalities observed in patients with JME, the limited number of patients makes any conclusion tentative. The data from the partial seizure patients should be considered to be relevant for JME patients.

5.9 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

### Clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of adnexal torsion in pregnant women: a retrospective study [^1164qS4y]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we summarized the characteristics, treatment and outcomes of AT in pregnant women over 10 years. Eighty-two patients were included. However, considering that the occurrence of AT during pregnancy is uncommon, the number of cases in our study is relatively large. Hasson et al. described a series of 118 patients with AT during a 10-year period in two tertiary centers, of which 41 patients were pregnant. Ginath et al. reported 54 cases of AT in pregnant women.

The accurate diagnosis of AT is often challenging, as the symptoms and signs of AT during pregnancy lack specificity. Consistent with other studies, most cases occurred in the first trimester but could occur even in the third trimester: 8 (9.8%) patients experienced AT in the third trimester. Almost all patients were admitted to the emergency department because of acute or subacute low abdominal pain. Nausea and vomiting was another common manifestation after pain, with an incidence of up to 70%. AT can be misdiagnosed as other diseases that cause lower abdominal pain, such as appendicitis and renal colic. In the present study, three patients underwent laparotomy because of suspected appendicitis and were found to have AT during the operation. In addition, white blood cell counts may be slightly elevated. Chang et al. reported that 45% of patients had elevated white blood cells. Ginath et al. also revealed a slight elevation in white blood cell counts in pregnant women with AT compared with nonpregnant women. In our study, 47.6% of patients had leukocytosis, which was consistent with previous studies.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute myeloid leukaemia in pregnancy [^116UFFbM]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Pregnant women should be managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes haematologists, obstetricians, neonatologists and anaesthetists (Grade 1C) As for non-pregnant patients, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) should be diagnosed using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification (Grade 1A) Women diagnosed with AML in pregnancy should be treated without delay (Grade 1B) When the diagnosis of AML is made in the first trimester, a successful pregnancy outcome is unlikely and spontaneous pregnancy loss in this situation carries considerable risks for the mother. The reasons for and against elective termination should be discussed with the patient (Grade 2C) In the case of presentation beyond 32 weeks gestation, it may be reasonable to deliver the foetus prior to commencement of chemotherapy (Grade 2C) Between 24 and 32 weeks, risks of foetal chemotherapy exposure must be balanced against risks of prematurity following elective delivery at that stage of gestation (Grade 1C) The risk-benefit ratio must be carefully considered before using any drugs in pregnancy (Grade 1C) Where AML induction chemotherapy is delivered, a standard daunorubicin, cytarabine 3 + 10 schedule should be used (Grade 1B) Chemotherapy should be dosed according to actual body weight and adjustments made for weight changes during treatment (Grade 1C) Quinolones, tetracyclines and sulphonamide use should be avoided in pregnancy (Grade 1B) Amphotericin B or lipid derivatives are the antifungal of choice in pregnancy (Grade 2C) Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-negative blood products should be administered during pregnancy regardless of CMV serostatus (Grade 1B) A course of corticosteroids should be considered if delivery is anticipated between 24 and 35 weeks gestation, given over a 48-h period during the week prior to delivery (Grade 1A) Use of magnesium sulphate should be considered in the 24 h prior to delivery if this is before 30 weeks gestation (Grade 1A) Where possible, delivery should be planned for a time when the woman is at least 3 weeks post-chemotherapy to minimize risk of neonatal myelosuppression (Grade 1C) Planned delivery is easier to manage than spontaneous labour; induction of labour is usually advised (Grade 2C) Epidural analgesia should be avoided in a woman who is significantly thrombocytopenic (platelet count < 80 × 10(9) /l) and/or neutropenic (white blood cell count < 1 × 10(9) /l): (Grade 1C) Elective caesarean section should only be recommended for obstetric indications (Grade 2C) Antibiotics should be administered during and after premature rupture of membranes and delivery (Grade 1C).

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^112rExHY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on these observations, we propose the following RIs: ≤ 2 weeks of gestation can utilize the non-pregnancy reference interval of 4–10 × 10^9/L. For 3–5 weeks of gestation, the reference interval can be set as 4.7–11.9 × 10^9/L, while ≥ 6 weeks of gestation can utilize the range of 5.7–14.4 × 10^9/L. These recommendations provide more accurate and appropriate RIs for WBC count during different weeks of gestation.

During pregnancy, the information carried by blood cells is beyond that found in non-pregnant individuals. Elevated levels of haemoglobin concentration has been associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and similarly, a high WBC count is also linked to the adverse outcomes. A retrospective study showed that total leukocyte count, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were significantly higher in the placenta previa group compared to the controls, suggesting a valuable predictor for placenta previa. A study suggests that higher total WBC and absolute neutrophil counts in the third trimester are associated with small-for-gestational-age birth. These associations may indicate a cycle of inflammation and placental dysfunction contributing to fetal growth restriction. In our study, we as well found the WBC count over upper limit was associated with the placenta previa and fetal growth restriction. Moreover, we discovered additional associations between high WBC count and complications such as oligohydramnios and secondary uterine inertia, which have not been previously reported. The potential mechanisms for these observations might be attributed to systemic chronic inflammation, which can lead to alterations in the uterine environment. These novel findings suggest that establishing an RI for WBC during pregnancy is crucial not only for detecting infections but also for identifying and monitoring various pregnancy-related complications.

In conclusion, our study examined WBC trends in a large population of pregnant women and confirmed the well-known increase in WBC levels during pregnancy, primarily driven by neutrophils. Our findings suggest that different RIs should be applied based on gestational age, with RI partitioning necessary for specific periods. We also identified associations between high WBC count and various pregnancy-related complications, including placenta previa, fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, secondary uterine inertia, and shoulder presentation. These results highlight the importance of using appropriate RIs for WBC count during pregnancy to enhance health monitoring and risk assessment.

### Reference intervals of complete blood count and coagulation tests in Vietnamese pregnant women [^114tFVpc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

During pregnancy, the mother has an increase in blood volume, up to 50% increase. This contributes to slightly decreased red blood cell indices, also known as dilutional anemia. However, red blood cell production also increases by 25–30% until term gestation. In our study, RBC, HCT, and HGB (Fig. 1) started to decline in the second trimester but then rise again in the third trimester, which is explained by the physiology adaptation in pregnancy. The 2.5 th percentiles of HGB (g/dL) in our study are 10.33, 9.71, 9.80 in first, second and third trimester, respectively. Nevertheless, according to the definition of anemia recommended by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HGB levels below 11 g/dL, 10.5 g/dL, 11 g/dL in first, second and third trimester, respectively, are considered to be anemic. 11% of patients were classified as anemia if we use CDC criteria despite taking taking iron supplements. Several studies including Aiwei Li et al. and Yi Jin et al. also found that the 2.5 th percentiles were below the diagnostic cutoff for anemia. An explanation for this phenomenon may be due to the use of 5 th percentile of data aggregated from four European studies of healthy iron-supplemented pregnant women to establish the cutoff. Therefore, CDC conventional diagnostic criteria for anemia may not be approriate for Vietnamese pregnant women and we suggest the use of 2.5 th percentile as a cutoff for anemia diagnosis.

Fig. 1
RBC, HCT, HGB, MCV, MCH, and RDW during pregnancy. The middle line reflects the median, and the crossbars represents the 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentiles

In addition, Torgersen CKL and Curran CA reported white blood cell count increases in the beginning of the first trimester and then remains stable in the second and third trimester. In white blood cell count, neutrophils contributes the most to the rise, followed by eosinophils. In our study, white blood cell count from all trimesters ranges from nearly 6 × 10 9 /L to roughly 15 × 10 9 /L, with the number of white blood cell count increases slightly in second trimester, compared to the first trimester, but decreases in the third trimester (Fig. 2). Thus, the difference between the third trimester and first trimester shows no statistical significance.

### Are published standards for haematological indices in pregnancy applicable across populations: an evaluation in healthy pregnant Jamaican women [^116t31U8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The haematological profile of the pregnant woman has an impact on the outcome of the pregnancy. Published guidelines indicate acceptable levels for haematological indices in pregnancy but they are population specific. Indicators of haemoglobin concentration are the most commonly utilized of the indices. These published international norms are used across populations, however, there is no evidence confirming their applicability to a population such as the Jamaican pregnant woman. This study was therefore undertaken with the intent of documenting the haematological profile of pregnant primigravid Jamaican women and comparing these to the established norms to determine whether the norms apply or whether there was a need to establish local norms.

Methods

This was a longitudinal study done on a cohort of 157 healthy primigravid women ages 15 to 25 and without anaemia, and who were recruited from the antenatal clinic of the University Hospital of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica. The haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume, mean cell volume, mean cell haemoglobin, mean cell haemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, red blood cell count and platelet count were measured on samples of blood obtained from each consenting participant during each of the three trimesters. The results were analysed using SPSS for windows (Version 11) and the data expressed as means ± S.D. Means were compared using the student's paired t-test. Comparison was then made with the international norms as recommended by the United States Center for Disease Control (1989). Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the University Hospital of the West Indies/University of the West Indies Ethics Committee.

Results

The results showed changes by trimester in all measured variables. For most of the indices the changes achieved levels of significance across trimesters. These changes were however in keeping with the expected physiological response in pregnancy and the values were similar to the published international norms.

Conclusion

The findings suggest that the international norms for haematological indices in pregnancy are applicable across populations and to the pregnant Jamaican primigravid woman. This finding may be reassuring to others with a similar population and stage of development as Jamaica.

### Maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia: a case-control study [^111Uq6xP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused serious concerns about its potential adverse effects on pregnancy. There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics and maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia.

Results

During the period 24 January-29 February 2020, there were 16 pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 18 suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest were cesarean delivery. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest computed tomographic images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had lower counts of white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase on admission. Increased levels of WBCs, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. Three (18.8%) of the mothers with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 3 (16.7%) with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than in the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during their hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns, and none developed severe neonatal complications.

Conclusions

Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal or cesarean delivery. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^111Ybhd3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

White blood cell increased during pregnancy

The WBC count was assessed in this study at a median of five times, with an interquartile range of 3–6, resulting in a total of 86,578 results. Most of the samples were collected according to the recommended schedule, with notable peaks observed at 8 weeks (n = 2,124), 16 weeks (n = 6,103), 24 weeks (n = 5,035), 30 weeks (n = 5,188), and 36 weeks (n = 7,755) of gestation, as well as at 0 week (n = 9,526) and 4 weeks (n = 4,811) of postpartum (Figure S1).

It is widely recognized that WBC levels increase during pregnancy. This study confirms this trend by analyzing data from the prepregnancy period to the postpartum phase. The median WBC count remained relatively stable at around 6 × 10^9/L before pregnancy and increased after conception (Fig. 2 a). A notable surge in WBC count was observed during the first 7 weeks of gestation, followed by a relatively steady trend until the 15 weeks. Subsequently, it gradually increased, reaching a peak of 9.9 × 10^9/L at 25 weeks, followed by a gradual decline until 40 weeks. The increase in WBC count during the first and second trimesters was statistically significant (all P values < 0.001), rising from 6.25 × 10^9/L in the pre-pregnancy phase to 8.73 × 10^9/L in the first trimester and 9.33 × 10^9/L in the second trimester (Fig. 2 b). WBC count in the third trimester was similar to that in the second trimester, measuring 9.35 × 10^9/L. An intriguing observation was noted during the postpartum period, where the WBC count rapidly increased to its highest level of 11.3 × 10^9/L in the immediate postnatal week (0 to 6 days). Following this peak, the WBC count gradually declined, reaching a level of 7.0 × 10^9/L at 4 weeks postnatally, which was similar to the WBC count in the prepregnancy phase. Subsequently, the WBC count remained relatively consistent.

### Clinical stratification of pregnant COVID-19 patients based on severity: a single academic center experience [^114G8UAX]. American Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to describe baseline characteristics of a cohort of pregnant women infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and determine if these correlate with disease severity and perinatal outcomes.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort trial conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston, Texas. All pregnant women presented to our medical center, who were screened and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, were included. We stratified our study population in three groups: asymptomatic, symptomatic not requiring oxygen therapy, and patients requiring oxygen support to maintain oxygen saturation > 94%. Relevant population characteristics, laboratory data, and maternal and neonatal outcomes were abstracted. A p -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Between March and July 2020, 91 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission to our labor and delivery unit. Among these, 61.5% were asymptomatic, 34.1% were symptomatic, and 4.4% required oxygen support. Our population was mainly Hispanic (80.2%), multiparous (76.9%), obese (70.3%), and with a median age of 27 years. Median gestational age at symptom onset or diagnosis was 36 weeks. Significant differences were found between gestational age and disease severity. Maternal characteristics including age, body mass index (BMI), and presence of comorbid conditions did not appear to influence severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significant laboratory findings associated with increasing disease severity included decreasing hemoglobin and white blood cell count, lymphopenia, and increasing levels of inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin. Maternal and neonatal outcomes did not differ among groups. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected by polymerase chain reaction testing in neonates of mothers with COVID-19.

Conclusion

Pregnant patients with COVID-19 infection are predominantly asymptomatic. Patients appear to be at increased risk for more severe infection requiring oxygen support later in pregnancy.

Key Points

· The majority of pregnant patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and < 1 in 20 require oxygen support. · Women in the later stages of pregnancy may be at increased risk for severe infection. · Anemia, leukopenia, CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin are associated with increasing severity.

### Relationship between TYG mediated pregnancy diabetes history and SII in American women: a retrospective cohort study of NHANES 2011–2018 [^1132UMBD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is a condition diagnosed during pregnancy that affects approximately 2% to 10% of pregnant women. Although GDM typically resolves after childbirth, its long-term health impacts on both mother and child cannot be overlooked. Studies have shown that women with a history of GDM are significantly more likely to develop Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) later in life. Additionally, these women are at a higher risk of other metabolic disorders, such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The influence of GDM extends beyond blood sugar control issues. Its direct connection with metabolic health makes GDM a critical window for studying chronic inflammatory states. Inflammation plays a key role in the development of many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD), metabolic syndrome, and T2DM. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count are often elevated in patients with GDM, indicating that GDM may increase systemic inflammation levels.

The Systemic Inflammatory Index (SII), derived from the counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets in peripheral blood, has recently been used to assess the state of inflammation within the body. SII has demonstrated potential value in predicting cardiovascular events, cancer progression, and other inflammation-related diseases in various studies. Additionally, the Triglyceride-Glucose Index (TyG index), a non-invasive, cost-effective tool for assessing insulin resistance, has been studied in women with GDM. Research indicates that the TyG index correlates positively with the risk of developing metabolic diseases in the future. Although primarily used for evaluating metabolic health, the potential mediating role of the TyG index — namely, its capacity to influence systemic inflammation through metabolic status — remains underexplored.

Therefore, this study aims to fill this knowledge gap by exploring the potential mechanisms through which GDM impacts long-term health, particularly how it influences the TyG index and thereby possibly increases the risk of other chronic diseases. This research is crucial for understanding the comprehensive impact of GDM and providing targeted interventions for its patients, bearing significant clinical and public health implications.

### Platelet counts in uncomplicated pregnancies at term [^113KPAAY]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate platelet counts at delivery in uncomplicated pregnancies between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation.

Study Design

Platelet counts in women 16 to 45 years of age from August 1, 2011, through May 15, 2018, with a singleton pregnancy that delivered from 37 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks of gestation. Women with pregnancy-related complications, preexisting disorders, or on medications that could affect platelet counts were excluded.

Results

A total of 18,526 women had uncomplicated pregnancies with mean platelet count from 37 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks of gestation of 220×10 9 /L. The lower limit 95th percentile (2.5% quantile) was 120×10 9 /L. Platelet counts decreased weekly from 37 to 41 weeks of gestation, becoming significant at 39 weeks of gestation and beyond, compared with 37 weeks (p < 0.01). Mean platelet counts: 225×10 9 /L at 37 weeks, 223×10 9 /L at 38 weeks, 219×10 9 /L at 39 weeks, 218×10 9 /L at 40 weeks, and 216×10 9 /L at 41 weeks of gestation. Platelet counts of less than 150×10 9 /L occurred in 9.7%.

Conclusion

Platelet counts in uncomplicated pregnancies decrease weekly from 37 to 41 weeks of gestation. This will be important to consider when serial platelet values are monitored for other indications.

### Leukocytosis: basics of clinical assessment… [^111LTomS]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, defined as a white blood cell count greater than 11, 000 per mm 3, 1 is frequently found in the course of routine laboratory testing. An elevated white blood cell count typically reflects the normal response of bone marrow to an infectious or inflammatory process. Occasionally, leukocytosis is the sign of a primary bone marrow abnormality in white blood cell production, maturation or death related to a leukemia or myeloproliferative disorder. Often, the family physician can identify the cause of an elevated white blood cell count based on the findings of the history and physical examination coupled with basic data from the complete blood count. As mentioned previously, an increase in neutrophils is the most common cause of an elevated white blood cell count, but other sub-populations of cells can also give rise to increased leukocyte numbers.

LYMPHOCYTOSIS Lymphocytes normally represent 20 to 40 percent of circulating white blood cells. Hence, the occurrence of lymphocytosis often translates into an increase in the overall white blood cell count. Increased numbers of lymphocytes occur with certain acute and chronic infections. Malignancies of the lymphoid system may also cause lymphocytosis. Leukocytosis with Primary Bone Marrow Disorders Clinical factors that increase suspicion of an underlying bone marrow disorder are listed in Table 5. Bone marrow disorders are generally grouped into leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders. Platelet counts are usually normal to increased. In fact, chronic myelogenous leukemia is the only leukemic process that is associated with thrombocytosis.

Another laboratory feature that distinguishes this disease from other leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders is the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, an abnormality of translocation between chromosome 22 and chromosome 9. Final Comment Excessive numbers of white blood cells are most often due to the response of normal bone marrow to infection or inflammation. In some instances, leukocytosis is a sign of more serious primary bone marrow disease. Attention to clinical factors associated with marrow disorders, such as extremely elevated white blood cell counts, abnormalities in red blood cell or platelet counts, weight loss, bleeding and organ enlargement, can help the family physician decide which patients require further investigation and consultation.

### Distribution of extreme vital signs and complete blood count values of healthy parturients: a retrospective database analysis and review of the literature [^114wuQUK]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of physiological adjustments throughout pregnancy on maternal vital signs and laboratory values has yet to be fully defined. The present study was designed to determine the normal range of these parameters among healthy pregnant women during the peripartum period.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of data collected during real-time deliveries in a single medical center. Vital signs and laboratory results from the 24 hours preceding delivery room admission and up to 72 hours postpartum were collected. Only pregnant women at term (37 to 41 weeks' gestation) with a liveborn, singleton gestation, and no chronic disease or obstetric complication that could affect the physiological parameters under study were included. The mean, range, and standard deviations of the extremes of all parameters at 3 distinct time points (prelabor, intrapartum, and postpartum) were calculated. The 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for each parameter were reported as the normal range.

Results

A total of 32,161 cases fulfilled inclusion criteria. The average gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks ± 8 days, and one-third of the cases were primiparous. During labor and after delivery, the upper limits of normal blood pressure values were 147/94 and 145/94 mm Hg, respectively. The lower limits were 83/43 and 83/42 mm Hg, respectively. Normal heart rates were 60–115 beats/min prelabor, 51–120 beats/min intrapartum, and 50–120 beats/min postpartum. Lowest normal temperatures ranged between 36.0°C and 36.3°C in the 3 study time points, and highest normal temperatures were 37.2°C prelabor and 37.6°C intra- and postpartum. The normal ranges of white blood cell counts were 6.1–16.8 prelabor, 6.5–22.5 intrapartum, and 6.4–23.9 K/µL postpartum. Normal low values of hemoglobin were 9.7, 8.7, and 7.1 g/dL and of platelets were 117, 113, and 105 K/µL, respectively.

Conclusions

Our findings justify the practice of using ≥ 2 repeated measurements for diagnosing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Lower normal blood pressure limits may be below those defining hypotensive shock. Normal heart rates exceed the accepted definitions of both tachy- and bradycardia. Normal temperatures at all times have a more narrow range than previously thought, and the normal range of white blood cell count has outliers exceeding the current definitions of leukocytosis or leukopenia at all times. The normal lower range of hemoglobin was constantly below 10 g/dL, and normal platelet counts were considerably lower than those previously described. The vital signs and complete blood count values thus far considered normal for the peripartum period may require some adjustment. New definitions for hypotension, tachy- and bradycardia, fever, and leukocyte quantitative disorders should be considered.

### Establishment of reference intervals of complete blood count for twin pregnancy [^1157jiqv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With the gradual relaxation of one-child policy in China in recent decades, there has been an increase in multiple pregnancies, which is primarily related to progress in the treatment of infertility and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Multiple pregnancies are associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including increased rates of preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, maternal anemia, and venous thrombosis. Twin pregnancy is top 10 risk factor for stillbirth, which remained high in 2015 in China and ranked in the top five worldwide.

Routine blood tests are essential in the diagnosis of diseases in the clinic, such as anemia and infection. However, without correct reference intervals, there is an increased risk of missing significant changes due to pathological conditions and erroneous interpretations of regular changes as a pathological event. Although the physiological and biochemical changes in pregnancy influence many laboratory tests and the changes in normal laboratory values induced by pregnancy are well known, few studies have been conducted to determine blood reference intervals for normal singleton pregnant women. Changes in routine peripheral blood parameters insingleton pregnancy have been reported. Red cell mass increases during pregnancy but the plasma volume increases more, resulting in relative anemia. These changes lead to dilution anemia, which is associated with lower hemoglobin (HGB) levels, hematocrit (HCT) values, and red blood cell (RBC) counts. A stable higher upper reference limit of white blood cell (WBC) count during pregnancy has also been reported. The WBC count is known to increase in pregnancy, thus limiting the use of this parameter as a marker for infection during pregnancy. Use of the results of healthy nonpregnant women as the reference interval may lead to the misdiagnosis of anemia or infection in a normal pregnancy, resulting in elevated medical costs and even unnecessary and potentially dangerous therapeutic actions.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: what is it? Why is it important? [^117UxPoQ]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

### Longitudinal modulation of immune system cytokine profile during pregnancy [^115BHpGV]. Cytokine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize immune modulation as expressed by cytokine assays at three time-points in human pregnancy.

Study Design

This is a prospective, longitudinal study of a broad panel of cytokine expression during singleton pregnancies resulting in an uncomplicated, full-term, live births. Peripheral blood was obtained at 8–14, 18–22, and 28–32 weeks gestation. Six cytokines - IFN-γ, IL-4, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 - were measured in supernatants obtained from whole blood stimulations with PHA or LPS and were compared to unstimulated controls. Samples were processed by Luminex-100 MAP®. We used Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to evaluate cytokine trajectories.

Results

Complete data were obtained for 45 uncomplicated pregnancies. Overall, peripheral blood WBC's demonstrated dampened cytokine responses. However, over the course of pregnancy, we found enhanced counter-regulatory cytokine expression (e.g., shown by increased IL-10).

Conclusion

The overall decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase in counter-regulatory cytokines as uncomplicated pregnancy progresses supports the evolving concepts of immunoregulation for the maintenance of a viable pregnancy.

### Levetiracetam in sodium chloride [^114w5rku]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.8 Hematologic Abnormalities

Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cells counts (RBC); decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

Partial-Onset Seizures

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, minor but statistically significant decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC (0.03 × 106/mm3), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients.

A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 × 109/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1 × 109/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Although there were no obvious hematologic abnormalities observed in patients with JME, the limited number of patients makes any conclusion tentative. The data from the partial seizure patients should be considered to be relevant for JME patients.

5.9 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

### Epigenetic programming of obesity in early life through modulation of the kynurenine pathway [^11474omS]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-lasting effects of maternal risk factors on offspring health

Pregnancy is a complex physiological process involving changes in the maternal immune state throughout gestation. The maternal immune state is a tightly orchestrated process designed to facilitate pregnancy, while protecting the mother and fetus from infection and from maternal immune responses against the allogeneic fetus. T helper (Th) cells play a crucial role in moderating immune responses in different phases of human pregnancy. Dysregulation in Th responses show association with multiple obstetrical complications. The first and third trimesters have been identified as Th1 proinflammatory states, whereas the second trimester is characterized as a Th2 anti-inflammatory state. During the peri-implantation period of the first trimester, the Th 1 immune response is required to facilitate tissue remodeling and wound healing following trophoblast invasion of the endometrium in addition to increased angiogenesis to support trophoblasts. In the second trimester, the immune system switches to a Th2, anti-inflammatory state. Here, paternal antigens in the trophoblasts activate Th2 cells at the maternal-fetal junction leading to the infiltration of Th2 cells into the decidua basalis of the placenta and the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which provide protection for the placenta and developing fetus against opportunistic infection. Following completion of fetal development in the third trimester, the placenta induces a Th1 immune state in preparation for birth, which aids in the contraction of the uterus, expulsion of the baby and rejection of the placenta itself. Therefore, pregnancy is considered a trigger for a systemic inflammatory response. This is supported by evidence demonstrating increased plasma concentrations of acute-phase inflammation biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), and a total white blood cell (WBC) count in the upper reference limit during pregnancy, elevated by up to 36% (5.7–15.0 × 10 9 /L). This is largely due to the increased leukocyte levels including neutrophils and monocytes which can increase by 55 and 38%, respectively during various stages of inflammation. Although inflammation is a component of innate immunity, which aims to promote tissue repair and restore homeostasis, excessive inflammation can compromise cellular and tissue function. For example, it has been suggested that excessive inflammation during pregnancy may result in maternal immune activation (MIA), leading programming of the fetal immune pathways and epigenetic changes resulting in increased expression of neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood. In addition, a bidirectional relationship between epigenetic modifications and an increased inflammatory response during pregnancy appears to exist. For instance, changes in DNA methylation patterns have been linked to the development of inflammation-related conditions such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Conversely, inflammatory stimuli can induce epigenetic modifications in immune cells, leading to changes in gene expression and potentially impacting pregnancy outcomes.

### Evaluation of liver enzymes in asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B virus infected pregnant women [^111Zev2E]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The physiologic leukocytosis of pregnancy represents a well known phenomenon, described early on by Rudolf Virchow, that has been very well documented and studied quantitatively. There are also reports that present leukocytosis with marked left shift in the myeloid-neutrophilic lineage during the third trimester of normal uncomplicated pregnancy that normalized readily after delivery. It has been reported that the elevated circulating levels of progesterone, especially during the late second and third trimester of pregnancy results in the increased numbers of circulating neutrophils while decreasing lymphocyte proportions, a phenomenon frequently observed in normal pregnancy. Moreover, it has been reported that pregnant women exhibit lower lymphocyte counts than non-pregnant women. Lymphocyte proliferation and activation is a well known phenomenon in patients with viral infections. Recent studies revealed that endogenous factors, such as regulatory T cells, immunosuppressive cytokines, and inhibitory receptors contribute to the impairment of virus-specific T cell responses in chronic HBV infection, perhaps reflecting the host's attempt to protect itself against immune-mediated pathology in a subset of patients. Viremic pregnant women of our study population, exhibited significantly lower absolute numbers of white blood cells and neutrophil counts and significantly higher ALT and GGT values, compared to non-viremic women. Moreover, we observed that the absolute neutrophil count of pregnant women was the only predictor of viremia among HBeAg negative chronic HBV-infected women (the lower the absolute neutrophils count the higher the possibility of detectable viremia). It seems that the presence of viremia affects the well known pregnancy-induced leukocytosis as well as the left shift in the myeloid-neutrophilic lineage. The absolute lymphocyte count in viremic chronic HBV-infected pregnant women was higher than the corresponding count in non-viremic ones (2.088 vs. 1.727 respectively, P = 0.808), although not significant, probably because of the major effect of pregnancy per se in the absolute neutrophil count. This finding needs further investigation in large-scale studies.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^116bmHDE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using R software in this study. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study samples. Continuous variables were presented as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), depending on their distribution. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages.

In the analysis of the trend of WBC count, median was used due to the non-normal distribution of the data (Figure S2), and Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni correction was used to compare WBC levels between different gestational stages.

To achieve a normal distribution and maintain the trend of WBC count across pregnancy, WBC count was log-transformed (Figure S3). A threshold regression model with a segmented-type change point was used to fit the log-transformed WBC count against gestational age. Due to the uneven sample size across different gestational ages, bootstrapping with 100 replications was employed for resampling. Each replication included 120 samples per gestational week. The median values of the model parameters were extracted from the bootstrap results to construct the regression equation, and the mean log-transformed WBC count for each gestational week was calculated. The residuals of the model across different gestational ages showed minimal deviation (Figure S4), allowing us to utilize the residual standard deviation (RSD) as the standard deviation of WBC count for each gestational week. The gestational age-specific RIs for log-transformed WBC count were calculated as the mean ± 1.96 standard deviations. Finally, the RIs for log-transformed WBC count were transformed back to RIs for WBC count.

### A comprehensive study of umbilical cord blood cell developmental changes and reference ranges by gestation, gender and mode of delivery [^111QVjaS]. Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the normal hematological values in cord blood during gestation, the impact of the type of delivery and differences in gender.

Study Design

The database included 10287 live births of 30–44 weeks gestation from cesarean or vaginal deliveries. Cord blood was collected into bags containing lyophilized heparin. Specimens were stored for 24h or less and analyzed using the SysmexXE-2100. Data from cesarean births were used to evaluate developmental hematopoietic changes.

Result

Increases during maturation occurred in hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, and decreases in mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. The number of nucleated red blood cells per 100 white blood cells decreased but absolute counts remained constant. Quantitative counts of white blood cells, neutrophils, monocytes (MON), eosinophils and lymphocytes (LYMP) increased, but percentages of lymphocytes and monocytes decreased. Platelets increased from 30–35 weeks.

Conclusion

Reference ranges were established for cord blood. Erythroid and myeloid cells show developmental changes. Mode of delivery has a significant effect on hematologic values. Only a rare parameter showed differences based on gender. The cord blood complete blood cell count has the potential for providing relevant clinical information for managing neonatal patients.

### Levetiracetam [^117LmVRY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 4 Years to < 16 Years

Statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the levetiracetam-treated group were -0.4 × 109/L and -0.3 × 109/L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. Mean relative lymphocyte counts increased by 1.7% in levetiracetam-treated patients, compared to a decrease of 4% in placebo patients (statistically significant).

In the controlled trial, more levetiracetam-treated patients had a possibly clinically significant abnormally low WBC value (3% of levetiracetam-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients), however, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count (5% of levetiracetam-treated patients versus 4.2% of placebo-treated patients). No patient was discontinued secondary to low WBC or neutrophil counts.

In the controlled cognitive and neuropsychological safety study, 5 patients (8.6%) in the levetiracetam-treated group and two patients (6.1%) in the placebo-treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (≥ 10% or ≥ 0.7 x 109/L).

5.10 Increase in Blood Pressure

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, a significantly higher risk of increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in the levetiracetam-treated patients (17%), compared to the placebo- treated patients (2%). There was no overall difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between the treatment groups. This disparity between the levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups was not observed in the studies of older children or in adults.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^115nrZRX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

White blood cell (WBC) count increases during pregnancy, necessitating reliable reference intervals for assessing infections and pregnancy-related complications. This study aimed to establish comprehensive reference intervals for WBC counts during pregnancy.

Methods

The analysis included 17,737 pregnant women, with weekly WBC count measurements from pre-pregnancy to postpartum. A threshold linear regression model determined reference intervals, while Harris and Boyd's test partitioned the intervals.

Results

WBC count exhibited a significant increase during pregnancy, characterized by a rapid rise before 7 weeks of gestation, followed by a plateau. Neutrophils primarily drove this increase, showing a similar pattern. The threshold regression model and Harris and Boyd's test supported partitioned reference intervals for WBC counts: 4.0–10.0 × 10^9/L for ≤ 2 weeks, 4.7–11.9 × 10^9/L for 3–5 weeks, and 5.7–14.4 × 10^9/L for ≥ 6 weeks of gestation. These reference intervals identified pregnant women with high WBC counts, who had a higher incidence of pregnancy-related complications including placenta previa, oligohydramnios, secondary uterine inertia, and intrauterine growth restriction.

Conclusion

This study establishes comprehensive reference intervals for WBC counts during pregnancy. Monitoring WBC counts is clinically relevant, as elevated levels are associated with an increased risk of infection and pregnancy-related complications.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^113QNAMt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Harris and Boyd's test, which is recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), was used to determine the partitioning of RI during pregnancy. Harris and Boyd's test is composed of two independent partitioning tests. The first one uses the standard normal deviate score z as a test parameter: z = [(‾x 2 -‾x 1)/(s 1 2 /n 1 + s 2 2 /n 2)] 1/2, where ‾x i, s i, and n i are the mean, standard deviation, and sample size, respectively, of subgroup i. Mean and standard deviation were from the threshold regression model. When z score ≥ 5[(n 1 + n 2)/240] 1/2, a reference interval partitioning was required. The second one is if the ratio between standard deviations ≥ 1.5, separate reference intervals are recommended for the subgroups, even if the means are equal. In this study, the second test was not applicable due to equal standard deviations.

In the analysis of the association between high WBC and pregnancy-related complications, we conducted an analysis of the diagnoses for all subjects and selected the most prevalent pregnancy-related complications for further investigation. Utilizing the RIs proposed in our study, we employed them to identify pregnant women with high WBC counts. Women with at least one test result above the gestational age-specific RI were categorized into the High group, while those with all test results within the RI were classified into the non-High group. The association between WBC count and pregnancy-related complications was assessed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test, depending on the expected frequencies.

All statistical tests were two-tailed, and a significance level of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Selected hematologic and biochemical measurements in African HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women and their infants: the HIV prevention trials network 024 protocol [^112TPsor]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Mean WBC counts were within the ranges of those previously described. The WBC count for normal male and female adults is 4,500–11,000/μL (range is estimate of 95% confidence limits). One study reported that although changes in leukocyte counts during pregnancy in African women were similar to those reported in Caucasian women, the total WBC counts were lower in the African women.

Although hematological parameters were comparable at birth between HIV-infected infants and HIV-uninfected infants, HIV-infected infants showed a greater decrease in hemoglobin concentrations than HIV-uninfected infants in the first 4–6 weeks of life. Similar findings have been found in a large cohort of HIV-infected and uninfected infants in Malawi. In this study, hemoglobin levels were lower among HIV-infected infants whose mothers had received NVP prophylaxis, and higher among HIV-uninfected infants who were not exposed to NVP prophylaxis. We were not able to assess whether the lower hemoglobin levels seen in HIV-infected infants in HPTN024 were due to HIV infection or NVP exposure, since nearly all HIV-infected women and their infants in this cohort received NVP prophylaxis.

5.2 Risk of Teratogenicity

MAVENCLAD may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Malformations and embryolethality occurred in animals [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus during MAVENCLAD dosing and for 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course.

In females of reproductive potential, pregnancy should be excluded before initiation of each treatment course of MAVENCLAD and prevented by the use of effective contraception during MAVENCLAD dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose of each treatment course. Women who become pregnant during treatment with MAVENCLAD should discontinue treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. MAVENCLAD is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception.

5.3 Lymphopenia

MAVENCLAD causes a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count. In clinical studies, 87% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients experienced lymphopenia. The lowest absolute lymphocyte counts occurred approximately 2 to 3 months after the start of each treatment course and were lower with each additional treatment course. In patients treated with a cumulative dose of MAVENCLAD 3.5 mg per kg over 2 courses as monotherapy, 26% and 1% had nadir absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 and less than 200 cells per microliter, respectively. At the end of the second treatment course, 2% of clinical study patients had lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter; median time to recovery to at least 800 cells per microliter was approximately 28 weeks.

Additive hematological adverse reactions may be expected if MAVENCLAD is administered prior to or concomitantly with other drugs that affect the hematological profile [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. The incidence of lymphopenia less than 500 cells per microliter was higher in patients who had used drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS prior to study entry (32.1%), compared to those with no prior use of these drugs (23.8%).

Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential including lymphocyte count prior to, during, and after treatment with MAVENCLAD. See Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) for timing of CBC measurements and additional instructions based on the patient's lymphocyte counts and clinical status (e.g., infections).

### Characterization of B cells in healthy pregnant women from late pregnancy to post-partum: a prospective observational study [^1133nZXm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, we found that the absolute counts of the majority of the B cell subsets were significantly lower in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy than in the non-pregnant women, suggesting pregnancy-associated B lymphopenia (though most pregnant women still presented values within normal ranges). The increased blood volemia observed during pregnancy could in part explain these observations. In fact, pregnant presented also decreased absolute lymphocyte counts, along with decreased absolute counts of T and NK cells, compared to non-pregnant (data not shown). Nonetheless, B cell percentages in pregnant also seem to decrease during pregnancy, which does not happens with either T cells or NK cells.

Compared to the percentages of peripheral blood naïve B cells in the non-pregnant women, we found higher values during the 3rd trimester and on delivery day, but no differences were observed in absolute counts. This relative increase in naïve B cells may be a consequence of decreased differentiation of B cells into memory cells and/or plasmablasts. In fact, Muzzio et al. reported the expansion of naïve B cells in pregnant mice. The high levels of progesterone present in late pregnancy may potentially explain this, as high progesterone levels inhibit B cell activation in mice. Our results may also be explained by the mobilization of more differentiated B subsets from peripheral blood to other body tissues.

### Levetiracetam (spritam) [^111jsk7H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 4 Years to Less Than 16 Years of Age

Statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in levetiracetam‑treated patients as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the levetiracetam‑treated group were -0.4 × 109/L and -0.3 × 109/L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. Mean relative lymphocyte counts increased by 1.7% in levetiracetam‑treated patients, compared to a decrease of 4% in placebo‑treated patients (statistically significant).

In a controlled trial, more levetiracetam-treated patients had a possibly clinically significant abnormally low WBC value (3% of levetiracetam‑treated patients versus 0% of placebo‑treated patients); however, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count (5% of levetiracetam‑treated patients versus 4.2% of placebo‑treated patients). No patient was discontinued secondary to low WBC or neutrophil counts.

In a controlled cognitive and neuropsychological safety study, 5 patients (8.6%) in the levetiracetam‑treated group and two patients (6.1%) in the placebo‑treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (≥ 10% or ≥ 0.7×109/L).

5.10 Increase in Blood Pressure

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, a significantly higher risk of increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in levetiracetam-treated patients (17%), compared to the placebo-treated patients (2%). There was no overall difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between the treatment groups. This disparity between the levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups was not observed in the studies of older pediatric patients or in adults.

Monitor patients 1 month to < 4 years of age for increases in diastolic blood pressure.

5.11 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

### Are published standards for haematological indices in pregnancy applicable across populations: an evaluation in healthy pregnant Jamaican women [^117Cevyi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

Results

General characteristics of the cohort

Table 1 shows the demographic profile of the participants. The average age was 20.31 ± 2.33 yrs, while average height was 162.70 ± 7.43 cm. The average weight of the participants increased progressively over the three trimesters of pregnancy.

Table 1
Demographic characteristics of participants

Haemoglobin pattern over the three trimesters

The results indicate that the haemoglobin concentration is highest in the first trimester, reaches its lowest point in the second trimester and begins to rise again in the third trimester (Table 2). The mean haemoglobin concentration was 12.73 ± 1.14 g/dl in the first trimester, 11.41 ± 1.16 g/dl in the second trimester and 11.67 ± 1.18 g/dl in the third trimester. These results are similar to those published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) using data from four European surveys of healthy women taking iron supplements and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Other haematological indices across trimesters

A similar trend in changes in concentration to that for the haemoglobin mentioned above, is also seen in the packed cell volume and the red blood cell count (Table 2). In contrast, the mean corpuscular volume and the mean cell haemoglobin had the lowest value in the first trimester, rose to its highest value in the second trimester and then started to decline in the third trimester. The mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration however, remained fairly constant throughout pregnancy. The white blood cell count changed in a similar way as the mean corpuscular volume and the mean cell haemoglobin. The platelet count decreased from a mean value of 280.55 ± 64.40 × 10 3 /μl in the first trimester to 234.15 ± 67.67 × 10 3 /μl in the third trimester (Table 2).

Data collection

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from electronic hospital records in this study. Demographic data encompassed information such as ethnicity, age, height, and weight. Height and weight measurements were taken during registration, primarily between 6 and 12 gestational weeks, and were used to calculate body mass index (BMI). Clinical data included variables such as blood pressure, gestational age at delivery, baby sex, gravidity, parity, delivery style, and labor-related diagnoses. Laboratory data consisted of blood routine tests performed as part of routine clinical care. Venous blood samples were collected using 4.5 mL potassium EDTA tubes and analyzed using the Sysmex XS-500i hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation Kobe, Japan). The same analytical method was consistently employed throughout the study period. Gestational age was recorded in weeks, including the corresponding weeks and days (e.g. 37 weeks represents a period from 37 to 37 + 6 weeks), and categorized into three stages: first trimester (0 to 13 weeks of gestation), second trimester (14 to 27 weeks), and third trimester (28 to 42 weeks). Additionally, samples during the prepregnancy stage (0 to 11 weeks prior to pregnancy) and the postpartum stage (0 to 11 weeks following delivery) were collected for the comparison with WBC trends during pregnancy.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^114Xmgkt]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Others have studied the impact of steroids on WBC in small groups of hospitalized patients or outpatients. Frenkel et al. studied acute and chronic steroid use in 277 patients hospitalized with COPD and 546 patients with acute infection. They found that the maximal increase in WBC in the first 24 h after acute steroid use in patients with acute infection was 2.2 × 10 9 cells/L. This effect diminished between Day 2 and discharge. For patients with COPD, they estimated a mean increase of 2.9 × 10 9 cells/L for maximal WBC count within 24 h of admission for acute steroid use. Alsehiri et al. studied WBC response to a single dose of steroid in 99 hospitalized patients and found that WBC increased in first 36 h post‐dose with a median increase of 2.7 × 10 9 cells/L (IQR 1.68, 4.89), and in a linear regression found an independent increase of 1.13 × 10 9 cells/L in high‐dose steroids versus low‐dose steroids. Others have studied the impact of short‐dose prednisone among small samples of non‐hospitalized patients. Shoenfeld et al. found a significant increase in WBC among patients with inflammatory conditions on Day 1 but a variable effect thereafter. Fleishaker et al. found an increase in ANC among healthy individuals. As in our study, counts increased from Day 1 to 2 and then plateaued. The response was dose dependent. Our findings are similarly consistent to those published in the obstetric population with prenatal steroids for pre‐term labor where trials estimated WBC increases of 1.1–1.8 × 10 9 cells/L after 24 h of steroid treatment. Similarly, our findings in ANC and ALC trends are corroborated by studies identifying a rise in ANC and transient decrease in lymphocyte count.

Laboratory Measures in Pregnant Women

Tables 2 and 3 compare the hematological values for HIV-infected versus HIV-uninfected pregnant women at 20–24 weeks (Table 2) and at 36 weeks (Table 3). At both 20–24 weeks and 36 weeks, HIV-infected pregnant women had lower red blood cell (RBC) counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and WBC counts than HIV-uninfected women. Platelet counts and the monocyte differential counts were higher in HIV-infected women than in HIV-uninfected women at both time points. The CD4+ T lymphocyte cell counts (CD4+ cell count) were lower in HIV-infected women compared to HIV-uninfected women. From the paired samples' t-test (comparing the changes in CD4+ cell count at 20–24 weeks vs. 36 weeks), the CD4+ cell counts increased during pregnancy among the HIV-infected women (p = 0.0002), while there was no significant change in this measure among the HIV-uninfected women. The mean of the paired differences of CD4+ cell counts among HIV-infected women was +14.8 cells/μL from the 20–24-week visit compared to the 36-week antenatal visit.

The elevation of white blood cell (WBC) count during pregnancy is primarily attributed to an increase in neutrophils, which exhibit a similar trend throughout gestation. Monocytes also experience an increase during pregnancy, albeit to a lesser extent, as their absolute count is relatively low. Interestingly, lymphocytes display an opposite pattern compared to neutrophils. They decline during the first trimester and remain relatively stable during the second and third trimesters. Following childbirth, lymphocytes experience a sharp decline within the initial week, reaching their lowest level, and subsequently begin to increase, gradually returning to prepregnancy levels during the 3–4 weeks postnatally. Eosinophils and basophils, on the other hand, do not exhibit significant variations during pregnancy (Fig. 3).

Estimation of reference interval of white blood cell

To determine the RI for WBC count, we included samples obtained from 0 to 40 weeks of gestation, comprising a total of 16,230 pregnant women in this analysis. Notably, a turning point was observed at 7 weeks of gestation. A regression model as well identified a threshold at 7 weeks, prior to which WBC count exhibited a rapid increase from 5.8 to 9.1 × 10^9/L, and subsequently, a slower increase from 9.1 to 9.5 × 10^9/L. The upper limit progressively increased from 9.3, 14.4, to 15 × 10^9/L at 0, 7, and 40 weeks, respectively. Likewise, the lower limit increased from 3.7, 5.7, to 6 × 10^9/L at 0, 7, and 40 weeks, respectively (Fig. 4). The upper and lower limits of all gestational weeks were presented in Table S2.

### Are elevated fetal nucleated red blood cell counts an indirect reflection of enhanced erythropoietin activity? [^116kLuLW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Animal and human studies demonstrated elevated erythropoietin (EPO) levels in response to intrauterine hypoxic events. Other studies documented an association between fetal hypoxia and elevated nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) counts and have speculated that it is the elevation of EPO that results in an increase in NRBC counts. Thus, the purpose of our study was to determine the correlation between EPO levels and NRBC counts in the human fetus.

Study Design

Data were collected prospectively between April and July of 2003. Term singleton pregnancies were eligible to participate in the study. Umbilical cord blood was collected immediately after birth for determination of fetal EPO levels and NRBC counts.

Results

Forty pregnancies formed the study population. The mean gestational age at delivery was 39.5 ± 1.2 weeks (± SD) and the mean birth weight was 3500 ± 372 g. The median EPO (mU/mL) was 34 (range 13–427). The median NRBC/100 white blood cells was 10 (range 0–150). A simple regression analysis indicated that NRBC counts are significantly and positively correlated with EPO (P = .0004, R(2) = 0.287).

Conclusion

Our results suggest a significant association between EPO and NRBC counts in term singleton fetuses. These results support the hypothesis that fetal NRBC and EPO are interrelated. However, the relatively low R(2) indicates that there are other (yet to be determined) hypoxia-derived mediators that result in an elevation of fetal NRBC counts.

### Practice bulletin no. 166: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^111pgvSY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia in pregnant women is diagnosed frequently by obstetricians because platelet counts are included with automated complete blood cell counts (CBCs) obtained during routine prenatal screening (). Although most U.S. health care providers are trained using U.S. Conventional Units, most scientists, journals, and countries use Système International (SI) units. The laboratory results reported in U.S. Conventional Units can be converted to SI Units or vice versa by using a conversion factor. The conversion factor for platelet count results is 1.0 (ie, to convert from x 103/µL, multiply by 1.0, to get x 109/L). Thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count of less than 150 x 109/L, is common and occurs in 7–12% of pregnancies (). Thrombocytopenia can result from a variety of physiologic or pathologic conditions, several of which are unique to pregnancy. Some causes of thrombocytopenia are serious medical disorders that have the potential for maternal and fetal morbidity. In contrast, other conditions, such as gestational thrombocytopenia, are benign and pose no maternal or fetal risks. Because of the increased recognition of maternal and fetal thrombocytopenia, there are numerous controversies about obstetric management of this condition. Clinicians must weigh the risks of maternal and fetal bleeding complications against the costs and morbidity of diagnostic tests and invasive interventions.

### Establishment of reference intervals of complete blood count for twin pregnancy [^115Nwa8w]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Laboratory tests are often requested during pregnancy to exclude pathological complications that may affect maternal or fetal health. Diagnostic accuracy is based on the evaluation of results in relation to accurate reference values. Although changes in normal laboratory values induced by pregnancy are well known, few studies have been conducted to establish reference intervals for pregnant women, especially those with twin pregnancies. In this study, we report x ± 1.96 s as reference intervals for CBC parameters in twin pregnancy. We found that the RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT levels and the LY% in mid- and late-term pregnant women with twin pregnancies were lower than those in healthy nulligravida women, while the WBC, NEU counts and NEU% in mid- and late-term twin pregnancy were higher. We used these results to create reference intervals and tested our reference intervals using blood samples from 20 women with twin pregnancies. After confirming the correctness of the reference intervals, we found that the levels of RBCs, HGB, HCT, and PLTs decreased in women with twin pregnancies, and WBCs and NEUs increased, which suggests that these factors may be prognostic indicators of this adverse outcome. The establishment of suitable reference intervals for women with twin pregnancies has the potential to improve diagnostic quality, which could lead to increased survival, reducing unnecessary treatment and cost savings.

Evaluation and treatment of hematologic disorders in pregnancy requires an understanding of normal physiologic changes during pregnancy. Hematologic disorders may be caused by preexisting conditions, normal physiologic changes, or can be acquired. A multidisciplinary approach is often necessary for monitoring and treatment of both the mother and the fetus. In general, outcomes are good for both the mother and the fetus.

### Leukocyte telomere dynamics across gestation in uncomplicated pregnancies and associations with stress [^117EDKK8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our results provide valuable baseline information suggesting that LTL does not change significantly over the course of healthy pregnancies; this information can inform directions for future research on this topic. Prospective research with a larger, more diverse cohort is warranted. Correlating LTLs with known inflammatory markers and white blood cell counts during pregnancy may further illuminate on our results, but this was beyond the scope of the current study and is an ongoing area of future research.

Given the biochemical, physical, and psychologic stressors of pregnancy, we hypothesized that significant LTL shortening would have been identified for all participants in this cohort. Although there were trends toward overall LTL shortening, we did not identify significant changes in LTLs over the course of gestation. Whether this is due to the low prevalence of stress in this cohort, the variability in LTL measurements, or is a true biologic phenomenon remains to be elucidated. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for mode of delivery when studying postpartum LTL, as participants who underwent cesarean had shorter postpartum LTLs compared with those who had a vaginal birth. Finally, we identified an association between poor sleep quality and shorter LTLs which may direct future work in this area.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^117GWCSJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Although several studies have explored the RI of WBC count during pregnancy, there are notable limitations that cannot be overlooked. Firstly, many of these studies were based on small populations, which may not provide robust and reliable results. Secondly, some studies only sampled specific gestational weeks or trimesters, failing to capture the entire gestational process. Thirdly, most studies did not consider the necessity of RI partitioning, instead focusing solely on providing the 95% confidence interval. Akkaya et al. conducted a study involving 40,325 pregnant women with 82,786 complete blood count evaluations from 6 to the 41 weeks of gestation. They reported the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 50th, 95th and 99th percentile values for total and differential leukocyte counts according to trimester. While this study encompassed a large-scale population and a wide range of gestational ages, the clinical applicability of the results may be limited due to the specific percentile values chosen that were not the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile. Another large-scale study conducted by Dockree et al. included 24,318 pregnant women with 80,637 samples from 8 to 40 weeks of gestation, and RI was determined as 5.7–15.0 × 10^9/L. The authors confirmed the need for a pregnancy-specific RI, but refutes the need for partitioned, gestational-age specific limits. The results were similar to ours, in which RI was suggested as 5.7–14.4 × 10^9/L when gestational age ≥ 6 weeks.

### Platelet counts in women with normal pregnancies: a systematic review [^111iWP9h]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

The occurrence of thrombocytopenia in 5% of pregnant women at delivery, described as gestational thrombocytopenia, is well documented. A commonly believed concept is that gestational thrombocytopenia is the result of gradually decreasing platelet counts in all women during pregnancy. The goal of our study was to evaluate the data supporting this concept. To learn what is known about platelet counts throughout normal pregnancies, we systematically reviewed all publications describing platelet counts during pregnancy. We identified 3,039 studies; 46 reporting ≥ 30 women with normal pregnancies were included in our analyses. The combined mean platelet counts from all studies supported the concept that platelet counts decrease during pregnancy and increase postpartum: first trimester, 251,000/µL (95% CI, 238,000–264,000/µL); second trimester, 238,000/µL (95% CI, 222,000–253,000/µL); third trimester, 224,000/µL (95% CI, 213,000–235,000/µL); delivery, 237,000/µL (95% CI, 209,000–264,000/µL); 4–8 weeks postpartum, 247,000/µL (95% CI, 207,000–287,000/µL). However, individual studies were inconsistent. Eleven longitudinal studies compared platelet counts on the same women at different times during gestation: seven reported a decrease; four reported no change. Ten cross-sectional studies compared platelet counts of different women at different times during gestation: five reported a decrease; five reported no change. Five studies compared platelet counts of pregnant to nonpregnant women: three reported that platelet counts were lower in pregnant women; one reported no difference; one reported that platelet counts were higher in pregnant women. These inconsistent data emphasize the need to accurately describe platelet counts throughout normal pregnancies. Accurate data are essential for evaluating the clinical importance of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy.

### How I treat thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^116AKhV4]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic abnormality in pregnancy, encountered in ∼10% of pregnancies. There are many possible causes, ranging from benign conditions that do not require intervention to life-threatening disorders necessitating urgent recognition and treatment. Although thrombocytopenia may be an inherited condition or predate pregnancy, most commonly it is a new diagnosis. Identifying the responsible mechanism and predicting its course is made challenging by the tremendous overlap of clinical features and laboratory data between normal pregnancy and the many potential causes of thrombocytopenia. Multidisciplinary collaboration between hematology, obstetrics, and anesthesia and shared decision-making with the involved patient is encouraged to enhance diagnostic clarity and develop an optimized treatment regimen, with careful consideration of management of labor and delivery and the potential fetal impact of maternal thrombocytopenia and any proposed therapeutic intervention. In this review, we outline a diagnostic approach to pregnant patients with thrombocytopenia, highlighting the subtle differences in presentation, physical examination, clinical course, and laboratory abnormalities that can be applied to focus the differential. Four clinical scenarios are presented to highlight the pathophysiology and treatment of the most common causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy: gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, and immune thrombocytopenia.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^11136d3c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

In previous studies, the estimation of WBC count before 6 weeks of gestation was often neglected due to the low likelihood of detecting pregnancy during this early period. In our study, which involved a large population, the sample size for gestational age < 5 weeks did not reach the minimum requirement of at least 120 participants needed for accurate estimation of reference limits. Therefore, we employed bootstrapping to even the sample size as 120 at each gestational week and a threshold regression model to fit the means, using the residual standard deviation as the standard deviation for calculating the RIs. The approaches help reduce variation resulting from the small sample size. The threshold regression model proved to be as robust as linear regression (Figure S5), while also accommodating data with changing points. The impact of the low sample size is evident in Table 2, where the RIs for gestational age ≥ 6 weeks estimated by three different methods were similar. However, for the 2–5 weeks gestation period, the upper limits varied among the methods. Dockree et al. who only included women with gestational age over 8 weeks, concluded that RI partitioning was unnecessary. However, when we included gestational age before 8 weeks, an intriguing finding emerged. A significant turning point was identified in the 7th week, with WBC count increasing from a median of 5.8 to 9.1 × 10^9/L before that point (Fig. 4). According to the Harris and Boyd's test, RI partitioning was warranted in the 4th week, resulting in the range of 4.7–11.9 × 10^9/L. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that within the first 7 weeks of gestation, the progression of one or two weeks refuted the need for RI partitioning.

Furthermore, our findings showed that WBC count and NLR were significantly higher in women with GDM when compared to the control group, whereas no significant difference existed in NEUT and LYM counts between the two groups. The significant increase in WBC count and NLR among GDM patients reflects the probably associated inflammatory state of GDM. Consistent with our finding, in a meta‐analysis, Pace and Vassallo demonstrated that NLR was higher in women with GDM than in controls. The role of NLR as a marker of systemic inflammation in chronic diseases is well documented, and the detection of its raised levels in GDM points out the importance of monitoring markers of inflammation as a part of the standard management in these patients. This may suggest a selective activation of inflammatory pathways in GDM, further helping refine risk assessments and also guiding inflammation‐targeted interventions. The absence of a difference in NEUT, LYM and MONO counts could be an indication that a generalised inflammatory response does not take place but rather one limited to only some types of WBCs. Further studies may elaborate on the specific mechanisms of inflammation underlying these haematological changes, which can provide newer insights into improving targeted therapies in inflammation‐related complications of GDM.

4.1 Strength and Limitation

This study findings have to be interpreted in the light of limitations and strengths. Evaluating the association of multiple blood cell parameters with GDM provides holistic understanding of the relationship of blood cells parameters and GDM. However, there are also some limitations in this study are as follows: heterogeneity among included studies regarding diagnostic criteria for GDM, study design and populations studied, which makes it difficult to draw consistent conclusions and raises concerns about the generalisability of results. The varying diagnostic criteria for GDM create limitations such as inconsistent prevalence estimates, variation in screening approaches, differing blood glucose thresholds and difficulty in comparing research studies. Future research should aim to improve reporting of related covariates in primary studies to enable more comprehensive meta‐regression analyses. Additionally, some studies had small sample sizes which reduced their statistical power. Therefore, it is suggested to conduct longitudinal studies with a large sample size to investigate these haematological and inflammatory changes as well as their predictive role in the development of GDM. This point should also be mentioned, a large number of studies did not report the standard cut‐off of haematological and inflammatory markers and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) results. Future studies also should target the utility value of these markers as predictors of adverse pregnancy outcome and their role as therapeutic guides to improve maternal and fetal outcomes in GDM pregnancies.

### Establishment of reference intervals of complete blood count for twin pregnancy [^114ioW3w]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast, HCT and RBC counts decreased with increasing gestational age in our data, but the absolute WBC count reference interval was elevated during pregnancy, which was due to the significant increase in NEU count during a normal twin pregnancy. This result may be related to a stress response, the redistribution of WBCs between the marginal and circulating pools or pain, nausea, vomiting, and anxiety in the absence of infection. WBC and NEU counts are expected to increase during pregnancy. Therefore, the reference intervals for these parameters should especially be considered with caution in the clinic. The use of these parameters should be limited to markers for infection during pregnancy in case proper reference intervals are lacking. We found that the increase in WBC count resulted primarily from an increase in NEU counts, which peaked in the mid-term and decreased in the late-term and was slightly different from the results of other studies. The absolute WBC and NEU counts decreased from 11.36 ± 4.92/8.54 ± 4.17 to 9.76 ± 5.00/7.17 ± 4.17 when entering the late-term of gestation, and the NEU% was stable. We found that the absolute count of LY was stable during twin pregnancy, and LY% was lower than that of healthy nulligravida women. Significantly lower values were detected in the mid-term (P < 0.05), which is consistent with the literature that absolute NEU counts peaked at the mid-term.

Investigation of potential risk markers of adverse outcomes has been performed at the molecular, biochemical, and metabolic levels. Multiple pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes, primarily due to obstetric complications, preterm birth, and birth weight discordance. Cervical length, fetal fibronectin, and uterine activity monitoring, which used to be potential risk factors for interest, are not recommended because no new evidence has been identified to confirm their accuracy. Using ultrasound screening, crown-rump length and placental location were measured to assess their association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The current study identified risk factors using more routine laboratory tests and determined that absolute NEU in CBC values may be a predictor of PTB. According to the established reference intervals for a twin pregnancy, NEU increased to above the upper limit (> 11.31 × 10 9 /L) in 12.79% of the PTB population. The association between NEU count and PTB needs further confirmation using evidence from a larger sample.

Abnormal inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers

The laboratory measurements of blood routine at admission are listed in Tables 4 and 5. Compared with the COVID-19 negative pregnant women, the count of white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils (NE) significantly higher in the COVID-19 positive pregnant women, while lymphocyte (LY) were lower in the COVID-19 positive pregnant women, which represented an infection status. In addition, COVID-19 positive women presented with higher rates of anemia and thrombocytopenia (Table 5). No significant intergroup differences were observed regarding aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.

* Age, COVID-19 vaccination status, preterm labor, prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, postpartum hemorrhage, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, low birth weight (< 2500 g) and apgar score < 8 at 1-minute were adjusted.

Additionally, we segregated the COVID-19 positive group into a normal- outcomes group and an adverse-outcomes group. Only the count of WBC increased in the adverse-outcomes group compared to the normal-outcomes group (Table 6).
