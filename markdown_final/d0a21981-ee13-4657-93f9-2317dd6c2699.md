## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Gaucher disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and pathophysiology. Then, I should classify the clinical types and their implications. Next, I will review epidemiology and genetics. After that, I need to detail clinical manifestations and the diagnostic workup, including biomarkers and imaging. Then, I should evaluate treatment options, dosing, and monitoring. I will also consider special populations and unmet needs, and finally synthesize a practical management algorithm with key takeaways and references.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental definition and pathophysiology. Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in GBA1, leading to deficient acid β-glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase) activity and accumulation of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, primarily in macrophages, which drives multisystem disease; this mechanistic framework is well established and supported by contemporary standards and reviews [^113zCUYt] [^1161PTeN] [^116nR18E].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about classification; I should verify the traditional phenotypes and their clinical relevance. Type 1 is non-neuronopathic and accounts for roughly 90–95% of cases, whereas types 2 and 3 are neuronopathic with acute and chronic courses, respectively; importantly, there is a recognized phenotypic continuum and limited genotype–phenotype correlation, which complicates early assignment and necessitates a dynamic, evolving phenotype approach rather than rigid categories [^113zCUYt] [^116ENo1V] [^111RrBjg].

> I need to check epidemiology and genetic background next. Global prevalence of type 1 is about 1 in 26,000 to 1 in 63,000, with markedly higher incidence in Ashkenazi Jews (approximately 1 in 450), while types 2 and 3 are rarer overall but relatively more prevalent in certain regions; over 350 GBA1 variants have been described, and the presence of at least one N370S allele essentially excludes neuronopathic disease, though genotype alone poorly predicts severity within type 1 [^113zCUYt] [^112xS3R8] [^117HiN6C].

> Let me consider the clinical manifestations systematically. Hematologic features include thrombocytopenia, anemia, and leukopenia, with platelets typically falling first in spleen-intact patients; visceral involvement manifests as hepatosplenomegaly; skeletal disease spans bone pain, osteopenia/osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, and Erlenmeyer flask deformity; pulmonary disease can occur via infiltration and/or pulmonary hypertension; and neurologic disease in types 2 and 3 includes gaze palsy, seizures, and progressive neurodegeneration, with type 2 often fatal in early childhood [^117LmGWA] [^1161PTeN] [^114WQGnn] [^1161DG9N].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach and avoid premature closure. Definitive diagnosis rests on demonstrating low leukocyte glucocerebrosidase activity plus biallelic pathogenic GBA1 variants; lyso-Gb1 is the most reliable biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring, while chitotriosidase and CCL18 are useful but nonspecific and may be confounded by CHIT1 null variants; bone marrow may show Gaucher cells, though atypical histology can mislead, and imaging with MRI/CT/DEXA quantifies organ volumes and bone involvement; newborn screening is expanding but remains variably implemented and ethically debated [^111t3hTM] [^111RrBjg] [^116oBxgP] [^114T131z] [^111ZA1h3].

> I should double-check treatment options and their indications. Enzyme replacement therapy (imiglucerase, velaglucerase, taliglucerase) is first-line for symptomatic type 1 and type 3, with typical dosing of 30–60 U/kg every 2–4 weeks; randomized and observational data show robust improvements in hemoglobin, platelets, and organ volumes, with dose–response relationships observed in registry analyses; substrate reduction therapy (eliglustat, miglustat) is an oral alternative for appropriate adults, with eliglustat noninferior to ERT in switch trials and effective in treatment-naïve patients, though CYP2D6 phenotype testing is required; high-dose ERT does not meaningfully alter neurologic outcomes in neuronopathic disease, and HSCT remains investigational without comparative trials [^1156uewm] [^111JT5LQ] [^111koFvC] [^1135uMdG] [^112gZ6XM] [^114UqZTU] [^113YVS7D] [^113qwMXj].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing pragmatics and monitoring cadence. Many patients can be maintained on lower ERT doses once therapeutic goals are met, and extending infusion intervals to every 4 weeks can be safe in stable adults with careful monitoring; biomarker and imaging surveillance every 6–12 months is reasonable, with earlier follow-up after dose changes or in children; bone disease often lags in response and may require higher or longer treatment, and persistent bone events despite therapy remain an unmet need [^1172ivSZ] [^112mGzwE] [^115vQDRQ] [^114WQGnn].

> Let me think about special populations and counseling. Pediatric patients may require growth monitoring and dose adjustments over time, and very low maintenance doses can suffice in some; pregnancy planning should incorporate preconception optimization and continuation of ERT when indicated; patients with GBA1 variants have an increased risk of Parkinson disease and should be counseled accordingly; and never-treated cohorts remind us that some mild type 1 patients remain stable for years, though identifying such patients prospectively remains challenging [^112q5Aum] [^112mGzwE] [^115bgfXU] [^116k2BKq].

> I should confirm the unmet needs and future directions. Diagnostic delay persists due to nonspecific symptoms and low awareness; neuronopathic disease lacks disease-modifying CNS therapies; bone complications continue despite systemic therapy; and cost and access constraints complicate long-term management; emerging strategies include gene therapy, chaperones, and improved biomarker standardization, underscoring the need for international collaboration and innovative trial designs [^111DotJE] [^1155KPh9] [^114WQGnn] [^111JT5LQ].

> Next, I should review a practical management algorithm and make sure it aligns with evidence. Suspect GD in patients with unexplained thrombocytopenia, anemia, organomegaly, or bone pain; confirm with enzyme activity and GBA1 sequencing and quantify disease with CBC, liver/spleen MRI, bone imaging/DEXA, and lyso-Gb1; initiate ERT for symptomatic type 1/type 3 or significant disease burden, consider eliglustat in appropriate adults or when ERT is unsuitable, and titrate to therapeutic goals with periodic biomarker and imaging reassessment; maintain vigilance for bone events, malignancy (notably multiple myeloma), and neurologic evolution, and coordinate multidisciplinary care including hematology, hepatology, orthopedics, neurology, and genetics [^116dnPdE] [^111t3hTM] [^114T131z] [^113qAFhw].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the marrow is not classic? I should double-check for confounders like iron deficiency masking iron staining in Gaucher cells and remember that genotype can exclude neuronopathy but not define severity; in such cases, integrating clinical, genetic, biomarker, and imaging data — and, when needed, seeking expert review — reduces misclassification and ensures timely, appropriate therapy [^116oBxgP] [^117HiN6C] [^116ENo1V].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key messages are explicit: confirm the biochemical diagnosis and use lyso-Gb1 to guide monitoring; individualize therapy intensity to disease burden and patient factors; treat early to prevent irreversible complications, especially in bone; and maintain longitudinal surveillance for hematologic, visceral, skeletal, and neurologic outcomes while addressing access and evolving therapies [^111t3hTM] [^116dnPdE] [^114WQGnn] [^111DotJE].

Gaucher disease is a **lysosomal storage disorder** caused by GBA1 mutations that lead to glucocerebroside accumulation in macrophages, causing hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, bone disease, and, in neuronopathic forms, neurological impairment [^113zCUYt] [^1168RZvp]. Diagnosis relies on **enzyme assay and genetic testing**, with lyso-Gb1 as a key biomarker [^111t3hTM]. Enzyme replacement therapy is the **standard of care** for type 1, while substrate reduction is an oral alternative; neuronopathic disease remains a major unmet need due to limited CNS penetration of therapies [^116dnPdE] [^116ENo1V]. Early diagnosis and individualized monitoring are essential to prevent irreversible complications [^112UKiNC] [^114T131z].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Enzyme deficiency**: Deficient acid β-glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase) causes glucosylceramide accumulation in macrophages (Gaucher cells), driving organomegaly, cytopenias, and bone disease [^114Atxcq].

- **Neuronopathic forms**: Glucosylsphingosine accumulation contributes to neurodegeneration in types 2 and 3 [^notfound].

- **Inflammation**: Cytokine release and macrophage activation amplify disease activity [^114FT5CG] [^111Y6WTG].

## Clinical manifestations

| **System** | **Manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Hematologic | - Anemia <br/> - Thrombocytopenia <br/> - Leukopenia <br/> - Easy bruising <br/> - Bleeding [^113VfwPd] |
| Hepatosplenic | - Hepatosplenomegaly <br/> - Portal hypertension [^1161PTeN] |

| Pulmonary | - Interstitial lung disease <br/> - Pulmonary hypertension [^112926rK] |
| Metabolic | - Growth retardation <br/> - Delayed puberty [^113zCUYt] |

---

## Classification

Type 1 is **non-neuronopathic and the most common**, with variable age of onset and no CNS involvement [^1161PTeN]. Type 2 is **acute neuronopathic**, with early-onset, severe neurodegeneration and high infant mortality [^117HiN6C]. Type 3 is **chronic neuronopathic**, with later-onset, slower neurological progression and variable severity [^116ENo1V].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Enzyme assay**: Reduced leukocyte glucocerebrosidase activity confirms the diagnosis [^115KEhBH].

- **Genetic testing**: Identifies GBA1 mutations; N370S is common in type 1, while L444P associates with neuronopathic forms [^113c285Q] [^117HiN6C].

- **Biomarkers**: Lyso-Gb1 is highly specific and correlates with disease burden; chitotriosidase and CCL18 are adjunctive [^111t3hTM] [^112asWLw].

- **Imaging**: MRI/CT quantify organ volumes; DXA assesses bone density; MRI detects bone marrow infiltration and infarcts [^111r5jgv] [^1145pQpq].

---

## Treatment

- **Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)**: Imiglucerase, velaglucerase, taliglucerase reverse hematologic and visceral disease; typical dosing is 30–60 U/kg every 2–4 weeks [^111JT5LQ].

- **Substrate reduction therapy (SRT)**: Eliglustat (oral, CYP2D6-dependent) is non-inferior to ERT in type 1; miglustat is used when ERT is unsuitable [^1135uMdG] [^116wPURa] [^115THwZQ].

- **Neuronopathic disease**: ERT/SRT do not cross the BBB; chaperones and gene therapy are under investigation [^116ENo1V] [^1155KPh9].

- **Supportive care**: Analgesia, bisphosphonates, transfusions, and orthopedic interventions for complications [^114FT5CG].

---

## Prognosis

Type 1 has a **favorable prognosis with therapy**, though complications persist and there is an increased risk of multiple myeloma and Parkinsonism [^113qAFhw] [^115bgfXU]. Type 2 is **rapidly fatal**, often within 2 years, despite supportive care [^117HiN6C]. Type 3 shows variable outcomes; neurological progression is slowed but not halted by current therapies [^notfound].

---

## Current research and future directions

- **Gene therapy**: AAV-mediated GBA1 delivery is in early trials for neuronopathic disease [^notfound].

- **Pharmacological chaperones**: Small molecules to stabilize mutant enzyme are under study [^117PiD5Y].

- **Improved biomarkers**: Efforts to standardize lyso-Gb1 and identify predictive markers for bone/neurologic disease [^111t3hTM].

- **Personalized medicine**: Tailoring therapy to genotype, phenotype, and biomarker profile [^115KrCE5].

---

Gaucher disease is a **multisystem lysosomal disorder** with significant heterogeneity; early diagnosis and individualized therapy are critical to improving outcomes, while neuronopathic forms remain a key therapeutic challenge [^113VfwPd].

### The diagnosis and management of gaucher disease in pediatric patients: where do we go from here? [^111RrBjg]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disease that often presents in early childhood and is associated with damage to multiple organ systems. Many challenges associated with GD diagnosis and management arise from the considerable heterogeneity of disease presentations and natural history. Phenotypic classification has traditionally been based on the absence (in type 1 GD) or presence (in types 2 and 3 GD) of neurological involvement of varying severity. However, patient management and prediction of prognosis may be best served by a dynamic, evolving definition of individual phenotype rather than by a rigid system of classification. Patients may experience considerable delays in diagnosis, which can potentially be reduced by effective screening programs; however, program implementation can involve ethical and practical challenges. Variation in the clinical course of GD and an uncertain prognosis also complicate decisions concerning treatment initiation, with differing stakeholder perspectives around efficacy and acceptable cost/benefit ratio. We review the challenges faced by physicians in the diagnosis and management of GD in pediatric patients. We also consider future directions and goals, including acceleration of accurate diagnosis, improvements in the understanding of disease heterogeneity (natural history, response to treatment, and prognosis), the need for new treatments to address unmet needs for all forms of GD, and refinement of the tools for monitoring disease progression and treatment efficacy, such as specific biomarkers.

### Understanding the natural history of gaucher disease [^1135QRm7]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease is a rare and extraordinarily heterogeneous inborn error of metabolism that exhibits diverse manifestations, a broad range of age of onset of symptoms, and a wide clinical spectrum of disease severity, from lethal disease during infancy to first age of onset of symptoms in octogenarians. Before the advent of the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry, the understanding of the natural history and phenotypic range of Gaucher disease was based on isolated case reports and small case series. Limited data hindered understanding of the full spectrum of the disease leading to some early misconceptions about Gaucher disease, notably, that nonneuronopathic (type 1) disease was a disease of adults only. The global scope of the ICGG Gaucher Registry, with its vast body of longitudinal data, has enabled a real appreciation of both the phenotypic spectrum of Gaucher disease and its natural history. This body of evidence represents the foundation for accurate assessment of the response to specific therapies for Gaucher disease and to the development of standard-of-care to monitor disease activity. Here, we outline the key developments in delineating the natural history of this highly complex disease and role of the ICGG Gaucher Registry in this effort.

### How I treat gaucher disease [^112mGzwE]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

This review presents a cohesive approach to treating patients with Gaucher disease. The spectrum of the clinical presentation of the disease is broad, yet heretofore there was only one disease-specific treatment. In the past 2 years, a global shortage of this product has resulted in reassessment of the "one enzyme-one disease-one therapy" mantra. It has also showcased the multiple levels that engage the patient, the treating physician, and the third-party insurer in providing adequate treatment to all symptomatic patients. The key points summarizing the way I manage my patients include accurate enzymatic diagnosis with mutation analysis (for some prognostication and better carrier detection in the family), a detailed follow-up every 6–12 months (with an option to see consultants and attention to comorbidities), and initiation of enzyme replacement therapy according to symptoms or deterioration in clinically significant features or both. I do not treat patients with very mild disease, but I consider presymptomatic therapy for patients at risk, including young women with poor obstetric history. I prefer the minimal-effective dose rather than the maximally tolerated dose, and when the difference between high-dose and lower-dose regimens is (merely statistically significant but) clinically meaningless, minimizing the burden on society by advocating less-expensive treatments is ethically justified.

### How we manage gaucher disease in the era of choices [^116dnPdE]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of Gaucher Disease (GD) is now beset with the abundance of therapeutic options for an individual patient, making the choice of therapy complex for both expert and non-expert clinicians. The pathogenesis of all disease manifestations is a gene mutation-driven deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, but the clinical expression and response of each of the clinical manifestations to different therapies can be difficult to predict. Enzyme replacement therapy has been available since 1991 and is well-established, with known efficacy and minimal toxicity. Of interest, the three available enzymes are distinct molecules and were registered as new products, not biosimilars. Oral substrate reduction therapy has undergone a revitalisation with a newly approved agent in this class for which some efficacy and toxicity questions have been raised. Herein we present our approach to the management of GD in the era of choices, including a new algorithm for how to manage a newly diagnosed patient.

### A reappraisal of gaucher disease-diagnosis and disease management algorithms [^115KEhBH]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

Type 1 (non-neuronopathic) Gaucher disease was the first lysosomal storage disorder for which an effective enzyme replacement therapy was developed and it has become a prototype for treatments for related orphan diseases. There are currently four treatment options available to patients with Gaucher disease, nevertheless, almost 25% of Type 1 Gaucher patients do not gain timely access to therapy because of delays in diagnosis after the onset of symptoms. Diagnosis of Gaucher disease by enzyme testing is unequivocal, but the rarity of the disease and nonspecific and heterogeneous nature of Gaucher disease symptoms may impede consideration of this disease in the differential diagnosis. To help promote timely diagnosis and optimal management of the protean presentations of Gaucher disease, a consensus meeting was convened to develop algorithms for diagnosis and disease management for Gaucher disease.

### The clinical management of type 2 gaucher disease [^1161DG9N]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease, the inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, is the most common of the lysosomal storage disorders. Type 2 Gaucher disease, the most severe and progressive form, manifests either prenatally or in the first months of life, followed by death within the first years of life. The rarity of the many lysosomal storage disorders makes their diagnosis a challenge, especially in the newborn period when the focus is often on more prevalent illnesses. Thus, a heightened awareness of the presentation of these rare diseases is necessary to ensure their timely consideration. This review, designed to serve as a guide to physicians treating newborns and infants with Gaucher disease, discusses the presenting manifestations of Type 2 Gaucher disease, the diagnostic work-up, associated genotypes and suggestions for management. We also address the ethical concerns that may arise with this progressive and lethal disorder, since currently available treatments may prolong life, but do not impact the neurological manifestations of the disease.

### Screening, patient identification, evaluation, and treatment in patients with gaucher disease: results from a Delphi consensus [^111ZA1h3]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Several guidelines are available for identification and management of patients with Gaucher disease, but the most recent guideline was published in 2013. Since then, there have been significant advances in newborn screening, phenotypic characterization, identification of biomarkers and their integration into clinical practice, and the development and approval of new treatment options. Accordingly, the goal of this Delphi consensus exercise was to extend prior initiatives of this type by addressing issues related to newborn screening, diagnostic evaluations, and treatment (both disease directed and adjunctive). The iterative Delphi process involved creation of an initial slate of statements, review by a steering committee, and three rounds of consensus development by an independent panel. A preliminary set of statements was developed by the supporting agency based on literature searches covering the period from 1965 to 2020. The Delphi process reduced an initial set of 185 statements to 65 for which there was unanimous support from the panel. The statements supported may ultimately provide a framework for more detailed treatment guidelines. In addition, the statements for which unanimous support could not be achieved help to identify evidence gaps that are targets for future research.

### Gaucher disease: pathological mechanisms and modern management [^1168RZvp]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by the defective activity of the lysosomal enzyme, acid-beta-glucosidase (GlcCerase), leading to accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), particularly in cells of the macrophage lineage. Nearly 200 mutations in GlcCerase have been described, but for the most part, genotype-phenotype correlations are weak, and little is known about the down-stream biochemical changes that occur upon GlcCer accumulation that result in cell and tissue dysfunction. In contrast, the clinical course of Gaucher disease has been well described, and at least one treatment is available, namely enzyme replacement therapy. One other treatment, substrate reduction therapy, has recently been marketed, and others are in early stages of development. This review, after discussing pathological mechanisms, evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of existing therapies.

### Gaucher disease, state of the art and perspectives [^111DotJE]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Knowledge about Gaucher disease (GD), considered a model for rare diseases, has considerably increased since its discovery. The pathophysiology of this lysosomal disorder is better known, and specific therapies that can control many aspects of the disease have been developed, particularly for the most common form, Type 1 GD. Yet, in part because of the rarity of GD, but also because of a lack of awareness by physicians, diagnostic delay too often leads to a belated management of patients having accumulated comorbidities. Gaucher cells, the most visible consequence of glucocerebrosidase deficiency, have been known for many years. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying some major lesions, such as bone disease, predisposition to Parkinson's disease in Type 1 GD, or neurological involvement in Type 2 and Type 3 GD, remain poorly understood. Diagnostic, therapeutic, and follow-up issues associated with these symptoms remain critical to optimize the care of these patients. In this review, clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of GD are successively considered, highlighting for each of them the remaining challenges. Continued efforts to better understand pathophysiological mechanisms, use of the most modern methods such as artificial intelligence, international collaboration, and development of new therapeutic strategies seem essential for the future of this rare disease.

### Recommendations for the management of the haematological and onco-haematological aspects of gaucher disease [^116RKdaJ]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Aims and methods

On the 18 October 2006, a group of European haematologists and European experts in Gaucher disease convened to:

Review current knowledge on the haematological aspects and complications of Gaucher disease with the help of relevant data from non-Gaucher haematology.
Identify haematological aspects that can lead to increased awareness and earlier suspicion/differential diagnosis of Gaucher disease by general haematologists.
Determine which Gaucher aspects/complications warrant initial assessment and ongoing monitoring in known Gaucher patients.
Review current Gaucher treatment goals and assessment/monitoring guidelines for haematological aspects/complications of Gaucher disease.
Provide advice to both haematologists and non-haematologists for optimal treatment and monitoring of Gaucher patients.

Participants were asked to review and present evidence from peer-reviewed literature, the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) database and from their own clinical experience to support their recommendations. Because of the rarity of Gaucher disease and the consequent lack of randomized trial data, recommendations are based on evidence from observational studies, case reports and expert opinion. Recommendations are graded according to.

Abstract

Knowledge about Gaucher disease (GD), considered a model for rare diseases, has considerably increased since its discovery. The pathophysiology of this lysosomal disorder is better known, and specific therapies that can control many aspects of the disease have been developed, particularly for the most common form, Type 1 GD. Yet, in part because of the rarity of GD, but also because of a lack of awareness by physicians, diagnostic delay too often leads to a belated management of patients having accumulated comorbidities. Gaucher cells, the most visible consequence of glucocerebrosidase deficiency, have been known for many years. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying some major lesions, such as bone disease, predisposition to Parkinson's disease in Type 1 GD, or neurological involvement in Type 2 and Type 3 GD, remain poorly understood. Diagnostic, therapeutic, and follow‐up issues associated with these symptoms remain critical to optimize the care of these patients. In this review, clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of GD are successively considered, highlighting for each of them the remaining challenges. Continued efforts to better understand pathophysiological mechanisms, use of the most modern methods such as artificial intelligence, international collaboration, and development of new therapeutic strategies seem essential for the future of this rare disease.

Conclusions and recommendations

Gaucher disease is a complex multisystemic disorder that does not exclude other acute or chronic conditions. However, the precise relationship between Gaucher disease and certain comorbidities, especially cancer, remains unclear. There is insufficient information to conclude that multiple myeloma, or other cancers, represent disease progression per se in Gaucher patients, although it is hypothesized that certain pathophysiological consequences of Gaucher disease may be involved in the multistep aetiology of malignancy. The use of plasma MGUS, immunoglobulin light chains, or cytokines for monitoring the pathogenesis of Gaucher-related malignancies currently remains speculative. Further sharing of information through the ICGG registry, or other specialized databases, may help clarify their role in the future, and may provide additional therapeutic goals for Gaucher disease. Until then, clinicians can only remain vigilant to co-morbidities in Gaucher disease, and learn from the non-Gaucher community in recognizing possible early indicators of co-existent disease. The panellists made several recommendations for the treatment and monitoring of Gaucher patients, and for increasing awareness of possible signs of haematological co-morbidity (summarized in Table III).

### Lessons learned from the development of enzyme therapy for gaucher disease [^111sV5Eb]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Enzyme replacement therapy for the lysosomal storage disorders derives its impetus from the successes achieved in the treatment of Gaucher disease. After nearly two decades of persistent but unsuccessful efforts, the promise of therapy through enzyme replacement was losing credibility. Then, the fortunate intersection of two different lines of scientific research produced the necessary breakthrough. The dramatic responses to enzyme replacement therapy in patients with Gaucher disease made it immediately clear that this treatment approach was a success. Furthermore, the large number of patients with the disorder guaranteed commercial involvement. The lessons learned from the development of enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease are broadly applicable to other lysosomal storage diseases and will be reviewed in this paper.

Discussion

Non-malignant haematological disease

Gaucher disease is associated with well-defined patterns of cytopenia. In spleen-intact patients, platelets tend to decrease first. With increasing spleen size, haemoglobin levels also gradually fall, followed lastly by a decline in leucocyte numbers. In contrast, asplenic patients have normal or even high platelet counts. If there is severe bone marrow infiltration by Gaucher cells, haemoglobin levels often decline first. Deviations from these patterns may indicate other co-morbidities. For example, a non-splenectomized patient presenting with a large or slightly enlarged spleen, severe anaemia, but normal platelet counts is inconsistent with the expected pattern in Gaucher disease (which would normally include thrombocytopenia). In this case, it is likely that the anaemia is not (only) related to Gaucher disease and other causes should be investigated.

Anaemia

Anaemia is associated with poorer outcomes and poorer quality of life in a wide variety of disorders including Gaucher disease. Adoption of recent proposals to increase the lower limits defining anaemia for adults would enable earlier treatment and elevated treatment goals for haemoglobin normalization in adult Gaucher patients. Importantly, the proposals recognize that different ethnicities may have different requirements – an observation that may also be extended to different medical conditions and environments. Many Gaucher patients at the severe end of the disease spectrum present as children. Should anaemia in children, therefore, also be re-evaluated? In the absence of revised guidelines, an individualized approach to Gaucher disease management encourages physicians to assess, treat and monitor every patient individually for optimal outcomes. This takes into account variables, such as ethnic origin, age, environment, diet, co-morbidities and Gaucher disease status in all possible affected organs and tissues including bone marrow and bone density, in making disease management decisions.

### Phenotype, diagnosis, and treatment of Gaucher's disease [^116nR18E]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Gaucher's disease continues to be a model for applications of molecular medicine to clinical delineation, diagnosis, and treatment. Analyses of several thousand affected individuals have broadened the range of the pan-ethnic disease variants, provided initial genotype and phenotype correlations, and established the effectiveness of enzyme therapy. Large numbers of affected individuals worldwide have provided insight into the effect of disease variation related to ethnic origin, prognosis, and outcome. The ability to safely and effectively use enzyme therapy to inhibit or reverse visceral-disease progression and involvement has provided impetus for design of new enzyme therapies, and creation of substrate depletion and pharmacological chaperone strategies. Such innovations could provide interventions that are effective for neuronopathic variants and, potentially, could be more cost effective than other treatments. These developments are novel, clinically important, advancements for patients with other lysosomal storage diseases and genetic diseases.

### Therapy for gaucher disease: don't stop thinking about tomorrow [^117PiD5Y]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

While enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease has been widely used and appears to be an efficacious and safe treatment, this success should not be a reason for complacency. Other treatment strategies currently under consideration for patients with Gaucher disease include gene therapy, substrate reduction therapy and chaperone therapy. Furthermore, improvements in enzyme therapy could also have a significant clinical impact. Individuals with Gaucher disease and other lysosomal disorders will greatly benefit from continual refinement and optimization of the current therapy, as well as from the development of new treatment modalities that offer improvements in efficacy, cost, safety and availability.

### Therapeutic approaches to bone pathology in gaucher disease: past, present and future [^115vQDRQ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is effective for the treatment of the systemic manifestations of Gaucher disease (GD) and can have a significant impact on skeletal manifestations. Bone involvement is broad and can occur in otherwise clinically asymptomatic individuals. The heterogeneity in GD-related bone disease may implicate multiple pathological processes such as disruption of coordinated bone cell activity, in addition to the physical impact of Gaucher cells causing vascular occlusion. Accumulated data suggests that earlier treatment initiation decreases skeletal complications and that bone disease may require a longer duration of treatment and higher dose than is necessary for organ involvement and hematopoietic manifestations. However, in some patients, bone manifestations persist and even worsen despite ERT, regardless of dose or duration of treatment. Treating skeletal disease should be considered of equal importance as treating visceral and hematologic manifestations. When treatment decisions involve multiple enzyme preparations and other therapeutic modalities such small molecules, the choice should be tailored on an individual basis with continuing evaluation.

### Diagnosing neuronopathic gaucher disease: new considerations and challenges in assigning gaucher phenotypes [^116ENo1V]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Gaucher disease (GD), resulting from biallelic mutations in the gene GBA1, is a monogenic recessively inherited Mendelian disorder with a wide range of phenotypic presentations. The more severe forms of the disease, acute neuronopathic GD (GD2) and chronic neuronopathic GD (GD3), also have a continuum of disease severity with an overlap in manifestations and limited genotype-phenotype correlation. In very young patients, assigning a definitive diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. Several recent studies highlight specific features of neuronopathic GD that may provide diagnostic clues. Distinguishing between the different GD types has important therapeutic implications. Currently there are limited treatment options specifically for neuronopathic GD due to the difficulty in delivering therapies across the blood-brain barrier. In this work, we present both classic and newly appreciated aspects of the Gaucher phenotype that can aid in discriminating between acute and chronic neuronopathic GD, and highlight the continuing therapeutic challenges.

### Early diagnosis of gaucher disease in pediatric patients: proposal for a diagnostic algorithm [^112UKiNC]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by an enzyme deficiency that leads to the accumulation of glycolipids in various organs. Although the signs and symptoms of GD emerge in childhood in the majority of patients, the disease often remains unrecognized for many years with delay of benefits of therapy or development of irreversible complications. Based on published data and data from the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Registry, an algorithm has been drafted for early diagnosis of GD in pediatric patients. It will help hematologists in promoting a timely diagnosis and early access to therapy for pediatric patients with GD.

### Enzyme replacement and substrate reduction therapy for gaucher disease [^111JT5LQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gaucher disease, a rare disorder, is caused by inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. It is unique among the ultra-orphan disorders in that four treatments are currently approved by various regulatory authorities for use in routine clinical practice. Hitherto, because of the relatively few people affected worldwide, many of whom started therapy during a prolonged period when there were essentially no alternatives to imiglucerase, these treatments have not been systematically evaluated in studies such as randomized controlled trials now considered necessary to generate the highest level of clinical evidence.

Objectives

To summarize all available randomized controlled study data on the efficacy and safety of enzyme replacement therapies and substrate reduction therapy for treating Gaucher disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Additional searches were conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov for any ongoing studies with potential interim results, and through PubMed. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 07 August 2014.

Selection Criteria

All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled studies (including open-label studies and cross-over studies) assessing enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy, or both, in all types of Gaucher disease were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, and extracted relevant data.

Main Results

Of the 488 studies retrieved by the electronic searches, eight met the inclusion criteria and were analysed (300 participants). Response parameters were restricted to haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, spleen and liver volume and serum biomarkers (chitotriosidase and CCL18). Only one publication reported a 'low risk of bias' score in all parameters assessed, and all studies included were randomized. Four studies reported the responses to enzyme replacement therapy of previously untreated individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease. Two studies investigated maintenance enzyme replacement therapy in people with stable type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated for at least two years. One study compared substrate reduction therapy, enzyme replacement therapy and a combination thereof as maintenance therapy in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with enzyme replacement therapy. One study examined substrate reduction therapy in people with chronic neuronopathic (type 3) Gaucher disease who continued to receive enzyme replacement therapy. Treatment-naïve participants had similar increases in haemoglobin when comparing those receiving imiglucerase or alglucerase at 60 units/kg, imiglucerase or velaglucerase alfa at 60 U/kg, taliglucerase alfa at 30 units/kg or 60 units/kg, and velaglucerase alfa at 45 units/g or 60 units/kg. For platelet count response in participants with intact spleens, a benefit for imiglucerase over velaglucerase alfa at 60 units/kg was observed, mean difference -79.87 (95% confidence interval -137.57 to -22.17). There were no other significant differences in platelet count response when comparing different doses of velaglucerase alfa and of taliglucerase alfa, and when comparing imiglucerase to alglucerase. Spleen and liver volume reductions were not significantly different in any enzyme replacement therapy product or dose comparison study. Although a dose effect on serum biomarkers was not seen after nine months, a significantly greater reduction with higher dose was reported after 12 months in the velaglucerase study, mean difference 16.70 (95% confidence intervaI 1.51 to 31.89). In the two enzyme replacement therapy maintenance studies comparing infusions every two weeks and every four weeks, there were no significant differences in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and spleen and liver volumes over a 6 to 12 month period when participants were treated with the same cumulative dose. A total of 25 serious adverse events were reported, nearly all deemed unrelated to treatment. There are, as yet, no randomized trials of substrate reduction therapy in treatment-naïve patients that can be evaluated. Miglustat monotherapy appeared as effective as continued enzyme replacement therapy for maintenance of hematological, organ and biomarker responses in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with imiglucerase for at least two years. In those with neuronopathic Gaucher disease, no significant improvements in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count or organ volumes occurred when enzyme replacement therapy was augmented with miglustat. One randomized controlled study assessing substrate reduction therapy was published immediately prior to producing the final version of this review, and this, along with a further ongoing study (expected to be published in the near future), will be assessed for eligibility in a future update of the review.

Authors' Conclusions

The results reflect the limitations of analysing evidence restricted to prospective randomized controlled trials, especially when dealing with chronic rare diseases. This analysis suggests that, during the first year of treatment, different recombinant glucocerebrosidases are bio-similar and non-inferior in safety and efficacy for surrogate biological response parameters. Enzyme replacement therapy given at 30 to 45 units/kg body weight every two to four weeks was generally as effective as the 60 unit/kg dose for the assessed clinical outcomes. The analysis emphasise the need to determine whether it is realistic to carry out multi-decade prospective clinical trials for rare diseases such as type 1 Gaucher disease. With large treatment effects on the classical manifestations of the disorder, therapeutic investigations in Gaucher disease mandate innovative trial designs and methodology to secure decisive data concerning long-term efficacy and safety - with the realization that knowledge about disease-modifying actions that are sustained are of crucial importance to people with this chronic condition.

### Enzyme replacement therapy in pediatric patients with gaucher disease: what should we use as maintenance dosage? [^112q5Aum]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

No consensus exists on the minimal dose of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) effective to maintain therapeutic goals in pediatric Gaucher patients.

Objective

Evaluate the efficacy of low dosage ERT to maintain treatment goals.

Results

Six patients had a maintenance dose of 30–35U/kg/month. All patients, with the exception of one L444P/L444P homozygote, maintained therapeutic goals.

Discussion

A low maintenance dose may be adequate in most pediatric patients. L444P homozygotes may require a higher maintenance dosage.

### Clinically relevant therapeutic endpoints in type I gaucher disease [^112bUBHm]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2001). Low credibility.

The introduction of enzyme supplementation therapy for Gaucher disease has had a great impact on the lives of many patients. Organomegaly, cytopenia and bone disease have been shown to improve in response to treatment, resulting in an improvement in quality of life. However, the assessment of organ system involvement is not always done in such a way that the relationship with clinically relevant endpoints is clear. The lack of adequately validated methods of assessment, especially for bone disease, has hindered the establishment of treatment goals and guidelines for treatment optimization.

### Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for gaucher disease [^115xqCea]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Current treatment of the disease involves a choice among enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy and stem cell transplantation. Stem cell transplantation is a high risk procedure with possible long-term benefits in the regression of skeletal and neurological changes in people with Gaucher disease.

Objectives

To determine the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in people with Gaucher disease in relation to: mortality risk associated with the procedure; efficacy in modifying the course of the disease; and arrest or regression of neurological manifestations in neuropathic forms (Types 2 and 3).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 26 March 2012. We also searched the websites www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.genzymeclinicalresearch.com. Date of most recent search of these sites: 16 February 2012.

Selection Criteria

All randomised, quasi-randomised and controlled clinical trials comparing stem cell transplantation with enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy, symptomatic treatment or no treatment in people with Gaucher disease of all ages.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trials for inclusion, however, no relevant trials were identified.

Main Results

Twelve trials were identified by the searches, however, these were not suitable for inclusion in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

Stem cell transplantation is a form of treatment that offers the potential of permanent cure. However, there are no clinical trials that have assessed the safety and efficacy of stem cell transplantation in comparison to other conservative measures (enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy) now in use.

### Recommendations for the use of eliglustat in the treatment of adults with gaucher disease type 1 in the United States [^114UqZTU]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

In Gaucher disease, deficient activity of acid β-glucosidase results in accumulation of its substrates, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, within the lysosomes of cells primarily in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and occasionally the lung. The multisystem disease is predominantly characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and skeletal disease. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human acid β-glucosidase has been the first-line therapy for Gaucher disease type 1 for more than two decades. Eliglustat, a novel oral substrate reduction therapy, was recently approved in the United States and the European Union as a first-line treatment for adults with Gaucher disease type 1. Eliglustat inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, thereby decreasing production of the substrate glucosylceramide and reducing its accumulation. Although existing recommendations for the care of patients with Gaucher disease remain in effect, unique characteristics of eliglustat require additional investigation and monitoring. A panel of physicians with expertise in Gaucher disease and experience with eliglustat in the clinical trials provide guidance regarding the use of eliglustat, including considerations before starting therapy and monitoring of patients on eliglustat therapy.

### The definition of neuronopathic gaucher disease [^115hihyD]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD) has a very wide clinical and genotypic spectrum. However, there is no consensus definition of nGD, including no description of how best to diagnostically separate the acute form-Gaucher type 2-from the subacute or chronic form-Gaucher type 3. In this article, we define the various forms of Gaucher disease with particular emphasis on the presence of gaze palsy in all patients with nGD. This consensus definition will help in both clinical diagnosis and appropriate patient recruitment to upcoming clinical trials.

### Demographics and patient characteristics of 1209 patients with gaucher disease: descriptive analysis from the gaucher outcome survey (GOS) [^1163sNH6]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

As an ongoing registry, the structure and design of GOS is evolving in order to reflect the changing demographic characteristics of the GD population and to present data on relevant clinical outcomes. Previous analyses of GOS data have evaluated trends in treatment patterns 16 and the impact of treatment during pregnancy, 27 while ongoing analyses will examine patient comorbidities, skeletal abnormalities, patients with type 3 GD, and outcomes with long‐term treatment.

In conclusion, the findings from this evaluation of baseline data provide insights into the key demographic and disease characteristics of patients with GD who are enrolled in GOS and, together with future evaluations, will help to improve understanding of the natural history of the disease and the overall management of patients with GD.

### Remaining problems in the management of patients with gaucher disease [^112926rK]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2001). Low credibility.

The history of treatment of Gaucher disease started with splenectomy and continued with bone marrow transplantation, before the recent introduction of enzyme replacement therapy. Although the latter has revolutionized the prognosis of patients, many questions remain to be answered and clinical management problems resolved. These include how to monitor enzyme replacement to determine the optimal dosage, how to treat mild disease, whether intermittent treatment is an option, and the causes of the neurological signs and how to treat them. The pulmonary hypertension problem has also not been resolved, and we need to determine how to treat and monitor bone disease. In addition, the future role of substrate deprivation needs to be determined, and further research is required before gene therapy becomes a potential clinical option. The high cost of enzyme replacement treatment for Gaucher disease remains an important issue.

### Individualization of long-term enzyme replacement therapy for gaucher disease [^115KrCE5]. Genetics in Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disorder, is a heterogeneous condition affecting multiple organ systems. Patients with nonneuronopathic (type 1) Gaucher disease may suffer from hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bleeding tendencies, anemia, hypermetabolism, skeletal pathology, growth retardation, pulmonary disease, and decreased quality of life. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with mannose-terminated glucocerebrosidase (imiglucerase, Cerezyme, Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA) reverses or ameliorates many of the manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease. However, due to the variable pattern and severity of disease, and the uncertain manner of progression, implementation of treatment, choice of initial and maintenance imiglucerase dose, and evaluation of the therapeutic response must be tailored to the individual patient. For the past 14 years, the US Regional Coordinators of the International Collaborative Gaucher Group have individually and collectively developed extensive clinical experience in managing patients with Gaucher disease. In this review, we present recommendations for initial imiglucerase treatment and subsequent dose adjustments based on a schedule of regular assessment and monitoring, and achievement and maintenance of defined therapeutic goals.

### Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for gaucher disease [^113qwMXj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Current treatment of the disease involves a choice from enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy and hemotopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT is a high risk procedure with possible long-term benefits in the regression of skeletal and neurological changes in people with Gaucher disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To determine the role of HSCT in people with Gaucher disease in relation to: mortality risk associated with the procedure; efficacy in modifying the course of the disease; and arrest or regression of neurological manifestations in neuronopathic forms (types 2 and 3).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 19 January 2017. We also searched the websites: www.clinicaltrials.gov; WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform portal and www.genzymeclinicalresearch.com. Date of most recent search of these sites: 02 March 2017.

Selection Criteria

All randomised, quasi-randomised and controlled clinical trials comparing stem cell transplantation with enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy, symptomatic treatment or no treatment in people with Gaucher disease of all ages.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trials for inclusion, however, no relevant trials were identified.

Main Results

Thirty two trials were identified by the searches; however, these were not suitable for inclusion in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

HSCT is a form of treatment that offers the potential of permanent cure. However, there are no clinical trials that have assessed the safety and efficacy of this treatment in comparison to other conservative measures (enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy) now in use. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to March 2017. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published.

Abstract

Neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD) has a very wide clinical and genotypic spectrum. However, there is no consensus definition of nGD, including no description of how best to diagnostically separate the acute form — Gaucher type 2 — from the subacute or chronic form — Gaucher type 3. In this article, we define the various forms of Gaucher disease with particular emphasis on the presence of gaze palsy in all patients with nGD. This consensus definition will help in both clinical diagnosis and appropriate patient recruitment to upcoming clinical trials.

### Biomarker testing for lysosomal diseases: a technical standard of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^113zCUYt]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Gaucher disease — epidemiology, genetics, and phenotype: Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal disease, with global prevalence estimates of 1 in 26,000 to 1 in 63,000 for type 1 and 1 in 2000 to 1 in 8000 for types 2 and 3; in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, incidence for type 1 is as high as 1 in 450 births. This autosomal recessive sphingolipidosis is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in GBA and enzymatic deficiency of acid β-glucosidase (GBA1; EC 3.2.1.45) with subsequent accumulation of lysosomal glucosylceramide and its sphingoid base, lyso-Gb1. Type 1, the most common form in the United States, is distinguished from types 2 and 3 by limited neurological involvement; patients with type 2 and type 3 account for ~1% and 5% of patients in the United States, respectively. Primary phenotypic consequences of type 1 include hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, growth delay, bone involvement, and/or pulmonary involvement with age of onset ranging from childhood to late adulthood, and patients with type 1 have an increased risk for multiple myeloma and Parkinsonism.

### Management of neuronopathic gaucher disease: revised recommendations [^113YVS7D]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2009). Low credibility.

The original guidelines drawn up for the management of the neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease were felt to be in need of revision; in particular, the role of high-dose enzyme replacement therapy (120 IU/kg of body weight every 2 weeks) in stabilizing neurological disease. The existing published evidence was analysed; it was concluded that it did not support the role of high-dose ERT, although this might be required to treat severe visceral disease.

### Long-term treatment outcomes in gaucher disease [^112uMBJY]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Following the treatment of the first Gaucher disease patient with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), it was clear that ERT had the potential to be transformative with dramatic improvements in systemic manifestations of the disease within 2 years. Following over 20 years existence of the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry and evidence from ∼6000 patients, the long-term effects of therapy have been documented. It has been shown that ERT can result in improvements in all clinical and laboratory parameters of nonneuronopathic disease. However, different aspects of the disease, such as hematologic parameters, organ volumes and bone disease do not necessarily respond to therapy at the same rate or to the same extent, and this has had major implications for disease monitoring and for the establishment of therapeutic goals for ERT. Response may be affected by factors such as the timing of therapy initiation, the presence of irreversible complications such as osteonecrosis, and by enzyme dose. It is also apparent that ERT has no impact on neurological aspects of disease and highlights the need for additional or alternative treatment strategies able to meet the needs of patients with neuronopathic disease.

### Enzyme replacement therapy for gaucher disease [^112WPQX1]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal storage disease, and the first lysosomal storage disease for which a specific therapy has been developed. Enzyme replacement therapy, with glucocerebrosidase purified from human placentae, was introduced in 1991. Recombinant human glucocerebrosidase, produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells in tissue culture, became available in 1994 and has replaced the placenta-derived product. These therapies have revolutionized the care of patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, reversing many of the pathological consequences of this disease, and preventing further progression. Furthermore, they have served as a model for the treatment of other lysosomal storage diseases and inborn errors of metabolism.

### Gaucher disease: haematological presentations and complications [^114FT5CG]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, caused by deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, required for the degradation of glycosphingolipids. Clinical manifestations include hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bone disease and a bleeding diathesis, frequently resulting in presentation to haematologists. Historically managed by splenectomy, transfusions and orthopaedic surgery, the development of specific therapy in the form of intravenous enzyme replacement therapy in the 1990s has resulted in dramatic improvements in haematological and visceral disease. Recognition of complications, including multiple myeloma and Parkinson disease, has challenged the traditional macrophage-centric view of the pathophysiology of this disorder. The pathways by which enzyme deficiency results in the clinical manifestations of this disorder are poorly understood; altered inflammatory cytokine profiles, bioactive sphingolipid derivatives and alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment have been implicated. Further elucidating these pathways will serve to advance our understanding not only of GD, but of associated disorders.

### Comparative evaluation of α-galactosidase A infusions for treatment of Fabry disease [^1147LY2t]. Genetics in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Enzyme therapy has proven safe and effective in preventing and reversing many manifestations in patients with Gaucher disease. On the basis of this success, enzyme therapy is now becoming a reality for Fabry disease, alpha-galactosidase A deficiency. Two products, agalsidase alpha and beta, have been tested in pivotal trials. The substantial differences between the study structures and outcome measures have made direct comparisons difficult. Here, the strengths and weaknesses of these trials are compared: achievement of stated endpoints, safety and, potential efficacy. In addition, the need for additional long-term data is emphasized because this is not attainable in short-term trials for a chronic disease.

### A systematic review and meta-analyses of longitudinal studies on drug treatments for gaucher disease [^116NSvSc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare disorder linked to the absence/deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. GD can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT). The aim of this systematic review (SR) is to assess the effectiveness of drugs used for GD treatment.

Data Sources

Searches were conducted in PubMed and Scopus, in April 2021. The search strategies encompassed the name of the disease and of the drug treatments. Manual search was also conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Observational and interventional longitudinal studies evaluating ERT and SRT for GD were included. Single mean meta-analyses were conducted for each drug using R.

Data Synthesis

The initial search retrieved 2246 articles after duplicates were removed. Following screening and eligibility assessment, 68 reports were included. The studies evaluated imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, taliglucerase alfa, miglustat, and eliglustat. The results showed that ERT is effective as a treatment in both naïve and experienced patients. Miglustat did not significantly improve blood outcomes in naïve patients and resulted in a decrease in the platelet levels of experienced patients. Eliglustat was mainly assessed for experienced patients and resulted in stable outcome values.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This extensive SR confirms the effectiveness of GD treatments in short- and long-term follow-ups.

Conclusions

The results were favorable for all ERTs and for eliglustat. Based on the assessed evidence, miglustat did not achieved expressive results. However, all evidence should be interpreted considering its limitations and does not replace well-conducted randomized trials.

### Gaucher disease, state of the art and perspectives [^115Gixmf]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Perspectives and challenges

What has not yet been identified is the way to single out patients who will progress or who must be treated without waiting for deleterious bone or neurological consequences. In the case of bone lesions, treatments or complementary interventions are necessary. Protection against any bone event still needs to be optimized, as 10% of patients under treatment continue to experience bone infarcts. Besides, drugs crossing the blood–brain barrier would be a great advance for neurological lesions. Another subject of investigation is that of the peculiar tumors that are gaucheromas, probably not explored enough. Finally, the long‐term outcome of patients with GD again requires an international effort of collaboration.

### Imaging of non-neuronopathic gaucher disease: recent advances in quantitative imaging and comprehensive assessment of disease involvement [^114T131z]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Historic and available therapies for Gaucher disease

Many asymptomatic patients with mild disease may not receive treatment at first; most children with milder genotypes perhaps may not require treatment initially. However, active bone disease, even if asymptomatic, and significant hepatosplenomegaly are considered indications for initiating ERT in asymptomatic children. Therefore, monitoring of patients not currently on therapy with imaging is clearly important in guiding clinicians as to early disease involvement.

As some patients may respond poorly to particular therapies, imaging can be important to inform clinicians regarding changes in an individual patient's response to specific therapies to provide personalized therapy decisions. The management of treated individuals who are asymptomatic despite biomarker and imaging findings of Gaucher disease poses a unique challenge, leading some clinicians to propose a concept of minimal disease activity wherein some treated patients may have mild persistent abnormalities on imaging and laboratory investigations without clinically significant disease. Moreover, the substantial financial burden incurred by these therapies with annual treatment costs ranging between 70,000 and 380,000 USD may also motivate the use of imaging assessment of treatment response in well-controlled patients to assist in verifying efficacy and safety of reduced dosing schedules or alternative strategies to reduce the overall cost of therapy.

### Sixteen years of prenatal consultations for the N370S / N370S gaucher disease genotype: what have we learned? [^111a7yLs]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Although prenatal diagnosis and genotyping are available for Gaucher disease, genetic counseling for an affected child's parents reflects the inability to predict disease course with certainty. The purpose of this survey is to ascertain disease status of children identified by prenatal screening.

Methods

All carrier couples for glucocerebrosidase mutations who were counseled at our large Gaucher Clinic were included; none had genotyped the fetus. Medical status of children was assessed by questionnaires and data were collected from clinic charts and/or telephone contact with the parents.

Results

Of 34 children born, 1 died in utero, 5 fetuses (N370S/N370S) aborted. Of 21 genotyped N370S/N370S, 7 children had Gaucher-like symptoms/signs but for only one child (two symptoms) were these ascribable to Gaucher disease; four children had non-Gaucher symptoms/signs.

Conclusion

Of 21 children whose parents pursued prenatal counseling for Gaucher disease and were found to have the N370S/N370S genotype, none has presented with severe disease with follow-up of 15 years. The Israeli experience shows that Gaucher disease N370S screening does not identify children requiring treatment, but rather leads to termination of asymptomatic fetuses; this may lead to reconsideration of guidelines regarding Gaucher screening.

### Gaucher disease and its treatment options [^114z8ntt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatments of Gaucher disease (GD), focusing on the role of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), andsubstrate reduction therapy (SRT).

Data Sources

A literature search through PubMed (1984-May 2013) of English language articles was performed with terms: Gaucher's disease, lysosomal storage disease. Secondary and tertiary references were obtained by reviewing related articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles in English identified from the data sources, clinical studies using ERT, SRT and articles containing other interesting aspects were included.

Data Synthesis

GD is the most common inherited LSD, characterized by a deficiency in the activity of the enzyme acid β-glucosidase, which leads to accumulation of glucocerebroside within lysosomes of macrophages, leading to hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow suppression, and bone lesions. GD is classified into 3 types: type 1 GD (GD1) is chronic and non-neuronopathic, accounting for 95% of GDs, and types 2 and 3 (GD2, GD3) cause nerve cell destruction. Regular monitoring of enzyme chitotriosidase and pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokines are useful to confirm the diagnosis and effectiveness of GD treatment.

Conclusions

There are 4 treatments available for GD1: 3 ERTs and 1 SRT. Miglustat, an SRT, is approved for mild to moderate GD1. ERTs are available for moderate to severe GD1 and can improve quality of life within the first year of treatment. The newest ERT, taliglucerase alfa, is plant-cell derived that can be produced on a large scale at lower cost. Eliglustat tartrate, another SRT, is under phase 3 clinical trials. No drugs have been approved for GD2 or GD3.

### Enzyme replacement and beyond [^113md7U5]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2001). Low credibility.

During the last decade, enzyme replacement therapy for lysosomal storage diseases became a reality with the demonstration of its safety and effectiveness in type 1 Gaucher disease. Currently, enzyme replacement and several other potential therapeutic strategies are being developed for selected lysosomal storage diseases, including Fabry disease due to the deficient activity of alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A). The development and clinical evaluation of these new therapies require a stepwise process, each step being rigorously reviewed and approved by national or international regulatory agencies. For lethal disorders that affect small populations, such as many inherited metabolic diseases, this process can be accelerated by 'orphan drug' and 'fast track' regulations. As an example of the drug development process, the development of recombinant human alpha-Gal A (r-halphaGal A) replacement for Fabry disease is presented, including the preclinical studies in the 'Fabry mouse' model, and the clinical phase 1/2, phase 3, and phase 3 extension studies, which demonstrate the safety and efficacy of this new therapy.

### Imaging of non-neuronopathic gaucher disease: recent advances in quantitative imaging and comprehensive assessment of disease involvement [^1145pQpq]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Gaucher disease is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting in deficiency of lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase causing the accumulation of abnormal macrophages ("Gaucher cells") within multiple organs, most conspicuously affecting the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. As the most common glycolipid metabolism disorder, it is important for radiologists encountering these patients to be familiar with advances in imaging of organ and bone marrow involvement and understand the role of imaging in clinical decision-making. The recent advent of commercially available, reliable, and reproducible quantitative MRI acquisitions to measure fat fractions prompts revisiting the role of quantitative assessment of bone marrow involvement. This manuscript reviews the diverse imaging manifestations of Gaucher disease and discusses more optimal quantitative approaches to ascertain solid organ and bone marrow involvement with an emphasis on future applications of other quantitative methods including elastography.

Due to the reliance on ERT and SRT for the long-term management of patients with Gaucher disease, non-invasive imaging methods are essential in ascertainment of response to therapy and detection of disease-related complications. Therefore, understanding the role of different imaging modalities in the context of disease processes is important to provide clinicians and radiologists with guidance in assessing disease severity and treatment response. General strengths and limitations of each imaging modality are summarized in Table 4.

Imaging modalities relevant to Gaucher disease

Hepatic and splenic involvement

Organomegaly and infiltration

While the inciting pathophysiological mechanism of Gaucher disease, enzymatic deficiency with accumulation of glucocerebroside, has been elucidated, the extent to which substrate accumulation accounts for liver enlargement has been called into question. Originally, visceromegaly was attributed to simple accumulation glucocerebroside in the reticuloendothelial system with buildup of this material within Gaucher cells in the spleen as well as Kupffer cells in the liver. However, newer evidence suggests that pro-inflammatory and pro-infiltrative chemotaxis factors may also account for organ enlargement with Gaucher cells contributing only partially to enlarged liver and spleen volumes. Regardless, severe hepatic involvement generally corresponds with additional organ system manifestations. Hepatosplenomegaly is a hallmark of Gaucher disease and uniformly present beginning in childhood, and liver disease is a major contributor to Gaucher disease-related mortality. As such, traditional imaging of disease severity has been based on hepatic and splenic visceral organ enlargement.

### Biomarker testing for lysosomal diseases: a technical standard of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^111t3hTM]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Gaucher disease — diagnostic and monitoring biomarkers: The findings of low enzyme activity together with biallelic pathogenic variants and/or elevated biomarker can establish the diagnosis of Gaucher disease, and biomarker testing is also useful in evaluating therapeutic response and treatment compliance. Established monitoring biomarkers include tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, chitotriosidase activity, angiotensin converting enzyme, and/or C-C motif ligand 18/pulmonary-activated-related chemokine, but these reflect macrophage activation and/or lipid storage and are not specific to Gaucher disease. Current evidence supports lyso-Gb1 as the most reliable biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and disease and therapeutic monitoring. Context on therapy is that FDA-approved ERT (imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, and taliglucerase alfa) and SRT (miglustat and eliglustat) are available for symptomatic types 1 and 3, although they are generally not effective for neurological manifestations in type 3.

### Real-world effectiveness of eliglustat in treatment-naïve and switch patients enrolled in the international collaborative gaucher group gaucher registry [^115H93fX]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Following drug approval, it is prudent to evaluate "real‐world" safety and effectiveness outside of the clinical trial setting, where patients are selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria and treatment compliance is generally very high. Accordingly, we analyzed efficacy outcome data from eliglustat‐treated patients with Gaucher disease type 1 enrolled in the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry, to determine how these real‐world data compare with what was observed in the eliglustat clinical trials. Our objectives were to determine whether treatment‐naïve patients achieved clinically significant improvements of indicators of disease activity after 2 years of eliglustat treatment, and whether previously ERT‐treated patients maintained (or improved) their clinical status 2 years after switching to eliglustat treatment.

Monitoring disease manifestations and therapeutic intervention

Accurate quantitative monitoring of disease manifestations as well as of the therapeutic efficacy of any type of treatment is crucial for clinical management of patients with LSDs. Disease onset and progression can be monitored by clinical, radiological, and laboratory assessments. Clinical assessments obviously differ among the various LSDs, as illustrated below for Gaucher disease and Fabry disease. In practice, clinical therapeutic efficacy is often difficult to assess, as organ involvement can sometimes not be quantitatively assessed and is highly variable among patients. Moreover, some symptoms have an irreversible nature, such as advanced renal failure in Fabry disease or bone infarctions in Gaucher disease. Increasingly, disease-specific biochemical abnormalities are used to monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy for LSDs.

### Guidance on the use of miglustat for treating patients with type 1 gaucher disease [^115THwZQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) is a progressive lysosomal storage disorder due to an autosomal recessive deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. Clinical manifestations include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone and pulmonary disease. Intravenous enzyme replacement (ERT) with imiglucerase is the accepted standard for treatment of symptomatic patients. More than 3,500 patients worldwide have received ERT with well-documented beneficial effects on the hematological, visceral, skeletal, and pulmonary manifestations, and with resultant improvement in health-related quality of life. Miglustat, an imino sugar that reversibly inhibits glucosylceramide synthase and reduces intracellular substrate burden, is an oral treatment for patients with type 1 GD that was recently approved in the United States for symptomatic patients with mild to moderate clinical manifestations for whom ERT is not an option. Because responses to miglustat are slower and less robust than those observed with ERT, and because miglustat is associated with significant side effects, clinicians who care for patients with GD should become familiar with the limited indications for miglustat use and the circumstances when it may be prescribed appropriately. This review article and position statement represents the current opinion of American physicians with extensive expertise in GD regarding patient management in the context of the availability of standard imiglucerase treatment and the recent introduction of miglustat.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model development, validation, and application for prediction of eliglustat drug-drug interactions [^1156PQfu]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Study highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Eliglustat is an oral substrate reduction therapy for the treatment of adults with type‐1 Gaucher disease. Eliglustat can interact with many other drugs, complicating and potentially limiting its use in polypharmacy situations.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

Prediction of eliglustat drug–drug interactions using a validated physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic model and exploration of lower doses in drug interaction situations.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

The physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of eliglustat is described. Untested clinical scenarios are simulated, and lower eliglustat doses were explored for their utility in dosing flexibility and safety.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

The PBPK model can be used to provide some indication for dose adjustment in polypharmacy situations. Lower doses can be explored as an alternative to the full and currently marketed eliglustat dose when drug interactions are likely and interruption or nonuse of eliglustat could be disadvantageous for patients with Gaucher disease.

### Imaging of non-neuronopathic gaucher disease: recent advances in quantitative imaging and comprehensive assessment of disease involvement [^112xS3R8]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Classification of Gaucher disease

As the most common lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease manifests with abnormal accumulation of glucosylceramide within macrophage lysosomes in multiple organs resulting from an absence or deficiency of β-glucocerebrosidase (also termed β-glucosidase, a glycosphingolipid) enzyme activity. This disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion with over 350 mutations in the glucosylcerebrosidase (GBA) gene identified to-date.

Although this condition is attributed to a single gene, there is substantial variability in the phenotypic presentation of Gaucher disease with three classically described types. This article focuses on the chronic, non-neuronopathic form (type 1), manifesting with prominent involvement of the reticuloendothelial system with liver, spleen, and marrow involvement, whereas the other types (acute neuronopathic type 2 and subacute-chronic neuronopathic type 3, summarized in Table 1) are far less common. It is worth noting that some experts propose conceptualizing these disease types as a phenotypic spectrum rather than as distinct entities. Some work has suggested subclinical neurological involvement in the "non-neuronopathic" type with abnormal brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) findings reported in type 1 Gaucher disease patients, although subsequent investigations have failed to replicate these observations and further work is needed. Others have suggested an increased risk of Parkinsonism in individuals with GBA mutations that reflects a complex relationship between glucocerebrosidase and Lewy body disorders.

Table 1
Clinical classifications of Gaucher disease

While type 1 Gaucher disease is most often diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood with a little under one-third of cases diagnosed by 10 years of age, this condition can come to clinical attention at any age due to gradations of residual enzyme activity and phenotypic variability. Pediatric phenotypic expression, however, tends to be particularly severe. The diversity of clinical manifestation and spectrum of disease severity underscore the importance of accurate assessment of multisystemic involvement at diagnosis and across the lifespan; as this article will further discuss, diagnostic imaging plays an instrumental role in clinical evaluation and management of Gaucher disease.

### Gaucher disease in bone: from pathophysiology to practice [^114WQGnn]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Whether the treatment of choice is ERT or SRT, prompt initiation is key to optimizing outcomes. 14, 70

For physicians who are relatively inexperienced in treating GD, we encourage multidisciplinary collaboration to facilitate clinical decision‐making; the team should include a radiologist experienced in GD.

In case of a malignancy, treatment should follow guidelines appropriate for the tumor type, taking into account the complexities of GD, and care should be taken to optimize BM function in relation to the delivery of myelotoxic chemotherapy. 71 The presence of GD in itself should not, however, influence the decision to treat the malignancy.

Remaining unmet needs

Specific biochemical markers of Gaucher cell‐related bone disease are needed to allow frequent noninvasive monitoring of bone pathology and its response to therapy. 14

Although understanding of the pathophysiology of GD‐related malignancy has recently advanced, further work is required to facilitate the targeted intervention and prevention of this disease manifestation.

### Gaucher disease, state of the art and perspectives [^1155KPh9]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Type 1 GD is a model among rare diseases, owing to the progress achieved in knowledge about pathophysiology, treatment with ERT, then with a second efficient substrate inhibitor, and long‐term follow‐up. Great challenges remain.

The first challenge is probably to alleviate diagnostic delay, an issue shared by all rare diseases that would benefit from educational initiatives. Integrating rare diseases in etiologic algorithms of the most common key symptoms would help clinicians, even non‐specialists.

A second one relates to understanding the phenotype of the various clinico‐biologic manifestations of GD. This remains crucial, in spite of the important progress demonstrating that it goes beyond the sole influence of Gaucher cells. Better understanding of Type 3 neurologic involvement, of bone lesions and factors favoring it, and of the relationship between GD and Parkinsonian syndromes would allow for the emergence of new therapeutic strategies.

The latter is the third challenge. Despite the efforts of research teams and pharmaceutical companies to try and find molecules crossing the blood–brain barrier, results are currently disappointing, in spite of the small hope brought by chaperones. The parallel advances in gene therapy led to the development of this approach for Type 3 GD as well as for Type 1 GD. Stakes are high also regarding treatment for bone lesions and Parkinson's disease. All these issues are hampered by the relatively small numbers in patient cohorts.

Finally, there is also room for progress regarding biomarkers. Better understanding between known markers and phenotypes would help optimize their use. Again, a large international cohort is lacking, hindered by the lack of standardization and high variability between studies. Experts in GD have been working collaboratively in a network for a long time. The IWGGD serves as the academic network for GD, bringing together multidisciplinary experts involved in the management and research of this condition, as well as representatives of patient associations, united internationally under the International Gaucher Alliance, itself being a complementary driving force of the proposal. Thus, the IWGGD addresses various aspects (medical, biological, societal, etc.) that can contribute to improving patient care. For example, the IWGGD has published its diagnosis guidelines regarding geographical differences in the access to diagnostic services and has initiated such a standardization strategy for biomarker assays that should favor data collection of real‐life information, allowing to better study phenotypic groups. Some resources could also be found in the registries of pharmaceutical companies. Besides, predictive biomarkers of neurological or bone evolution are still lacking.

Nevertheless, research on GD remains quite active and should allow progressively meeting these challenges.

### Cancer risk and gammopathies in 2123 adults with gaucher disease type 1 in the international gaucher group gaucher registry [^113qAFhw]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The metabolic defect in GD leads to accumulation of bioactive glycosphingolipids that have long been held to drive carcinogenesis. With earlier diagnosis and transformative therapies, outcomes for patients with GD1 have significantly improved; therefore, maintenance of long‐term health in this growing population of patients underscores the importance of reliable data on cancer risk to stratify patients for appropriate monitoring. Previous studies have been hindered by inadequate ascertainment, inadequate patient cohorts, and/or differences in length and depth of follow‐up, often leading to contradictory conclusions. This is the first analysis of the risk of malignancy in the GD1 population using a large, multicenter, international population with a sufficient follow‐up time for malignancies to develop.

The overall risk for hematological malignancies was higher in GD1 patients compared to the general US population, particularly the risk of B cell neoplasms. A higher risk for MM has been reported previously, ranging from 5.9 to 51.1 times greater risk. Our study estimated the relative risk for MM as approximately nine times higher in GD1 patients compared to the general population. The age stratification we used may yield a more representative risk estimate as MM is an age‐related phenotype. Previous risk studies of GD1 patients have shown that patients with MM were > 50 years old. Our large international cohort extended the age of occurrence of MM to younger ages, emphasizing the need for regular comprehensive evaluations of adults with GD1.

### Effect of oral eliglustat on splenomegaly in patients with gaucher disease type 1: the ENGAGE randomized clinical trial [^112gZ6XM]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Gaucher disease type 1 is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and skeletal disease. A safe, effective oral therapy is needed.

Objective

To determine whether eliglustat, a novel oral substrate reduction therapy, safely reverses clinical manifestations in untreated adults with Gaucher disease type 1.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 18 sites in 12 countries from November 2009 to July 2012 among eligible patients with splenomegaly plus thrombocytopenia and/or anemia. Of 72 patients screened, 40 were enrolled.

Interventions

Patients were stratified by spleen volume and randomized 1:1 to receive eliglustat (50 or 100 mg twice daily; n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) for 9 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy end point was percentage change in spleen volume in multiples of normal from baseline to 9 months; secondary efficacy end points were change in hemoglobin level and percentage changes in liver volume and platelet count.

Results

All patients had baseline splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia (mostly moderate or severe), most had mild or moderate hepatomegaly, and 20% had mild anemia. Least-square mean spleen volume decreased by 27.77% (95% CI, -32.57% to -22.97%) in the eliglustat group (from 13.89 to 10.17 multiples of normal) vs an increase of 2.26% (95% CI, -2.54% to 7.06%) in the placebo group (from 12.50 to 12.84 multiples of normal) for an absolute treatment difference of -30.03% (95% CI, -36.82% to -23.24%; P < .001). For the secondary end points, the least-square mean absolute differences between groups all favored eliglustat, with a 1.22-g/dL increase in hemoglobin level (95% CI, 0.57–1.88 g/dL; P < .001), 6.64% decrease in liver volume (95% CI, -11.37% to -1.91%; p = 0.007), and 41.06% increase in platelet count (95% CI, 23.95%-58.17%; P < .001). No serious adverse events occurred. One patient in the eliglustat group withdrew (non-treatment related); 39 of the 40 patients transitioned to an open-label extension study.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among previously untreated adults with Gaucher disease type 1, treatment with eliglustat compared with placebo for 9 months resulted in significant improvements in spleen volume, hemoglobin level, liver volume, and platelet count. The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain, and more definitive conclusions about clinical efficacy and utility will require comparison with the standard treatment of enzyme replacement therapy as well as longer-term follow-up.

### Knowledge and attitudes of Parkinson's disease risk in the gaucher population [^115bgfXU]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2020). Medium credibility.

Individuals with Gaucher disease have an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease as compared to the general population. Though the association is well-known in the scientific community, it is unclear if individuals with Gaucher disease are being counseled on the increased risk. To date, no studies have been performed assessing whether Gaucher disease patients are aware of the increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, it is unknown how and when individuals with Gaucher disease wish to learn of the increased risk. To assess this, an online survey was administered to Gaucher disease patients. We hypothesized that most individuals with Gaucher disease have been informed of the risk, and that they wish to be told of the risk by their health care provider at the time of diagnosis. Study results revealed that of 125 individuals with Gaucher disease, 80% previously knew about the association with Parkinson's disease, 83.7% preferred to find out about the increased risk from a health care provider, and 71.0% wanted to find out at the time of Gaucher disease diagnosis. These results suggest that health care providers should counsel Gaucher disease patients about the increased Parkinson's disease risk, and they should do so at the time of diagnosis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gaucher disease is an inherited autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease that is diagnosed in patients with both reduced activity of acid β‐glucosidase and mutations in the GBA1 gene. 1 Clinically, Gaucher disease is classified into three major forms based upon the absence or presence and rate of progression of neurological manifestations. The most common form in the Western world is Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1). It is distinguished by the lack of early onset central nervous system (CNS) involvement characteristic of the other two traditional clinical forms of neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD). The nGD forms are Gaucher disease type 2 (GD2) and Gaucher disease type 3 (GD3). GD2 is the acute neuronopathic form, which does not have an ethnic predilection and has an early onset CNS involvement, typically manifesting in the first 6 months of life and leading to death by age 2 years, although patients may live up to age 4 years or beyond with supportive medical care. GD3, or the chronic neuronopathic form, has a slightly later onset, CNS symptoms typically manifesting months to years after birth, and has a much slower neurological progression than is seen in GD2. Distinguishing GD2 from GD3 before age 2 years can be challenging in some cases. 2 In non‐European countries such as Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, India, Pakistan and Egypt, GD3 is the predominant form of Gaucher disease. 3, 4, 5 In all three forms of Gaucher disease there is considerable phenotypic‐genotypic heterogeneity rendering it difficult to predict Gaucher type based solely upon genotype, with the exception that the presence of even one p. Asn409Ser allele (previously known as N370S) excludes the diagnosis of nGD.

### Outcomes after 8 years of eliglustat therapy for gaucher disease type 1: final results from the phase 2 trial [^116kmYu5]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

As Gaucher disease requires lifelong therapy, long‐term safety and efficacy of therapies are of paramount importance. We report the final 8‐year outcomes of previously untreated adults with GD1 who completed the open‐label, Phase 2 trial of eliglustat (NCT00358150, Sanofi Genzyme). These data represent the longest eliglustat therapy experience to date. They build on the 1‐year outcomes, in which the primary endpoint of improvement in at least 2 of the 3 main efficacy parameters (spleen volume, hemoglobin level, and platelet count) was met, 10 as well as the 2‐ and 4‐year data showing sustained improvements in hematologic parameters, organ volumes, disease‐related biomarkers, and measures of bone health. 11, 12, 13

### Velaglucerase alfa for the management of type 1 gaucher disease [^111r5jgv]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common lysosomal storage disease, (frequency of 1:40,000 to 1:60,000). Ninety-Five percent of patients have type 1 (nonneuropathic type). Symptomatic patients with type 1 GD are treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to improve disease-induced effects on hemoglobin, platelets, and liver and spleen volume. Currently, several ERTs are available.

Objective

The goal of this article was to review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety data available for the use of a recently approved ERT, velaglucerase alfa, for the treatment of type 1 GD in symptomatic pediatric and adult patients.

Methods

Serial searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for English-language, peer-reviewed, clinical data (using the search term velaglucerase alfa) were completed, with the final search in November 2011. All identified, peer-reviewed published human data were used for this review. Due to minimal peer-reviewed published data, those data reported via clinical trial registries or in the form of published abstracts were included. The manufacturer was contacted and given the opportunity to submit supplemental data for consideration of inclusion by the author.

Results

Velaglucerase alfa is produced through gene activation technology and is identical to wild-type enzyme. As with other ERTs for type 1 GD, velaglucerase alfa targets accumulated glucocerebroside primarily within the lysosome of the macrophages in the affected organs and systems. When administered at doses of 60 U/kg intravenously, velaglucerase alfa follows linear pharmacokinetics and is rapidly eliminated, with a mean (SD) residence time or time for 63% of the dose to be cleared from systemic circulation of 14 (4) minutes. Four trials and early access program data reporting efficacy were identified for this review: 5 peer-reviewed publications, 3 clinical trial registry reports, and 1 abstract-only publication. Phase I/II data with an extension phase (n = 12) showed significant improvements (all, P < 0.004) in hemoglobin concentrations (21.7%), platelet counts (157.8%), and hepatic (-42.8%) and spleen (-79.3%) volumes at 48 months. Bone mineral density data reported out to 69 months for this extension population noted significant improvements in z score slope for both lumbar spine (0.14 z score unit per year; P < 0.01) and femoral head (0.08 z score unit per year; P < 0.01). Benchmarking of 7 patients with complete clinical datasets at 57 months identified achievement and maintenance of therapeutic goals set by the International Collaborative Gaucher Group for anemia, platelet counts, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone mineral density. Thirty-eight patients enrolled in an open-label, therapy-switch trial who received velaglucerase alfa at doses consistent with current doses of imiglucerase maintained hemoglobin (-0.101 g/dL [95% CI, -0.272 to 0.07]) and platelet counts (7.04% [95% CI, 0.54% to 13.53%]) at 53 weeks after therapy change. Phase III data evaluating 2 dosing regimens of velaglucerase alfa 60 and 45 U/kg intravenously every other week reported significant improvements in most measured clinical parameters at 12 months: hemoglobin concentrations (60 U/kg, 2.429 [0.324] g/dL [P < 0.0001]; 45 U/kg, 2.438 g/dL [95% CI, 1.488 to 3.389]), platelet counts (60 U/kg, 50.88 × 10(9)/L [95% CI, 23.97 to 77.78]; 45 U/kg, 40.92 × 10(9)/L [95% CI, 11.2 to 70.64]), spleen volumes (60 U/kg, -1.92% of body weight [95% CI, -3.04 to -0.79]; 45 U/kg, -1.87% of body weight [95% CI, -3.17 to -0.57]), and hepatic volumes (60 U/kg, -0.84% of body weight [95% CI, -1.58 to -0.11]). A subanalysis of the pediatric population showed clinical improvements at 12 months in both dosing groups: hemoglobin concentrations (60 U/kg, 1.74 g/dL [95% CI, 0.72 to 2.78]; 45 U/kg, 2.77 g/dL [95% CI, -0.99 to 6.53]), platelet counts (60 U/kg, 49.9 × 10(9)/L [95% CI, -32.1 to 131.9]; 45 U/kg, 60.3 × 10(9)/L [95% CI, -103.1 to 223.7]), spleen volumes (60 U/kg, -2.1 cm(3) [95% CI, -5.3 to 1.1]; 45 U/kg, -0.7 cm(3) [95% CI, -2.6 to 1.2]), and hepatic volumes (60 U/kg, -0.7 cm(3) [95% CI, -1.4 to 0.0]; 45 U/kg, -0.3 cm(3) [95% CI, -1.7 to 1.1]). Data comparing velaglucerase alfa with imiglucerase identified similar changes in hemoglobin concentrations at 1.624 g/dL and 1.488 g/dL, respectively, after 9 months of therapy. Safety was reported in 3 identified studies and in data reported from the early access program: 3 peer-reviewed publications, 3 studies reported in clinical trial registries, and 1 abstract publication. Patients experienced a minimal number of adverse effects, and most reactions were mild to moderate in severity; 1 patient developed an anaphylactoid reaction and was discontinued from the trial. Antibody formation has been described with velaglucerase alfa but when compared with that of imiglucerase, seroconversion is less frequent (1% and 23%, respectively). Dosing regimens, from 30 to 60 U/kg intravenously every other week, have been assessed. Currently, the manufacturer recommends 60 U/kg intravenously every other week; however, further studies and evaluation of current study dosing regimens are needed to determine if there is a lower effective dose.

Conclusions

Although a minimal amount of data are available for this relatively new biological agent, velaglucerase alfa reportedly is effective in the achievement and maintenance of therapeutic goals in type 1 GD in both treatment-naive and patients previously treated with imiglucerase. This agent has been reasonably well tolerated in clinical trials and may be considered for use in symptomatic patients with type 1 GD.

### The outcome of clinical parameters in adults with severe type I gaucher disease using very low dose enzyme replacement therapy [^111MHdH5]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Enzyme replacement therapy is now well established as the treatment of choice in Type I Gaucher disease. Historically higher dosage regimens have been used in preference to lower doses despite the little clinical evidence in the way of large controlled clinical trials to support this. Moreover, the extraordinary cost of therapy means that not all eligible patients are able to be treated at the higher dose. Twelve type I adult patients with relatively severe disease were commenced on a very low dose of 7.5U of alglucerase/imiglucerase per kg every two weeks (initially given thrice weekly and later weekly). Follow-up 5 year data reveal a good visceral and haematological response with outcomes consistent with recently published treatment guidelines. Satisfactory clinical and radiological skeletal improvement was also demonstrated in most patients. Three patients had an inadequate overall skeletal response to therapy. Biomarkers also steadily improved although perhaps not quite at the same rate as that seen in higher doses. Very low dose enzyme replacement therapy may be appropriate for adult type I Gaucher patients with mild-moderate skeletal disease.

The ICGG Gaucher Registry was launched in 1991 to track clinical, demographic, genetic, biochemical, and therapeutic characteristics of patients with GD throughout the world, irrespective of disease severity, treatment status, or treatment choice (Charrow et al.). Governance and scientific direction is provided by an international group of physician experts in GD, with operational support from Genzyme, a Sanofi company (Cambridge, MA, USA). With Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee approvals and after obtaining informed patient consent, physicians from 62 countries voluntarily submitted deidentified data on more than 6,000 patients, capturing 54,000 patient years of follow-up.

### Effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy in 1028 patients with type 1 gaucher disease after 2 to 5 years of treatment: a report from the gaucher registry [^114STnj4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Gaucher disease is the first lysosomal storage disorder to be treated with macrophage-targeted enzyme replacement therapy. Previous studies in relatively small numbers of patients demonstrated short-term efficacy of this treatment. This study describes the effects of 2 to 5 years of treatment on specific manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease.

Subjects and Methods

Physicians reported data from 1028 patients to the Gaucher Registry. Assessment of response included serial measurements of hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, liver and spleen volumes, and the occurrence of bone pain and bone crises.

Results

Among anemic patients, hemoglobin concentration increased to normal or near normal within 6 to 12 months, with a sustained response through 5 years. In thrombocytopenic patients with intact spleens, the most rapid response occurred during the first 2 years, with slower improvement thereafter. The likelihood of achieving a normal platelet count decreased with increasing severity of baseline thrombocytopenia. In patients who had undergone splenectomy, platelet counts returned to normal within 6 to 12 months. Hepatomegaly decreased by 30% to 40% during follow-up; splenomegaly decreased 50% to 60%, but rarely to volumes below five times normal size. In patients with pretreatment bone pain or bone crises, 52% (67/128) were pain free after 2 years and 94% (48/51) reported no additional crises.

Conclusion

Enzyme replacement therapy prevents progressive manifestations of Gaucher disease, and ameliorates Gaucher disease-associated anemia, thrombocytopenia, organomegaly, bone pain, and bone crises.

### Recommendations for the management of the haematological and onco-haematological aspects of gaucher disease [^113VfwPd]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Non-neuronopathic (type 1) disease is the most common form of Gaucher disease, a rare condition characterized by an autosomal recessive inherited deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (E 3.2.1.45). Common disease manifestations include hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and bleeding, anaemia and skeletal disease. Untreated, symptomatic patients may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from haematological and skeletal complications, liver failure, severe pulmonary disease and infection. Patients endure reduced quality of life and reduced lifespan compared with healthy controls.

Early clinically significant symptoms often reflect the haematological manifestations of disease such as, unexplained fatigue due to anaemia, frequent gum or nosebleeds as a result of thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction, and abdominal distension and pain from splenomegaly. Consequently, haematologists are often involved in the initial diagnosis, assessment and on-going medical care of Gaucher patients.

The course of type 1 Gaucher disease is highly variable. There are marked differences between individuals in the age of onset of clinical symptoms, clinical expression, rates of disease progression and life expectancy. Clinical phenotype cannot be accurately predicted from genotype although early onset is generally associated with more rapidly progressive and severe disease. Gaucher disease may be associated with a variety of co-morbidities including malignant disease, particularly multiple myeloma.

Enzyme replacement therapy (imiglucerase [Cerezyme®]; Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA) reverses or ameliorates many of the systemic manifestations of Gaucher disease, prevents disease progression and complications, and is considered the gold standard treatment for Gaucher type 1 and type 3 patients. Substrate reduction therapy (miglustat, [Zavesca®]; Actelion Pharmaceuticals, Allschwill, Switzerland) has also been licensed for type 1 Gaucher disease and may be used in adult patients with mild to moderate disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option.

The heterogeneity of type 1 Gaucher disease demands an individualized approach to treatment and disease management to ensure optimal outcomes. Comprehensive therapeutic goals and monitoring guidelines were agreed in 2004. They form the basis for an evidence-based disease management approach that enables patient-focused treatment aimed at preventing or reducing the risk of long-term disease complications. This study reviews the current knowledge of the haematological aspects of Gaucher disease with the purpose of identifying best clinical practice in the treatment and monitoring of haematological and onco-haematological complications in Gaucher patients.

### Outcomes after 18 months of eliglustat therapy in treatment-naïve adults with gaucher disease type 1: the phase 3 ENGAGE trial [^114oZDBJ]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, the open‐label extension period in the ENGAGE randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trial affirmed the efficacy of treatment and clearly demonstrated incremental reversal of visceral, hematologic and skeletal indicators, and pathophysiology of Gaucher disease. After switching from placebo to eliglustat treatment, patients experienced progressive improvement in visceral, hematologic, bone, and biomarker indicators of disease activity over 9 months similar in rate and magnitude to those initially treated with eliglustat. For patients continuing on eliglustat for 18 months, these same disease measures continued to improve, and no new safety concerns were identified with longer‐term exposure to eliglustat. Future analysis will examine the effects of 4–5 years of eliglustat therapy in the ENGAGE trial.

1 INTRODUCTION

In Gaucher disease, biallelic mutations in the GBA1 gene lead to defective acid β‐glucosidase and lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine with immediate and downstream metabolic consequences. This metabolic defect underlies a multisystemic phenotype involving myeloid cells, most conspicuously seen as the lipid‐engorged macrophages (i.e. Gaucher cells) and other cells, including neurons and mesenchymal‐derived cells. The accumulating glycosphingolipids trigger immune activation involving myeloid cells, lymphocytes and possible complement activation that causes increased activity of glucosylceramide synthase, an effect that further amplifies the metabolic defect. Life‐long intravenous infusions of macrophage‐targeted enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) ameliorate hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, some aspects of bone disease, and growth failure (in children) in type 1, non‐neuronopathic Gaucher disease.

### Histologically atypical case of gaucher disease type 1 [^116oBxgP]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

This report presents a case of childhood Gaucher disease type 1, a rare inherited metabolic disorder. Although the clinical symptoms were classical, the histological findings in this case were atypical and initially led to diagnostic uncertainty. The pathognomonic histological finding on bone marrow is Gaucher cells, which are lipid-engorged phagocytes secondary to the accumulation of glucosylceramide. These cells typically demonstrate diffuse and avid iron staining using a Prussian blue iron stain. In this case, although the histiocytes seen on bone marrow were abnormal, the absence of iron staining on bone marrow led to a large range of other diagnoses being considered. In retrospect, this anomaly was likely in the setting of prolonged iron deficiency and anaemia as a result of the insidious nature of this presentation. The prognosis of type 1 Gaucher disease is favourable, with current treatments significantly improving duration and quality of life. We explore the utility of a collaborative multidisciplinary approach in addressing diagnostic uncertainty and the importance in making a diagnosis for Gaucher disease type 1 in order to provide appropriate and targeted treatment.

### Elevated plasma glucosylsphingosine in gaucher disease: relation to phenotype, storage cell markers, and therapeutic response [^114Ni16L]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease, caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, leads to prominent glucosylceramide accumulation in lysosomes of tissue macrophages (Gaucher cells). Here we show glucosylsphingosine, the deacylated form of glucosylceramide, to be markedly increased in plasma of symptomatic nonneuronopathic (type 1) Gaucher patients (n = 64, median = 230.7 nM, range 15.6–1035.2 nM; normal (n = 28): median 1.3 nM, range 0.8–2.7 nM). The method developed for mass spectrometric quantification of plasma glucosylsphingosine is sensitive and robust. Plasma glucosylsphingosine levels correlate with established plasma markers of Gaucher cells, chitotriosidase (ρ = 0.66) and CCL18 (ρ = 0.40). Treatment of Gaucher disease patients by supplementing macrophages with mannose-receptor targeted recombinant glucocerebrosidase results in glucosylsphingosine reduction, similar to protein markers of Gaucher cells. Since macrophages prominently accumulate the lysoglycosphingolipid on glucocerebrosidase inactivation, Gaucher cells seem a major source of the elevated plasma glucosylsphingosine. Our findings show that plasma glucosylsphingosine can qualify as a biomarker for type 1 Gaucher disease, but that further investigations are warranted regarding its relationship with clinical manifestations of Gaucher disease.

### Attitudes of individuals with gaucher disease toward substrate reduction therapies [^115U9MtD]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2018). Low credibility.

The availability of SRTs for patients with GD is the first example of an oral therapy utilized to treat a lysosomal storage disease traditionally managed with intravenous enzyme replacement. Additionally, emergence of SRTs represents the first time patients with GD have been able to exercise considerable choice regarding the type and delivery method of their therapy. As such, little is known about how individuals with GD view SRTs as a treatment option or what benefits or disadvantages patients may perceive surrounding these therapies. We sought to capture reasons why individuals with GD chose or declined use of SRTs, in order to add to existing knowledge about available treatment options for GD.

Furthermore, while efficacy of treating symptoms and disease progression is of great importance when evaluating a potential therapy, how a therapy affects an individual's overall perception of their health and quality of life is also crucial to investigate. Because SRTs are oral therapies, they may impact patients differently, while providing similar symptom relief or management of GD. Therefore, patients with GD using SRTs may identify aspects of their health and quality of life that differ from when using ERTs in the past. Understanding potential differences in perceived patient quality of life, as well as the various reasons individuals may prefer or refuse use of SRTs for GD, is important for healthcare providers so they can appropriately care for and counsel patients with GD about the benefits and limitations associated with various treatment options. In order to accomplish the goals of the current study, we analyzed survey responses of individuals with GD that use either treatment method (ERTs or SRTs) regarding their views of SRTs and any differences in perceptions of health between currently using SRTs and when using ERTs in the past.

### 'Non-neuronopathic' gaucher disease reconsidered. prevalence of neurological manifestations in a Dutch cohort of type I gaucher disease patients and a systematic review of the literature [^117AaYVg]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, which is classically divided into three types. Type I Gaucher disease is differentiated from types II and III disease by the absence of nervous system involvement. However, an increasing number of reports has emerged on neurological manifestations in patients with type I Gaucher disease. Whether a strict division in three different phenotypes is still valid has been the subject of debate. The main objective of this study was to provide scientific arguments whether a distinction between type I (non-neuronopathic) and types II and III (neuronopathic) Gaucher disease should be maintained. We investigated retrospectively a large Dutch cohort of type I Gaucher disease patients for the prevalence of neurological manifestations and provide an overview of the literature on this topic. A diagnosis of a neurological disease was made 34 times in 75 patients. Forty-five patients reported at least one neurological symptom during the median follow-up time of 11 years. The literature search revealed 86 studies in which type I Gaucher disease patients or carriers of a glucocerebrosidase mutation were described with a neurological disease or a condition which is known to be associated with neurological disease. In conclusion, the term non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease does not seem to be an appropriate characterization of type I Gaucher disease. However, the neurological signs and symptoms in type I Gaucher disease are of a totally different kind from and, in the majority of cases, of much less severity than the signs and symptoms associated with types II and III disease Therefore, type I disease should be classified as a separate phenotype.

### Prenatal healthcare providers' gaucher disease carrier screening practices [^115H5Q2d]. Genetics in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Gaucher disease carrier screening is controversial in the medical community. The goal of this study was to explore current Gaucher disease carrier screening practices of prenatal healthcare providers.

Methods

Prenatal healthcare providers were invited by email to complete an electronic-based survey.

Results

A total of 1,454 prenatal healthcare providers, including 209 genetic counselors, 450 midwives, and 795 physicians, completed the study. The majority of genetic counselors (n = 208/209, > 99%), physicians (n = 415/450, 92%), and midwives (n = 634/795, 80%) currently offer Jewish ancestry disease carrier screening to couples in whom one or both partners are Jewish. Of providers who offer Jewish ancestry disease screening, the majority of genetic counselors (n = 199/208, 96%) and physicians (n = 352/415, 85%) always or sometimes offer Gaucher disease screening whereas the majority of midwives (n = 357/634, 56%) never offer Gaucher disease screening.

Conclusion

This study presents the first report of Gaucher disease carrier screening practices of the prenatal healthcare providers in North America. Our results indicate that Gaucher disease carrier screening is being offered at a high rate within the scope of Jewish ancestry-based carrier screening. This may highlight a need to move away from the debate as to whether Gaucher disease carrier screening should be offered and, instead, focus on how best to provide Gaucher disease carrier screening services.

### A randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of imiglucerase (cerezyme) infusions every 4 weeks versus every 2 weeks in the maintenance therapy of adult patients with gaucher disease type 1 [^1172ivSZ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Imiglucerase (Cerezyme) has been the standard of care for treatment of Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, since its approval in 1994. Infusions are typically given once every 2 weeks. However, many patients have expressed a desire for less frequent infusions as a matter of convenience. This clinical study assessed the safety and efficacy of intravenous imiglucerase infused once every 4 weeks (Q4) compared to once every 2 weeks (Q2) at the same total monthly dose in adult patients with clinically stable Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1). This was a 24-month, open-label, randomized, Phase 4, dose-frequency study conducted in 25 centers worldwide. Patients receiving imiglucerase were randomized to receive their monthly dose biweekly (n = 33) or every 4 weeks (n = 62). Changes from baseline in hemoglobin, platelets, liver and spleen volumes, bone crisis, and bone disease comprised a predefined composite endpoint; achievement or maintenance of established Gaucher disease therapeutic goals comprised a secondary endpoint. Sixty-three percent of Q4- and 81% of Q2-treated patients met the composite endpoint at Month 24; 89% of Q4- and 100% of Q2-treated patients met the therapeutic goals-based endpoint. The frequency of related adverse events was comparable between treatment groups. This study suggests that with comprehensive monitoring, a Q4 imiglucerase infusion regimen may be a safe and effective treatment option for the majority of clinically stable adult patients with GD1 but may not be appropriate for all GD1 patients. Continued monitoring in patients treated with Q4 dosing is required to assess long-term effectiveness.

### Velaglucerase alfa enzyme replacement therapy compared with imiglucerase in patients with gaucher disease [^112Yy4xQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease (GD) has been available since 1991. This study compared the efficacy and safety of velaglucerase alfa with imiglucerase, the previous standard of care. A 9-month, global, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority study compared velaglucerase alfa with imiglucerase (60 U/kg every other week) in treatment-naïve patients aged 3–73 years with anemia and either thrombocytopenia or organomegaly. The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in mean change from baseline to 9 months in hemoglobin concentration. 35 patients were randomized: 34 received study drug (intent-to-treat: 17 per arm), 20 were splenectomized. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The per-protocol population included 15 patients per arm. The mean treatment difference for hemoglobin concentration from baseline to 9 months (velaglucerase alfa minus imiglucerase) was 0.14 and 0.16 g/dL in the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations, respectively. The lower bound of the 97.5% one-sided confidence interval in both populations lay within the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -1.0 g/dL, confirming that velaglucerase alfa is non-inferior to imiglucerase. There were no statistically significant differences in the secondary endpoints. Most adverse events were mild to moderate. No patient receiving velaglucerase alfa developed antibodies to either drug, whereas four patients (23.5%) receiving imiglucerase developed IgG antibodies to imiglucerase, which were cross-reactive with velaglucerase alfa in one patient. This study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of velaglucerase alfa compared with imiglucerase in adult and pediatric patients with GD clinically characterized as Type 1. Differences in immunogenicity were also observed.

### Eliglustat compared with imiglucerase in patients with Gaucher's disease type 1 stabilised on enzyme replacement therapy: a phase 3, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^1135uMdG]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

The mainstay of treatment for Gaucher's disease type 1 is alternate-week infusion of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We investigated whether patients stable on such treatment would remain so after switching to oral eliglustat, a selective inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase.

Methods

In this phase 3, randomised, multinational, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled adults (aged ≥ 18 years) who had received ERT for 3 years or more for Gaucher's disease. Patients were randomly allocated 2:1 at 39 clinics (stratified by ERT dose; block sizes of four; computer-generated centrally) to receive either oral eliglustat or imiglucerase infusions for 12 months. Participants and investigators were aware of treatment assignment, but the central reader who assessed organ volumes was masked. The composite primary efficacy endpoint was percentage of patients whose haematological variables and organ volumes remained stable for 12 months (ie, haemoglobin decrease not more than 15 g/L, platelet count decrease not more than 25%, spleen volume increase not more than 25%, and liver volume increase not more than 20%, in multiples of normal from baseline). The non-inferiority margin was 25% for eliglustat relative to imiglucerase, assessed in all patients who completed 12 months of treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00943111, and EudraCT, number 2008–005223–28.

Findings

Between Sept 15, 2009, and Nov 9, 2011, we randomly allocated 106 (66%) patients to eliglustat and 54 (34%) to imiglucerase. In the per-protocol population, 84 (85%) of 99 patients who completed eliglustat treatment and 44 (94%) of 47 patients who completed imiglucerase treatment met the composite primary endpoint (between-group difference -8.8%; 95% CI -17.6 to 4.2). The lower bound of the 95% CI of -17.6% was within the prespecified threshold for non-inferiority. Dropouts occurred due to palpitations (one patient on eliglustat), myocardial infarction (one patient on eliglustat), and psychotic disorder (one patient on imiglucerase). No deaths occurred. 97 (92%) of 106 patients in the eliglustat group had treatment-emergent adverse events, as did 42 (79%) of 53 in the imiglucerase group (mostly mild or moderate in severity).

Interpretation

Oral eliglustat maintained haematological and organ volume stability in adults with Gaucher's disease type 1 already controlled by intravenous ERT and could be a useful therapeutic option.

Funding

Genzyme, a Sanofi company.

### Clinical outcomes after 4.5 years of eliglustat therapy for gaucher disease type 1: phase 3 ENGAGE trial final results [^112MpC4S]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Treatment with eliglustat for up to 4.5 years in previously untreated adults with Gaucher disease type 1 in the Phase 3 ENGAGE trial resulted in continued improvement of hematologic, visceral and bone manifestations with commensurate reduction of bioactive lipids and other inflammatory biomarkers. These results are consistent with results observed after 4 years and 8 years of eliglustat treatment in the Phase 2 trial of previously untreated patients. Those with the greatest baseline burden of disease (i.e. lowest platelet count and hemoglobin concentrations and highest spleen and liver volumes) experienced the largest improvements (Table S1). Moreover, the favorable safety and tolerability profile of eliglustat in this trial is consistent with what has been reported among treatment‐naïve patients during 8 years in the Phase 2 trial, ERT switch patients during 4 years in the Phase 3 ENCORE trial, and mostly ERT switch patients in the Phase 3 EDGE trial of once‐daily versus twice‐daily eliglustat dosing. Collectively, these trials represent a total of 1400 patient‐years of eliglustat exposure.

### Splenic lymphoma arising in a patient with gaucher disease. A case report and review of the literature [^114VEkVP]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with Gaucher disease have an increased risk of malignancies, especially the lymphoreticular type. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Gaucher disease diagnosed during the workup and diagnosis of a splenic marginal-zone lymphoma with progression to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. There are several theories as to how Gaucher disease leads to malignancies. The accumulated glucocerebroside in the reticuloendothelial organs, histologically visible as Gaucher cells, is thought to provide chronic antigenic stimulus to the immune system. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia develops, and monoclonal populations of lymphocytes and plasma cells may arise from this premalignant proliferative state. How Gaucher disease is related to nonlymphoid malignancies remains unclear.

### Cancer risk and gammopathies in 2123 adults with gaucher disease type 1 in the international gaucher group gaucher registry [^115YzvMf]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

We conducted a study in a large, multicenter, international sample from the International Cooperative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry (NCT00358943, Sanofi‐funded) for comprehensive delineation of the relative risk of hematological and solid organ malignancies and the relationship between gammopathies and multiple myeloma (MM). The ICGG Gaucher Registry is a global, observational, voluntary program for patients with GD created in 1991 which has tracked the natural history and outcomes of GD patients for over 30 years regardless of treatment status. In 2017, the ICGG Gaucher Registry team began a focused retrospective and prospective collection of gammopathy‐ and malignancy‐related data. We investigate the relative risk for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors among GD1 patients compared to a representative general population as well as the incidence of polyclonal gammopathies and monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS), and the frequency with which GD1 patients with MGUS progress to MM.

ACMG technical standard — biomarker testing for lysosomal diseases (LD) states that measurement of LD biomarkers can reveal valuable information about disease status and that clinical biomarker testing is performed to guide patient management, including monitoring disease progression and initiating treatment, and in diagnostic evaluations of either symptomatic patients or asymptomatic individuals with a positive family history or abnormal newborn screen. It notes that biomarker analysis can be performed through independent analysis of a single analyte or as a multiplex assay measuring analytes for more than one disorder utilizing liquid chromatographic separation and tandem mass spectrometric detection, and explains that these guidelines were developed to provide technical standards for biomarker analysis, results interpretation, and results reporting, highlighting Fabry, Gaucher, Krabbe, and Pompe disease as examples.

### Dose-response relationships for enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase / alglucerase in patients with gaucher disease type 1 [^111koFvC]. Genetics in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether enzyme therapy with imiglucerase/alglucerase demonstrates dose-response relationships with doses and disease parameters used in routine clinical practice for Gaucher disease type 1 patients.

Methods

Analyses included all patients with Gaucher disease type 1 on enzyme therapy and with intact spleens in the large observational database of the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry. Propensity scoring was used to match patients between enzyme therapy dose groups categorized as Group A (5 U to < 29 U/kg/2 weeks), Group B (29 U to < 48 U/kg/2 weeks), Group C (48 U to < 75 U/kg/2 weeks). Hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and hepatic and splenic volumes were assessed after initiation of enzyme therapy using nonlinear mixed effects models. The maximal effect (Emax) and half-time to Emax (T50) of enzyme therapy for each parameter were compared across dosing groups.

Results

Propensity score matching resulted in three comparable groups of 122 patients each (enzyme therapy in Groups A, B, and C). Dose-response relationships were found with regard to Emax and T50 over 96 months for each disease parameter.

Conclusions

Enzyme therapy with imiglucerase/alglucerase displays a dose-dependent improvement in hematological and visceral parameters in Gaucher disease type 1 patients. Group C displayed greater treatment effects than Groups A or B. Propensity score matching and nonlinear mixed effects model analyses provide a prototype for assessment of treatment outcomes based on observational data from international rare disease registries.

### Velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV) enzyme replacement therapy in patients with gaucher disease: long-term data from phase III clinical trials [^114FG3ZT]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in GBA, which encodes a hydrolytic, lysosomal enzyme (glucosylceramidase). When this enzyme is deficient, the major natural glucocerebroside substrates of the enzyme accumulate in cells, notably macrophages, which are most responsible for the visceral pathophysiology in type 1 GD. Type 1 GD can present at variable ages with thrombocytopenia, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow infiltration, and various focal and generalized bone abnormalities, and additionally in children, with growth failure.

Current GD-specific treatment, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy, is beneficial but not curative, and so patients usually have regular continual dosing. Valuable research into disease outcomes, with and without treatment, has been conducted through GD registries. There is, however, also a need for clinical trial evidence for long-term drug efficacy and safety, and this should include data in pediatric patients.

Velaglucerase alfa is available as an ERT for type 1 GD. Two randomized, parallel-group phase III trials of velaglucerase alfa were conducted between 2007 and 2009 in treatment-naïve patients, including children: study identifiers TKT032 (a parallel assessment of two doses) and HGT-GCB-039 (a noninferiority study comparing velaglucerase alfa with imiglucerase). No patient discontinued from these studies because of an adverse event (AE), and improvements in hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, spleen volume, liver volume, biomarkers, and bone mineral density (BMD) were observed. Patients who completed the initial trials were enrolled in an open-label, phase III extension study for up to 5 years of follow-up, to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of velaglucerase alfa.

### Phenotypic continuum of type 2 Gaucher's disease: an intermediate phenotype between perinatal-lethal and classic type 2 Gaucher's disease [^111aPxbr]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

The natural history and clinical presentation of the perinatal-lethal Gaucher's disease, a severe variant of acute type 2 Gaucher's disease, is quite different from classic type 2 Gaucher's disease. Rare reported patients had an overlapping phenotype between these two forms confirming that phenotyping may be difficult. Here we report three patients with an intermediate phenotype. The first two patients showed at birth cholestatic jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and hematological involvement consistent with hemophagocytosis in one patient, the death occurred from a severe liver involvement in one and lung disease in the second in the absence of neurological symptoms. The third patient displayed ichthyosis and facial dysmorphism but with neurological degeneration course and survival consistent with classic type 2 Gaucher's disease.

### Outcomes after 18 months of eliglustat therapy in treatment-naïve adults with gaucher disease type 1: the phase 3 ENGAGE trial [^116wPURa]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by GBA mutations and defective acid‐β‐glucosidase. 1 The metabolic defect results in progressive accumulation of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine in lysosomes, most conspicuously in the cells of macrophage/monocyte lineage. The accumulating lipids trigger metabolic inflammation and immune activation that is associated with increased synthesis of glucosylceramide via induction of glucosylceramide synthase, thus amplifying the primary metabolic defect 2, 3; hence, the typical phenotypic features of hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, and disabling skeletal complications. 1 Two treatment approaches have been used to lower pathological glucosylceramide accumulation in Gaucher disease. For the past two decades, the standard of care for GD1 has been enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with biweekly infusions of macrophage‐targeted recombinant acid β‐glucosidase, which supplements enzyme activity in the macrophage system. 4 Substrate reduction therapy is predicated on partial inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase to decrease synthesis of glucosylceramide to balance residual activity of mutant acid β‐glucosidase. 4

Eliglustat (Cerdelga, Sanofi Genzyme, Cambridge, Massachusetts) is an oral substrate reduction therapy approved as a first‐line treatment for adults with GD1 whose predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer status, as detected by an FDA‐cleared test, is poor, intermediate, or extensive 5 (> 90% of patients 6). The Phase 3 ENGAGE trial (NCT00891202), the first placebo‐controlled trial ever conducted in Gaucher disease, demonstrated significant reductions in spleen and liver volumes and increases in hemoglobin concentration and platelet count after 9 months of treatment in eliglustat‐treated GD1 patients, while placebo‐treated patients demonstrated slight worsening of these indicators of disease activity. 7 On completing the 9‐month primary analysis period, all patients had the opportunity to continue in the open‐label ENGAGE trial extension, in which all patients received eliglustat. We report the 18‐month outcomes of the patients who entered the trial extension.

### Demographics and patient characteristics of 1209 patients with gaucher disease: descriptive analysis from the gaucher outcome survey (GOS) [^115yJxTm]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

The Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS) is an international Gaucher disease (GD) registry established in 2010 for patients with a confirmed GD diagnosis, regardless of GD type or treatment status, designed to evaluate the safety and long-term effectiveness of velaglucerase alfa and other GD-related treatments. As of February 25, 2017, 1209 patients had enrolled, the majority from Israel (44.3%) and the US (31.4%). Median age at GOS entry was 40.4 years, 44.1% were male, and 13.3% had undergone a total splenectomy. Most patients had type 1 GD (91.5%) and were of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity (55.8%). N370S/N370S was the most prevalent genotype, accounting for 44.2% of genotype-confirmed individuals (n = 847); however, there was considerable variation between countries. A total of 887 (73.4%) patients had received ≥ 1 GD-specific treatment at any time, most commonly imiglucerase (n = 587), velaglucerase alfa (n = 507), and alglucerase (n = 102). Hematological and visceral findings at the time of GOS entry were close to normal for most patients, probably a result of previous treatment; however, spleen volume of patients in Israel was almost double that of patients elsewhere (7.2 multiples of normal [MN] vs. 2.7, 2.9 and 4.9 MN in the US, UK and rest of world), which may be explained by a greater disease severity in this cohort. This analysis aimed to provide an overview of GOS and present baseline demographic and disease characteristics of participating patients to help improve the understanding of the natural history of GD and inform the overall management of patients with the disease.

### Plasma glucosylsphingosine correlations with baseline disease burden and response to eliglustat in two clinical trials of previously untreated adults with gaucher disease type 1 [^112asWLw]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1), accumulation of the lipid substrates glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine (lyso-GL-1 or lyso-Gb1), primarily in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, leads to progressive hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and skeletal disease. Plasma glucosylceramide elevations are modest, variable, and normalize within weeks of starting treatment before clinical changes are evident, and therefore, have limited value for monitoring treatment responses. Serum chitotriosidase activity, a widely used GD biomarker, is also elevated in many other conditions but is not measurable in 5–10% of individuals due to a common CHIT1 null variant. Plasma glucosylsphingosine is increasingly recognized as a useful biomarker for GD1: elevations are highly specific to the disease and show no overlap with normal controls, it is in the causal pathway of disease, and levels are reliably measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We report correlations of plasma glucosylsphingosine with baseline disease burden and eliglustat treatment response in previously untreated adults with GD1 in the Phase 2 (NCT00358150), open-label, single-arm trial of 26 patients with up to 8 years of follow-up and the placebo-controlled Phase 3 ENGAGE trial (NCT00891202) of 40 patients with up to 4.5 years of follow-up. At baseline, untreated patients showed moderate to strong correlations between plasma glucosylsphingosine and spleen volume, liver volume, and hemoglobin level. Organ volumes and hematologic parameters improved in parallel with reductions in plasma glucosylsphingosine during eliglustat treatment in both trials. Moderate correlations were seen between plasma glucosylsphingosine reduction and spleen and liver volume reductions during eliglustat treatment. These clinical trial data add to the growing body of evidence supporting plasma glucosylsphingosine as both a diagnostic and pharmacodynamic/response biomarker for GD1.

Epidemiology, clinical evaluation, and treatment

While Gaucher disease is relatively uncommon overall with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1/40,000, certain groups have much higher carrier and disease prevalence with a carrier frequency of as high as 6–10% in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. The majority of type 1 Gaucher disease patients are diagnosed during childhood, and type 1 Gaucher disease is most commonly due to biallelic p. N370S mutations in the Western world.

Detailed description of the diagnostic workup and clinical management of Gaucher disease is beyond the scope of this article, but it is helpful for radiologists evaluating patients with Gaucher disease to be familiar with commonly utilized clinical tests and available therapies. Laboratory tests and biomarkers are summarized in Table 2; these clinical tests are part of comprehensive patient assessment that also involves diagnostic imaging. Clinical severity scoring is often performed using the Gaucher Disease Type 1 Severity Scoring System (GD-DS3), which incorporates bone involvement, hematologic parameters, and organ enlargement. The Pediatric Gaucher Severity Scoring System (PGS3) additionally accounts for growth disturbance as a key consideration in the younger population.

Table 2
Laboratory investigations in Gaucher disease

Traditionally, Gaucher disease has been conceptualized as a single gene-related disease due to one enzyme with one treatment consisting of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Prior to the advent of ERT, treatment was largely based on addressing symptoms with splenectomy performed for extensive splenic infiltration in severe patients with poor prognosis. The earliest effective ERT, alglucerase, was introduced in the 1990s and has dramatically changed the prognosis of this condition. Subsequent newer forms of ERT with improved manufacturing techniques and safety profiles have been approved. Newer oral substrate reduction therapy (SRT) functions earlier in the biochemical pathway by mitigating the accumulation of glucosylceramide. Both types of therapies are expensive, and each have disadvantages to consider with ERT requiring intravenous infusion every few weeks and SRT possessing a narrower safety profile with CYP2D6 and CYP3A metabolism considerations as well as being only approved for adult use. Historic and currently available treatment options are summarized in Table 3, but we refer interested readers elsewhere for detailed description of clinical trials and advances in Gaucher disease treatment.

### Seven-year safety and efficacy with velaglucerase alfa for treatment-naïve adult patients with type 1 gaucher disease [^117PJ7hJ]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In Guide to Drug Development, Bert Spilker writes, "One of the most important clinical principles is that good data in a few patients are far better than mediocre or poor data in many patients" 16. This is particularly relevant to orphan drug development where few patients are available for well‐designed and well‐controlled trials.

Phase I and early phase II studies, in contrast with phase III trials, are often smaller, time‐limited, single‐arm trials that focus on safety and therapeutic potential. The velaglucerase alfa phase I/II and extension trials offer multiple unique features beyond the 9‐month assessment of safety and efficacy of velaglucerase alfa for GD1. Importantly, the full extension resulted in a 7‐year follow‐up under clinical trial conditions and thus unique features that could be documented include: the implementation of therapeutic goals 10 as the criteria for therapeutic dosing decisions such that dose reduction at 15 to 18 months related to achievement of therapeutic goals; the option for home therapy of an intravenous investigational drug (under medical supervision) within the constraints of a clinical trial; and the inclusion of two different bone disease parameters, BMD and BMB scoring 8, 9, as exploratory efficacy endpoints.

The importance of this report is the quality and quantity of the safety and efficacy results from the seminal trial and the extension trial, and the importance of a dose reduction at 15 to 18 months of cumulative exposure to velaglucerase alfa that did not result in diminution of response: this too was an important feature because it underscores the unimpeded safety while documenting the continuous trajectory for amelioration of disease‐specific parameters.

In presenting the completer data i.e. without imputing values and without carrying forth the last observation in the four patients who withdrew before the end of the extension trial, there is further evidence of the robustness of the response over time. In other words, the completer data was approximately comparable to that of the entire ITT cohort and as such, no individual withdrawal or single completer was the driver for the ultimate group values on any of the continua measured.

### Velaglucerase alfa (Vpriv) [^115WKKNd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1	Overview of Clinical Studies of VPRIV for Gaucher Disease

The efficacy of VPRIV was assessed in three clinical trials in a total of 99 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease: 82 patients age 4 years and older received VPRIV and 17 patients age 3 years and older received imiglucerase. Studies I and II were conducted in patients who were not currently receiving Gaucher disease-specific therapy. Study III was conducted in patients who were receiving imiglucerase treatment immediately before starting VPRIV. The long-term safety of VPRIV was assessed in Study IV, an open-label extension trial in a total of 93 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease ages 3 years and older. Patients who had completed Studies I to III were eligible to participate in Study IV. In Studies I through IV, VPRIV was administered intravenously over 60 minutes at a maximum dose of 60 Units/kg every other week. Doses above 60 Units/kg were not studied in these trials.

14.2	Clinical Trials of VPRIV as Initial Therapy

Study I was a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel-dose-group, multinational trial in 25 patients age 4 years and older with Gaucher disease-related anemia and either thrombocytopenia or organomegaly. Patients were not allowed to have had disease-specific therapy for at least the previous 30 months; all but one had no prior therapy. The mean age was 26 years and 60% were male. Patients were randomized to receive VPRIV at a dose of either 45 Units/kg (N = 13) or 60 Units/kg (N = 12) every other week. The recommended starting dose in naïve patients is 60 Units/kg. The 45 Units/kg dosage is not recommended as a starting dose in naïve patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

At baseline, mean hemoglobin concentration was 10.6 g/dL, mean platelet count was 97 × 109/L, mean liver volume was 3.6% of body weight (% BW), and mean spleen volume was 2.9% BW.

For all studies, liver and spleen volumes were measured by MRI. The changes in clinical parameters after 12 months of treatment are shown in Table 2. The observed change from baseline in the primary endpoint, hemoglobin concentration, was considered to be clinically meaningful in the 60 Units/kg dose, in light of the natural history of untreated Gaucher disease.

1 INTRODUCTION

In Gaucher disease (GD) biallelic mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene result in defective lysosomal acid β‐glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase, EC 3.2.1.21) that causes widespread accumulation of macrophages engorged with glucosylceramide‐laden lysosomes and system‐wide pathophysiology mediated by accumulating sphingolipids. 1 The clinical effects are multisystemic with heterogeneous manifestations and natural history. 2, 3 Symptomatic presentation of GD can occur at any age with variable combinations of cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, diverse patterns of skeletal disease, and growth retardation, and in the most severe cases, neurodegenerative disease. The vast majority of cases are patients with GD type 1 (GD1) who lack the early‐onset neurological disease that characterizes type 2 and type 3 disease. 3

### Clinical outcomes after 4.5 years of eliglustat therapy for gaucher disease type 1: phase 3 ENGAGE trial final results [^111zDTQf]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Gaucher disease pathophysiology, beyond deficiency of acid β‐glucosidase and lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide, is complex involving alternative metabolism of substrate via acid ceramidase that generates glucosylsphingosine and system‐wide involvement beyond the macrophage. The suite of biomarkers evaluated in ENGAGE was designed to capture this multidimensional pathophysiology that underlies disease manifestations. First, the baseline elevated plasma levels of primary and secondary substrates (glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine) were strikingly reduced with eliglustat treatment. Concomitantly, eliglustat resulted in dramatic reduction of chitotriosidase, a marker of the burden of alternatively activated lipid‐engorged Gaucher macrophages. Moreover, another macrophage biomarker of Gaucher disease, MIP‐1β, which has been associated with skeletal disease, was also reduced with eliglustat treatment. The pattern of biomarker responses in the ENGAGE trial strongly parallels responses in the smaller, Phase 2, open‐label study in more severely affected treatment‐naïve patients. Marked reductions were observed in the first 9 to 18 months of treatment in both studies, with smaller incremental responses out to 4.5 years in ENGAGE and 8 years in the Phase 2 trial.

### Effectiveness and safety of eliglustat treatment in gaucher disease: real-life unicentric experience [^116F4agS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The therapy and management of Gaucher disease (GD) have radically changed with the use of substrate reduction therapy, of which eliglustat is the most widely known drug, allowing it to overcome the limits of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The rarity of GD and the limited use of eliglustat outside clinical trials require further study of its strengths and weaknesses.

Methods

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety of eliglustat in a cohort of 12 patients with GD followed up in our center, reporting a reduction in both chitotriosidase (394.3 vs 181.1 nmol/h/mL, P = 0.027) and glucosylsphingosine values (45.1 vs 18.9 ng/mL, P < 0.001) after at least 12 months of therapy compared with baseline, regardless of patient demographic characteristics and GD characteristics.

Findings

There were no drug-related serious adverse effects and no drug-related cardiac events. Most adverse events were mild and transient, mainly dyspepsia and abdominal pain. Of interest, we reported an absence of statistical difference in terms of response regarding glucosylsphingosine reduction in relation to naive or prior exposure to ERT (P = 0.296), which was confirmed also when patients were placed in naive and treated groups for < 5 vs > 5 years (P = 0.667).

Implications

The use of eliglustat immediately after diagnosis may guarantee the best treatment for patients with milder phenotypes or with aggressive disease after an initial stabilization with ERT compared with ERT, which cannot adequately remove the disease burden despite the apparent response, thus potentially reducing future complications caused by substrate deposits.

### Never-treated, non splenectomised patients with gaucher disease (the French GANT study): the prospective follow-up [^116k2BKq]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment options for Type 1 Gaucher Disease (GD1) include enzyme replacement therapy and oral substrate reduction therapy. The criteria for treatment initiation vary across regions. Recent retrospective studies have highlighted the natural progression of never-treated GD1, suggesting that some patients remain asymptomatic or stable for extended periods. However, there is no data on long-term prospective follow-up. We conducted a prospective study following a cross-sectional analysis of 36 never-treated, non-splenectomised GD1 patients from the French Gaucher Disease Registry (FGDR). The objective was to describe the natural disease progression, tracking clinical, radiological, and biological characteristics over time. Thirty-six non-splenectomised and never-treated patients (19 women and 17 men) diagnosed with Gaucher Disease were prospectively followed for an additional median duration of 6.5 (5–8.3) years. Of the cohort, 17 remained untreated, 10 initiated treatment, and 7 were lost to follow-up. Although never-treated patients tended to be older at the time of first symptoms, diagnosis, and last follow-up compared to those who received treatment, the difference was not significant in this small cohort. At last follow-up, never-treated patients had no worsening of most of their symptoms. No significant changes were observed in platelets, chitotriosidase, and lyso-Gb1. In this prospective cohort, we highlight that patients with mild GD can remain untreated with no disease progression, offering insights into cost-effective management strategies. Identifying such patients is still challenging.

### Gaucher disease… [^1161PTeN]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Gaucher disease is a chronic, progressive, inherited disorder named for the French physician who first described it. It is caused by a deficiency of a specific enzyme called glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme breaks down and recycles certain lipids. In people with Gaucher disease, these lipids, glucocerebrosides, accumulate within cells and interfere with the normal functioning of various organs. The disease is classified into 3 types. In type 1, there is no brain involvement. It is found in adults, accounts for 95% of all cases, and can sometimes have no symptoms. The type 2 condition is uncommon and severe. Brain damage can be extensive. Children usually die by 2 years of age. Type 3 occurs in children and adolescents. It tends to be chronic and slowly progressive and the central nervous system is affected.

It is estimated that approximately 1 in 40 000 to 60 000 persons in the general population has Gaucher disease, or about 10 000 people worldwide. It is the most common disorder in a group of more than 40 diseases classified as lysosomal storage disorders. Grouped together, LSDs affect 1 in every 7700 babies born. The September 19, 2007, issue of JAMA includes an article about genetic screening and treatment for Gaucher disease. Risk factors Gaucher disease may occur among every nationality and ethnic group but it is most common among Ashkenazi Jews. In this particular ethnic group, the incidence is 1 in 450 persons. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of Gaucher disease can vary form the very mild, or even none, to severe. Bone pain or fracture is often the first symptom. Other symptoms may include.

Skeletal abnormalities Hepatomegaly Splenomegaly Anemia Excessive fatigue Bleeding and easy bruising due to thrombocytopenia Mental retardation.

### Eliglustat for splenomegaly in gaucher disease… [^114J5Hva]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00891202 In Gaucher disease type 1, biallelic mutations in GBA result in defective acid β-glucosidase and cause lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, primarily in the monocyte-macrophage cell lineage. 1 Consequently, lipid-laden macrophages infiltrate spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lungs, leading to hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, skeletal disease, chronic bone pain, and growth failure. In an uncontrolled phase 2 trial of 26 untreated adult patients with Gaucher disease type 1, eliglustat reduced glucosylceramide accumulation and ameliorated major disease manifestations. 10–12 We report the results of ENGAGE, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to determine the effect of eliglustat on spleen volume, hemoglobin level, liver volume, and platelet count in untreated patients with Gaucher disease type 1 and splenomegaly.

Eligibility criteria included age 16 years or older, Tanner stage 4 or higher, a diagnosis of Gaucher disease type 1 confirmed by deficient activity of acid β-glucosidase in blood leukocytes and/or GBA mutation analysis, and major clinical manifestations of the disease as defined by hemoglobin level. Baseline demographics and patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. eTable 1 in Supplement 2 summarizes the Gaucher and chitotriosidase genotypes for all patients. The study population included equal numbers of male and female patients, was predominantly white and of non-Jewish descent, and ranged in age from 16 to 63 years. In this cohort with Gaucher disease type 1 and substantial disease manifestations, the slight decrease in clinical status of patients in the placebo group over 9 months underscores the progressive nature of Gaucher disease.

By reducing substrate influx, eliglustat significantly improved disease manifestations in patients with existing visceral and hematologic involvement. The magnitude of the improvements observed suggests that eliglustat alone may have the potential to effectively restore balance in the production and degradation of glucosylceramide without prior reconstitution of the macrophage system with exogenous acid β-glucosidase.

### NCT03240653 | Gaucherite – A study to stratify gaucher disease… [^111Wy3US]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Gaucherite
- A Study to Stratify Gaucher Disease ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Gaucher disease is part of a rare group of genetic metabolic diseases which are caused by an inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. The most common form, Type 1 affects 1 in 40, 000 to 60, 000 individuals in the general population. In Type 1 symptoms may appear at any time from infancy to old age. The disease is associated with anaemia, fatigue, bruising and an increased tendency to bleed. An enlarged spleen and liver with stomach swelling may also occur as well as bone pain, fractures and bone deterioration. Type 1 was formerly considered not to affect the brain or nervous system.

Some patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease have no symptoms, while others develop serious symptoms that can be life threatening; latterly Parkinsonism and Dementia with Lewy bodies has been noted to occur with increased frequency in patients with this variant of Gaucher disease compared with healthy control subjects in an age-matched population. Gaucher disease is not gender-specific and its signs and symptoms may appear in affected individuals at any age, with Type 3 being commonly diagnosed in childhood. Although individuals from any ethnic background may develop Gaucher disease, Type 1 Gaucher disease is most common among Jews of Ashkenazi descent. Among this group, about 1 in 900 people are at risk of Gaucher disease. There are approximately 280 people in England diagnosed with Gaucher Disease, who receive treatment or management at one of the treating hospitals. Patients with Gaucher disease have an increased risk of developing myeloma and Parkinson's disease.

Myeloma, also known as multiple myeloma, is a type of bone marrow cancer affecting the white blood cells of the immune system which generate antibodies. Approximately 1 in 10 Gaucher patients have a specific blood protein
- a monoclonal antibody called a paraprotein, which is found in both malignant and non-malignant conditions, including myeloma. Parkinson disease is a neurological condition which develops over time as specific brain cells that control movement, die. The failure to produce less of a chemical called dopamine, reduces communication between brain cells involved in the coordination of movement, behaviour, learning and memory.
