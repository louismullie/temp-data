## Question

What labs to run

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to run in a given clinical scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify which guideline-based panels map to that context. Next, I will check for condition-specific add-ons and avoid low-yield tests. After that, I need to ensure preanalytic and analytic quality, including specimen handling and assay limitations. Finally, I will consider stewardship, follow-up, and documentation, and I will double-check any exceptions or controversies before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: laboratory testing should be driven by the clinical question, pretest probability, and the likelihood that results will change management or improve outcomes. Otherwise, testing risks harm through false positives, unnecessary procedures, and cost without benefit [^aa53c8a5] [^f2e5f350].

> I will now examine the clinical context categories that commonly drive lab selection: undifferentiated symptoms, targeted organ-system complaints, screening and prevention, medication monitoring, and acute presentations. Hold on, I should verify that these align with how guidelines frame testing, and yes, most high-quality guidance anchors testing to presentation and risk rather than blanket panels [^notfound].

> For undifferentiated symptoms or a new patient, let me consider a core panel that addresses common, high-yield conditions. A reasonable starting set includes CBC, CMP with liver enzymes, renal function, electrolytes, glucose, and TSH, with selective additions such as iron studies, vitamin B12, and inflammatory markers when indicated. Wait, let me verify that this aligns with primary care and specialty guidance, and yes, this mirrors approaches used for fatigue, pruritus, and initial evaluations in multiple settings [^be57786e] [^117ceb0c] [^d438719a].

> For suspected liver disease or abnormal liver tests, I should confirm the recommended first-line panel and escalation. The standard initial evaluation includes bilirubin, ALT, ALP, GGT, albumin, and a full blood count, followed by a structured etiologic screen when abnormalities persist, including hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody with reflex RNA, autoimmune markers, iron studies, and abdominal ultrasound. I need to ensure I note that aminotransferases can be normal despite advanced disease, so I should not falsely reassure based on normal enzymes alone [^74b4a2f6] [^0c8ec408].

> For cardiovascular presentations, I should double-check the role of cardiac biomarkers. Troponin is the primary test for myocardial injury, with BNP or NT-proBNP for heart failure, and CK-MB reserved for specific contexts. Routine lipid profiling is central for risk assessment and management, with LDL-C as the primary analyte. Hold on, I should verify that these are guideline-endorsed, and yes, ESC and EAS guidance support these practices [^a6bc7532].

> For endocrine complaints, let me verify thyroid testing strategy. TSH is the appropriate first-line test for suspected thyroid dysfunction, with free T4 added when TSH is abnormal, and repeating TSH over 3–6 months to confirm persistent abnormalities. I should confirm that adding T3 or antibodies upfront is discouraged unless there is a specific indication, and yes, USPSTF and pediatric guidance emphasize restraint to avoid incidentalomas and cascade testing [^d80df50d] [^cfb7df02].

> For suspected or confirmed HIV, I need to ensure I follow the CDC-recommended diagnostic algorithm. The current approach uses a 4th-generation Ag/Ab assay followed by a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation assay and nucleic acid testing when indicated, which improves detection of acute infection and reduces indeterminate results. I should confirm reporting requirements and public health notification steps as well [^da3678b2] [^5fd7b55d].

> For COVID-19, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about routine labs for diagnosis. Routine laboratory tests have limited standalone diagnostic accuracy and should not be used to diagnose COVID-19; they may reflect general illness severity but cannot reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other causes of inflammation, so molecular testing remains the diagnostic standard while labs support clinical assessment and complications [^4f32bdb1] [^5da999f5].

> For pruritus without rash, I should confirm the recommended initial labs. Guidelines advise CBC, ferritin, liver tests, renal function, TSH, and fasting glucose or HbA1c, with bile acids and antimitochondrial antibodies considered when cholestasis is suspected. Let me verify that this is consistent across dermatology and primary care sources, and yes, it is [^be57786e] [^44e5d8b4].

> For eating disorders, I need to check the baseline laboratory assessment. APA guidance recommends CBC and a comprehensive metabolic panel including electrolytes, liver enzymes, and renal function, recognizing that results may be normal even in serious disease and should be interpreted in clinical context. I should confirm that this applies across subtypes, and yes, it does [^d438719a] [^f409c52a].

> For multiple myeloma suspicion, let me verify the screening and diagnostic panels. Initial workup includes CBC, urea and creatinine, calcium, immunoglobulins with serum protein electrophoresis, and serum free light chains, followed by immunofixation to confirm monoclonal proteins. Tumor burden and prognostic markers include beta-2 microglobulin, LDH, and albumin. I should confirm that these align with BSH/UKMF guidance, and they do [^95f56bd0].

> For Kawasaki disease, I should confirm the laboratory components of diagnosis and monitoring. Recommended tests include CBC, ESR, CRP, liver tests with bilirubin, AST, ALT, albumin, sodium, renal function, and urinalysis, which support diagnosis and detection of complications. Let me verify that this reflects SHARE consensus, and yes, it does [^da75a0a6].

> For medication monitoring, I need to ensure I address high-risk drugs and baseline assessments. For stimulant use disorder care, baseline CBC, CMP including LFTs, and infectious disease screening for HIV, HCV, HBV, and STIs are advised, with CK considered if rhabdomyolysis is suspected. For thiopurines in IBD, TPMT or metabolite testing can be considered, but I should caution against overordering metabolites without a clear question. I should confirm these align with ASAM/AAAP and pediatric IBD guidance, and they do [^f56941af] [^2b6d753a] [^25cd32e7].

> For chronic kidney disease, I should double-check the recommended evaluation. KDIGO advises measuring creatinine and considering cystatin C to estimate GFR, and for albuminuria, prefer urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio with first-morning samples, confirming positives with a repeat first-morning ACR. I need to ensure I note that PCR can be used when albumin is not available, and yes, that is correct [^2954175a] [^cbe080e9].

> For dyslipidemia screening and management, I should confirm that LDL-C is the primary analyte and that fasting lipid profiles are standard, with nonfasting acceptable in many settings. Genetic testing is reserved for suspected familial hypercholesterolemia or severe phenotypes, with counseling and informed consent essential. This aligns with ESC/EAS and the National Lipid Association [^a6bc7532] [^f8dfe732].

> Now, I need to ensure preanalytic and analytic quality steps are not overlooked. Proper patient identification, specimen type, timing, and handling matter, and for certain tests like COVID-19 PCR, respiratory specimen selection and timing critically affect sensitivity. For send-out tests, order accuracy is frequently suboptimal, so I should double-check test names and codes. For thyroid testing, assay interference and lack of standardization can mislead, so discordant results warrant clinical correlation and, if needed, alternative methods [^5da999f5] [^060ecd99] [^aa4edc81].

> Next, I should review stewardship and systems-level levers to reduce low-value testing. Interventions such as order form redesign, default order sets, and laboratory formularies reduce unnecessary testing without harming outcomes, and Choosing Wisely campaigns target repetitive daily labs in stable inpatients. I should confirm that these strategies show measurable reductions in utilization and cost, and yes, meta-analyses and implementation studies support their effectiveness [^8fa2f175] [^ba7628a4] [^33e750a2].

> For follow-up and interpretation, I need to ensure results are contextualized with prior values, medications, and comorbidities. Abnormal liver tests, for example, should trigger a structured etiologic workup rather than reflexive repeating of the same panel, and the magnitude of abnormality does not always reflect clinical significance. I should also remember that up to 5% of healthy individuals may fall outside a reference interval by chance, so minor deviations need cautious interpretation and, when appropriate, confirmation over time [^74b4a2f6] [^64d4427e].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is an acute abdomen or suspected cholangitis? In those cases, I should prioritize tests with immediate diagnostic yield: CBC, inflammatory markers such as CRP, and liver biochemical tests, while arranging urgent imaging and source control rather than exhaustive panels. This aligns with hepatobiliary guidance for acute biliary disease [^ef0e793b].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and communication standards. Reports should specify assays used, interpretive comments provided, and public health reporting completed when required, as with HIV and certain infectious diseases. For complex or send-out tests, including clinical context with the order reduces errors and improves result relevance [^945cdc59] [^5fd7b55d] [^6e35e0eb].

The labs you should order depend on the **clinical question** and pretest probability [^aa53c8a5]. For most undifferentiated presentations, start with **CBC, CMP, and urinalysis** to screen for common issues and guide next steps [^notfound]. Add targeted tests based on symptoms and risk: TSH for fatigue or weight change [^d80df50d]; HbA1c for diabetes risk or symptoms [^notfound]; LFTs for jaundice or hepatotoxic drugs [^74b4a2f6]; troponin for chest pain [^notfound]; and infectious screens (HIV, hepatitis, STIs) when indicated [^f56941af]. Avoid routine testing that won't change management, and **repeat only when results will alter care** [^ba7628a4].

---

## General principles for laboratory test ordering

- **Clinical question**: Order tests that directly address the clinical question or hypothesis [^aa53c8a5].
- **Pretest probability**: Consider pretest probability to avoid unnecessary testing and false positives [^aa53c8a5].
- **Management impact**: Order tests only when results are likely to change management or improve outcomes [^aa53c8a5].
- **Avoid routine testing**: Avoid routine or screening tests unless evidence supports their utility [^d80df50d].

## Specialized laboratory tests

Specialized tests are ordered based on **specific clinical scenarios**:

- **Autoimmune disorders**: ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, ANCA [^72a5e411].
- **Genetic testing**: Inherited disorders, pharmacogenomics, cancer genetics [^f8dfe732].
- **Tumor markers**: PSA, CA-125, CEA, AFP for specific cancers.
- **Therapeutic drug monitoring**: Lithium, digoxin, antiepileptics, immunosuppressants [^586719e6].

---

## Avoiding unnecessary laboratory testing

- **Evidence-based guidelines**: Follow guidelines to avoid low-value testing [^ba7628a4].
- **Formulary restrictions**: Use lab formularies to limit unnecessary tests [^33e750a2].
- **Education**: Educate clinicians on appropriate test utilization [^9c1e05f6].
- **Feedback**: Provide feedback on ordering patterns to reduce waste [^notfound].

---

## Frequency of laboratory testing

The frequency of testing depends on the **clinical context**:

- **Acute illness**: Frequent monitoring (daily or as indicated).
- **Chronic conditions**: Periodic monitoring (every 3–6 months or annually).
- **Stable patients**: Minimal routine testing unless clinically indicated [^ba7628a4].

---

## Conclusion

Order labs based on the **clinical question**, pretest probability, and the likelihood that results will change management. Start with core tests (CBC, CMP, urinalysis) and add targeted tests as indicated, while avoiding routine or low-value testing.

Questions to guide future research

Clearly, laboratorians and clinicians should forge stronger links between diagnostic testing and patient outcomes. Without those links, the clinical laboratory will continue to be driven primarily by cost, volume and process measures, similar to the way a factory manages inputs and outputs. By developing measures of patient impact, the relative effectiveness of interventions to reduce diagnostic error can be assessed. To guide the development of new measures and new interventions, additional research is needed that should take into account the following questions:
What specific measures can be developed and validated to assess and monitor the harm of testing-related diagnostic error?
How often and under what circumstances do the five types of errors proposed in our approach lead to harm associated with an erroneous diagnosis, a missed diagnosis or a delay in diagnosis?
What practices would optimise the appropriate ordering of laboratory tests and application of laboratory test results to improve patient outcomes?

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^945cdc59]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV test result reporting to ordering clinicians — reports to persons who ordered HIV testing should specify all assays that were used, the results of each assay, interpretation of the results, any additional testing that is recommended using existing specimens or new specimens that should be submitted, and if alternatives to the recommended assays or algorithm sequence were used, the assays that were used and limitations of these tests or sequence compared with the recommended algorithm. Laboratories should report final results when all testing is complete, but can also report test results of individual assays used in the algorithm as they become available; if results of all tests are not reported at one time, the report should specify which test results are pending. Laboratories should establish methods to expedite reporting of test results consistent with acute HIV infection to the person who ordered HIV testing and to public health authorities to facilitate prompt notification and provision of services for acutely infected persons and their sex and drug injection partners.

### Diagnosis: making the best use of medical data [^aa53c8a5]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

To take the best possible care of patients, physicians must understand the basic principles of diagnostic test interpretation. Pretest probability is an important factor in interpreting test results. Some tests are useful for ruling in disease when positive or ruling out disease when negative, but not necessarily both. Many tests are of little value for diagnosing disease, and tests should be ordered only when the results are likely to lead to improved patient-oriented outcomes.

Analyze: Data Synthesis and Strength of the Body-of-Evidence (Meta-Analysis Approach)

Two analytic approaches were used in this systematic review: qualitative determinations of overall strength of evidence and quantitative meta-analysis. For the qualitative analysis, groups of studies within a practice category were classified according to the overall strength of their evidence's effectiveness, with ratings of "high", "moderate", "suggestive", or "insufficient". These qualitative ratings take into account the number of studies within a group, their qualitative effect size ratings, and their qualitative quality ratings. Criteria in Table 1 are the minimum criteria to achieve a particular strength of evidence rating. These criteria are the basis of the body-of-evidence qualitative analyses appearing in the "Results" section and are the primary determinant of the best practice recommendation categorizations appearing in the "Conclusions" section.

Table 1
Criteria for Determining Strength of Body-of-Evidence Ratings a

Quantitative meta-analysis was conducted on a subset of included studies meeting the following criteria: (1) have a similar outcome (eg, number of tests ordered or performed, or cost of tests), (2) have an intervention satisfying inclusion criteria, (3) have a quality rating of "fair" or "good", and (4) have information necessary to calculate point and interval estimates. In preparation for meta-analysis, data in studies were summarized as either Cohen d or as an odds ratio (OR), representing standardized measures of effect for each included study. Continuous data were summarized using Cohen d. For continuous data, necessary information included means, standard deviations (or standard errors, confidence interval [CI] exact P value, or test statistic), and sample sizes. Nominal data, on the other hand, were summarized using ORs. For nominal data, necessary information included numerators and denominators of proportions.

### Methodology for constructing guidance [^490ac0d6]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Although guidance exists for the use of many laboratory tests in a wide range of clinical situations, this guidance is spread among a range of literature sources, and is often directed at laboratory specialists rather than test users. Individual general practices display large variations in standardised test requesting, yet much of their testing activity involves a relatively small range of tests. This paper describes a methodological approach to review the available evidence and guidance and to extract relevant primary research work to examine a range of testing scenarios in general practice, with the aim of formulating guidance based on the best available evidence or consensus opinions.

Study Characteristics and Risk of Bias

While studies with the aim of impacting quality gaps identified as underutilization were eligible for inclusion, the final set of studies that could be qualitatively analyzed and meta-analyzed addressed inappropriate overutilization (additional discussion on this gap in the "Limitations" section). Further, the information among the available evidence base supported statistical determinations of number of tests (representing either number of tests ordered or number of tests performed) as the measure of effect that could be analyzed across a majority of included studies.

The number of tests outcome was calculated as the difference between the number of tests pre- and postintervention, or between the intervention group and control group (for some studies, this was expressed as number of tests ordered, for others it was expressed as number of tests performed, generalized in this review as "number of tests"), with the assumption made that the testing ordered/performed postintervention was appropriate. These data permitted calculation in most cases of one of the standardized effect measures — Cohen d or OR — for inclusion in qualitative and quantitative analysis summaries (described below). As will be further described in the "Discussion" section, the quality gap addressed by all but one included study was in relation to inappropriate overutilization of testing. Each study variably defined the standard by which the quality gap of inappropriate overutilization was established, with considerable variation across studies as to criteria for determining the presence of inappropriate test utilization through utilization audit, as well as how thoroughly investigators described these criteria in their reporting. This is discussed in more detail in the "Limitations" section and in the "Future Research Need" section.

### Effectiveness of practices to support appropriate laboratory test utilization: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review and meta-analysis [^eade99b8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Quality Gap: Inappropriate Laboratory Test Ordering

Many laboratory test orders are not supported by appropriate-use protocols (ie, organizational guidelines, local consensus guidelines, algorithms, and local administrative directives on utilization) and are unnecessarily duplicative, with variations in test ordering patterns influenced by a number of factors. A systematic review by Zhi et alrevealed that overall mean rates of inappropriate over- and underutilization of testing were 20.6% and 44.8%, respectively. In this context, a reduction in duplicate test orders and the use of test orders supported by appropriate use protocols qualify as measurable quality gaps.

Reporting results for the recommended HIV diagnostic algorithm — factors influencing laboratory reporting: Laboratory practices for reporting test results and providing interpretation of results to the persons who ordered the HIV test are influenced by the assay manufacturer's instructions (specified in product inserts), guidance or recommendations from regulatory or scientific agencies and professional associations, local clinical practice needs (communicated through requests from institutional clinical practice committees), requirements of the laboratory information system, and requirements of the electronic health record.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^fdeaf458]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

### Laboratory tests in the patient with abdominal pain [^ca81ec2a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting complaints to the emergency department (ED). More often than not, some degree of laboratory testing is used to narrow the differential diagnosis based on the patient's history and examination. Ordering practices are often guided by evidence, habit, consulting services, and institutional/regional culture. This review highlights relevant laboratory studies that may be ordered in the ED, as well as commentary on indications and diagnostic value of these tests.

### Evidence-based guidelines to eliminate repetitive laboratory testing [^ba7628a4]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Routine daily laboratory testing of hospitalized patients reflects a wasteful clinical practice that threatens the value of health care. Choosing Wisely initiatives from numerous professional societies have identified repetitive laboratory testing in the face of clinical stability as low value care. Although laboratory expenditure often represents less than 5% of most hospital budgets, the impact is far-reaching given that laboratory tests influence nearly 60% to 70% of all medical decisions. Excessive phlebotomy can lead to hospital-acquired anemia, increased costs, and unnecessary downstream testing and procedures. Efforts to reduce the frequency of laboratory orders can improve patient satisfaction and reduce cost without negatively affecting patient outcomes. To date, numerous interventions have been deployed across multiple institutions without a standardized approach. Health care professionals and administrative leaders should carefully strategize and optimize efforts to reduce daily laboratory testing. This review presents an evidence-based implementation blueprint to guide teams aimed at improving appropriate routine laboratory testing among hospitalized patients.

### Effectiveness of practices to support appropriate laboratory test utilization: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review and meta-analysis [^a43cf1be]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 3) from. All meta-analyses assumed random effects. Unlike the fixed effect approach, the random effects approach does not assume homogeneity of effect across studies, an assumption which is not reasonable for the evidence base analyzed in this review. The I² statistic, was used to determine consistency (homogeneity) of effects. Most studies had I² close to 100% (nearly all variation due to heterogeneity), reinforcing the decision to use a random effects approach. Results of meta-analyses were summarized numerically using the summary OR (for number of tests ordered) or Cohen d (for cost of tests ordered) and their 95% CI.

Point and interval estimates were summarized graphically using forest plots, appearing in the "Results" section. Study-specific ORs and summary ORs were classified as having minimal (OR < 2.5 or OR > 0.4), moderate (OR ≥ 2.5 or OR ≤ 0.4 and OR < 4.5 or OR > 0.2), or substantial (OR ≥ 4.5 or OR ≤ 0.2) effect sizes. Study-specific Cohen d and summary Cohen d were classified as having minimal (| d | < 0.5), moderate (| d | ≥ 0.5 and | d | < 0.8), or substantial (| d | ≥ 0.8) effect sizes. These cutoffs were the criteria for qualitative effect size ratings used for the body-of-evidence qualitative analysis described above.

### Effectiveness of practices to support appropriate laboratory test utilization: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review and meta-analysis [^9f98fcc9]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Laboratory testing is integral to modern health care as a tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, stratification of disease risk, treatment selection, and monitoring of disease progression or treatment response. It is also a guide for hospital admissions and discharges. As rates of test utilization grow, there is increased scrutiny over the appropriateness of testing, for example to reduce potential for diagnostic error. Additionally, with increased capitation and restrictive insurance reimbursements, clinical laboratories are under continuous pressure to improve the value and utility of laboratory investigations while operating in relation to these financial restrictions. Within this landscape, rates of inappropriate overutilization and underutilization represent an important gap for quality improvement at one of the earliest points of clinical-laboratory interface. While utilization management approaches have been described in the literature, the effectiveness of these interventions in support of appropriate test utilization is unclear, as are current research gaps.

### When diagnostic testing leads to harm: a new outcomes-based approach for laboratory medicine [^2520ac14]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

The role of laboratory testing in establishing diagnoses

Diagnoses typically result from the patient history and physical. However, diagnostic testing is often used to confirm initial impressions or rule out alternatives, and at least 10% of all diagnoses are not considered final until clinical laboratory testing is complete. This number most likely underestimates the actual impact of testing on diagnosis. In the emergency room, clinical laboratory testing is ordered in more than 41% of all visits. Family physicians order tests in 29% of all patient visits, and general internists, in 38% of visits. These percentages would be even higher if the calculations were based only on the 33.9% of primary care visits that involve a new complaint.

Advances in technology have also contributed to the increased importance of laboratory tests. In the past, laboratory tests were used to identify organ and system dysfunctions or diseases. While this is still true, testing nowadays is used to diagnose disease subtypes, as occurs when pathology reports of cancer are accompanied by tumour-specific and patient-specific molecular analyses, data which help physicians determine optimum therapies and a patient's likely response to treatment. Laboratory testing is also increasingly being used to diagnose treatment failures associated with newer measures of effective care, such as reduced hospital readmissions. The clinical laboratory's growing significance may also reflect physicians' increasing reliance on objective data from diagnostic testing to partially compensate for reduced history and physical examination skills.

### Laboratory testing for the monkeypox virus: interim guidance [^19ddcdd6]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for mpox, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, NAAT, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to consider ordering positive control material for PCR assays from specialized initiatives. Include the positive control material at a low (above the limit of detection) but easily detectable concentration. Consider including quality control materials to assist in controlling for any assay issues. Use controls to provide information about sample quality, nucleic acid quality, and process quality. Limit contamination since PCR can be extremely sensitive and use negative controls on every run to ensure contamination has not occurred.

### Laboratory test names matter: a survey on what works and what doesn' T work for orders and results [^41f27a2d]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context —

Health care providers were surveyed to determine their ability to correctly decipher laboratory test names and their preferences for laboratory test names and result displays.

Objective —

To confirm principles for laboratory test nomenclature and display and to compare and contrast the abilities and preferences of different provider groups for laboratory test names.

Design —

Health care providers across different specialties and perspectives completed a survey of 38 questions, which included participant demographics, real-life examples of poorly named laboratory orders that they were asked to decipher, an assessment of vitamin D test name knowledge, their preferences for ideal names for tests, and their preferred display for test results. Participants were grouped and compared by profession, level of training, and the presence or absence of specialization in informatics and/or laboratory medicine.

Results —

Participants struggled with poorly named tests, especially with less commonly ordered tests. Participants' knowledge of vitamin D analyte names was poor and consistent with prior published studies. The most commonly selected ideal names correlated positively with the percentage of the authors' previously developed naming rules (R = 0.54, P < .001). There was strong consensus across groups for the best result display.

Conclusions —

Poorly named laboratory tests are a significant source of provider confusion, and tests that are named according to the authors' naming rules as outlined in this article have the potential to improve test ordering and correct interpretation of results. Consensus among provider groups indicates that a single yet clear naming strategy for laboratory tests is achievable.

### Decoding laboratory test names: a major challenge to appropriate patient care [^983ffc97]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical laboratory tests have no value if clinicians cannot quickly order and obtain the results they need. We found that efforts to obtain even the most commonly ordered tests are often derailed by excessively complex nomenclature. Ordering the right laboratory tests is critical to diagnosis and treatment, but existing mechanisms for entering lab orders actively interfere with physicians' efforts to provide good clinical care. Rather than simplifying lab orders, the advent of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems-generally programmed by non-clinicians-has introduced new and vexing practical problems. Medical laboratories have filled their test menus, whether paper or electronic, with bewildering nomenclature and abbreviations, and have failed to appreciate the dangers of assigning perilously similar names to different tests. The efficient and efficacious patient care demanded by the quality care initiative requires progress beyond traditional solutions, such as convening naming conventions, to the development of innovative software with intelligent, real-time, clinically driven search functions that will allow these programs to help rather than hinder physicians.

Data available in the current evidence base also supported determinations of "cost of tests" outcome, serving as this review's secondary outcome measure analyzable across many of the included studies.

To allow for more robust synthesis of eligible studies with number of tests as the outcome, the Cohen d statistics (with CIs) were converted to ORs (with CIs). Studies with cost of tests ordered as an outcome were compared using Cohen d, since subsequent conversion to an OR was unnecessary.

The available evidence base demonstrated considerable variability in terms of targeted test-ordering clinicians, targeted testing, patient setting, patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, facility type and size, study design, and the specific intervention used within a practice category. The "Applicability and Generalizability" subsection of the "Discussion" section provides details on distribution of characteristics across studies. Additionally, they varied in terms of author affiliation, with 46% of included studies having laboratory professionals in authorship (eg, pathologists, lab consultants, lab managers, and lab directors).

Supplemental Table 4 provides detailed evidence summary tables for the 83 included studies, as well as for the 12 eligible studies excluded for poor quality ratings. Supplemental Table 4 also provides criteria for study quality point deductions. With a possible score of 0 to 10, average quality score for all included studies was 6.7 (standard deviation, ± 1.11) for an average "fair" quality rating across all included studies. Supplemental Table 4 lists the most common reasons for quality point deductions. Supplemental Table 5 provides consolidated intervention descriptions, targeted testing descriptions, and targeted clinical staff descriptions for each included study.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^a8426ad2]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Analytic framework — CDC writing group members conducted a systematic literature review to compare outcomes of previous and proposed HIV testing algorithm recommendations, and evaluated evidence using criteria adapted to relevant study designs within an analytic framework linking key questions to outcomes related to performance of individual assays and their use in combinations. The evidence synthesis focused on the relative effects of previous and recommended testing algorithms on diagnostic accuracy and yield. Benefits were defined as tests or algorithms classifying specimens as true-positive or true-negative for HIV-1 or HIV-2, and as reduced turnaround time, whereas harms included being classified as false-positive or false-negative, receiving indeterminate or inconclusive results, and delayed diagnosis due to the need for additional specimens or follow-up testing. Services after diagnosis for persons with HIV and for those identified as uninfected would be needed regardless of which testing algorithm is used.

### Molecular biomarkers for the evaluation of colorectal cancer [^b1042dac]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Medium credibility.

Colorectal carcinoma — ordering, initiation, and turnaround expectations: Laboratories must provide clinically appropriate turnaround times and optimal utilization of tissue specimens by using appropriate techniques (eg, multiplexed assays) for clinically relevant molecular and immunohistochemical biomarkers of colorectal cancer, and molecular and IHC biomarker testing in colorectal carcinoma should be initiated in a timely fashion based on the clinical scenario and in accordance with institutionally accepted practices; test ordering can occur on a case-by-case basis or by policies established by the medical staff. Laboratories should establish policies to ensure efficient allocation and utilization of tissue for molecular testing, members of the patient's medical team, including pathologists, may initiate colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker test orders, and laboratories that require send-out of tests for treatment predictive biomarkers should process and send specimens in a timely manner; it is suggested that a benchmark of 90% of specimens should be sent out within 3 working days.

### Interpretating normal values and reference ranges for laboratory tests [^64d4427e]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory test results drive about 70% of clinical decisions and are important in making diagnosis, prognosis, ruling out conditions, testing for propensity to disease and monitoring the course of illnesses. The requirement for releasing laboratory results to patients has altered the dynamics of doctor patient interaction. Minor variations in laboratory test results that are labeled by the laboratory as low/high/abnormal may cause unwarranted worry to the patients. The number of laboratory results that are outside the "normal range" far exceeds the clinically meaningful abnormal results due to the usually accepted methodology for ascertaining "normal values"/reference ranges, variations in methods of testing at different laboratories, variations due to age, gender, ethnicity, seasonality, and random variations. The usual process for establishing "normal values/reference ranges" entails testing at least 120 healthy individuals in a given age-group, gender, ethnicity, testing method and related health issues. The central 95% of the values is usually adopted as the normal range. This practice, by definition, labels 5% of healthy individuals as having abnormal laboratory results. This review addresses various issues that affect laboratory test results and interpretation of such results. It also addresses doctor and patient concerns about assessing and reporting laboratory results. In addition to reporting normal values along with patient results, it may be useful to include clinical significance of the findings, in simple terms, such as, no immediate concern, warrants discussion with doctor at the next visit, recommend contacting your doctor for further action.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^376f0048]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^9f8e2324]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^c111ccf7]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### FDA and CMS: Americans deserve accurate and reliable diagnostic… [^9eefb9b7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Physicians heavily rely on laboratory tests to make critical decisions about their patients' care — roughly 70% of healthcare decisions depend on laboratory test results according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For example, results from laboratory tests can be the sole determinant of whether a patient with cancer gets a particular therapy, potentially risking the patient's life with an inaccurate test result. Because of the important role of laboratory tests in healthcare decisions, it is essential to ensure these tests work. While the U. S Food and Drug Administration actively oversees tests made outside laboratories by test manufacturers, tests made and run within a single laboratory, known as laboratory, developed tests or LDTs, are often used without such oversight.

The FDA's approach was developed half a century ago when tests made and used in single labs were generally simple, often made to address local individual needs, and mostly manufactured in small volumes. Both CMS and the FDA believe that patients and their doctors need to know that LDTs are valid. The FDA and CMS both provide oversight to help assure the accuracy of test results, however, they have different roles. CMS regulates laboratories that perform testing on individuals in the U. S. through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 by establishing quality standards for all laboratory testing to help ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. In 2013, CMS published a fact sheet on LDTs, outlining each agency's authority and the complementary roles of the two regulatory schemes.

That said, a decade later, in connection with the FDA's notice of proposed rulemaking, we are – together – reiterating that CMS's CLIA program is separate in scope and purpose from FDA oversight. Some have suggested that concerns with LDTs should be addressed through expansion of CLIA. This is not the answer. As was stated in our 2015 testimony, CMS does not have the expertise to assure that tests work; the FDA does. Moreover, establishing a duplicative system for the oversight of tests by expanding CLIA would create more government bureaucracy and inconsistencies. That makes no sense. The FDA and CMS have long stood together in mutual support of FDA oversight of the analytical and clinical validity of LDTs. LDTs play an important role in healthcare, but when they perform poorly or are not supported by science, they put patients at risk. The current approach has enabled some tests to enter the market with unfounded claims of innovation.

### Effectiveness of practices to support appropriate laboratory test utilization: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review and meta-analysis [^6374ff34]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Additional Benefits and Economic Evaluation

Several subsections of this section serve to further inform implementation decisions, while indicating limitations of the current evidence base. Frameworks guiding decision-making exist, such as GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group) Evidence to Decision frameworks, and may be applied by health care decision-makers when choosing to adopt (or adapt) recommendations in new contexts.

To this end, this first subsection refers readers to the data provided in the "Additional Outcomes Data" of the "Results" section, suggesting benefit beyond this review's primary outcome ("number of tests"). These data suggests statistically significant favorable impact (via P values) for studies that could not be meta-analyzed. While the patient-related outcomes provided by some of the studies are distal outcomes, impacted by many factors during the course of care, the following pattern arises: the rates of the patient-important outcomes assessed (eg, morbidity, mortality, and length of stay) were not significantly different pre- or postintervention, therefore interventions apparently were not associated with adverse impact on these outcomes. Additional discussion on limitations associated of the patient-related outcome measures encountered in the current evidence base appears in the "Limitations" section.

Additionally, while concerns associated with the economic evaluation supported by the current evidence base are also noted in the "Limitations" section, what the meta-analyzed "costs of tests" outcome does provide is complementary indication of the proximal effects of these interventions, expressed as cost-savings.

### Approaches to developing and implementing a molecular diagnostics stewardship program for infectious diseases: an ASM laboratory practices subcommittee report [^33e750a2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Laboratory formularies

One way of promoting DxS is to focus and limit which tests are available. This can be achieved by a "Laboratory Formulary". A Laboratory Formulary is a policy defining which tests are approved by the institution and in what circumstances they are approved. Similar to a pharmaceutical formulary which catalogs drugs that can be prescribed in each setting, it can be used to standardize and drive approaches to patient management through testing.

While akin to a "test menu", Laboratory Formularies are more complex. They typically include tests performed both locally and those sent to reference laboratories. They may define the specific reference laboratory and clinical setting permitted for a send-out test. Decisions regarding whether a test is offered should consider clinical utility, TAT, availability of alternatives, and cost; tests may be stratified within the Laboratory Formulary based on these characteristics. Depending on the tier, different administrative controls may be put in place. For example, some tests may be accessible only to specific locations or providers, and some tests may require special authorization whenever ordered. Tests deemed to have little clinical value can be omitted from the electronic ordering system. Laboratory Formularies should ensure that tests ordered as "miscellaneous send-out" tests are also evaluated for inclusion or exclusion.

Laboratory formularies are not static. As new tests are developed and testing needs evolve, formularies should be re-evaluated and edited. This requires regular review and having defined processes by which providers can submit proposed changes and provide feedback regarding gaps in the formulary. Given the complexity of clinical medicine, providers may need alternative ordering mechanisms to order off-formulary tests when clinically indicated.

### Effectiveness of practices to support appropriate laboratory test utilization: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review and meta-analysis [^10124743]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Additionally, while laboratory professionals were frequently involved as investigators and authors within the included evidence base (46% of included studies), we recommend more robust representation of laboratory professionals on teams investigating the impact of practices to manage appropriate test utilization. Recent articles provide guidance on the role of the laboratory at this point of clinical-laboratory interface, as well as on relevant lab-related performance measures laboratory professionals may monitor, since labs should be "continuously engaged in auditing, monitoring, and improving the appropriateness of test requests… ", This should include efforts to further evolve how appropriate test utilization is benchmarked and monitored though lab-related performance measures or indicators (ideally standardized or "harmonized" across laboratories and health care organizations), as may involve increased use of health information technology, web technology, and new approaches to integrating and analyzing available, relevant data.

### The "slightly" abnormal thyroid test: what is the pediatrician to do? [^cfb7df02]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid disorders are common in pediatrics. Tests of thyroid function are widely available and frequently ordered in the pediatric healthcare setting. This is sometimes driven by common signs or symptoms of thyroid disease. All too often, it is driven by patients and their parents requesting thyroid tests for nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, obesity or family history of thyroid disease. The decision to order thyroid tests, as well as which test(s) of thyroid function to order, deserves careful thought rather than a reflexive "thyroid panel" for every patient. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is the single most appropriate test of thyroid function when screening a pediatric or adolescent for thyroid disorders. Adding more tests only increases the likelihood that a minor (and often insignificant) abnormality will be found. These incidental abnormalities can create anxiety for the parent and child, and usually results in additional testing, referral to a pediatric endocrinologist, and further expense. This review will aim to guide the pediatric primary care provider on the choice of appropriate screening test(s) for acquired thyroid dysfunction in children and adolescents, as well as the proper interpretation of the test(s). Emphasis will be placed on the "slightly" abnormal thyroid screening test. Specific thyroid tests to be reviewed include TSH, (free) T4, (free) T3, and thyroid antibodies. Finally, this review will aim to guide decisions on follow-up, additional testing, and reasons for referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. Congenital hypothyroidism, including abnormalities on state newborn screening, will not be discussed.

### What should be done when thyroid function tests do not make sense? [^2263dc4f]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Interpretation of thyroid function tests (TFTs) is generally straightforward. However, in a minority of contexts the results of thyroid hormone and thyrotropin measurements either conflict with the clinical picture or form an unusual pattern. In many such cases, reassessment of the clinical context provides an explanation for the discrepant TFTs; in other instances, interference in one or other laboratory assays can be shown to account for divergent results; uncommonly, genetic defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are associated with anomalous TFTs. Failure to recognize these potential 'pitfalls' can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate management. Here, focusing particularly on the combination of hyperthyroxinaemia with nonsuppressed thyrotropin, we show how a structured approach to investigation can help make sense of atypical TFTs.

### Does admission order form design really matter? A reduction in urea blood test ordering [^8fa2f175]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Based on our findings, admission order form design can be extremely influential on physician laboratory test ordering behaviour change. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the design of an admission order form to prevent unnecessary over ordering. Because our healthcare system is continually operated at its financial limits, order form changes could become a quick and effective way to maintain cost-effective care. Additionally, although the design of the order forms have an effect, this can be escalated with the addition of job aides that outline the clinical indications for specific laboratory tests, education or other context specific interventions that heighten physician awareness of laboratory test order frequency posthospital unit admission.

Implications

The notion that order form design can have an effect on physician ordering behaviour prompts an actionable response for sustainable healthcare. This most effectively occurs with collaboration between physicians, hospitals administrators, health organisations and laboratory leaders. Both paper order forms as well as computerised order systems can contribute to resource overuse and stewardship thus design of either should be carefully considered. With low value blood testing, design concepts in place, attaining financial accountability and resource stewardship may very well be possible.

Conclusions

This study makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of how different laboratory testing characteristics, including turnaround time, the number of tests, and test order episodes, affect ED length of stay. Clinicians' ordering practices affect ED length of stay through the number of laboratory tests that they order, and laboratory service performance affects ED length of stay through the time needed to process laboratory test requests. Variations in clinician practices and laboratory performance are suitable targets for quality improvement.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^2b6d753a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP stimulant intoxication and withdrawal — laboratory testing: Laboratory testing can detect some acute issues and complications, but no research was identified on ordering routine or as-needed testing in patients presenting with stimulant intoxication or withdrawal; the CGC agreed that some tests may be considered based on symptomatology and presence of risk factors, and clinicians should consider a CBC (complete blood count), a CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel); liver function tests (LFTs); and markers for muscle breakdown (creatine kinase [CK], lactate), cardiac injury (troponin), and renal injury (BCR, urine albumin). When ordering a CBC, clinicians should be alert to neutrophil levels in patients with cocaine intoxication or withdrawal. Levamisole is a common adulterant in the cocaine supply and can cause immunosuppression — in particular, neutropenia — and small vessel vasculitis, and the degree of clinical concern varies by region and over time. While there is no direct evidence regarding infectious disease screening as part of the comprehensive assessment, these tests help identify common comorbid conditions; the higher prevalence of HIV, hepatitis, and STIs in patients who use stimulants justifies testing, and clinicians should consider all sites of sexual exposure, which may include urogenital, pharyngeal, and/or rectal, when testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea. For some patients, the impact of routine laboratory testing could be substantial given the benefit of early detection and treatment for some conditions, whereas for some diagnoses the effect of early detection and treatment is less substantial.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^aa4edc81]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests (thyrotropin [TSH] and thyroid hormone [TH] measurement) is open to question and the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) with its expertise support the endeavor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing. ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing the recent literature to revise or update the criteria as needed in mutual agreement and to inform clinical care. Summary: This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of current routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be demonstrated through ongoing international efforts before results from different assays can be considered equivalent. Emerging technology (e.g., mass spectrometry) shows promise for improved analytical performance, but more evidence of its clinical utility and improved throughput is required before it can be considered for routine use. Close clinical-laboratory collaboration is encouraged to overcome and avoid the pitfalls in thyroid testing as well as resolve clinically discrepant results. The evidence base supporting the conclusions of this review is summarized in four detailed online technical supplements. Conclusions: Over the past five decades, testing for TSH, T4, and T3 has evolved from manual radioisotopic immunoassays to nonisotopic multiplexed immunometric assays using highly automated equipment. Despite these technical advances, physicians and laboratorians performing these analyses must understand limitations of these methods to properly order tests and interpret results.

Summary:

This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of current routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be demonstrated through ongoing international efforts before results from different assays can be considered equivalent. Emerging technology (e.g. mass spectrometry) shows promise for improved analytical performance, but more evidence of its clinical utility and improved throughput is required before it can be considered for routine use. Close clinical–laboratory collaboration is encouraged to overcome and avoid the pitfalls in thyroid testing as well as resolve clinically discrepant results. The evidence base supporting the conclusions of this review is summarized in four detailed online technical supplements.

Conclusions:

Over the past five decades, testing for TSH, T4, and T3 has evolved from manual radioisotopic immunoassays to nonisotopic multiplexed immunometric assays using highly automated equipment. Despite these technical advances, physicians and laboratorians performing these analyses must understand limitations of these methods to properly order tests and interpret results.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^4f32bdb1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

We included 21 studies in this review and analyzed the results for 67 different routine laboratory tests, focusing on diagnosing COVID‐19. For 16 tests, we have summarized the results in a meta‐analysis. As the majority of the included studies only reported RT‐PCR as a reference standard, the meta‐analyses may be more applicable to detecting SARS‐CoV‐2 infection than COVID‐19 diseased. Only three tests performed at sensitivity‐specificity combinations where both sensitivity and specificity were above 50%. There was low to very low certainty in the summary estimates of the tests.

The low accuracy of these tests does not render them useless. They are all indicators of the general health status of a patient. They may indicate infection, inflammation, or tissue damage and thus support diagnoses made based on other diseases. However, evidence to date suggests that in sick hospitalized patients, they cannot discriminate between COVID‐19 and other diseases as the cause of infection, inflammation or tissue damage and should preferably not be used as stand‐alone tests for COVID‐19. As a triage test would require a high sensitivity (< 80%), these tests have limited use as triage tests. How these tests would perform in those with milder symptoms cannot be inferred from our data.

Appendix I — Baseline laboratory testing for substance use disorder (SUD) — It is important for clinicians to deliver the full standard of care, including routinely ordering baseline laboratory testing for patients with a newly diagnosed SUD or psychiatric disorder. In non-acute care settings, clinicians should order the following clinical tests for most patients: complete blood count (CBC); comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP; eg, renal panel, liver function tests [LFTs]); screening for infectious diseases in accordance with current guidance; HIV and HCV for all patients; HBV for patients at increased risk for infection; screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs; eg, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis); and pregnancy testing for all patients with childbearing potential. Clinicians can also consider ordering the following clinical tests: tuberculosis (TB) for patients at increased risk for infection; HAV for patients at increased risk for infection; and other clinical tests as necessary based on clinical assessment, such as creatine kinase (CK) if signs of rhabdomyolysis are present.

### Genetic testing in dyslipidemia: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^f8dfe732]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Genetic testing in inherited dyslipidemias — how testing is performed and counseling: Genetic testing laboratories typically accept various sample types, including whole blood, saliva, or buccal swabs, and for inherited dyslipidemias, analysis usually involves DNA sequencing with additional analysis, including evaluation for deletions and duplications (del-dups), as for instance, ~10% of causative variants in FH are del-dups or large copy number variants, which can be missed by certain DNA sequencing methods, so genetic testing must be able to evaluate for these; variants are classified based on the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines. Methodologies typically include at least DNA sequencing, the clinician should discuss the implications of genetic testing with the patient and obtain informed consent, and patients should receive genetic counseling to discuss the implications of the results, in many cases before ordering genetic testing; once results are released to the ordering clinician, they should be reviewed with patients posttest genetic counseling.

### Factors associated with ordering laboratory monitoring of high-risk medications [^586719e6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Knowledge about factors associated with provider ordering of appropriate testing is limited.

Objective

To determine physician factors associated with ordering recommended laboratory monitoring tests for high-risk medications.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of patients prescribed a high-risk medication requiring laboratory monitoring in a large multispecialty group practice between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2008. Analyses are based on administrative claims and electronic medical records. The outcome is a physician order for each recommended laboratory test for each prescribed medication. Key predictor variables are physician characteristics, including age, gender, specialty training, years since completing training, and prescribing volume. Additional variables are patient characteristics such as age, gender, comorbidity burden, whether the medication requiring monitoring is new or chronic, and drug-test characteristics such as inclusion in black box warnings. We used multivariable logistic regression, accounting for clustering of drugs within patients and patients within providers.

Results

Physician orders for laboratory testing varied across drug-test pairs and ranged from 9% (Primidone-Phenobarbital level) to 97% (Azathioprine-CBC), with half of the drug-test pairs in the 85–91% ordered range. Test ordering was associated with higher provider prescribing volume for study drugs and specialist status (primary care providers were less likely to order tests than specialists). Patients with higher comorbidity burden and older patients were more likely to have appropriate tests ordered. Drug-test combinations with black box warnings were more likely to have tests ordered.

Conclusions

Interventions to improve laboratory monitoring should focus on areas with the greatest potential for improvement: providers with lower frequencies of prescribing medications with monitoring recommendations and those prescribing these medications for healthier and younger patients; patients with less interaction with the health care system are at particular risk of not having tests ordered. Black box warnings were associated with higher ordering rates and may be a tool to increase appropriate test ordering.

### Does admission order form design really matter? A reduction in urea blood test ordering [^c03d6c5e]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Laboratory blood testing is one of the most high-volume medical procedures and continues to increase steadily with instances of inappropriate testing resulting in significant financial implications. Studies have suggested that the design of a standard hospital admission order form and laboratory request forms influence physician test ordering behaviour, reducing inappropriate ordering and promoting resource stewardship.

Aim/method

To redesign the standard medicine admission order form-laboratory request section to reduce inappropriate blood urea nitrogen (BUN) testing.

Results

A redesign of the standard admission order form used by general internal medicine physicians and residents in two large teaching hospitals in one health zone in Alberta, Canada led to a significant step reduction in the ordering of the BUN test on hospital admission.

Conclusions

Redesigning the standard medicine admission order form-laboratory request section can have a beneficial effect on the reduction in BUN ordering altering physician ordering patterns and behaviour.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^74b4a2f6]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### Regulation of laboratory-developed tests [^5e7c8131]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

As described in the American Board of Pathology entry on the American Board of Medical Specialties website, board certified pathologists — as licensed medical professionals — contribute to "diagnosis, prognosis and treatment through knowledge gained by the laboratory application of the biologic, chemical and physical sciences". Pathology is a fundamental practice of medicine. Compelling arguments have been put forth advocating differing positions on whether laboratory testing services are (or are not) considered practice of medicine, and therefore how they may be impacted by medical device regulatory reform. Without increased advocacy regarding the value of laboratory medicine in test development, implementation, and operation, it is possible that future IVD proposals may diminish the ability of clinical pathologists and laboratory scientists to use their professional judgement and expertise in providing clinically optimal testing services for their patients.

Evaluation of albuminuria — initial testing, confirmation, and interpretation: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of preference), and in all cases, a first void in the morning midstream urine sample is preferred. If measuring urine protein, use urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading. Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods, confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible, and confirm ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the morning midstream urine sample. Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine creatinine and order confirmatory tests as indicated.

### Points to consider in the practice of postmortem genetic testing: a statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^eabfe652]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Considerations for reporting (for the laboratory) — variant classification for postmortem genetic testing should be performed according to the same standards established for genetic testing of samples from living individuals, and laboratories should maintain policies and procedures regarding their reportable variant classifications in this setting. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in genes that are clinically relevant for the decedent should be reported, while benign and likely benign variants should not be reported. If feasible, laboratories should consider reporting variants of uncertain significance in genes that are related to the cause of death for cases ordered by an ME/C, at the request of the family, or as part of a death investigation when a traditional autopsy fails to identify a cause of death, and segregation testing in family members may assist the laboratory in upgrading or downgrading the classification of certain variants. Postmortem genetic testing should be used solely as a component of the autopsy/death investigation to determine or confirm the cause of death; thus, only variants that are directly related to the cause of death should be reported, incidental/secondary findings that are unrelated to sudden death should not be reported unless consent was obtained from a family member, and heterozygous variants for recessive genetic conditions that are unrelated to sudden death should not be reported. Laboratories should maintain policies and procedures regarding variant re-evaluation that follow established recommendations for the testing of living individuals, and when testing is ordered by an ME/C, at the request of the family, or as part of a death investigation when a traditional autopsy fails to identify a cause of death, laboratories should communicate any updated variant classifications to the individuals who initiated testing or other appropriate providers through established means. Consumers of postmortem genetic testing reports include forensic pathologists, general pathologists, neuropathologists, coroners, lawyers, and the general public; therefore, if feasible, reports should ideally be succinct and free of jargon, and interaction with a genetics professional is also important because they are specifically trained to communicate genetic testing results.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Laboratory assay evaluation demystified: a review of key factors influencing interpretation of test results using different assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis [^889723d9]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Laboratory tests are an integral part of the diagnosis and management of patients; however, these tests are far from perfect. Their imperfections can be due to patient health condition, specimen collection, and/or technological difficulty with performing the assay and/or interpretation. To be useful clinically, testing requires calculation of positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs). During the current global pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), multiple assays with unknown clinical sensitivity and specificity have been rapidly developed to aid in the diagnosis of the disease. Due to a lack of surveillance testing, the prevalence of COVID-19 remains unknown. Hence, using this situation as an clinical example, the goal of this article is to clarify the key factors that influence the PPV and NPV yielded by diagnostic testing, By doing so, we hope to offer health-care providers information that will help them better understand the potential implications of utilizing these test results in clinical patient management.

### Diagnostics reform and harmonization of clinical laboratory testing [^a96e9b06]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2019). Medium credibility.

Developments in diagnostics reform legislation in the United States are occurring at a rapid pace. The framework for future regulatory oversight of clinical laboratory testing is currently under intensive debate among stakeholders that represent patients, practitioners, laboratories, diagnostic manufacturers, and regulators. The importance of clinical laboratory test standardization is a key component of any plan for regulatory reform. A laboratory-developed test is performed in a specific laboratory setting, often led by clinical laboratory professionals who possess specific expertise for developing and running the test to fill a clinical need. A test commercially marketed as an in vitro diagnostic kit is designed to operate across a spectrum of laboratory settings in laboratories with a range of expertise. Both types of tests are stringently regulated, laboratory-developed tests by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and in vitro diagnostic kits by the US Food and Drug Administration. Interlaboratory comparisons of laboratory-developed tests have been published, demonstrating highly reproducible results. Comparisons of laboratory-developed tests with in vitro diagnostic kits have also found high concordance. Several important clinical laboratory test standardization projects are currently under way. The US Food and Drug Administration has acknowledged the need for such standardization. In its most recent draft guidance, the agency requested input from the scientific community as to actions that can be taken to facilitate standardization.

### Accuracy of send-out test ordering: a college of American pathologists Q-probes study of ordering accuracy in 97 clinical laboratories [^060ecd99]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Errors entering orders for send-out laboratory tests into computer systems waste health care resources and can delay patient evaluation and management.

Objectives

To determine (1) the accuracy of send-out test order entry under "real world" conditions and (2) whether any of several practices are associated with improved order accuracy.

Design

Representatives from 97 clinical laboratories provided information about the processes they use to send tests to reference facilities and their order entry and specimen routing error rates.

Results

In aggregate, 98% of send-out tests were correctly ordered and 99.4% of send-out tests were routed to the proper reference laboratory. There was wide variation among laboratories in the rate of send-out test order entry errors. In the bottom fourth of laboratories, more than 5% of send-out tests were ordered incorrectly, while in the top fourth of laboratories fewer than 0.3% of tests were ordered incorrectly. Order entry errors were less frequent when a miscellaneous test code was used than when a specific test code was used (3.9% vs 5.6%; P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Computer order entry errors for send-out tests occur approximately twice as frequently as order entry errors for other types of tests. Filing more specific test codes in a referring institution's information system is unlikely to reduce order entry errors and may make error rates worse.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^0c8ec408]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (AASLD Practice Guidance) — referral, laboratory interpretation, and family screening: Patients with suspected advanced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or discordant noninvasive tests (NITs) should be referred, as "Patients with suspected advanced NASH or discordant NITs should be referred to a specialist for evaluation, management, and/or further diagnostic evaluation". Aminotransferase levels may be misleading, as "Aminotransferase levels are frequently normal in patients with advanced liver disease due to NASH and should not be used in isolation to exclude the presence of NASH with clinically significant fibrosis". Family members merit counseling and assessment, as "First-degree relatives of patients with NASH cirrhosis should be counseled regarding their increased individual risk and offered screening for advanced hepatic fibrosis". Patients with "at-risk" disease are highlighted: "Patients with 'at-risk' NASH (NASH with at least stage 2 fibrosis) are at increased risk of developing cirrhosis and liver-related complications".

### Diagnostic testing and interpretation of tests for autoimmunity [^72a5e411]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Laboratory testing is of great value when evaluating a patient with a suspected autoimmune disease. The results can confirm a diagnosis, estimate disease severity, aid in assessing prognosis and are useful for following disease activity. Components of the laboratory examination include a complete blood count with differential, a comprehensive metabolic panel, measurement of inflammatory markers and autoantibodies, and flow cytometry. This chapter discusses these components and includes a discussion about organ-specific immunologic diseases for which immunologic laboratory testing is used. Comprehensive laboratory evaluation of a suspected autoimmune illness in conjunction with a thorough clinical evaluation provides a better understanding of a patient's immunologic disease.

### Good laboratory practices for biochemical genetic testing and newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders [^a5b5a49e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Glossary — genetics and screening framework terms — defines newborn screening as a system that identifies, shortly after birth, infants who are at increased risk for genetic and other congenital conditions so that treatment can begin as soon as possible, noting the need to confirm positive screening results with additional diagnostic testing. It explains nonwaived testing as test systems, assays, or examinations not determined to be waived testing and encompassing moderate- and high-complexity testing for which CLIA regulations provide requirements for laboratory certification, quality systems, performance assessment, and laboratory personnel. Consent and classification standards are included, defining informed consent as a process by which persons voluntarily confirm willingness to participate in a testing act after being informed of all relevant aspects, and describing Health Level Seven International (HL7) as a standards-development organization that has produced international standards for electronic reporting of laboratory results and orders and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) as the international standard diagnostic classification for coding a wide range of health-related data, as maintained by the World Health Organization. The glossary also distinguishes biological concepts, defining genetics as the study of inheritance patterns of specific traits, genome as the complete genetic content of an organism, genotype as the genetic makeup with reference to a single trait, set of traits, or complex of traits, and phenotype as the observed biochemical, physiological, and morphological characteristics of an individual as determined by genotype and environment.

### Role of thiopurine metabolite testing and thiopurine methyltransferase determination in pediatric IBD [^25cd32e7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

Thiopurine metabolite testing — disadvantages and limitations include that two major potential disadvantages of testing TP metabolites fall into 2 broad categories (cost-versus-benefit and mistakes from misinterpretation or overinterpretation), and when levels are ordered multiple times without a specific reason they may add little to management aside from documenting adherence. The precise target levels for 6-TGN are not clear, other metabolites may be equally or more important, and overordering of laboratory tests is common, probably applying to at least 30% of all laboratory tests. Many adverse effects from TPs are not directly related to 6-TGN or 6-MMP levels; infections with TP use do not regularly correlate with leukopenia, and elevated transaminases can occur despite normal 6-MMP levels. It is also presently uncertain that attaining certain levels of 6-TGN will be sufficient to treat a particular patient, target ranges are only guidelines, and if a patient is not responding, consideration should be given to increasing the dose provided there is no evidence of toxicity.

### Laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19: current issues and challenges [^5da999f5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 outbreak has had a major impact on clinical microbiology laboratories in the past several months. This commentary covers current issues and challenges for the laboratory diagnosis of infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the preanalytical stage, collecting the proper respiratory tract specimen at the right time from the right anatomic site is essential for a prompt and accurate molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. Appropriate measures are required to keep laboratory staff safe while producing reliable test results. In the analytic stage, real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays remain the molecular test of choice for the etiologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection while antibody-based techniques are being introduced as supplemental tools. In the postanalytical stage, testing results should be carefully interpreted using both molecular and serological findings. Finally, random-access, integrated devices available at the point of care with scalable capacities will facilitate the rapid and accurate diagnosis and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections and greatly assist in the control of this outbreak.

### Failed attempts to reduce inappropriate laboratory utilization in an emergency department setting in Cyprus: lessons learned [^362e2169]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Laboratory test ordering is a significant part of the diagnosis definition and disease treatment monitoring process. Inappropriate laboratory test ordering wastes scarce resources, places unnecessary burden on the health care delivery system, and exposes patients to unnecessary discomfort. Inappropriate ordering is caused by many factors, such as lack of guidelines, defensive medicine, thoughtless ordering, and lack of awareness of costs incurred to the system.

Objectives

The purpose of this study is to assess two successive measures, which were introduced in a Cyprus emergency department (ED) for the purpose of synergistically reducing inappropriate laboratory ordering: the introduction of a copayment fee to reduce nonemergent visits, and the development of a Web-based protocol defining the tests emergency physicians could order.

Methods

An autoregressive integrated moving average model for interrupted time series analysis was constructed. Data include number and type of tests ordered, along with number of visits for a period of 4 years from an ED in Cyprus.

Results

Copayment fee and introduction of a revised Web-based protocol for a test ordering form did not reduce the number of ordered tests in the ED unit. Copayment fee alone resulted in a statistically significant reduction in ED visits.

Conclusions

The implementation of two consecutive measures resulted in an increase of ordered tests per patient. Laboratory ordering is a multidimensional process that is primarily supplier induced, therefore, all underlying possible causes must be scrutinized by health authorities. These include lack of guidelines, defensive medicine and thoughtless prescribing. To attain significant gains, an integrated approach must be implemented.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^37f87728]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.
