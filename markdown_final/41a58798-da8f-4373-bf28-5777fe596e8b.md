## Question

How does subendocardial ischemia differ from an NSTEMI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how subendocardial ischemia differs from an NSTEMI, including definitions, mechanisms, diagnostic criteria, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions anchored to the Universal Definition of MI. Then, I should compare pathophysiology and typical anatomic patterns. Next, I will verify diagnostic thresholds and algorithms with ECG, biomarkers, and imaging. After that, I will analyze infarct characteristics and the natural history from ischemia to infarction. Finally, I will integrate management differences, especially type 1 versus type 2 NSTEMI and the role of invasive strategies.

> Let me first confirm the definitions to avoid conflating physiology and diagnosis. Subendocardial ischemia is a pathophysiologic state of inadequate perfusion affecting the inner myocardial layer, typically non-transmural and often due to flow-limiting stenosis or supply–demand mismatch, which does not inherently imply myocyte necrosis or meet MI criteria by itself, whereas NSTEMI is a clinical diagnosis requiring a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit plus clinical, ECG, imaging, or angiographic evidence of ischemia, so I need to ensure I keep "ischemia without necrosis" separate from "ischemia with necrosis" here.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms before I separate type 1 from type 2 MI. In type 1 NSTEMI, plaque rupture or erosion with a non-occlusive thrombus typically yields downstream subendocardial necrosis, whereas in type 2 NSTEMI, an oxygen supply–demand imbalance without acute atherothrombosis triggers necrosis; in contrast, subendocardial ischemia alone represents a reversible state that may not progress to necrosis unless prolonged, so I should confirm that troponin release is the key discriminator for MI in both type 1 and type 2 contexts [^113dtKcZ] [^113Lmxtq] [^114mEU8G] [^114LTuKX].

> I need to check the diagnostic criteria next, particularly how ECG and troponin interplay. NSTEMI is characterized by the absence of persistent ST-segment elevation and may present with ST depression, T-wave inversion, or even a nondiagnostic ECG, whereas subendocardial ischemia without infarction often shows transient ST depression or T-wave changes without the required troponin dynamics; high-sensitivity troponin algorithms using 0 hour/1 hour or 0 hour/2 hour serial testing operationalize the rise/fall threshold and improve rule-in and rule-out accuracy, and I should double-check that imaging evidence of new wall motion abnormality can support the diagnosis when biomarker and ECG are borderline [^111QnpBh] [^115wc2F7] [^112fpq23].

> Let me consider infarct characteristics to avoid overgeneralization. Subendocardial infarction, the typical pattern in NSTEMI, is non-transmural and often patchy on imaging and histology, and compared with STEMI the infarct size is generally smaller, with many NSTEMI patients having modest CK-MB peaks or even no CK-MB elevation and being diagnosed by troponin alone; I should confirm this pattern aligns with contemporary imaging and biomarker data, which it does in translational models and clinical cohorts [^1122UDY6] [^111uHmHq].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and management to ensure I don't misapply therapies. If subendocardial ischemia has not produced necrosis (i.e., unstable angina within NSTE-ACS), initial management is anti-ischemic therapy and risk stratification, whereas NSTEMI mandates antithrombotic therapy with dual antiplatelet treatment and anticoagulation plus an early invasive strategy for high-risk features, with type 1 NSTEMI typically benefiting from revascularization and type 2 NSTEMI prioritizing treatment of the precipitating imbalance with a tailored approach to angiography; I need to verify supportive guidance around adjuncts such as IV nitroglycerin, selective morphine use, and nondihydropyridine CCBs when beta-blockers are contraindicated [^116b9UiC] [^113fb6dS] [^111S5BwM] [^1123TN3u] [^115tFtVs] [^1116Kedt] [^113dtKcZ] [^117KDdFL].

> Wait, let me verify the boundary between unstable angina and NSTEMI in the high-sensitivity troponin era. The critical distinction is a dynamic rise and/or fall in troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile plus corroborating ischemic evidence for MI; subendocardial ischemia without such biomarker dynamics remains unstable angina, and high-sensitivity assays have reduced UA prevalence by detecting smaller amounts of necrosis that previously went unnoticed, so I need to ensure serial sampling and context-specific interpretation to avoid overcalling chronic elevations as acute MI [^112fpq23] [^116CA3FM] [^114RtLDP].

> But wait, what if I mistakenly equate NSTEMI with non-occlusive disease only? Hmm, wait a minute, up to a quarter of NSTEMI cases may actually harbor an occlusive culprit, particularly LCx territory events with subtle or posterior changes, which means I should maintain a high index of suspicion for "occlusion MI" physiology within NSTEMI phenotypes and triage very high-risk NSTE-ACS features to immediate angiography rather than delay based solely on the ECG label [^114rht7p] [^113fb6dS].

> I will now examine special diagnostic branches to avoid premature closure. If angiography shows non-obstructive coronaries in a troponin-positive presentation, I should consider the MINOCA algorithm to identify alternative ischemic mechanisms or non-ischemic diagnoses, and if troponin is elevated without ischemic features I should step back and assess non-ACS causes of myocardial injury; integrating history, exam, ECG, and serial high-sensitivity troponin within guideline algorithms helps ensure I classify the syndrome correctly before committing to an invasive pathway [^112K3Rrr] [^11219eGm].

Subendocardial ischemia is **reversible ischemia** of the inner myocardium without necrosis, typically showing ST depression or T-wave inversion on ECG [^notfound] and normal troponin [^116CA3FM]. NSTEMI is **irreversible necrosis** from prolonged ischemia, defined by a rise/fall of troponin above the 99th percentile [^116CA3FM] with ischemic symptoms or ECG changes, but without persistent ST elevation. Thus, subendocardial ischemia is a functional, reversible state, while NSTEMI is a structural, irreversible injury requiring urgent evaluation and management.

---

## Pathophysiological differences

Subendocardial ischemia is a **reversible oxygen supply–demand mismatch** in the subendocardium, often due to transient coronary narrowing, vasospasm [^11336zs3], or increased demand (e.g. tachycardia, hypertension, anemia) [^113Yc72b]. NSTEMI reflects **irreversible necrosis** from prolonged ischemia, usually from partial coronary occlusion [^113Yc72b] or severe supply–demand mismatch, with myocyte death and troponin release [^113ys8wf].

---

## Clinical presentation

Clinically, **subendocardial ischemia** presents with transient chest discomfort or angina, often exertional or stress-related, relieved by rest or nitrates [^113Yc72b], and symptoms are typically brief and reversible. NSTEMI typically presents with **prolonged chest pain or discomfort** — often at rest or with minimal exertion — not fully relieved by rest or nitrates, and may be accompanied by dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, or syncope [^111aQLPY].

---

## Electrocardiographic findings

On ECG, **subendocardial ischemia** shows transient ST depression or T-wave inversion [^113Yc72b] that resolves with relief of ischemia, without persistent ST elevation. NSTEMI may show **ST depression, T-wave inversion, or nonspecific changes**, without persistent ST elevation; the ECG can also be normal [^111uHmHq].

---

## Biomarker differences

Regarding biomarkers, **subendocardial ischemia** shows no significant troponin elevation [^1161CdFN] because there is no necrosis, whereas **NSTEMI** shows elevated troponin (rise and/or fall with at least one value above the 99th percentile) [^111QnpBh], indicating necrosis [^112fpq23].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

| **Parameter** | **Subendocardial ischemia** | **NSTEMI** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical symptoms | Transient, reversible ischemic symptoms [^113Yc72b] | Prolonged ischemic symptoms [^113fb6dS] |
| ECG findings | Transient ST depression or T-wave inversion [^113Yc72b] | ST depression, T-wave inversion, or nonspecific changes [^111uHmHq] |
| Cardiac biomarkers | Normal troponin levels [^1161CdFN] | Elevated troponin levels [^111QnpBh] |
| Myocardial necrosis | Absent [^113Yc72b] | Present [^113ys8wf] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Regarding management, **subendocardial ischemia** is treated with anti-ischemic therapy (nitrates [^1123TN3u], beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers) [^1116Kedt], risk factor modification, and close monitoring; urgent invasive intervention is not indicated unless progression occurs [^111aQLPY]. NSTEMI requires **urgent evaluation and an early invasive strategy** (angiography and possible revascularization) [^111QnpBh] in high-risk patients [^113fb6dS]; dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and guideline-directed medical therapy are essential [^1157AyYy].

---

## Prognostic differences

Prognostically, **subendocardial ischemia** generally has a favorable outlook because there is no necrosis, whereas NSTEMI carries a **higher risk of adverse outcomes** [^114MNqKw], including recurrent MI, heart failure, and death [^114vHFXe], due to necrosis; overall prognosis depends on infarct size, comorbidities, and management [^113Lfp78].

---

Subendocardial ischemia is a **reversible supply–demand mismatch without necrosis**, while NSTEMI is **irreversible necrosis with elevated troponin**; distinguishing them guides appropriate management and prognosis [^116CA3FM].

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^116CA3FM]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Clinically, myocardial infarction (MI) is defined by the presence of acute myocardial injury, as detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers (e.g. cardiac troponins [cTn]) presenting with symptoms of myocardial ischemia accompanied by an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), imaging, or angiographic findings.

- **Diagnosis of NSTEMI**:
	- The diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is covered in extensive detail elsewhere, including European and US clinical practice guidelines. In summary, in NSTEMI, a 12-lead ECG may show a depressed ST-segment or T-wave insertion, whereas in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), an ECG shows persistent (> 20 minutes) ST-segment elevation or new left bundle-branch block. Cardiac troponin testing, in combination with an ECG, has become an essential tool for accurately diagnosing MI and is mandatory for patients showing characteristics of an NSTEMI on ECG. The cardiac troponin test enables distinction between NSTEMI and unstable angina and, therefore, is an important aid in risk stratification and treatment decisions.

Cardiac troponin is a specific cardiac structural protein associated with myocyte injury of any type. Although elevated blood cardiac troponin is not specific to acute coronary events, cardiac troponin testing is highly sensitive in detecting small amounts of myocardial necrosis. In a study examining the utility of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays, more high-risk patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with unspecified chest pain were identified and admitted to the hospital than when conventional cardiac troponin assays were used. This improved triage.

### Cardiac troponin at the point of care in acute and chronic coronary syndromes [^112fpq23]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes encompass a spectrum of acute conditions, including ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina. These presentations have a common underlying pathophysiology, with the majority due to coronary atherosclerotic plaque rupture with thrombosis resulting in myocardial ischaemia. The mortality of acute coronary syndromes is highest within hours of symptom onset, and prompt diagnosis can allow timely delivery of life-saving treatments that improve prognosis. The electrocardiogram is essential for differentiating STEMI from NSTEMI, whilst measuring cardiac troponin is required to rule in or rule out myocardial infarction in those without ST-segment elevation and to differentiate NSTEMI from unstable angina.

For a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin is required, with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL), in addition to one of the following: symptoms of myocardial ischaemia, new ischaemic changes on the electrocardiogram, the development of pathological Q-waves, imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality, or identification of atherothrombosis on coronary angiography.

The term chronic coronary syndrome is more recent and encompasses a range of clinical presentations due to diseases of the coronary arteries and/or microcirculation resulting in structural or functional abnormalities that result in transient myocardial ischaemia.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^113Lfp78]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Despite the prognostic implications of troponin levels in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), guidelines for urgent revascularization in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients do not incorporate this biomarker in their decision-making process regarding treatment. In our study, we have demonstrated an association between high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) levels upon admission and overall survival in patients diagnosed with NSTEMI. Furthermore, we identified a subgroup that is at a heightened risk of mortality according to their initial hs-cTnI level. Interestingly, this association becomes less significant when early reperfusion strategy is considered. These findings may suggest that initial hs-cTnI levels could be an additional factor when determining reperfusion strategies in NSTEMI patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to investigate the impact of early reperfusion strategies on mortality in NSTEMI patients categorized by their initial presenting troponin levels.

### Prognostic value of admission electrocardiographic findings in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^115PUVTs]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Although our study showed that TSTE was the least frequent finding on the admission ECG and had no prognostic value for short-term outcomes, our investigation into this finding still bears important clinical implications since it is unclear at present whether TSTE myocardial infarction (TSTEMI) should be considered a variant of STEMI or a subgroup of NSTEMI. Previous studies have revealed that TSTEMI is associated with less ischemic damage and better short- or long-term outcomes than STEMI.

In this study, we explored TSTEMI in the context of NSTEMI and found that it had similar in-hospital and 30-day outcomes as the other three categories, regardless of whether patients received invasive management. These results corroborated data from several observational studies showing no differences in outcomes during hospitalization or short-term follow-up. From this perspective, TSTEMI seems to behave more like NSTEMI than STEMI. However, Badings et al. and Blondheim et al. have reported favorable long-term outcomes in TSTEMI vs. NSTEMI patients.

In addition, Lemkes et al. recently performed a randomized study to assess the effect of an immediate vs. a delayed invasive strategy in patients with TSTEMI and found no difference in myocardial-infarct size or 30-day outcomes between these two strategies. Badings et al. also found that in patients with high-risk NSTE-ACS, early angiography and revascularization in TSTE patients were not superior to later treatment. Thus, long-term outcomes and management of TSTEMI might be somewhat different from those of NSTEMI.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^113dtKcZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Advances in cardiovascular (CV) imaging, redefined electrocardiogram criteria, and high-sensitivity CV biomarker assays have enabled a more differentiated etiological classification of myocardial infarction (MI). Type 1 MI has a different underlying pathophysiology than type 2 through type 5 MI; type 1 MI is characterized primarily by intracoronary atherothrombosis, whereas the other types involve a variety of mechanisms, which can occur with or without an atherosclerotic component. In type 2 MI, there is evidence of myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance unrelated to acute coronary atherothrombosis. Types 1 and 2 MI are spontaneous events, while type 4 and type 5 are procedure-related; type 3 MI is identified only after death.

Most type 1 and type 2 MI present as non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), although both types can also present as ST-elevation MI. Because of their different underlying etiologies, type 1 and type 2 NSTEMI have different presentations and prognoses and should be managed differently. In this article, we discuss the epidemiology, prognosis, and management of NSTEMI occurring in the setting of underlying type 1 or type 2 pathophysiology. Most NSTEMI (65%–90%) are type 1 MI. Patients with type 2 MI have multiple comorbidities, and the causes of in-hospital mortality among these patients are not always CV-related. It is important to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 NSTEMI early in the clinical course to allow for the use of the most appropriate treatments that will provide the greatest benefit for these patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to patients with postoperative myocardial infarction, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend initiating guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with NSTEMI following non-cardiac surgery. This is recommended similarly to patients in the general population, but with modifications imposed by the specific non-cardiac surgical procedure and the severity of the NSTEMI.

In terms of medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, particularly concerning pain and anxiety management, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of NSAIDs (except aspirin). They advise discontinuing these medications during hospitalization for NSTEMI if they were initiated prior, due to the increased risk of major adverse cardiac events.

### Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the United States: Contemporary trends in incidence, utilization of the early invasive strategy, and in-hospital outcomes [^1114vLGc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

We report an increasing trend in the proportion of NSTEMI admissions for the overall cohort and in the age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-stratified subgroups from 2002 to 2011. This is associated with an increase in utilization of EIS, decreased in-hospital mortality, and decreased length of stay during the same period.

Analysis of the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction from 1990 to 2006 reported an increase in the proportion of NSTEMI from 14.2% in 1990 to 59.1% in 2006 (P < 0.001). The proportional increase in NSTEMI may be the result of an aging population, increasing chronic comorbidities, and reduction in smoking. Part of the increase in the proportion of NSTEMI in our study may be attributable to increased utilization and higher sensitivity of cardiac biomarkers (troponins). In the age- and sex-stratified analysis, patients ≥ 75 years and women had the greatest proportional increase in NSTEMI. Women are also more likely to present with NSTEMI compared to men. Older patients are more likely to be women and have significant comorbidities that predispose them to NSTEMI.

### Change in T/QRS ratio can be a supplementary diagnostic tool in predicting coronary artery disease in patients with NSTEMI [^112AczYX]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Changes in the electrocardiographic findings, namely the ratio T sum to QRS sum (T/QRS ratio), between the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) and the baseline ECG have rarely been investigated in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Thus, we aimed to determine whether changes in various parameters on ECG, including the T/QRS ratio, can assist in distinguishing between coronary artery disease (CAD) and NSTEMI without CAD with low to moderate risk.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study enrolled 2,572 patients who presented ischemic symptoms, were diagnosed with NSTEMI, and underwent coronary angiography. Overall, 388 patients had prior ECG and echocardiography data available. Following exclusions of patients with other cardiac diseases except CAD, 110 patients were included. The population was divided into two groups: a coronary stenosis group (n = 78) and a normal coronary group (n = 32) were analyzed.

- **Results**: We found that acute dynamic change in the most deviated T/QRS ratio in each region of leads on the initial ECG, from those of remote/recent ECG, was an extremely strong predictor of acute CAD (odds ratio, 110; p < 0.05). A T/QRS ratio change greater than 1.5 or less than 0.5 times in injured regional leads was a significant predictor of CAD.

- **Conclusion**: Change in the most deviated T/QRS ratio in the regional leads on the initial ECG from the T/QRS ratio in the same lead on remote ECG can assist in predicting CAD risk between patients with CAD and those with NSTEMI without CAD.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and more specifically with respect to prognostic assessment, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend using risk scores to assess prognosis in patients with NSTEMI. It is advisable to consider using risk stratification models in the management of patients with NSTEMI.

### Acute coronary syndromes: Mechanisms, challenges, and new opportunities [^114rht7p]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

While STEMI patients proceed immediately to revascularization, risk stratification for those with NSTE-ACS remains challenging. Importantly, up to one-quarter of NSTEMI patients have coronary occlusion responsive to immediate revascularization therapy. Dedicated ACS guidelines endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology suggest guiding the timing (immediate vs. early) based on factors such as > 3% in-hospital mortality risk, transient ST-segment elevation, and dynamic ST-segment/T-wave changes, or 'non-high' which indicates an absence of any risk features or a low suspicion of unstable angina (UA).

This scheme does not fully reflect our understanding of ACS pathobiology. While ST-segment elevation on ECG indicates transmural infarction and thus coronary occlusion, about 5% of patients with STEMI have no occlusion. In contrast, up to 25% of NSTEMI patients have occlusive myocardial infarction. Specifically, occlusion of the left circumflex artery or large diagonal branches may result in subtle ECG changes, such as ST-depression, which are often undetected by the human eye. These findings indicate the need for innovation in the triage of patients with ACS.

The benefit of using the GRACE risk score further underscores the importance of understanding ACS pathobiology and improving patient management.

### Mortality based on the presenting electrocardiogram in patients with myocardial infarction in the troponin era [^111uHmHq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Studies reporting short-term mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) based on the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) are often limited by requiring an ischemic ECG for inclusion. Because few patients with normal or nonspecific findings were included, outcomes in these patients are less clear, especially in the troponin era.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients diagnosed as having MI using troponin I (TnI) over a six-year period were included and classified into eight mutually exclusive groups based on the initial ECG using standard criteria. Patients were included in only one group. The MI size was estimated using multiples of peak creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and the 30-day mortality rate was assessed.

- **Results**: Among 1641 patients with MI, patients with ST elevation represented only 22% of all MIs. Patients with ST elevation had the largest MI size, with two out of three having a peak CK-MB greater than ten times normal. In contrast, most of the patients representing all the other ECG groups had a peak CK-MB less than five times normal, with approximately one of three having no CK-MB elevation and were diagnosed by TnI elevation alone. Patients could be separated into a high-risk group (ST elevation, ischemia, other, or left bundle-branch block), in which the mortality rate exceeded 9% (mean, 14%), and a lower-risk group (prior MI, left ventricular hypertrophy, nonspecific changes, and normal), in which the 30-day mortality rate averaged 6% (P < .001; range, 5.23%-7.1%).

- **Conclusions**: Specific ECG findings other than ischemia portend poor outcomes in patients with MI.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^112YU71j]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

A total of 665 patients with NSTEMI were screened; of them, 27 were excluded due to missing data, and 94 were excluded due to loss of follow-up. Hence, the final study population included 544 patients. The mean age was 68 (± 11) years, and 122 (22%) were female. Three hundred and fifty (64%) patients suffered from hypertension, 233 (43%) from diabetes mellitus (DM), 342 (63%) from dyslipidemia, 184 (34%) were active smokers, and 39 (7%) had previous myocardial infarction (MI).

- **Hs-cTnI levels at presentation**: Hs‐cTnI levels in each quartile were: (a) ≤ 122, (b) 123–680, (c) 681–2877, and (d) ≥ 2878 ng/L. The median initial hs‐cTnI level was 680 ng/L (range 0–150,008 ng/L). There were no differences in age or comorbidities between the four initial hs‐cTnI level quartiles. The prevalence of male gender, higher peak level of hs‐cTnI during admission, and C‐reactive protein (CRP) were greater in the fourth quartile than in the first quartile. Stratifying NSTEMI patients based on gender resulted in distinct cutpoints. In male patients, the cutpoints were as follows: (a) ≤ 217, (b) 218–698, (c) 699–3276, and (d) ≥ 3277 ng/L. Conversely, female patients exhibited lower values, as anticipated, with the following cutpoints: (a) ≤ 100, (b) 101–612, (c) 613–2449, and (d) ≥ 2450 ng/L.

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: Understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^114LTuKX]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Challenges for the treatment of patients with NSTEMI**:

- **Patient characteristics**: Patients with NSTEMI present with more heterogeneous characteristics than those with STEMI, with significant variation in ischemic risk and comorbid conditions, making diagnosis and treatment more challenging. Whereas patients with STEMI typically have complete occlusion of a large epicardial coronary artery, those with NSTEMI are often affected by multiple factors, including varying degrees of coronary flow reduction, atherosclerotic changes in the vessel wall, calcification, plaque rupture, and subsequent non-occlusive intracoronary thrombus formation. In a study of patients hospitalized with MI who underwent coronary angiography in Alberta, Canada, of the 2092 patients with MI with nonobstructive coronary arteries, 1542 (73.7%) received a diagnosis of NSTEMI, while 550 (26.3%) were diagnosed with STEMI.

- **Demographic heterogeneity**: There is also considerable heterogeneity in the demographics of NSTEMI patient populations worldwide, as indicated by the variety of patient demographic data across different countries. This demographic variability could partly explain the differences in mortality rates of patients with cardiovascular disease between countries.

Furthermore, patients with NSTEMI are more likely to be older and exhibit a higher rate of comorbidities, such as diabetes, impaired renal function, and lung disease, compared to patients with STEMI. These comorbidities contribute to a greater burden of coronary artery disease and an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to female patients, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend managing female patients with NSTEMI with the same pharmacological therapy as for male patients for acute care and for secondary prevention, with attention to weight and/or renally calculated doses of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents to reduce bleeding risk.

### Myocardial ischemic syndromes: A new nomenclature to harmonize evolving international clinical practice guidelines [^115Ch515]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Since the 1960s, cardiologists have adopted several binary classification systems for acute myocardial infarction (MI) that facilitated improved patient management. Conversely, for chronic stable manifestations of myocardial ischemia, various classifications have emerged over time, often with conflicting terminology, such as "stable coronary artery disease" (CAD), "stable ischemic heart disease", and "chronic coronary syndromes" (CCS). While the 2019 European guidelines introduced CCS to impart symmetry with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS), the 2023 American guidelines endorsed the alternative term "chronic coronary disease". An unintended consequence of these competing classifications is the perpetuation of the restrictive terms "coronary" and "disease", often connoting only a singular obstructive CAD mechanism.

It is now important to advance a more broadly inclusive terminology for both obstructive and non-obstructive causes of angina and myocardial ischemia that fosters conceptual clarity and unifies dyssynchronous nomenclatures across guidelines. We, therefore, propose a new binary classification of "acute myocardial ischemic syndromes" and "non-acute myocardial ischemic syndromes", which comprises both obstructive epicardial and non-obstructive pathogenetic mechanisms, including microvascular dysfunction, vasospastic disorders, and non-coronary causes. We herein retain accepted categories of ACS, ST-segment elevation MI, and non-ST-segment elevation MI, as important subsets for which revascularization is of proven clinical benefit, as well as new terms like ischemia and MI with.

### Non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction with "N" wave on electrocardiogram and culprit vessel in left circumflex has a risk equivalent to ST-elevated myocardial infarction [^112gj29N]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

It was found that the delayed activation wave often appeared in the terminal QRS wave in non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with the culprit vessel in the left circumflex artery (LCX). However, little is known about the similarities among non-"N"-wave non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction (N-NSTEMI) and ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI).

- **Hypothesis**: In AMI patients with the culprit vessel in LCX, "N" wave NSTEMI has a risk equivalent to STEMI.

- **Methods**: All 874 patients admitted to Shenjing Hospital of China Medical University between January 1, 2013, and December 30, 2017, were included, and whose coronary angiography (CAG) indicated the culprit vessel in LCX. Patients were divided into three groups: ST-elevated myocardial infarction group (STEMI group, n = 322), "N" wave non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction group (N-NSTEMI group, n = 232), and non-"N"-wave NSTEMI group (non N-NSTEMI group, n = 320). The basic data and the incidence of MACE during hospitalization and 12 months were analyzed.

- **Results**: In the STEMI and N-NSTEMI groups, AST, CK, CK-MB, TnI, and stenosis severity were significantly higher than in non N-NSTEMI (p < 0.05). The lesions in the N-NSTEMI and STEMI groups were more often located proximal LCX before giving rise to OM1 of LCX (p < 0.05). However, the non N-NSTEMI group was often located distal LCX after giving rise to OM1 and the OM1 (p < 0.05). The incidence rates of all MACEs, all-cause death, ST, TVR, and rUAP were similar in the N-NSTEMI and STEMI groups, which were greater than in non N-NSTEMI (p < 0.05). Both N-NSTEMI and STEMI are independent risk factors for MA

### Fractional flow reserve vs. angiography in guiding management to optimize outcomes in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: The British Heart Foundation FAMOUS-NSTEMI randomized trial [^114mEU8G]. European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

In invasively managed NSTEMI patients, the standard care approach involves visual interpretation of the anatomical severity of disease disclosed by the coronary angiogram. Adoption of a physiological approach to inform treatment decisions in invasively managed NSTEMI patients is not the standard of care mainly because of a lack of evidence. The specific uncertainties for FFR adoption relate to a lack of evidence for FFR measurement in culprit arteries.

- **Coronary resistance**:
	- When coronary resistance is reduced by vasodilator drugs, such as adenosine, the curvilinear relationship between coronary pressure and flow becomes approximately linear in the physiological range of blood pressure. Following STEMI, vascular injury may limit microvascular vasodilatation, and this may limit the validity of FFR, which is by definition a hyperaemic index.

- **Pathophysiology in NSTEMI**:
	- In NSTEMI, the pathophysiology of the culprit artery is typically non-occlusive thrombotic plaque rupture and subendocardial infarction. Since FFR was measured in coronary arteries with normal blood flow, microvascular dysfunction may have been limited, transient, or absent in the participants in this trial. The post hoc analysis of medically stabilized ACS patients in the FAME trial also supports the validity of FFR.

### Clinical utility of ventricular repolarization dispersion for real-time detection of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in emergency departments [^116K36w7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that T-wave complexity on baseline 12-lead ECG not only can differentiate NSTEMI patients from UA and other nonischemic chest pain patients very early during evaluation, but also correlate with the risk of adverse in-hospital outcomes. This is the first study to test the clinical utility of T-wave complexity to detect and risk stratify NSTEMI patients in the ED. Our findings are novel and support the notion that global myocardial ischemia, associated with ruptured plaques and partial coronary artery occlusion, can precipitate quantifiable T-wave distortions before any ST segment displacement. This makes sense because ischemic injury is most likely to alter local gradients of repolarization manifested in the T waves (i.e. phase 3 of the action potentials) before distorting the ST segment (i.e. phase 2 of the action potentials) of the ECG. As such, our data suggest that a simple measure of T-wave complexity is more sensitive for (1) detecting ischemic myocardial necrosis associated with NSTEMI and (2) quantifying the severity of ischemic burden to identify high-risk NSTEMI patients who would benefit from early revascularization.

- **Vrd and ischemic myocardial injury**: Myocardial ischemia induces electrophysiological alterations in action potentials, causing repolarization dispersion between normal and ischemic fibers and between epicardium and endocardium, which can be detected on the surface 12-lead ECG. However, despite the ongoing electrical dispersion currents during infarction (whether STEMI or NSTEMI), ST changes mainly evolve when action pot

With respect to medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, particularly in managing pain and anxiety, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend considering the administration of IV morphine sulfate in patients with NSTEMI. This is advised in the absence of contraindications if there is continued ischemic chest pain despite treatment with maximally tolerated anti-ischemic medications.

### Myocardial infarction classification on outcomes in nonemergent coronary artery bypass grafting [^1179z154]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Although patients with ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) are known to have worse outcomes than patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMIs), such differences are not well described in the subset of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The purpose of this study is to compare postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing nonemergent coronary artery bypass grafting within one week following a STEMI versus NSTEMI.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was performed on patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between 1 and 7 days from an MI from 2008 to 2012. Postoperative outcomes, including mortality and composite postoperative morbidity for patients with STEMI versus NSTEMI, were compared within each group.

- **Results**: Of the 446 patients undergoing nonemergent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between 1 and 7 days after an MI, 122 patients (27.3%) had a STEMI. The STEMI cohort was younger with less incidence of hypertension than the NSTEMI cohort. However, aside from having a lower incidence of congestive heart failure, STEMI patients had an overall poorer cardiac status than NSTEMI patients. No differences were found in mortality, rates of major complications, length of intensive care unit stay, and length of hospital stay between STEMI and NSTEMI patients.

- **Conclusion**: Despite differences in preoperative characteristics and pathophysiology of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting between 1 and 7 days after NSTEMI versus STEMI, no difference was found in early surgical outcome.

### Reproducing extracellular matrix adverse remodelling of non-ST myocardial infarction in a large animal model [^1122UDY6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We have presented a model of NSTEMI that is triggered by multiple ligations (2 cm apart) from the level of the first diagonal artery and parallel to the LAD to within 3–4 cm of the apex. We compared this procedure with animals with full ligation of the first diagonal branch to induce STEMIs. As a result of NSTEMIs, we observed patchy and non-transmural infarcts, confirmed by ECG and histological changes in the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle.

The fourth universal definition of MI requires a rise and fall of cardiac troponin (cTn) and one other criterion from the following: symptoms of acute ischaemia, new ischaemic ECG changes, new Q-waves, loss of viable myocardium, or a new wall-motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with ischaemic aetiology via imaging. Thus, we have demonstrated that this multiple suture ligation approach results in infarcts that fulfill all of the criteria for an NSTEMI by comparing its functional response with STEMIs.

We observed a significant rise and fall of cTn over time following NSTEMI and STEMI. However, the absolute peak value of cTn does not consistently correlate with the type or size of infarction in NSTEMI. No specific cTn level differentiates STEMI from NSTEMI, but cTn values may be used for risk stratification for early intervention. In addition, typical changes of NSTEMI on ECG in sheep reflected the standard range of changes classified as NSTEMI in the clinical setting. Moreover, histology showed definitive partial thickness myocardial necrosis and fibrosis.

### Rapid diagnosis of STEMI equivalent in patients with left bundle-branch block: Is it feasible [^115dJivP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

It is conceivable that patients with underlying left bundle‐branch block (LBBB) can present with AMI with either STEMI equivalent (acute occlusion of an epicardial artery) or NSTEMI equivalent physiology. LBBB distorts the surface ECG, resulting in secondary ST‐T changes that interfere with the interpretation and identification of ischemia (STEMI and NSTEMI).

In the past, the presence of new or presumably new LBBB in a patient with symptoms compatible with AMI was considered a class I indication for emergent reperfusion therapy (STEMI‐equivalent, also known as occlusion MI, or OMI). However, the 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Guideline for the Management of STEMI states: "A new or presumably new LBBB has been considered a STEMI equivalent. Most cases of LBBB at the time of presentation, however, are 'not known to be old' because a prior ECG is not available for comparison. New or presumably new LBBB at presentation occurs infrequently, may interfere with ST‐elevation analysis, and should not be considered diagnostic of AMI in isolation".

The European Society of Cardiology guidelines acknowledge the difficulties in diagnosing STEMI equivalent in patients with LBBB. These guidelines consequently recommend that patients with a clinical suspicion of ongoing refractory myocardial ischemia, "regardless of ECG or biomarker findings", should be managed in a way similar to patients with STEMI, regardless of the presence or absence of LBBB, or whether the LBBB is previously known.

### Risk score to predict need for intensive care in initially hemodynamically stable adults with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^114cYLp7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

The ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network) score is a clinical calculator used to predict the risk of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). It is specifically designed for patients diagnosed with NSTEMI, a type of heart attack that does not manifest the classic EKG change known as ST elevation.

The ACTION score is clinically useful in stratifying patients based on their risk of requiring ICU admission, which can guide clinicians in making informed decisions about the level of care needed. This scoring system considers various factors, including patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory results.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for using the ACTION score. However, it is important to note its inapplicability to patients with other types of heart attacks, such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), or to patients with chest pain of non-cardiac origin. Additionally, it is less accurate in cases where data for any of the variables included in the score is missing.

The ACTION score calculator estimates the risk of ICU admission for patients with NSTEMI by evaluating responses to nine specific health criteria, each with a predefined score. The sum of these scores reflects the patient's risk of developing complications necessitating ICU care.

### Prevalence, predictors, and outcomes of type 2 NSTEMI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^117KDdFL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is a subtype of acute coronary syndrome resulting from either partial or total occlusion of coronary artery blood flow. The majority of NSTEMI cases involve partial, flow-limiting occlusions rather than total obstructions. While type 1 myocardial infarction is characterized primarily by intracoronary atherothrombotic plaque rupture, a type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI) occurs due to an oxygen supply and demand mismatch in the absence of acute atherothrombosis. T2MI can occur in the context of fixed atherosclerosis without plaque rupture, either alone or in combination with coronary vasospasm, sustained tachyarrhythmias, severe hypertension, severe bradyarrhythmias, respiratory failure, or severe anemia, among other causes.

Comorbid risk factors for patients with T2MI include anemia, sepsis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF), hypertension, and arrhythmias. T2MI has been associated with higher mortality compared to type 1 myocardial infarction, typically occurring in older patients, more often female, and with a higher prevalence of cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities.

Since the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, myocardial injury characterized as acute or chronic has been reported as a cardiovascular complication associated with adverse outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Acute myocardial injury is defined as a significant elevation of cardiac troponin above the 99th percentile upper reference.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically in relation to cardiac troponin, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend using an ESC algorithmic approach with serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements (0 hour/1 hour or 0 hour/2 hours) to rule in and rule out NSTEMI.

### Biomarkers and acute coronary syndromes: An update [^1161CdFN]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Biomarkers complement clinical assessment and the 12-lead ECG in the diagnosis, risk stratification, triage, and management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). While there is broad consensus that cardiac troponin (cTn) I or T is the preferred biomarker in clinical practice, important uncertainties remain regarding the value of high-sensitivity cTn assays. These uncertainties include the assays' best clinical use, the most appropriate timing of serial measurements, and the added value of other biomarkers reflecting and quantifying other pathophysiological signals, such as copeptin and natriuretic peptides. This review addresses these aspects with a focus on the diagnostic application of biomarkers, as they are associated with immediate therapeutic consequences. In addition, this review briefly highlights that increased diagnostic accuracy offered by high-sensitivity cTn assays has contributed to improving our understanding of the incidence, pathophysiology, and mortality of the two distinct components currently summarized under the term ACS: acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^112Ft58r]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

**Prevalence of type 1 and type 2 MI in NSTEMI**: Results from a number of studies suggest that between 65% and 90% of NSTEMI events are pathophysiologically type 1 MI, depending on the clinical setting and the diagnostic criteria used. For example, in one prospective study of 541 hospitalized patients, 406 (73.4%) were diagnosed with NSTEMI; of these, 267 patients (65.8%) had type 1 NSTEMI and 139 (34.2%) had type 2 NSTEMI. A single-center retrospective study of 1039 patients with a discharge diagnosis of NSTEMI found that 775 (74.6%) patients had type 1 NSTEMI and 264 (25.4%) had type 2 NSTEMI; none had type 4 or 5 MI. In contrast, in a larger prospective analysis of 19,763 hospitalizations for acute MI, the proportion of type 1 NSTEMI appeared to be even greater. Of the 13,211 patients who did not have ST-segment elevation, approximately 90% had a diagnosis consistent with type 1 NSTEMI and only 10% with type 2 NSTEMI.

### Cardiac troponin level elevations not related to acute coronary syndromes [^11219eGm]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, cardiac troponins (cTn) have emerged as the preferred biomarkers for the noninvasive detection of myocardial injury. In conjunction with typical clinical findings of ischemia, elevated cTn levels in the blood confirm a diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

However, neither cTnT nor cTnI are exclusively released as a result of ischemic myocardial cell necrosis; they are also elevated in numerous nonischemic acute and chronic cardiac conditions such as myopericarditis, toxic injury, or severe cardiac overload. With the advent of high-sensitivity assays, causes of cTn elevation not related to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have become common findings in patients with chest pain and in those with acute or chronic systemic disorders.

Elevated cTn levels in blood are associated with increased rates of cardiac events and mortality, independently of the underlying disease. However, the clinical conditions leading to cTn release in patients who do not have ACS, and the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these individuals, are largely unknown.

Here, we provide an overview of the many causes and the prognostic importance of the release of cTn not related to ACS. We also recommend strategies to discriminate between ischemic and nonischemic cTn elevation and describe the clinical evaluation of these patients.

### Discharge timing and outcomes after uncomplicated non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction [^112CKZ7v]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Length of stay after non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) continues to decrease, but information to guide duration of hospitalization is limited.

- **Methods**: We used landmark analyses, in which the landmark defined potential days of discharge, to estimate complication rates on the first day the patient would have been out of the hospital and estimated associations between timing of discharge and 30-day and 1-year event-free survival after discharge among NSTEMI patients.

- **Results**: Among 20,410 NSTEMI patients, the median length of stay was 7 (4, 12) days; 3,209 (15.7%) experienced a cardiac complication on days 0 to 2, and 1,322 (6.5%) were discharged without complications during hospital days 0 to 2. At the start of day 3, 15,879 patients (77.8%) were still hospitalized without complications. Of these, 1,689 (10.6%) were discharged event-free on day 3. Adjusted event-free survival rates of death or myocardial infarction from day 4 to 30 days after among the 1,689 patients was 99.1% compared with 93.1% for the 14,190 who remained hospitalized at the end of day 3. For 1-year mortality, these rates were 98.1% and 96.4%, respectively. Among 13,334 patients hospitalized without complications at the start of day 4, 1,706 were discharged event-free that day. Adjusted survival rates among these patients, compared with those still hospitalized at the end of day 4, were 98.0% versus 93.7% for 30-day death or myocardial infarction and 97.8% versus 96.1% for 1-year mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with NSTEMI who had no serious complications during the first days of hospitalization showed different outcomes based on discharge timing.

### Myocardial ischemic syndromes: A new nomenclature to harmonize evolving international clinical practice guidelines [^114Tgohw]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Since the 1960s, cardiologists have adopted several binary classification systems for acute myocardial infarction (MI) that facilitated improved patient management. Conversely, for chronic stable manifestations of myocardial ischemia, various classifications have emerged over time, often with conflicting terminology, e.g. "stable coronary artery disease" (CAD), "stable ischemic heart disease", and "chronic coronary syndromes" (CCS). While the 2019 European guidelines introduced CCS to impart symmetry with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS), the 2023 American guidelines endorsed the alternative term "chronic coronary disease".

An unintended consequence of these competing classifications is the perpetuation of the restrictive terms "coronary" and "disease", often connoting only a singular obstructive CAD mechanism. It is now important to advance a more broadly inclusive terminology for both obstructive and non-obstructive causes of angina and myocardial ischemia that fosters conceptual clarity and unifies dyssynchronous nomenclatures across guidelines.

We, therefore, propose a new binary classification of "acute myocardial ischemic syndromes" and "non-acute myocardial ischemic syndromes", which comprises both obstructive epicardial and non-obstructive pathogenetic mechanisms, including microvascular dysfunction, vasospastic disorders, and non-coronary causes. We herein retain accepted categories of ACS, ST-segment elevation MI, and non-ST-segment elevation MI as important subsets for which revascularization is of proven clinical benefit.

### New definition of myocardial infarction: impact on long-term mortality [^116KTtBc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Use of cardiac troponin allows the identification of additional patients developing myocardial necrosis during an acute coronary syndrome. Novel guidelines from European and American cardiac societies recommend labeling these events as myocardial infarction. Our study evaluated the long-term mortality in the group of patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction not meeting the older World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (creatine phosphokinase) but additionally identified by the novel definition of myocardial infarction.

- **Methods**: This cohort study included 1,024 consecutive patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome classified into "unstable angina", myocardial infarction according to the WHO definition ("WHO criteria"), and myocardial infarction additionally identified by the novel definition ("additional criteria"). All patients were treated with an early invasive strategy. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during follow-up of up to 36 months.

- **Results**: During long-term follow-up (median 16 months, interquartile range 6–29 months), 67 deaths occurred. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed cumulative 3-year mortality rates of 5.6% in patients with "unstable angina", 9.1% in patients identified by "WHO criteria", and 17.5% in patients identified by "additional criteria" (P < .001). Cox regression analysis confirmed the "additional criteria" as a significant predictor of mortality (hazard ratio 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–5.0; P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: The new definition of myocardial infarction based on cardiac troponin provides a critical insight into mortality risks.

### Feasibility of prehospital identification of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction by ECG, troponin and echocardiography [^114d1FFn]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Prehospital identification and selection of treatment strategy in patients with suspected non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of prehospital ECG, troponin T (TnT), and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) acquired by paramedics in the early identification of NSTEMI.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients requesting an ambulance from Sorlandet Hospital, Norway, due to chest pain between November 2017 and January 2020 were screened for inclusion in the study. One ambulance was equipped with an ECG recorder, a point-of-care TnT test, and a TTE scanner, and six paramedics were given the necessary training. ECG, TnT results, and TTE images were acquired prehospitally and transferred to an in-hospital cardiologist. NSTEMI was suspected in patients with ischaemic ECG changes, elevated TnT, or myocardial regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) at TTE.

- **Results**: A total of 253 patients were included in the study. ECG was interpretable by cardiologists in 243 (96%), TnT in 238 (94%), and TTE images in 240 (95%) patients. NSTEMI was the discharge diagnosis in 22 (9%) of these patients. Four (18%) patients with NSTEMI had ischaemic ECG changes, elevated TnT, and RWMA at TTE. Eight (36%) patients with NSTEMI had positive findings in two of the diagnostic methods, six (27%) patients had positive findings in one, and four (18%) patients had no positive findings in any of the diagnostic methods. In three patients (14%) with NSTEMI, RWMA was the only positive test.

### STEMI and NSTEMI: Are they so different? 1 year outcomes in acute myocardial infarction as defined by the ESC/ACC definition (the OPERA registry) [^114vHFXe]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The ESC/ACC redefined myocardial infarction as any amount of necrosis caused by ischaemia. The aim of this study was to describe the management and outcomes using 'real-world' data taking the new definition of acute myocardial infarction into account.

A total of 2,151 consecutive patients (76.0% men) with a myocardial infarction were enrolled at 56 centres in France. The median delay to presentation was shorter in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) vs. non-STEMI (NSTEMI) (4 vs. 7 hours, P < 0.0001).

STEMI patients were more likely to receive fibrinolysis (28.9 vs. 0.7%, P < 0.0001) or undergo PCI (71.0 vs. 51.6%, P < 0.0001) but less likely to have bypass surgery (3.1 vs. 4.9%, P < 0.05). At discharge, patients with STEMI received more aggressive secondary prevention therapies than those with NSTEMI, which was not supported by differences in disease severity.

A total of 1,878 patients were followed-up for 1 year: 36.7% of STEMI and 41.5% of NSTEMI patients were rehospitalized (P = 0.05); 16% in both groups were revascularized. In-hospital mortality was similar (4.6 vs. 4.3%), and 1-year mortality was 9.0% in STEMI patients and 11.6% in NSTEMI patients (Log-Rank P = 0.09). Independent correlates of in-hospital mortality were untreated dyslipidaemia, advanced age, diabetes, and low blood pressure. The strongest predictors of 1-year mortality were heart failure and age, with similar predictors found in STEMI and NSTEMI subgroups.

Despite differing management, patients with STEMI and NSTEMI have similar prognoses.

### Non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction with "N" wave on electrocardiogram and culprit vessel in left circumflex has a risk equivalent to ST-elevated myocardial infarction [^115PzSvM]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

NSTEMI patients with an "N" wave in ECG indicating the LCX as the infarct‐related artery had a higher incidence of acute occlusion and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) than non N‐NSTEMI patients. They did not always have a more favorable clinical outcome than patients with acute LAD or RCA occlusion. Therefore, N‐NSTEMI has a risk equivalent to acute STEMI. These NSTEMI patients with the delayed activation wave, in which classic ST‐segment elevation is absent, may benefit from earlier revascularization.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^115Bo1RP]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) includes a spectrum spanning unstable angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Typically, ACS results from an abrupt total (STEMI and some NSTEMI) or subtotal (NSTEMI only) interruption of coronary artery blood flow, and therefore oxygen supply, to cardiac tissues. This occurs as a result of coronary artery occlusion following atherosclerotic plaque disruption, where the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque leads to the formation of an intraluminal thrombus in one or more coronary arteries. Myocardial infarction (MI) can also result from distal thrombotic embolization. Evaluation of the clinical presentation and determining the underlying pathophysiology of an MI are crucial for the development of an appropriate management plan.

STEMI is usually characterized by severe and/or total coronary flow obstruction with transmural ischemia, which predisposes to myocardial necrosis and pump dysfunction. The pathogenesis of NSTEMI differs from that of STEMI in that it usually results from a flow-limiting coronary stenosis with resultant downstream myocardial ischemia. Total coronary artery occlusion is present in approximately one-quarter of patients with NSTEMI. STEMI and NSTEMI require different approaches to their acute and long-term management. In this article, we focus on the epidemiology, prognosis, and management of NSTEMI according to its underlying pathophysiology.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^113Lmxtq]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

When considering revascularization in patients presenting with NSTEMI, the risks of morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure should be weighed against its benefits in terms of short- and long-term prognosis, symptom relief, quality of life, and duration of hospital stay. Patients with type 2 NSTEMI are less likely than those with type 1 NSTEMI to undergo revascularization, and its benefit in type 2 NSTEMI has yet to be established. In addition to the absence of intracoronary thrombosis, almost half of the patients with type 2 MI do not have significant underlying CAD. Therefore, guideline recommendations for revascularization in patients with NSTEMI may be more relevant to type 1 MI. Early identification of atherothrombotic plaque disruption as the cause of the event is critical in triaging appropriate patients with type 1 NSTEMI to the cardiac catheterization lab and to distinguish it from type 2 NSTEMI.

The indication for an invasive approach, the timing of revascularization (immediate, early, or delayed), and the selection of the revascularization approach (i.e. PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) in type 1 NSTEMI depend on a number of factors. These include the risk of a subsequent ischemic event, bleeding risk, and the clinical setting, for example, whether the patient has been admitted to a PCI center or will need to be transferred to a suitable facility. In general, guidelines recommend that in the case of multivessel CAD, the choice of CABG over multivessel PCI should be guided by the extent and complexity.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^113ys8wf]. Clinical cardiology (2020). High credibility.

In the past 20 years, the accuracy of detecting myocardial infarction (MI) has improved. Advances in cardiovascular (CV) imaging, redefined ECG criteria, and the availability of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays have enabled a more detailed examination of the underlying pathophysiology. Based on this improved diagnosis, the joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/World Heart Federation (ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF) Task Force classified MI into five main categories according to etiology, with the most recent criteria for each MI type published in 2018. Types 1 and 2 are spontaneous etiologies of MI, while type 3 is by definition fatal, and types 4 and 5 are procedure-related. This review focuses on type 1 and type 2 MI.

The classification of myocardial infarction based on the fourth universal definition introduces the criteria for both type 1 and type 2 MI. These include a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin with at least one value higher than the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit, and at least one of the following: symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia, new ischemic ECG changes, development of pathological Q waves, or imaging evidence consistent with ischemic etiology. Type 1 MI is characterized by atherothrombotic coronary artery disease (CAD) with an occlusive or non-occlusive coronary thrombus.

- **Definition**:

- **Type 1 MI**: Involves atherothrombotic coronary artery disease, which can be occlusive or non-occlusive.
- **Type 2 MI**: Not explicitly detailed in this section, but is discussed alongside type 1 MI for comparison and a comprehensive understanding of these primary spontaneous subtypes.

- **Abbreviations**: CABG - coronary artery bypass grafting
CAD - coronary artery disease
ECG - electrocardiogram
MI - myocardial infarction
PCI - percutaneous coronary intervention

### What US cardiology can learn from the 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^113fb6dS]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The spectrum of clinical presentations, electrocardiographic findings, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome is essential for initial assessment. This includes an electrocardiogram, physical examination, clinical history, vital signs, and high-sensitivity troponin trends.

An ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is readily apparent from the electrocardiogram. However, patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) should be divided into those with very high-risk features and those without. Very high-risk features include hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock, ongoing chest pain refractory to medical management, acute heart failure presumed secondary to ongoing myocardial ischemia, life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest after presentation, mechanical complications, or dynamic electrocardiographic changes suggestive of ischemia.

Patients with STEMI require immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as appropriate. Thrombolysis is considered if timely PCI is not feasible. NSTE-ACS patients with very high-risk features also require immediate intervention. For NSTE-ACS without very high-risk features, angiography should be considered within the initial 24 hours. The results of angiography determine the necessity for PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Long-term medical therapy and lifestyle measures, emphasizing smoking cessation, should be considered when warranted.

### Early invasive versus non-invasive assessment in patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome [^112Gdjj3]. Heart (2022). Low credibility.

Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) comprises a broad spectrum of disease ranging from unstable angina to myocardial infarction. International guidelines recommend a routine invasive strategy for managing patients with NSTE-ACS at high to very high risk, supported by evidence of improved composite ischaemic outcomes compared with a selective invasive strategy. However, accurate diagnosis of NSTE-ACS in the acute setting is challenging due to the spectrum of non-coronary disease that can manifest with similar symptoms.

Heterogeneous clinical presentations and limited uptake of risk prediction tools can confound physician decision-making regarding the use and timing of invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Large proportions of patients with suspected NSTE-ACS do not require revascularisation but may unnecessarily undergo ICA with its attendant risks and associated costs. Advances in coronary CT angiography and cardiac MRI have prompted evaluation of whether non-invasive strategies may improve patient selection, or whether tailored approaches are better suited to specific subgroups.

Future directions include:

- **Risk stratification**: Better understanding of risk stratification as a guide to investigation and therapy in suspected NSTE-ACS.
- **Randomised clinical trials**: Conducting randomised clinical trials of non-invasive imaging versus standard of care approaches prior to ICA.
- **Timing of invasive procedures**: Defining the optimal timing of very early ICA in high-risk NSTE-ACS.

### Does clinical presentation affect outcome among patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention? Insights from the Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in the Coronary Tree study [^111JXVjB]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

In some prior studies, patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as compared with patients with non-STEMI (NSTEMI), tended to have a higher early mortality but similar long-term outcomes. We compared the angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) characteristics of patients with STEMI and NSTEMI in the PROSPECT study to evaluate the independent prognostic value of clinical presentation on long-term outcomes.

- **Methods**: After successful revascularization, patients underwent 3-vessel quantitative coronary angiography, grayscale, and radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for unstable or progressive angina.

- **Results**: There were 211 patients (31.6%) with STEMI and 457 (68.4%) with NSTEMI. Patients with STEMI and NSTEMI had similar angiographic and IVUS morphologic characteristics. At 3 years, MACE occurred in 22.1% and 19.6%, respectively, (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16 [0.81, 1.68], P = 0.42). There was a higher overall mortality (HR 2.16 [0.94, 4.99], P = 0.06) and a significantly higher incidence of probable stent thrombosis (HR 4.34 [1.09, 17.36], P = 0.02) in the STEMI cohort. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to events related to culprit or nonculprit lesions. ST-elevation myocardial infarction presentation was not an independent predictor of 3-year MACE (HR 1.14 [0.77, 1.67], P = 0.52).

- **Conclusion**: Patients with STEMI and NSTEMI did not differ with respect to revascularization outcomes on long-term follow-up.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^114VLWoq]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Managing type 1 vs. type 2 NSTEMI: Type 2 NSTEMI is often classified under a general NSTEMI diagnosis or misclassified as type 1, despite its presentation and underlying pathophysiology being different from those of type 1 NSTEMI. It is essential that NSTEMI be classified as type 1 or type 2, based on clinical presentation, cardiac troponin, ECG, and imaging findings, so that it can be managed appropriately. Type 2 MI has heterogeneous underlying causes, often atypical features, a lack of a clear precipitating cause of the oxygen supply-demand imbalance in some patients (e.g. absence of discernible CAD), and does not usually involve atherothrombotic plaque disruption. As a result, NSTEMI guidelines may be challenging — or in some cases inappropriate — to apply in patients who are experiencing a type 2 NSTEMI, and no formal guidelines for type 2 NSTEMI are available.

Studies have found that compared with patients with type 1 NSTEMI, patients with type 2 NSTEMI were less likely to undergo catheterization and revascularization procedures or receive recommended secondary prevention medications at discharge, and they had higher mortality rates. There is therefore a need for evidence-based diagnosis and management guidelines for NSTEMI that acknowledge the complexities of type 2 MI. Consequently, a phenotype-based approach to type 2 MI diagnosis and management across different clinical settings has been proposed. This approach considers both the context and multiple possible underlying mechanisms of type 2 MI.

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: Understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^114MNqKw]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with NSTEMI have a higher long-term mortality risk than patients with STEMI but are often treated less aggressively, with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment (the "treatment-risk paradox"). The suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI can be explained by the heterogeneity of patient characteristics, an underestimation of the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk by physicians, procedure availability, and policy.

To address these challenges, potential approaches include developing guidelines and protocols that include rigorous definitions of NSTEMI, risk assessment, and integrated quality assessment measures. Additionally, providing education to physicians on the management of long-term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI, and making stents and antiplatelet therapies more accessible to patients, are important steps.

### Updates and current recommendations for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: What it means for clinical practice [^116b9UiC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have recently updated their joint guidelines for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS, including unstable angina [UA] and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]). These guidelines replace the 2007 guidelines and the focused updates from 2011 and 2012. They now combine UA and NSTEMI into a new classification, NSTE-ACS, and update the terminology around noninvasive management to ischemia-guided strategy.

The latest guidelines include updated recommendations for the use of the oral antiplatelet agents (P2Y12 inhibitors) prasugrel and ticagrelor as part of dual-antiplatelet therapy, which is the cornerstone of treatment for these patients. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the new and modified recommendations for the management of patients with NSTE-ACS and the evidence supporting them. It also highlights similarities and differences between the recommendations of the AHA/ACC and those of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) where appropriate. For example, the AHA/ACC recommends the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor over clopidogrel in all patients with NSTE-ACS and suggests clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor for patients in whom percutaneous coronary intervention is planned. In contrast, the ESC guidelines specifically recommend individual P2Y12 inhibitors for particular patient subgroups.

### The CRP troponin test (CTT) stratifies mortality risk in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) [^111zkaN1]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Elevated cardiac troponin is a hallmark of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The definition of NSTEMI includes several clinical entities, such as type 1 MI, type 2 MI, and myocardial injury. Distinguishing between these entities is challenging, and differentiating between them bears substantial implications on patient management and prognosis. Thus, definitive diagnostic tests aimed at better stratifying risk at the onset of NSTEMI development are needed.

A rapid increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations early in the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with worse outcomes and cardiac dysfunction. We recently described a simple diagnostic approach for identifying STEMI patients at increased risk for worse outcomes, the "CRP Troponin Test (CTT)", which is comprised of simultaneous serial measurements of both CRP and cardiac troponin during admission. However, the clinical application of this approach in patients with NSTEMI has not yet been studied.

Systemic and vascular inflammation play a key role in the development of ACS in addition to precipitating illnesses, such as infection, respiratory disease, and kidney injury. CRP is an acute phase reactant. Analyzing its concentrations in relation to circulating cardiac troponin, which implicates myocardial necrosis, might help identify "inflammatory prone" patients who demonstrate an excessive inflammatory response during an MI.

We, therefore, sought to determine the association between early CTT results and short- and long-term mortality rates in patients with NSTEMI.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, particularly with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend initiating medical treatment in the acute phase of NSTEMI. Decisions on stress testing, angiography, and revascularization for patients with diabetes mellitus should be made similarly to patients without diabetes mellitus.

### Myocardial infarction classification and its implications on measures of cardiovascular outcomes, quality, and racial/ethnic disparities [^11444XZq]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

**STEMI, NSTEMI, and type 2 MI**: Type 1 MI can be further divided into two classifications: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). STEMI is defined as an acute coronary thrombosis or persistent ST-segment elevation of ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 2 contiguous electrocardiographic leads. NSTEMI is defined as ischemic symptoms at rest from an acute coronary plaque rupture or erosion, lasting ≥ 10 minutes, occurring within 24 hours before hospital admission, and displaying either elevated cardiac biomarkers (either creatine kinase or cTn) within 24 hours after initial presentation. Prior to the introduction of the ICD-10 code for type 2 MI, patients with type 2 MI were often coded as NSTEMI or with no code at all. While STEMI care is well defined and fairly consistent in delivery, NSTEMI management is substantially more variable on the patient, clinician, facility, and regional levels. Since there is now a specific code for type 2 MI, and type 2 MI does not feature acute coronary thrombotic plaque disruption, great efforts should be made by clinicians to not identify it as NSTEMI. Doing such could have adverse effects on patient prognosis, treatment, and outcome. Improved methods of distinguishing type 1 and 2 MI could further enhance the study of MI and the potential development of MI-specific treatments.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Sorting through type 1 vs other types [^114r5UAu]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of NSTEMI management guidelines is to provide recommendations for the relief of ischemia during hospitalization and, in the longer term, to prevent secondary events such as reMI, events in other vascular beds, and death. All NSTEMI events should initially be diagnosed and managed in accordance with these guidelines, regardless of MI type. However, NSTEMI guidelines are more suited to type 1 NSTEMI than type 2 NSTEMI. Recent guidelines for MI classification have attempted to address this by providing an algorithmic approach to understanding the mechanistic basis for the occurrence of type 2 NSTEMI to facilitate appropriate treatment. Further studies are needed to address this unmet need in the treatment of the older, sicker patient with a type 2 NSTEMI.

Given the preponderance of type 1 MI over type 2 MI in patients presenting with NSTEMI, and considering the increased intermediate- and long-term risk of major adverse CV events relative to STEMI, aggressive strategies need to be adopted in treating these patients. These include the appropriate use of early invasive approaches, antithrombotic agents that yield the best benefit-risk outcomes, and other guideline-directed therapies. Conversely, algorithms that address the multiple possible underlying causes for the myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance in individual patients may be preferable for managing patients with type 2 NSTEMI. Future guidelines should include appropriate evidence-based recommendations for the management of type 2 NSTEMI.

Regarding the medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), specifically with respect to calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend administering nondihydropyridine CCBs (such as verapamil or diltiazem) as initial therapy in patients with NSTEMI who have continuing or frequently recurring ischemia, contraindications to β-blockers, and are without the following conditions:

- **Clinically significant LV dysfunction**: Patients with this condition should not receive nondihydropyridine CCBs.
- **Increased risk for cardiogenic shock**: Nondihydropyridine CCBs are contraindicated in these patients.
- **PR interval > 0.24 second**: A long PR interval can be problematic without close monitoring.
- **Second- or third-degree AV block without a cardiac pacemaker**: Patients with these conditions need caution unless a pacemaker is present.

### Contemporary approach to the diagnosis and management of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^117PqKFi]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has evolved dramatically over the past decade and, in many respects, represents a rapidly moving target for the cardiologist and internist who seek to integrate these recent advances into contemporary clinical practice. Unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) comprise a growing percentage of patients with ACS and are emerging as a major public health problem worldwide, especially in Western countries, despite significant improvements and refinements in management over the past 20 years. Against this backdrop of a multitude of randomized controlled clinical trials that have established the scientific foundation upon which evidence-based treatment strategies have emerged and become increasingly refined, the clinician is frequently confronted with a panoply of choices that can create uncertainty or confusion regarding "optimal management".

While the debate about the ideal approach to the management of non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) ACS (i.e. routine "early invasive strategy" versus an "ischemia-guided" or "conservative" strategy) has been ongoing for over a decade, clinical trials results provide compelling evidence that intermediate- and high-risk ACS patients derive significant reductions in both morbidity and mortality with mechanical or surgical intervention, especially when revascularization is coupled with aggressive, multifaceted (anti-platelet, antithrombin, anti-ischemic, and anti-atherogenic) medical therapy along with risk factor modification.

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: Understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^1157AyYy]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) recommend an invasive strategy with cardiac catheterization, revascularization when clinically appropriate, and initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy regardless of whether the patient receives revascularization. However, although patients with NSTEMI have a higher long-term mortality risk than patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), they are often treated less aggressively, with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment (the "treatment-risk paradox"). Here, using evidence gathered from across the world, we examine some reasons behind the suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI and recommend approaches to address this issue in order to improve the standard of healthcare for this group of patients.

- **The challenges for the treatment of patients with NSTEMI**: These can be categorized into four "P" factors that contribute to poor clinical outcomes: patient characteristics being heterogeneous; physicians underestimating the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk; procedure availability; and policy within the healthcare system.

- **To address these challenges**: Potential approaches include developing guidelines and protocols that incorporate rigorous definitions of NSTEMI; risk assessment and integrated quality assessment measures; providing education to physicians on the management of long-term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI; and making stents and antiplatelet therapies more accessible.

### Clinical features and prognosis of patients with coronary spasm-induced non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome [^11336zs3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of spasm-induced NSTE-ACS was based on the absence of a culprit lesion on coronary angiography and the presence of ischemic ECG changes, including transient ST-segment elevation of ≥ 0.1 mV, ST-segment depression of ≥ 0.1 mV, or the new appearance of negative U waves, recorded in ≥ 2 contiguous leads on the 12-lead ECG during rest angina attacks. It also included spontaneous coronary spasm during coronary angiography, which was relieved by the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin (see Figure 1), or a positive spasm provocation test (i.e. spasm after the intracoronary injection of ACh). We defined the culprit lesion as the site of acute coronary occlusion, severe coronary artery disease of > 90% stenosis, or coronary artery disease with complex lesion morphology, which is responsible for ischemic symptoms, corresponding to the electrocardiographic changes or wall motion abnormality observed on transthoracic echocardiography or left ventriculography.

Figure 1. Representative case of spasm-induced NSTE-ACS diagnosed by spontaneous coronary spasm during coronary angiography. A, First coronary angiography showed severe stenosis of the middle right coronary artery. B, Intracoronary administration of nitroglycerin resulted in complete resolution of the stenosis and vasodilation of the entire right coronary artery. NSTE-ACS indicates non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome.

### New features of troponin testing in different clinical settings [^114RtLDP]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin levels are routinely measured for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction. Cardiac troponin measurements also provide information concerning prognosis and the effect of early intervention in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The recent development of highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays permits detection of very low circulating levels. Use of sensitive troponin assays improves overall diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, and these assays provide strong prognostic information in stable coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure. However, increased sensitivity comes with a cost of decreased specificity, and serial testing, as well as clinical context and judgment, is likely to become increasingly important in the interpretation of troponin assay results.
