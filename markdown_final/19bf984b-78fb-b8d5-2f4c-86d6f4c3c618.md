## Question

Ramsy hunt syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the syndrome and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and when to suspect zoster sine herpete. After that, I need to appraise the evidence for antiviral and corticosteroid therapy, including timing and dosing. I will then examine prognostic factors and special populations, consider complications and multidisciplinary care, and finally synthesize practical management and follow-up recommendations with appropriate caveats about evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is herpes zoster oticus with peripheral facial nerve palsy, reflecting reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion, with inflammation and edema of the facial nerve causing neurapraxia or axonal degeneration, and occasionally spreading to adjacent cranial nerves such as the vestibulocochlear nerve, which explains otalgia, vesicles, facial weakness, and vestibulocochlear symptoms [^490daf89] [^3220207c].

> Wait, let me verify the classic clinical triad and its variability. The hallmark is ipsilateral facial palsy, otalgia, and vesicular rash on the pinna or in the external auditory canal, but vesicles can be subtle, delayed, or absent (zoster sine herpete), and patients may also have vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, hyperacusis, taste disturbance, and ocular surface complications from lagophthalmos, so I should not anchor on the rash alone when the story fits VZV reactivation [^490daf89] [^d10d71de] [^6b7ca28c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognosis versus Bell's palsy. I initially thought recovery was uniformly worse in Ramsay Hunt, but I should double-check the magnitude. Compared with Bell's palsy, Ramsay Hunt tends to have more severe initial paralysis and lower complete recovery rates, yet many patients still improve substantially over months, and early treatment modifies outcomes, so I need to be cautious not to overstate poor prognosis as inevitable [^d77073cd] [^490daf89].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis and when to suspect zoster sine herpete. Severe otalgia with facial palsy, especially with taste disturbance or vestibulocochlear symptoms, should prompt consideration of VZV even without vesicles; serology or PCR can support the diagnosis, and I should remember that a meaningful fraction of "Bell's palsy" may actually be zoster sine herpete, which changes management and counseling [^490daf89] [^ee0ebb57].

> I will now examine the evidence for antiviral therapy. The Cochrane review found only one small RCT of IV acyclovir plus steroids versus steroids alone and no statistically significant benefit, but the trial was underpowered and the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; mechanistic plausibility and observational data support antivirals, and contemporary guidelines recommend combination therapy for Ramsay Hunt, so I should frame this as low-certainty evidence with consensus support rather than proven ineffectiveness [^efe239f1] [^debddcb0].

> Let me consider corticosteroids carefully. The Cochrane review found no RCTs of steroids as adjuncts to antivirals, yet steroids reduce inflammation and edema of the facial nerve and are widely used in practice; given the pathophysiology and guideline support, I should recommend timely systemic steroids alongside antivirals while acknowledging the evidence gap and balancing risks in patients with contraindications [^ea3c5eb8] [^debddcb0].

> I should confirm timing and dosing because delays worsen outcomes. Early initiation within 72 hours of symptom onset is consistently associated with better recovery; typical regimens include acyclovir 800 mg five times daily or famciclovir 500 mg three times daily for 7–10 days, plus prednisone 60 mg daily for 3–5 days with a taper, and in severe cases some centers use high-dose IV acyclovir with systemic steroids, though high-quality comparative dosing data are limited [^490daf89] [^debddcb0] [^622c8f49].

> But wait, what if standard therapy fails or the patient presents late. Case series suggest that late high-dose IV methylprednisolone may salvage some nonrecovering cases, and intratympanic dexamethasone as an adjunct to systemic therapy has shown markedly higher recovery rates in moderate-to-severe cases, albeit in small, nonrandomized cohorts; I should present these as promising options when conventional therapy is inadequate or delayed, with shared decision-making about uncertain benefit [^b0e1ba03] [^fd9797d2].

> Next, I should review prognostic factors to guide counseling. Worse initial House-Brackmann grade, older age, diabetes, hypertension, electroneurography showing greater than roughly 78–85% degeneration, and delayed treatment predict poorer recovery; conversely, early treatment and lower ENoG degeneration portend better outcomes, so I need to set expectations accordingly and emphasize adherence and follow-up [^261fc1b8] [^46d2e72a] [^d77073cd].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In immunocompromised patients, including HIV, Ramsay Hunt occurs and may be more severe, so I should maintain a low threshold for IV acyclovir and consider inpatient management; in older adults, vestibular dysfunction and falls are common, and fear of falling can persist even after motor recovery, warranting fall risk assessment, vestibular rehabilitation, and occupational therapy [^1f8d69bc] [^4c519075] [^cb251d16].

> Let me think about complications and multidisciplinary care. Ocular surface disease from lagophthalmos requires aggressive lubrication, taping, moisture chambers, and sometimes temporary tarsorrhaphy or upper eyelid weights; vestibular deficits may benefit from targeted rehabilitation; cranial polyneuropathy, including vocal cord paralysis, may need speech therapy or ENT input; and rare CNS complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, or vasculitis mandate neurologic evaluation and extended antiviral therapy [^48947f41] [^cb251d16] [^f4c148fd] [^952cc910] [^c8260a58].

> I should double-check the role of electroneurography in decision-making. ENoG helps prognosticate: values above about 78–85% degeneration predict nonrecovery and can inform discussions about escalation or de-escalation of therapy, though it does not change the indication for standard antiviral–steroid treatment when within 72 hours; I should integrate ENoG with clinical severity and trajectory rather than use it in isolation [^261fc1b8] [^46d2e72a].

> Next, I should review prevention and public health implications. Herpes zoster vaccination reduces zoster and its complications, including Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and is recommended for older adults; in patients who develop zoster, prompt antiviral therapy within 7 days reduces risks of neurological complications and hospitalization, reinforcing the importance of early recognition and treatment in primary care [^46cdb78e] [^3d250f02] [^622c8f49].

> Let me synthesize practical management while keeping the evidence limitations visible. Suspect Ramsay Hunt in acute facial palsy with otalgia or vesicles, or in severe, painful facial palsy even without rash; start acyclovir 800 mg five times daily or famciclovir 500 mg three times daily for 7–10 days plus prednisone 60 mg daily for 3–5 days with a taper if within 72 hours; consider IV acyclovir for severe disease or immunocompromise; add intratympanic steroids in moderate-to-severe cases at experienced centers; protect the cornea aggressively; arrange vestibular rehabilitation if balance is impaired; and follow recovery with ENoG at about 2–3 weeks to refine prognosis and guide expectations [^490daf89] [^debddcb0] [^fd9797d2] [^48947f41] [^261fc1b8].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and counseling points. Most patients improve over weeks to months, but recovery is often incomplete compared with Bell's palsy; persistent weakness, synkinesis, taste disturbance, hearing loss, or neuralgia warrant ongoing rehabilitation and symptom-directed care, and recurrent facial palsy should trigger evaluation for alternative etiologies or systemic disease rather than assuming idiopathic recurrence [^d77073cd] [^7cffef0b].

---

Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a peripheral facial palsy caused by **varicella-zoster virus reactivation** in the geniculate ganglion, classically presenting with ipsilateral facial weakness, otalgia, and vesicles in the external ear or oral cavity [^490daf89]. Early diagnosis and **prompt combination therapy** with acyclovir or valacyclovir plus corticosteroids within 72 hours [^debddcb0] significantly improve facial nerve recovery and reduce complications [^3d250f02]. Prognosis is worse than Bell's palsy, with higher risks of incomplete recovery, synkinesis, and postherpetic neuralgia; electroneurography helps predict outcomes [^261fc1b8], and vestibular rehabilitation aids balance deficits [^cb251d16]. Prevention includes herpes zoster vaccination [^46cdb78e] and early antiviral use in zoster [^3d250f02].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

- **Virus**: Reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the geniculate ganglion [^490daf89].
- **Mechanism**: Viral replication causes inflammation, edema, and demyelination of the facial nerve, leading to neurapraxia or axonal degeneration [^d10d71de].
- **Spread**: Inflammation can extend to adjacent cranial nerves (VIII, V, IX, X), causing vestibulocochlear and other cranial neuropathies [^f4c148fd].

---

## Clinical presentation

The **classic triad** includes ipsilateral peripheral facial palsy, otalgia, and vesicular rash on the pinna, external auditory canal, or oral mucosa [^490daf89]. Additional features may include vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, hyperacusis, taste disturbance, and ocular surface complications from lagophthalmos [^6b7ca28c].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on acute peripheral facial palsy with otalgia and vesicular rash; zoster sine herpete (without rash) is recognized but less common [^490daf89]. Laboratory testing with PCR for VZV DNA in saliva, tear fluid, or CSF can confirm VZV reactivation when the diagnosis is uncertain [^6de35eff]. Electroneurography (ENoG) assesses facial nerve degeneration and helps prognosticate recovery [^261fc1b8].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Bell's palsy**: Idiopathic facial palsy without vesicles or severe pain [^d10d71de].
- **Lyme disease**: Bilateral facial palsy, rash, arthralgia, endemic exposure [^7c80b75f].
- **Otitis media**: Ear infection with facial palsy, different rash distribution [^7c80b75f].
- **Other**: Trauma, neoplasm, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome [^7c80b75f].

---

## Treatment

### Medical management

- **Antivirals**: Acyclovir 800 mg five times daily or valacyclovir 1 g three times daily for 7–10 days; initiate within 72 hours [^490daf89].
- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone 60 mg daily for 5 days, then taper over 5 days; start within 72 hours [^490daf89].
- **Combination therapy**: Antivirals plus corticosteroids improve facial nerve recovery vs monotherapy [^b246dee9].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive options include **intratympanic steroids** for moderate-to-severe cases to improve facial nerve recovery [^fd9797d2], and **vestibular rehabilitation** for persistent dizziness or balance deficits [^cb251d16]. Eye care with lubrication, taping, and moisture chambers prevents exposure keratopathy [^48947f41].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **worse than Bell's palsy**, with lower rates of complete recovery and higher risks of synkinesis and postherpetic neuralgia [^d77073cd]. Poor prognostic factors include older age, diabetes, severe initial paralysis, delayed treatment, and ENoG degeneration > 78% [^261fc1b8]. Most patients improve over weeks to months, but recovery may be incomplete [^331263c7].

---

## Complications

- **Neurological**: Persistent facial weakness, synkinesis, postherpetic neuralgia, hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction [^490daf89].
- **Ocular**: Exposure keratopathy, corneal ulceration, visual impairment [^48947f41].
- **Systemic**: Rare CNS involvement (meningitis, encephalitis, vasculitis) [^952cc910] [^c8260a58].

---

## Prevention

Prevention centers on **herpes zoster vaccination** to reduce incidence and severity of zoster, including Ramsay Hunt syndrome [^46cdb78e]. Early antiviral therapy during acute zoster lowers the risk of neurological complications, including Ramsay Hunt syndrome [^3d250f02].

---

## Recent advances and ongoing research

Recent work includes studies of **intratympanic steroids** as an adjunct to improve facial nerve recovery [^fd9797d2] and investigations into vestibular rehabilitation for persistent balance deficits [^cb251d16]. Research continues to refine prognostic tools, including ENoG and imaging, to guide management and counseling [^261fc1b8].

---

Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a VZV reactivation causing peripheral facial palsy with otalgia and vesicles; **early antiviral–steroid therapy** improves outcomes, but recovery is often incomplete. Management also includes eye protection, vestibular rehab, and prevention via vaccination.

## References

### Combination therapy is preferable for patients with ramsay hunt syndrome [^b246dee9]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To critically appraise the topic, questioning whether administering antiviral medication in case of Ramsay Hunt syndrome improves the restoration of facial nerve function.

Methods

We reviewed the literature on this subject and calculated the odds ratios for the different treatment modalities.

Results

Our study clearly shows that antiviral medication in combination with corticosteroids improves the outcome for patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

Conclusion

Contrary to a recent Cochrane Library review, we conclude that patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome should be treated with combination therapy including antivirals.

### Clinical manifestations and prognosis of patients with ramsay hunt syndrome [^d77073cd]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome have a poorer prognosis than those with Bell palsy despite the use of various treatment modalities. We compared the clinical characteristics, treatment methods, and outcomes in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Bell palsy.

Materials and Methods

Patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome were compared with patients with Bell palsy treated using oral steroids and with those treated with both steroids and an antiviral agent. Functional recovery of the facial nerve was scored according to the House-Brackmann grading system. Patients were followed up until recovery or for 3 months. Recovery rates in each group were assessed by age, sex, and initial and last House-Brackmann grade.

Results

Compared with patients with Bell palsy, those with Ramsay Hunt syndrome were generally younger, had initially more severe facial palsy, and a lower recovery rate. Various factors including initial House-Brackmann grade, starting time to treatment, age, comorbid disease, electroneurography, and electromyography showed some correlations with prognosis in all groups. The addition of antiviral agents to an oral steroid regimen did not improve the recovery rate of patients with Bell palsy.

Conclusion

Patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome have a poorer prognosis than do those with Bell palsy.

### Antiviral therapy for ramsay hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with facial palsy) in adults [^efe239f1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster oticus (HZO) is a viral infection of the ear and when associated with acute facial paralysis is known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Antiviral agents are the standard first-line treatment for herpes zoster infections at other body sites and are thought to reduce or minimise nerve damage, thereby improving outcomes. It has been suggested that these agents improve the chance of facial weakness improving or resolving completely in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of antiviral agents in the treatment of adult patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome (HZO with facial palsy).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane ENT Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, current issue), Medline (1950–2007), PubMed 2007–2008, EMBASE (1974 onwards) and other relevant databases. The date of the most recent search was June 2008.

Selection Criteria

Two authors scrutinized all possible citations to identify randomised controlled trials in which antiviral agents alone or in combination with other therapies (using different routes of administration and dosage schemes) were given as treatment for Ramsay Hunt syndrome. We contacted an author for further information.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

Only one randomised, controlled trial was identified and included. It was of low quality and included only 15 participants. In this 1992 trial, intravenous acyclovir and corticosteroids were compared with corticosteroids alone. Our analysis found no statistically significant difference between the two groups.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence that anti-viral agents have a beneficial effect on outcomes in Ramsay Hunt syndrome, despite their widespread use in this condition. The use of these drugs in patients with herpes zoster infections in other parts of the body might suggest that they have a role in herpes zoster oticus. As usual, the absence of positive evidence of benefit (or, in this case, the 'negative' result of one small, statistically under-powered study) does not necessarily indicate that antivirals are ineffective. However, these drugs are associated with a number of adverse effects and this must be taken into consideration when undertaking the requisite risk-benefit analysis before instigating treatment.

### Corticosteroids as adjuvant to antiviral treatment in ramsay hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with facial palsy) in adults [^ea3c5eb8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammation and oedema of the facial nerve due to viral infection by the herpes zoster virus are implicated in the aetiology and clinical manifestation of Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with facial palsy). Corticosteroids, with their powerful anti-inflammatory effect, have a potential role to play in the reduction or minimisation of nerve damage when administered together with antiviral therapy, and therefore may improve the outcome for patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids as an adjuvant to antiviral therapy in adult patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with facial palsy).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to December 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to December 2007), CINAHL (1982 to December 2007), LILACS, KoreaMed, IndMed, PakMediNet, ZETOC, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts (Conference Proceedings Database), ISI Proceedings (Web of Science), the National Research Register (NRR), the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database (UKCRN), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Research Findings Register (ReFeR) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials in which corticosteroids (by any route of administration at any dosage) were given as an adjuvant to antiviral agents in the treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and trial quality of the available studies, whether they were published or unpublished. No trials were found and therefore no data were analysed.

Main Results

This is an empty review as no trials were found that fulfilled the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

Since no randomised controlled trials investigating the use of corticosteroids as an adjuvant to antiviral treatment in Ramsay Hunt syndrome were identified, such studies are needed to assess the effects of such therapy.

### Ramsay hunt syndrome [^490daf89]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The strict definition of the Ramsay Hunt syndrome is peripheral facial nerve palsy accompanied by an erythematous vesicular rash on the ear (zoster oticus) or in the mouth. J Ramsay Hunt, who described various clinical presentations of facial paralysis and rash, also recognised other frequent symptoms and signs such as tinnitus, hearing loss, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and nystagmus. He explained these eighth nerve features by the close proximity of the geniculate ganglion to the vestibulocochlear nerve within the bony facial canal. Hunt's analysis of clinical variations of the syndrome now bearing his name led to his recognition of the general somatic sensory function of the facial nerve and his defining of the geniculate zone of the ear. It is now known that varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Compared with Bell's palsy (facial paralysis without rash), patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome often have more severe paralysis at onset and are less likely to recover completely. Studies suggest that treatment with prednisone and acyclovir may improve outcome, although a prospective randomised treatment trial remains to be undertaken. In the only prospective study of patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, 14% developed vesicles after the onset of facial weakness. Thus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome may initially be indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. Further, Bell's palsy is significantly associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. In the light of the known safety and effectiveness of antiviral drugs against VZV or HSV, consideration should be given to early treatment of all patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome or Bell's palsy with a 7–10 day course of famciclovir (500 mg, three times daily) or acyclovir (800 mg, five times daily), as well as oral prednisone (60 mg daily for 3–5 days). Finally, some patients develop peripheral facial paralysis without ear or mouth rash, associated with either a fourfold rise in antibody to VZV or the presence of VZV DNA in auricular skin, blood mononuclear cells, middle ear fluid, or saliva. This indicates that a proportion of patients with "Bell's palsy" have Ramsay Hunt syndrome zoster sine herpete. Treatment of these patients with acyclovir and prednisone within 7 days of onset has been shown to improve the outcome of recovery from facial palsy.

### Varicella-zoster virus-specific cell-mediated immunity in ramsay hunt syndrome [^ac455130]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The etiology of Ramsay Hunt syndrome (Hunt syndrome) is reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve, leading to neuritis. Although the mechanism of the VZV reactivation is unclear, one possibility is that the reactivation involves a low level of VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI). The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of the VZV-specific CMI in Hunt syndrome compared to that in Bell's palsy, and to obtain clues to its role in the development of Hunt syndrome.

Study Design

Prospective study.

Methods

We determined the median spot numbers and examined VZV-specific CMI in patients with Hunt syndrome and with Bell's palsy using interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays. We analyzed the relationship between the value of VZV-specific CMI and days from disease onset.

Results

The median spot number in Hunt syndrome (87.3 spot-forming cells [SFCs]/4 × 10⁵ peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) was higher than that in Bell's palsy (62.3 SFCs/4 × 10⁵ PBMCs). Hunt syndrome showed a strong relationship between the ELISPOT count and days from onset (r = 0.65). Within the first 5 days from onset, no ELISPOT counts higher than 80 SFCs/4 × 10⁵ PBMCs were observed. On the other hand, no correlation was observed between the ELISPOT count and days from onset in patients with Bell's palsy (r = -0.19).

Conclusions

These results suggest that VZV-specific CMI in Hunt syndrome is low at disease onset and increases rapidly thereafter. Consequently, reduced VZV-specific CMI may play an important role in the reactivation of VZV in the facial nerve, leading to Hunt syndrome.

### Prognosis of ramsay hunt syndrome presenting as cranial polyneuropathy [^f4c148fd]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Ramsay Hunt syndrome is known to be accompanied with cranial polyneuropathy very occasionally. We reviewed our experience to analyze the clinical manifestations and prognosis of these cases.

Study Design

Retrospective review.

Methods

Eleven patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome presenting as cranial polyneuropathy between 1999 and 2009 were included in this study retrospectively. All patients were treated with systemic steroids and antiviral agents. Assessment of recovery from facial nerve palsy (FNP) using the House-Brackmann (HB) grading system was performed, and the follow-up period was 4 to 28 months.

Results

The patient numbers for the initial degree of FNP were five for HB grade II, one for grade III, two for grade IV, and three for grade V. The cochleovestibular nerve was involved in 10 cases, and hearing loss was observed in nine patients. Other involved cranial nerves were IX in seven cases, X in five cases, V in three cases, and III/XII in one case each. Antiviral agents and steroids were administered within 3 days after the onset of symptoms for about 1 to 2 weeks in most cases. After the treatment the degree of FNP improved to HB grade I or II in nine of 11 patients (81.8%). Symptoms of other cranial nerves also improved in most patients, whereas recovery for hearing loss showed poor results.

Conclusions

Ramsay Hunt syndrome associated with cranial polyneuropathy has a good prognosis for FNP and other cranial nerve palsies with a combination therapy of antiviral agents and steroids, but not for recovery of hearing loss.

### Acyclovir in the treatment of ramsay hunt syndrome [^55d3cdd6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome is an herpetic disease with ominous prognosis regarding the facial nerve. Treatment with acyclovir, a well-known virostatic agent, has been given in a small number of patients in recent years with excellent results. We report on the administration of acyclovir intravenously for 7 days in 31 patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, with overall recovery rate of 82.6%. There were no side effects regarding this treatment.

### Ramsay hunt syndrome in a 3-month-old infant [^685b21d7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a disorder characterized by herpetic eruptions on the auricle, facial paralysis, and vestibulocochlear dysfunction, and is attributed to varicella zoster virus infection in the geniculate ganglion. Although it is a common cause of acute peripheral facial paralysis, children are not usually affected. We describe Ramsay Hunt syndrome in a 3-month-old infant who was referred because of a 2-day-old appearance of herpetic blisters on the right auricle and along the distribution of the right facial nerve. His mother had been infected with chickenpox during the second trimester of pregnancy. The infant presented with right facial palsy and was anxious, but had no fever. Otoscopy revealed herpetic eruptions in the right ear canal. Otoacoustic emissions were absent in the right ear and auditory brainstem responses confirmed moderate sensorineural hearing loss. Appropriate treatment resulted in slight improvement after the first week and complete recovery within 4 months. Infection with varicella zoster virus was proved by a significant increase in the serum anti-varicella zoster virus antibody titer during the convalescent phase of the disease.

### Ramsay hunt syndrome in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus [^1f8d69bc]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) is defined as herpes zoster infection of the head and neck that involves the facial nerve. Immunocompromised people, such as those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are predisposed to herpes zoster. However, reports of RHS in patients with HIV are rare. We report two cases of RHS in patients with HIV at our hospital, located in southern Brazil. We hope this report will increase the awareness of this condition among doctors caring for patients with HIV.

### Fear of falling as a potential complication of ramsay hunt syndrome in older adults: a case report [^4c519075]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fear of falling (FOF) is a common and major health concern in older adults. The consequences of FOF include reduced physical performance, social activity, and health-related quality of life. Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) is a herpes zoster-related facial nerve dysfunction accompanied by an erythematous vesicular rash on the ear or mouth that may complicate ipsilateral facial paralysis and otalgia, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and meningoencephalitis. However, repeated falls and subsequent FOF due to RHS have not been reported in older adults.

Case presentation

A 65-year-old woman diagnosed with RHS experienced repeated falls during hospital admission and after discharge. Despite recovery of balance and no subsequent falls, the patient presented with persistent FOF at the geriatric outpatient follow-up visit 1 year after the RHS episode. The fear sensation impaired the patient's instrumental daily activities and was confirmed by documentation of serial comprehensive geriatric assessments, especially the Timed Up and Go test scores.

Conclusions

RHS may cause repeated falls and FOF, leading to impairment in daily activities and psychosocial function in older adults. Therefore, clinicians should be mindful of falls and FOF when caring for older patients with RHS and should develop multidimensional strategies for fall prevention and FOF.

### Successful response of non-recovering ramsay hunt syndrome to intravenous high dose methylprednisolone [^b0e1ba03]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) is a frequent cause of facial palsy. It is a consequence of the infection of geniculate ganglion by herpes zoster or herpes simplex virus. In the lack of randomized controlled trials, RHS is empirically treated by a combination therapy of antiviral agents and steroids given orally. However, RHS has, per se, a poorer prognosis than idiopathic facial palsy (Bell's palsy). We describe a case series of two patients with RHS unsuccessfully treated with antiviral drugs and oral corticosteroids, showing an almost complete recovery after late administration of intravenous (i.v.) high dose methylprednisolone. Both patients had all recognized negative prognostic factors including age of onset, a high grade facial weakness, absence of R1 and R2 response at blink reflex test, and in the first case, the involvement of greater superficial petrosal nerve. We propose that i.v. high dose methylprednisolone should be considered, even as a late treatment option, in patients with RHS non recovering after standard antiviral and oral steroid therapy as well as presenting clinical features suggestive of a poor prognosis.

### Fear of falling as a potential complication of ramsay hunt syndrome in older adults: a case report [^7a2069ef]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls, defined as "unexpected event [s] in which participants drop to the ground, floor, or lower level", commonly occur in older people, and the incidence of falls increases with age. Approximately 27.5% of adults aged ≥ 65 years had at least one fall episode within 1 year, and the rate increased to 33.8% for those aged ≥ 85 years. Falls are the fifth leading cause of death in older adults and increase healthcare utilization and medical costs. Furthermore, falls may develop into fear of falling (FOF). FOF is defined as an exacerbated concern for falling when performing activities of daily living. Depending on different FOF measurement strategies, the prevalence of FOF in older people varies between 21 and 85%. FOF is associated with activity avoidance, loss of self-efficacy, and loss of self-confidence. FOF can lead to restricted social activities and a reduced quality of life.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS), also known as herpes zoster oticus, is caused by reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the geniculate ganglion. Ipsilateral facial paralysis, otalgia, and vesicular rash over the external auditory canal comprise the symptom triad of RHS. Abnormal taste, vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss have been reported in some patients. After Bell's palsy, RHS is the second most common cause of non-traumatic peripheral facial paralysis. However, facial paralysis is often more severe in patients with RHS than in those with Bell's palsy. Additionally, age is the most vital risk factor affecting reactivation of herpes zoster, and approximately 50% of 85-year-old adults suffer from one episode of herpes zoster. Most clinicians focus on facial paralysis and postherpetic neuralgia in patients with RHS. Nevertheless, vertigo caused by RHS may result in repeated falls and fall-related injuries, including FOF, which may profoundly affect patients, especially older adults. To the best of our knowledge, repeated falls and subsequent FOF complicated by RHS have not been reported in older adults. Herein, we report the case of a patient with RHS who initially presented with dizziness and right otalgia followed by repeated falls. In the subsequent period, the patient was bothered by the FOF, which affected the patient's gait, daily function, and social interactions.

### Acupuncture: a potential modality for the treatment of auricular pruritus in ramsay hunt syndrome with multiple cranial nerve lesions [^02dbd927]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Auricular pruritus coexisted with multiple cranial nerve lesions in Ramsay Hunt syndrome has been rarely reported in the literature especially its treatment. However, auricular pruritus cannot be better improved along with the improvement of multiple cranial nerve lesions. We tried to solve the problem with acupuncture and got experience from it. The following 2 cases of Ramsay Hunt syndrome show a potential modality for the treatment of auricular pruritus with acupuncture.

### Unilateral facial paralysis caused by ramsay hunt syndrome [^0b169e06]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a rare disease caused by an infection of the geniculate ganglion by the varicella-zoster virus. The main clinical features of the syndrome are as follows: Bell palsy unilateral or bilateral, vesicular eruptions on the ears, ear pain, dizziness, preauricular swelling, tingling, tearing, loss of taste sensation, and nystagmus. We describe a 23-year-old white woman, who presented with facial paralysis on the left side of the face, pain, fever, ear pain, and swelling in the neck and auricular region on the left side. She received appropriate treatment with acyclovir, vitamin B complex, and CMP nucleus. After 30 days after presentation, the patient did not show any signs or symptoms of the syndrome. At follow-up at 1 year, she showed no relapse of the syndrome.

### Herpes zoster oticus associated with varicella zoster virus encephalitis [^4da7b6db]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, herpes zoster oticus (HZO), derived its name from James Ramsay Hunt, who first described it in 1907. It is classically characterized by acute peripheral facial paralysis, herpetic eruptions on the auricle, and vestibulocochlear dysfunction due to the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV). In this Case Report, the authors describe an HZO patient with simultaneous VZV encephalitis. To date, only eight cases of HZO associated with VZV encephalitis have been reported in the English literature. Therefore, the authors discuss all the aspects of this rare entity, including clinical examination, radiological evaluation, laboratory evaluation, and treatment options.

### Motor cortex stimulation for refractory facial neuralgia and paresthesia in ramsay hunt syndrome [^5f52ad40]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

This study explores motor cortex stimulation (MCS) as a treatment for Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS)-related neuralgia, which often persists despite traditional therapies. A 68-year-old patient with RHS experienced significant pain and sensory relief after MCS, after ineffective conventional treatments. MCS enhances neural plasticity, offering a promising alternative for managing intractable neuralgia and sensory disturbances in RHS patients. This case underscores MCS's potential efficacy, advocating for further research into its broader application and benefits for RHS-related pain management.

### Ramsay hunt syndrome and concurrent varicella-zoster virus meningitis in Denmark: a nationwide cohort study [^952cc910]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) is a manifestation of reactivated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) from the geniculate ganglion. Data on clinical features and outcomes of patients with RHS and concurrent VZV meningitis (henceforth RHS meningitis) are limited. Thus, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study of all adults hospitalized for RHS meningitis at the departments of infectious diseases in Denmark from 2015 to 2020. Patients with VZV meningitis without cranial nerve palsies were included for comparison. In total, 37 patients with RHS meningitis (mean annual incidence: 1.6/1000000 adults) and 162 with VZV meningitis without cranial nerve palsies were included. In RHS meningitis, the median age was 52 years (interquartile range: 35–64), and in addition to peripheral facial nerve palsy (100%), dizziness (46%), and hearing loss (35%) were common symptoms. The triad of headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia/hyperacusis was less common in RHS meningitis than in VZV meningitis without cranial nerve palsies (0/27 [0%] vs. 24/143 [17%]; p = 0.02). At 30 days after discharge, 18/36 (50%) patients with RHS meningitis had persistent peripheral facial nerve palsy, with no statistically significant difference between those treated with and without adjuvant glucocorticoids (6/16 [38%] vs. 12/20 [60%]; p = 0.18). Additional sequelae of RHS meningitis included dizziness (29%), neuralgia (14%), tinnitus/hyperacusis (11%), hearing loss (9%), headache (9%), fatigue (6%), and concentration difficulties (3%). In conclusion, clinical features and outcomes of RHS meningitis were primarily related to cranial neuropathies.

### Comparison of acyclovir and famciclovir for ramsay hunt syndrome [^261581d6]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Although antiviral agents are widely used to treat Ramsay hunt syndrome (RHS), their relative effectiveness has not been assessed. This study retrospectively compared clinical outcomes in patients with RHS treated with the antiviral agents acyclovir and famciclovir.

Patients and Methods

This study involved 227 patients diagnosed with RHS from 2003 to 2015. Patients were treated with prednisolone plus acyclovir (n = 102) or famciclovir (n = 125). Patient outcomes were measured using the House-Brackmann scale according to age, initial severity of disease, electroneurography, and underlying disease.

Results

Based on complications (p = 0.019) and disease severity (p = 0.013), the overall complete recovery rate was significantly higher with famciclovir than with acyclovir, whereas rates of recovery in patients with severe (p = 0.111) and initially moderate (grades III-IV; p = 0.070) facial palsy were similar. Electroneurography also showed no difference in remission rate between the two groups (p = 0.692). Complete recovery rates in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus were similar in the two groups. However, the complete recovery rate of patients without hypertension and diabetes was significantly higher in patients treated with famciclovir than acyclovir (p = 0.018).

Conclusion

Recovery rates in patients with RHS were higher following treatment with steroid plus famciclovir than with steroid plus acyclovir, especially in patients without hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

### Herpes zoster laryngitis accompanied by ramsay hunt syndrome [^decf27e2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The most common presentation of herpes zoster in the head and neck region is called Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS), which rarely accompanies multiple cranial neuropathy. Herpes zoster also involves the mucous membrane of the tongue, palate, pharynx, and larynx. Herpes zoster infection of the larynx accompanied by Ramsay Hunt syndrome with cranial polyneuropathy is extremely rare, with only few reported cases in the literature. At the time of this report, a review of the medical literature disclosed 4 reported cases of herpes zoster laryngitis accompanied by Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herein, we present 2 additional cases and report the clinical outcome of cranial polyneuropathy with a review of the literature.

### Detection of varicella zoster virus DNA in tear fluid and saliva of patients with ramsay hunt syndrome [^6de35eff]. Otology & Neurotology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To clarify the dynamics of the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus in Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

Subjects and Methods

Varicella zoster virus DNA in the tear fluid, submandibular gland saliva, and parotid gland saliva of 15 patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome was studied. The presence of varicella zoster virus DNA was detected quantitatively by the use of polymerase chain reaction and a microplate hybridization method.

Results

Of 102 specimens of the tear fluid and saliva collected from 15 patients, varicella zoster virus DNA was detected in 40 specimens (39%) from 12 patients (80%). The detection rate was 72% in the submandibular saliva, 57% in the parotid saliva, and 27% in the tear fluid. Varicella zoster virus DNA was detected not only in specimens from the affected side but also in specimens from the unaffected side at the same rate of detection, and at nearly the same number of DNA copies. Regarding the parotid saliva, varicella zoster virus DNA was detected in samples collected at an early stage of the disease. In the tear fluid and submandibular saliva, however, the detection rate was high in samples collected 2 weeks after the onset of disease or later.

Conclusions

Secretion of varicella zoster virus DNA into the tear fluid and saliva was confirmed in the patient with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The increase and decrease in the detection rate and the number of varicella zoster virus DNA copies detected in samples collected at different times was considered to substantiate varicella zoster virus reactivation in Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Varicella zoster virus reactivation was thought to occur in the unaffected side at the same level as in the affected side, and some of the secreted varicella zoster virus DNA was suspected to be derived from the ganglion trigeminale.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^46cdb78e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster neurologic complications — Ramsay Hunt syndrome, paresis timing, autonomic and delayed neurologic effects: An uncommon complication of zoster is Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a peripheral facial nerve palsy accompanied by zoster vesicles on the ear, hard palate, or tongue, and many patients do not recover completely. Idiopathic facial palsy (Bell's palsy) might be caused by inapparent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. Occasionally, zoster can cause motor weakness in noncranial nerve distributions, called zoster paresis; the weakness develops abruptly within 2–3 weeks after onset of the rash and can involve upper or lower extremities, and the prognosis of zoster paresis is good. Zoster also can result in autonomic dysfunction, causing urinary retention and colonic pseudo-obstruction, and rarely patients will experience acute focal neurologic deficits weeks to months after resolution of the zoster rash; mortality from this syndrome is substantial.

### Benefits of high-dose corticosteroid and antiviral agent combination therapy in the treatment of house-brackman grade VI ramsay hunt syndrome [^7cbd7758]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Few large-scale investigations have been conducted on treatment of House-Brackmann grade VI (HB grade VI) Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) patients. We compared recovery rates among patients receiving a normal-dose corticosteroid (prednisolone [PSL] 60 mg/d) or high-dose corticosteroid (PSL 200 mg/d), both with or without an antiviral agents. Recovery rates were also examined based on the order of presentation of herpetic vesicles versus facial palsy.

Study Design

Retrospective case review.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

A total of 128 patients with HB grade VI RHS were treated in our department between 1995 and 2017. These patients were divided into four treatment groups based on corticosteroid dosage and use of an antiviral agent.

Methods

We assessed treatment outcomes for HB grade VI patients together with logistic regression analysis to investigate factors that can impact treatment outcomes, that is, sex, age, days to start of treatment, PSL dosage, and antiviral agent administration.

Results

Recovery rates were best in the high-dose corticosteroid group with an antiviral agent (71.1%) in comparison with the normal-dose corticosteroid group with an antiviral agent (60.0%) or high-dose corticosteroid alone (57.1%). Significant factors for treatment outcomes were high-dose corticosteroid administration and early initiation of treatment. A better recovery rate was also found when the herpetic vesicles appeared before facial palsy.

Conclusion

We showed that a combination of a high-dose corticosteroid and antiviral agent produced the best outcomes for patients with HB grade VI RHS. However, our results were not statistically significant because of small sample size.

### Vocal cord paralysis associated with ramsay hunt syndrome: looking back 50 years [^147b13e8]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome is defined by herpes zoster oticus and peripheral facial nerve palsy which is often associated with otalgia. The syndrome is, in rare cases, associated with other cranial nerve paralyses including the vagal nerve causing unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Vocal cord paralysis is more often seen as a symptom of various other diseases, that is, malignant tumours, neurodegenerative illness, cerebrovascular assaults, inflammatory processes or as a result of intubation or surgical procedures. The symptoms of unilateral vocal cord paralysis are mainly hoarseness, dyspnoea and dysphagia. We present a case of Ramsay Hunt syndrome combined with unilateral hearing loss and left vocal cord paralysis. The patient underwent MRI, CT and a lumbar puncture causing anxiety in the patient and delaying the initiation of antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment, which is only efficient when initiated within 72 h. We hope to raise the awareness of this disease.

### Ramsay hunt syndrome type II [^95df07ac]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old man developed 3 days of left facial pain and swelling with left-sided hearing loss followed by a painful, unilateral, erythematous, and vesicular rash on the left anterior two-thirds of the tongue, external auditory canal, lip, and face typical of varicella-zoster virus reactivation (figure). Reactivation in the geniculate ganglion or facial nerve is uncommon and typically causes tongue and auricular lesions or facial palsy and was described by Hunt in 1907.(1) The patient received IV acyclovir and oral prednisone with rapid improvement in pain and resolution of lesions and improvement of hearing over 1 month.

### Vestibular rehabilitation therapy in a patient with chronic vestibulopathy of ramsay hunt syndrome [^cb251d16]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

A 60-yr-old man presented with chronic vestibulopathy induced by Ramsay Hunt syndrome for 1 yr. Prolonged dizziness and postural imbalance affected his quality-of-life. He was treated using a 2-mo protocol of customized vestibular rehabilitation therapy consisting of 16 treatment sessions in a rehabilitation clinic and daily home exercises. Significant improvements in the subjective perception of dizziness and objective balance function were found. The results suggest that vestibular rehabilitation therapy may be an effective therapeutic method for chronic vestibulopathy of Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

### Variable patterns of varicella-zoster virus reactivation in ramsay hunt syndrome [^d2dab8db]. Journal of Medical Virology (2004). Low credibility.

The mechanism by which reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes facial paralysis in Ramsay Hunt syndrome remains unclear. The relationship between VZV load and the onset of facial paralysis was analyzed in 42 patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The patients were divided into three groups according to the times of appearance of zoster and of facial paralysis; group I (zoster preceding, n = 13), group II (simultaneous, n = 22), group III (paralysis preceding, n = 7). A real-time quantitative PCR assay was used to measure VZV DNA copy number in saliva, and paired sera were assayed for anti-VZV IgG and IgM antibodies. In group I, the VZV DNA-positive rate was low and virus load decreased gradually after the initial hospital visit around the time of onset of paralysis. The level of anti-VZV antibodies had in most cases already increased at that time. In group III, viral load tended to increase after the onset of paralysis and peaked around the time of appearance of zoster. The level of anti-VZV antibodies was low at the onset of paralysis but showed a significant increase when paired sera were tested. In group II, virus load and changes in level of anti-VZV antibodies either resembled group I or group III behavior. These results indicate that facial paralysis in Ramsay Hunt syndrome can occur at various times between the early and the regression phase of VZV reactivation, suggesting that there are variable patterns of development of facial nerve dysfunction caused by VZV reactivation and the progression of neuritis.

### Bilateral taste disorders in patients with ramsay hunt syndrome and Bell palsy [^f229a096]. Annals of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) and Bell palsy (BP) are typically known as facial nerve motor syndromes and are primarily unilateral. The aim of this study was to challenge this assertion, because both conditions are also known to be associated with viruses that typically affect several nerves.

Methods

Ten participants with RHS, 12 with BP, all clinically unilateral, and 12 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. Electrogustometric thresholds were measured bilaterally in the areas of the chorda tympani, the glossopharyngeal, and the major petrosal nerve. Also bilaterally, the taste function was tested using chemogustometry with different tastant concentrations. Again bilaterally, the morphology of the mucosa and the vessels of the anterior fungiform papillae were examined by contact endoscopy. Statistically, RHS and BP participants were compared with the healthy controls, and the paretic sides of RHS and BP were compared pairwise with their mobile sides.

Results

Electrogustometrically, perception was reduced bilaterally in RHS (10-19dB, p < 0.001) and BP (3-5dB, p = 0.011–0.030) in all 3 innervation areas. Chemogustometrically, it was also reduced bilaterally in RHS (20–70%) and BP (8–50%). Papillary atrophies were increased 100% in RHS (p = 0.001) and BP (p < 0.001). They were more increased on the paretic side in RHS (30%, p = 0.078) and BP (83%, p < 0.001).

Interpretation

In these 2 clinically unilateral conditions, the gustatory perception and morphology are bilaterally affected, more in RHS and more on the paretic side. BP, known as an isolated motor condition, appears to be a cranial polyneuritis. A bilateral examination and therapeutic gustatory monitoring might follow these observations in evidence-based practice. Ann Neurol 2018;83:807–815.

### Fear of falling as a potential complication of ramsay hunt syndrome in older adults: a case report [^0925aa33]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
A Initial onset of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Right facial palsy presented as an asymmetric mouth and incomplete closure of the right eye. The patient received a Grade V score on the House–Brackmann Facial Paralysis Scale on December 16, 2019. B One year after the patient's Ramsay Hunt syndrome episode. Her facial palsy was considerably improved, and she received a Grade II score on the House–Brackmann Facial Paralysis Scale on March 30, 2021

Fig. 2

After discharge, the patient fell three times at home within 1 month. Due to repeated falls, she visited the geriatric clinic 22 days after discharge and completed a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) revealed poor balance (1/4), poor gait speed (1/4), and fair chair stand (3/4). The patient completed the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test in 9.4 seconds, which was within the normal range for older adults (Table 1). FOF was confirmed through the positive response to the questions on the FOF and activity restriction (SQ-FAR) questionnaire, which asked, "Are you afraid of falling?" and "If YES, did your FOF lead you to restrict some of your activities?". The patient was referred to a physical therapy center for rehabilitation and balance training. The physical therapist educated her on home-based self-balance training. The second CGA was conducted 3 months after the first CGA. The patient had had no further falls since the last CGA. However, she still had FOF and refused to go outdoors. The patient's SPPB revealed resumed balance (4/4) and walking speed (4/4) but deteriorated chair stand (2/4). The patient's TUG test time increased to 14.1 seconds. At the third CGA performed 3 months after the second CGA, the patient's TUG test time increased to 16.2 seconds. At the same time, the patient's IADLs showed new impairments in three aspects: shopping, transportation, and handling of finances. She required family members to accompany her when she left home. The fourth CGA, performed 6 months after the third CGA, showed that the patient's TUG test time increased to 17.6 seconds, which was higher than in any of her previous TUG tests. The IADLs assessment still showed an impairment in shopping. The patient's EuroQol-visual analog scales (EQ-VAS) score, which represents a patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analog scale, was between 55 to 80 throughout the four CGAs. The patient reported no additional falls between the follow-up appointments, and her handgrip strength was intact throughout the serial CGAs. The patient reported that physical therapy and balance training were useful, and she felt grateful because no incident of falls had occurred afterward. However, even though her SPPB improved, especially during the balance test, the patient's FOF persisted, and she was too afraid to walk by herself. This consequently caused her to become less socially active due to the fear of going out independently, even though her facial palsy had considerably improved 1 year after the onset of RHS (Fig. 1 B).

### Facial palsy and atrial fibrillation: a special case of ramsay hunt syndrome [^31eddd2c]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus) is a rare complication of latent Varicella Zoster virus infection. It can be complicated by permanent hearing loss, loss of taste and postherpetic neuralgia. Although Ramsay Hunt syndrome most prominently involves the facial nerve, a number of other cranial nerves can be involved such as the vestibulocochlear, glossopharyngeal and the vagus nerve. We report on a case of Ramsay Hunt syndrome with cranial polyneuritis complicated by atrial fibrillation. Vagal involvement as evidenced by physical examination and MRI findings was present in our patient. We hypothesise that viral vagal neuritis likely contributed to the development of atrial fibrillation in our patient through involvement of the autonomic components of the vagus nerve.

### Progressive myoclonus ataxia: time for a new definition? [^8adb6fed]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Progressive myoclonus ataxia (PMA) is a rare disorder and defined in the literature as progressive ataxia and myoclonus, without prominent decline in cognitive functions, and with or without infrequent epileptic seizures. 1 PMA was previously known as the Ramsay Hunt syndrome, named after sir James Ramsay Hunt who first described this triad of symptoms in 1921. 2 PMA can be acquired as in celiac disease but is mainly caused by genetic disorders, including inborn errors of metabolism and neurodegenerative disorders, such as myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers syndrome and North Sea progressive myoclonus epilepsy. 3 Despite the suspicion of a genetic cause, only in less than 50% a causative genetic defect can be identified. 4 Identification of an etiological cause is important as some disorders require specific treatment and also with regard to the patient's prognosis and appropriate genetic counseling.

As a clear demarcation of clinical features of PMA is absent, problems arise regarding the recognition and differentiation of PMA from other neurological syndromes. PMA can especially be hard to distinguish from the related but more extensively studied progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) syndrome. PMA and PME syndromes are characterized by the combination of myoclonus, ataxia, and epilepsy and mainly differ in the severity of specific features. By definition, PME patients compared to PMA present with more prominent (frequent) epilepsy and have in addition, severe cognitive deterioration. 1 It is unclear where to draw the line between infrequent and frequent epilepsy and if (mild) cognitive decline should be part of the PMA criteria. In the past, the difficulties in discriminating PME and PMA led to a discussion between experts from the epilepsy field arguing for lumping, whereas movement disorder experts favored splitting. 5, 6 Recently, this discussion restarted in the disorder North Sea PME caused by a mutation in the Golgi SNAP receptor complex 2 gene (GOSR2) gene, which is described both as PMA and PME in the literature. 7, 8

### Acyclovir responsive brain stem disease after the ramsay hunt syndrome [^18df2e35]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2004). Low credibility.

We report an immunocompetent patient with the Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) followed days later by brainstem disease. Extensive virological studies proved that varicella zoster virus (VZV) was the causative agent. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir resulted in prompt resolution of all neurological deficits except peripheral facial palsy. This case demonstrates that after geniculate zoster, brainstem disease may develop even in an immunocompetent individual and effective antiviral therapy can be curative.

### Vestibular restoration and adaptation in vestibular neuritis and ramsay hunt syndrome with vertigo [^96f4f678]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate vestibular restoration and the evolution of the compensatory saccades in acute severe inflammatory vestibular nerve paralysis, including vestibular neuritis and Ramsay Hunt syndrome with vertigo.

Study Design

Prospective.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Vestibular neuritis (n = 18) and Ramsay Hunt syndrome patients with vertigo (n = 13) were enrolled.

Intervention

After treatment with oral corticosteroids, patients were followed up for 6 months.

Main Outcome Measures

Functional recovery of the facial nerve was scored according to the House-Brackman grading system. Caloric and video head impulse tests were performed in every patient at the time of enrolment. Subsequently, successive video head impulse test (vHIT) exploration was performed at the 1, 3, and 6-month follow-up.

Results

Eighteen patients with vestibular neuritis and 13 with Ramsay Hunt syndrome and associated vertigo were included. Vestibular function was significantly worse in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome than in those with vestibular neuritis. Similar compensatory saccades velocity and latency values were observed in both groups, in both the caloric and initial vHIT tests. Successive vHIT results showed a significantly higher vestibulo-ocular reflex gain recovery in vestibular neuritis patients than in Ramsay Hunt syndrome patients. A significantly faster reduction in the latency, velocity, and organization of the compensatory saccades was observed in neuritis than in Ramsay Hunt syndrome patients.

Conclusions

In addition to the recovery of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, the reduction of latency, velocity and the organization of compensatory saccades play a role in vestibular compensation.

### Voice correction treatment promotes recovery of vocal cord paralysis caused by atypical ramsay-hunt syndrome: a case report [^6d2e9d00]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Atypical Ramsay-Hunt syndrome is caused by varicella zoster viruses (VZV), without herpes, herpes is not around the ear, or posterior cranial nerve palsy is the first clinical manifestation. In this case, a 60-year-old male patient with VZV invades the branches of the vagus nerve alone. The initial symptoms were in the pharynx and larynx, which presented as mucosal ulcers and voice disorders. The ear symptoms were only otalgia and auricular herpes, without deafness, tinnitus, or peripheral facial palsy. Herpes and ulcers healed with medication, but voice disorders caused by vocal cord paralysis did not return. Voice correction treatment has been implemented to help restore the movement and closure of the vocal cords, with ultimately good results. After voice correction treatment, the patient recovered without residual nerve palsy complications. Voice correction treatment has been shown to be potentially effective and promising in shortening the recovery period and improving the recovery rate for vocal cord paralysis caused by viral infection.

### Magnetic resonance imaging evidence of varicella zoster virus polyneuropathy: involvement of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves associated with ramsay hunt syndrome [^94bc03c3]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The involvement of lower cranial nerve palsies is less frequent in Ramsay Hunt syndrome caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV). The authors report 1 of extremely rare patients of radiologically proven polyneuropathy of VZV infection with magnetic resonance imaging findings of VII, IX, and X cranial nerve involvement is a 62-year-old female patient, who initially presented with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Varicella zoster virus infection should be considered even in patients who show unilateral palsy of the lower cranial nerves associated with laryngeal paralysis. Thin-section T2W and T1W images with a contrast agent should be added to the imaging protocol to show the subtle involvement.

### Herpes zoster auris ("geniculate" ganglionitis) [^a5800f6f]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

INTRODUCTION In many papers, from 1906 to 1910, Ramsay Hunt1 reviewed 56 cases, abstracted from the literature, including 4 observed by him, of herpetic eruptive inflammations of zona involving the ear, fusing the herpetic variants in these cases into an entity which he called geniculate ganglionitis. This entity with its corollary, geniculate neuralgia, has received only quasirecognition in otolaryngologic texts. As a measure of the actual skepticism existent, neurosurgeons operate for glossopharyngeal otalgia but apparently are unable to find cases of geniculate neuralgia, while a search for factual information on "Hunt's syndrome" in textbooks brings out clearly the extreme paucity of information concerning this most interesting neuro-otologic disease.

An English textbook, for example, states, "Herpes Zoster Auris is a rare disease, " following this laconic quip with a meager discussion of Hunt's work, while an American text, after uncritically discussing, in two small paragraphs, "Hunt's Syndrome, " displays an excellent colored representation.

### Concurrent treatment with intratympanic dexamethasone improves facial nerve recovery in ramsay hunt syndrome [^fd9797d2]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether early intervention with intratympanic steroid injections, known as concurrent intratympanic steroid therapy (ITST), is an effective supplement to systemic steroid therapy for moderately-severe to severe Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

Methods

Forty-six patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome (House-Brackmann grade IV or higher) who received either concurrent ITST with standard systemic steroid therapy (ITST group, n = 12) or standard systemic therapy alone (control group, n = 34) with antivirals starting within 7 days of onset. Patients in the concurrent ITST group received the standard systemic dose of prednisolone (410 mg in total) and intratympanic dexamethasone (16.5 mg in total) over 10 consecutive days. Patients in the control group received systemic prednisolone at the standard dose or higher (average dose, 581 ± 25 mg).

Results

The recovery rate was higher in the concurrent ITST group than in the control group (93% vs 47%, P = 0.013). The adjusted odds ratio was 22.2 (95% confidence interval 1.32–373.58, P = 0.031).

Conclusions

The recovery rate was higher after concurrent systemic and intratympanic steroid therapy than after standard systemic steroid therapy, regardless of whether the steroid used had lower or equivalent glucocorticoid potency. This finding suggests that concurrent intratympanic steroid therapy is a beneficial supplement in patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

### Ramsay hunt syndrome… [^ef9400dd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

RAMSAY HUNT'S original description of geniculate herpes zoster is a model of thoughtful analysis applied to a clinical observation. From an eruption in the ear, Hunt was able to define the concept of inflammation of cranial nerve ganglia and deduce the sensory distribution of the facial nerve. Hunt, who was an American neurologist, saw in geniculate herpes not only a new syndrome but also a unique neuroanatomical demonstration, and he elaborated his ideas on the functions and dysfunctions of the seventh cranial nerve in a series of articles over a period of 30 years. One significant contribution of the later papers was the description of oral eruptions in geniculate herpes. 1 A major review of the subject was published by him in 1937, 2 the year of his death. Additions to Hunt's clinical picture have been made by other authors, and involvement of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves. Brody IA, Wilkins RH. Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. Arch Neurol. 1968;

### A case report of refractory postherpetic neuralgia after ramsay hunt syndrome treated with tympanic nerve neurectomy [^56014c19]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a facial nerve palsy that arises from herpes zoster infection. In rare cases, postherpetic neuralgia is a complication following Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Pain management to address postherpetic neuralgia includes facial nerve blocks, medications such as gabapentin, carbamazepine and botulinum toxin injections, and pulsed radiofrequency. Despite the reported benefits for patients with glossopharyngeal nerve pain, neurectomy as a treatment has rarely been described. A 45-year-old patient visited our ENT clinic for chronic right-sided facial, ear, and jaw pain that persisted for 9 years following the development of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. She trialed multiple medications including gabapentin, carbamazepine, and botulinum toxin injections with minimal relief to her symptoms. The patient underwent a diagnostic myringotomy with topical application of lidocaine to the tympanic nerve. This resulted in temporary relief of her pain until the effects of the lidocaine subsided. The patient was subsequently offered lysis of the right tympanic nerve for more definitive management. The patient experienced significant pain reduction after the right tympanic neurectomy procedure. Chronic postherpetic neuralgia following Ramsay Hunt syndrome can cause significant impairment in a patient's quality of life. For patients with ear pain refractory to conservative management, a tympanic neurectomy can be considered.

### Value of electroneurography as a prognostic indicator for recovery in acute severe inflammatory facial paralysis: a prospective study of Bell's palsy and ramsay hunt syndrome [^261fc1b8]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of electroneuronography (ENoG) in acute severe inflammatory facial paralysis, including Bell's palsy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS).

Study Design

Prospective observational study.

Methods

Patients with acute severe facial paralysis of House-Brackmann (H-B) grade IV or worse and diagnosed with Bell's palsy or RHS were enrolled from August 2007 to July 2011. After treatment with oral corticosteroid, antiviral agent, and protective eye care, patients were followed up until recovery or 12 months from onset.

Results

Sixty-six patients with Bell's palsy and 22 with RHS were included. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed significant effect of ENoG value on recovery in both Bell's palsy and RHS. Values of ENoG were significantly worse in RHS than Bell's palsy. Chance of early recovery within 6 weeks after correction of ENoG effect was still significantly worse in RHS. Logistic regression analysis showed 90% chance of recovery within 6 months, expected with ENoG values of 69.2% degeneration (Bell's palsy) and 59.3% (RHS). The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves showed ENoG values of 82.5% (Bell's palsy) and 78.0% (RHS) as a critical cutoff value of nonrecovery until 1 year, with the best sensitivity and specificity.

Conclusions

A higher chance of recovery was expected with better ENoG in Bell's palsy and RHS. Based on our data, nonrecovery is predicted in patients with ENoG value greater than 82.5% in Bell's palsy, and 78% in RHS.

### Chickenpox and the geniculate ganglion: facial nerve palsy, ramsay hunt syndrome and acyclovir treatment [^306e79fa]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Facial nerve palsy has long been considered to have an infectious etiology. Recent diagnostic analyses in children and adults have provided convincing evidence that reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), sometimes during infectious mononucleosis, can lead to cranial nerve VII palsy. The site of reactivation from latency is the geniculate ganglion. Virus most likely enters the ganglion during chickenpox, via the sensory branches of the facial nerve located on the ear and tongue. Retrospective reviews suggest that patients with VZV-related facial nerve palsy have poorer outcomes than other cases of Bell's palsy. Therefore treatment with acyclovir is suggested when VZV reactivation i slikely.

### Comparative analysis of vestibular dysfunction and compensation in ramsay-hunt syndrome and vestibular neuritis [^56312efe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate vestibular loss and compensation in Ramsay-Hunt syndrome with dizziness (RHS-D) and vestibular neuritis (VN).

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study from 2019 to 2023.

Setting

Tertiary care neurotology practice.

Methods

Patients with RHS-D or VN who underwent videonystagmography, including cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP), caloric stimulation, rotary chair, and oculomotor testing, were reviewed and stratified by vertigo etiology. The main outcome measures were rates and severity of vestibular loss, as measured by cVEMP and caloric stimulation, and of vestibular compensation, as measured by rotary chair and oculomotor testing.

Results

Ten patients were found to have RHS-D and 22 with VN. Caloric and cVEMP abnormalities were noted in 100 and 70% of RHS-D patients compared to 60 and 20% with VN (P = 0.029 and P = 0.034, respectively). RHS-D patients were significantly more likely to present with concurrent caloric and cVEMP abnormalities compared to VN (70 and 13%, respectively; P = 0.009). Vestibular loss appeared more severe in RHS-D compared to VN suggested by significantly lower mean bithermal slow phase velocity sum (3.8 and 21 degrees per second, respectively), greater canal paresis (78.7 and 40.2%, respectively), and greater cVEMP amplitude asymmetry (64 and 31%, respectively) (P = 0.014, P < .001, and P = 0.053, respectively). Regarding vestibular compensation, abnormal gain asymmetry was present in 88% of RHS-D patients with a mean asymmetry of 31.2 compared to 11% in VN with a mean of 14.0 (P = 0.019 and P = 0.003, respectively).

Conclusion

Compared to VN, RHS-D patients appear to suffer from a more profound vestibular loss and a worsened ability to compensate for such deficits.

### Ramsay hunt syndrome with cranial polyneuropathy with features of supraglottitis [^195c81c0]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 67-year-old woman presented with a 1-week history of left otalgia and a 1-day history of odynophagia, pain extending into the face and neck, and a productive cough. Flexible nasendoscopy showed features of supraglottitis, with swollen arytenoids and pooling of saliva in the piriform fossae. Laboratory investigations revealed a mildly raised C reactive protein. A CT scan of the neck supported the diagnosis of supraglottitis and pharyngitis, with thickening of the mucosa of the left piriform fossae and left oropharynx. Standard supraglottitis treatment was instigated, but on day 4 of the admission, a vesicular rash and features of cranial nerve involvement (V, VII, VIII, X) developed. A revised diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome with cranial polyneuropathy was made and later confirmed by varicella zoster virus PCR. After 4weeks, facial nerve function normalised, but features of other cranial nerve palsies were persistent.

### Prognostic factors in herpes zoster oticus (ramsay hunt syndrome) [^331263c7]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine if an accurate prognosis can be made in patients with Herpes zoster oticus (HZO), facial nerve outcomes were assessed at 1-year after onset and compared with symptoms and signs at presentation.

Study Design

Individual retrospective cohort study of 101 records in a case series (level of evidence: Level 2b).

Methods

Symptoms, signs, audiology, and treatment records were analyzed to determine their association with facial nerve outcome at 1 year.

Results

Mean improvement at 1 year for the 101 patients was 3 House-Brackmann (HB) grade units. Initially, severity ranged from HB III to HB VI. Mean recovery was significantly greater for those patients who were initially more affected, although at 1 year, they had still not recovered to the same grade as those initially less affected. Having both incomplete eye closure and a dry eye was associated with less recovery at 1 year. The use of prednisone combined with an antiviral agent, and begun at or after Day 5 of the illness, was related to a better facial nerve outcome. No other symptom, sign, or audiologic feature was of prognostic value.

Conclusion

All patients with HZO improved facial function to some degree, with the mean gain at 1 year after onset being 3 HB grade units. Improvement was less for patients who initially had both incomplete eye closure and dry eye. The group who received a combination of an antiviral medication with steroids given after 5 days had the best facial nerve outcome.

### Brainstem infarction and vertebral artery vasculopathy after ramsay hunt syndrome [^c8260a58]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

A 45-year-old man presented with right auricle rash, facial weakness, otalgia, deafness, and transient dizzy spells. He had leftward spontaneous, bidirectional gaze-evoked and unsuppressed leftward head-shaking nystagmus in head-shaking tilt suppression test (Figure 1). MRI results showed a subacute infarct on the right dorsolateral pons and medulla oblongata and incomplete flow void in the right vertebral artery. After acyclovir and dexamethasone therapy, the ischemic lesion and vascular narrowing on MRI vanished and the patient's symptoms disappeared (Figure 2). Concomitant intracranial vasculopathy and brainstem stroke may occur in Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which could be easily missed but possibly detected by careful eye movement assessments.

### Bell palsy… [^d10d71de]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Bell palsy is an idiopathic, unilateral, acute paresis or paralysis of facial movement caused by dysfunction of the lower motor neuron. Up to 30 percent of persons with acute peripheral facial palsy have an alternative cause diagnosed at presentation or during the course of their facial palsy. Alternative causes are higher in children, warranting specialist evaluation at presentation. Severe pain, vesicles, and hearing loss or imbalance suggest Ramsay Hunt syndrome caused by herpes zoster virus infection, which requires specialist management. Most persons with paresis make a spontaneous recovery within three weeks. Up to 30 percent of persons, typically those with paralysis, have a delayed or incomplete recovery.

Corticosteroids alone improve the rate of recovery, increase the proportion of persons who make a full recovery, and reduce cosmetically disabling sequelae, motor synkinesis, and autonomic dysfunction compared with placebo or no treatment. Definition Bell palsy is an idiopathic, acute, unilateral paresis or paralysis of the face in a pattern consistent with peripheral facial nerve dysfunction. The paralysis may be partial or complete, occurring with equal frequency on the right and left sides of the face. There is evidence that Bell palsy is caused by herpes viruses. Additional symptoms of Bell palsy may include mild pain in or behind the ear, oropharyngeal or facial numbness, impaired tolerance to ordinary levels of noise, and disturbed taste on the anterior part of the tongue. Severe pain is more suggestive of herpes zoster virus infection and possible progression to Ramsay Hunt syndrome, but other causes should be carefully excluded.

Up to 30 percent of persons with an acute peripheral facial palsy will not have Bell palsy; other causes may include stroke, tumor, trauma, middle ear disease, and Lyme disease. Features such as sparing of movement in the upper face or weakness of a specific branch of the facial nerve suggest an alternative cause. Herpes zoster–associated facial palsy more often presents as zoster sine herpete, although 6 percent of persons will subsequently develop vesicles. Thus, treatment plans for the management of Bell palsy should recognize the high incidence of herpes zoster virus, which is associated with worse outcomes. Inflammation of the facial nerve initially results in reversible neurapraxia, but wallerian degeneration may occur.

### Tolosa-hunt syndrome: appraising the ICHD-3 beta diagnostic criteria [^75add66f]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction The term Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome was first used more than half a century ago to describe painful ophthalmoplegia accompanied by cranial nerve palsies. In the decades since, its diagnostic criteria have evolved considerably. The beta version of the 3rd Edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders narrows these criteria to require the demonstration of granulomatous inflammation on MRI or biopsy. We believe this may introduce challenges to accurate diagnosis. Discussion Requiring the demonstration of granulomatous inflammation for a diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome may introduce the potential for false negative and false positive diagnoses. Although the disorder presents secondary to granulomatous inflammation, MRI technology may not be able to identify it reliably, and biopsy is not always indicated for its symptomatology. Additionally, several cases have been reported of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome diagnosed with MRI-confirmed granulomatous inflammation that later prove to be attributable to other pathologies. The emphasis on neuroimaging may therefore exclude some true Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome cases and include others resulting from other latent pathologies that are not visible on MRI. Conclusion We wish to offer several potential modifications to the International Classification of Headache Disorders guidelines for Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome, including making the demonstration of granulomatous inflammation on MRI or biopsy non-mandatory and lengthening patient follow-up to two years for cases in which MRI is unrevealing.

### Fear of falling as a potential complication of ramsay hunt syndrome in older adults: a case report [^be3397fd]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

We report the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented with persistent FOF 1 year after an episode of RHS, even though her serial CGAs showed recovered balance and no additional falls. Previous reports regarding older adults with RHS have mainly focused on the treatment of facial palsy, postherpetic neuralgia, and disease prognosis. However, the impact of RHS on older adults' physical, psychological, and social functioning has rarely been reported, despite the fact that functional status is one of the most crucial determinants of older adults' quality of life. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe a patient with FOF and functional deterioration after an RHS episode.

The classic symptom triad of RHS consists of ipsilateral facial paralysis, otalgia, and vesicular rash over the external auditory canal. Furthermore, VZV could affect not only the 7th cranial nerve but also other cranial nerves, most commonly the 8th cranial nerve. Symptoms of 8th cranial nerve dysfunction, including vertigo, dizziness, poor balance, tinnitus, and hearing loss have been reported in patients with RHS. According to recent studies, 26–37% of patients with RHS developed vertigo. One study showed that vertigo in all patients disappeared with conservative treatment during the hospitalization period. Another study reported that vertigo in a patient lasted up to 7 months. Among patients with acute peripheral facial palsy (RHS and Bell's palsy), older people were more likely to develop dizziness, vertigo, and poor balance than younger ones. In the present study, the 65-years-old patient had the classic RHS triad, as well as dizziness, vertigo, and poor balance. Due to this patient's age, she may have a higher tendency to develop vertigo.

### Incidence of acute complications of herpes zoster among immunocompetent adults in england: a matched cohort study using routine health data [^3d250f02]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our cohort study of 178 964 UK adults with zoster, from CPRD GOLD and Aurum, we found raised risks of neurological, ocular, cutaneous, visceral and zoster‐specific complications in the 3 months after zoster diagnosis. Estimated absolute risks attributable to zoster were 0.48% (95% CI 0.44–0.51) for neurological complications, 1.33% (95% CI 1.28–1.39) for ocular complications, 0.29% (95% CI 0.26–0.32) for cutaneous complications and 0.78% (95% CI 0.73–0.84) for visceral complications. The estimated absolute attributable risks of zoster‐specific complications were 0.37% for Ramsay Hunt syndrome, 0.01% for disseminated zoster, 0.04% for death due to zoster and 0.97% for zoster‐related hospitalization. Younger patients with zoster (< 50 years) had higher relative risk, but lower absolute risk, of complications compared with older patients (≥ 50 years). Antiviral use during acute zoster appeared to protect against neurological complications, Ramsay Hunt syndrome and hospitalization. Clinicians should be aware that zoster can lead to various complications, besides PHN.

### Audiologic findings in ramsay hunt syndrome… [^3220207c]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

RAMSAY HUNT1 in 1907 described a syndrome which he attributed to geniculate ganglion pathology consisting of herpes zoster, affecting a portion of the external ear, and facial palsy. Subsequent investigations failed to confirm geniculate ganglion pathology but have demonstrated lymphocytic infiltration and degeneration of the facial nerve. 2–5 The skin of the concha and external auditory canal is supplied by cranial nerves 5, 7, 9, 10 and upper cervical nerves. Herpetic lesions of the external ear could be due to involvement of the ganglia of any of these nerves. It appears that the dorsal root ganglia of the upper cervical nerves are often involved in this syndrome because of the distribution of the severe burning pain which so characteristically precedes facial palsy and differentiates it from Bell's palsy. A filterable virus, similar to if not identical with chickenpox virus, is considered the causal agent of herpes zoster. 6 The Harbert F, Young IM.

### Evaluation and management of tolosa-hunt syndrome in Children: a clinical update [^9560ffd1]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a painful ophthalmoplegia caused by an inflammatory process of unknown etiology in the region of the cavernous sinus, orbital apex, or superior orbital fissure. This disease is rare in the pediatric population. The objective of this study was to provide a clinical framework for the evaluation and treatment of children with this disorder. A systematic approach to the diagnosis of painful ophthalmoplegia in children is proposed.

Methods

We present a 15-year-old girl whose clinical presentation and neuroradiological findings support a diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome as defined by the 2013 International Classification of Headache Disorders (Third Edition, ICHD-3 beta) diagnostic criteria. An exhaustive systematic literature search based on these criteria yielded 15 additional cases of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome in children. Clinical, demographic, and radiological features were retrospectively analyzed. The results and statistical analyses are reported.

Results

A total of 16 individuals were included in the final analysis. This review summarizes the current knowledge and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of pediatric Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. It highlights demographic, clinical, and radiological features of this disease in children and underscores areas of the literature where evidence is still lacking.

Conclusions

Overall, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome seems to follow a similar course in children compared to adults. The diagnostic approach and treatment require specific considerations. New observations and possible features of pediatric Tolosa-Hunt syndrome are discussed. Further research is needed to optimize clinical detection and medical management of this disease.

### Fear of falling as a potential complication of ramsay hunt syndrome in older adults: a case report [^255e2c2a]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a 65-year-old Taiwanese woman with underlying hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Her baseline activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) indicated complete independence. The patient lived with her husband, and their son lived nearby.

On presentation, the patient had acute onset of dizziness and right otalgia 15 days before admission. Several vesicles emerged from the patient's right auricle 1 day later. She was diagnosed with herpes zoster infection in the right ear, and an oral antiviral agent (acyclovir 800 mg QID) was prescribed for 7 days at a local clinic 5 days after initial symptoms. Unfortunately, the dizziness and right otalgia did not improve with treatment. Upon experiencing acute right-sided facial palsy 13 days after initial symptoms, the patient visited the emergency department, where physical examination revealed right peripheral-type facial palsy, presenting as an asymmetric mouth and incomplete closure of the right eye. Oral steroids (prednisolone 5 mg BID) were prescribed for emergent treatment of facial palsy. She was subsequently referred to the neurology clinic. As RHS with 7th and 8th cranial nerves involvement was suspected, the patient was immediately admitted to the neurology department for further evaluation. After admission, the patient's right peripheral type facial palsy was estimated as Grade V severity on the House–Brackmann Facial Paralysis Scale (Fig. 1 A). The Romberg test failed because of the patient's inability to stand steadily while closing her eyes. The result of the vestibular function test was compatible with right vestibular dysfunction. The otorhinolaryngology fiberoscope displayed two crusts at the right auricle without any other lesions in the right external auditory canal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium administration revealed increased enhancement in the distal right internal auditory canal (Fig. 2). A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study demonstrated lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis. Herpes simplex virus and VZV were not identified in the viral nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction of the CSF. No pathogens were detected in the CSF by virus isolation or bacterial culture. Under the suspicion of aseptic meningitis, an empirical intravenous antiviral agent (acyclovir 750 mg Q8H) was administered for 14 days. Artificial tears (hypromellose/dextran 1 gtt QID OU) were prescribed for the patient's lagophthalmos in the right eye. Physiatrist-arranged electrical stimulation and physical therapy, including self-facial exercises, facial stretches, and mirror visual feedback, were used to treat the patient's facial palsy. Despite completing the treatment course of intravenous antiviral agents, the patient still experienced dizziness and imbalance and could not ambulate by herself. The patient required assistance or needed to hold a handrail when getting out of bed. After 15 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged with a stationary clinical manifestation.

Background and aims: Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) involves reactivation of the varicella‐zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion, affecting the facial nerve (CN7) [1]. This leads to ipsilateral facial paralysis and may extend to nearby cranial nerves, causing symptoms like hearing loss, tinnitus, or vertigo [2]. Even with the unusualness of this, there´s no description of treatments and outcomes in these patients. This study aimed to highlight the interplay between cranial nerve dysfunction and posterior recovery, based on treatment regime.

Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA protocols, emphasizing abnormal presentations. PubMed database was searched until 2014 using keywords: "Ramsay‐Hunt Syndrome", and "Nerve". 45 studies found. We evaluated age, cranial nerve involvement, and outcome.

FIGURE 1 PRISMA flowchart presenting the process of inclusion of studies for systematic review

Results: We included 30 studies, reporting 33 patients with a mean age of 56 years. Of which, 10 (30%) were female, and 23 (60%) male. 91% of patients presented CN7 involvement, 48.4% with vestibulocochlear, 36% trigeminal, and 27% vagus. 60% of patients treated with valacyclovir didn´t recover their functionality in nerves besides the CN7, compared to 47.6% of those treated with acyclovir. 43.7% of patients with vestibulocochlear involvement presented better prognosis using acyclovir, while valacyclovir obtained fewer results. Both treatments presented better recovery when administered with corticosteroids.

FIGURE 2 Patients based on the number of structures affected

Conclusion: Although rare, cranial nerve involvement is a challenge in rehabilitation of RHS patients. This study provides a list of cases where the use of acyclovir showed a better prognosis when other cranial nerves are affected, contrasting with literature around CN7 involved alone, which might be inconclusive or opposite [3].

Disclosure: Nothing to disclose.

### Physical therapy for facial nerve paralysis (Bell's palsy): an updated and extended systematic review of the evidence for facial exercise therapy [^622e7da7]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Methodological quality and risk of bias: Consensus ratings of the methodological quality of studies (GRADE) are shown in the final column of Table 2. Five of the 19 individual studies were rated as high quality; four of these were randomised controlled trials –; and one was a cohort study. A further six studies were judged to be of moderate quality. Two were randomised controlled trials, and four were non-experimental observational studies. The remaining nine studies were rated as low methodological quality. Two were randomised trials, one was a quasi-experimental study, and two were small pilot studies. In terms of methodological flaws all, except one study, were at risk of bias for failing to blind participants when outcomes were based on patient-reported measures. One high-quality study failed to achieve the required sample size, with a significant number of severe facial palsy patients in the control group dropping out in order to access physical therapy which was shown to be improving outcomes.

Patient characteristics (diagnoses/conditions): There was a high level of heterogeneity in the characteristics of patients included in the studies as shown in Table 2. Where specified, there was considerable variation in time post-onset of facial palsy at study entry. Six studies focused on patients in the acute phase, ranging from 48 h, five days, ten days, to one month since onset. One study recruited patients in the 'sub-acute phase', that is, 3–5 days after the acute onset subsided. A further two studies focused on chronic stages of recovery, that is, 2–30 years since onset. The remaining 11 studies did not pre-specify time post-onset at study entry. Individual studies also varied in the types of facial palsy patient recruited. All studies included Bell's palsy patients. Three studies also recruited some Ramsay Hunt syndrome patients. Where specified, all patients had unilateral facial palsy, although some studies did not state the type. Some studies recorded patients' level of facial synkinesis at entry. Others focused on the severity of facial palsy; this ranged from Grade II to VII.

### Physical therapy for facial nerve paralysis (Bell's palsy): an updated and extended systematic review of the evidence for facial exercise therapy [^b6ae77fb]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

The evidence base for therapy in acute and chronic cases remains limited. Currently, a range of treatment options may be offered, with a recent study identifying considerable variation in the care pathways experienced by patients in the United Kingdom. These range from medication and physical therapies to surgery. Evidence of the effectiveness of surgical interventions remains limited, with a Cochrane systematic review reporting insufficient proof of benefit and further trials judged to be unlikely. Cochrane reviews have identified one pharmaceutical treatment (prednisolone) as an effective treatment (versus placebo) for Bell's palsy, but only if administered within 72 h of symptom onset. – Use of adjunctive antiviral therapy was reported to be of uncertain value, although more recent evidence of its value in the treatment of Ramsay Hunt syndrome, the second most common cause of facial palsy, has emerged. In addition to medication, a number of physical therapy options are available. Facial exercise therapy (facial neuromuscular retraining) is the most widely evaluated. – A Cochrane review of physical therapies published in 2011 reported some evidence that facial exercise therapy could improve facial function for moderate paralysis and chronic cases and reduce sequelae in acute cases, but it recommended the need for further studies. We have therefore undertaken a systematic review to identify and appraise any further studies that have examined the effectiveness of facial exercise therapy. Updated evidence on effectiveness is required to inform the planned development of facial remote activity monitoring eyewear to enable telerehabilitation in a patient's own home.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^7c80b75f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Facial paralysis etiologies and clinical features — Table 7 details conditions with etiologic agents and distinguishing factors, including autoimmune, idiopathic, infectious, inherited, neoplastic, neurovascular, and traumatic causes. Autoimmune Guillain-Barré lists an etiologic agent of autoimmune/infectious with distinguishing factors of acute polyneuropathy, ascending paralysis, and weakness of hands and feet progressing to the trunk. Idiopathic acute facial nerve paresis/paralysis is noted as classic Bell's palsy with other etiologies excluded. Infectious examples include Ramsay Hunt syndrome from herpes zoster virus with a pronounced prodrome of pain and vesicular eruption in the ear canal or pharynx; Lyme disease due to the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi that may be bilateral with rash and arthralgias; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated with fever, malaise, and CD4 count; and otitis media from bacterial pathogens with gradual onset, ear pain, fever, and hearing loss. Inherited heritable disorders show autosomal dominant inheritance with family history as high as 4%, and may have other neurologic disorders. Neoplastic causes such as facial nerve tumor, skin cancer, and parotid tumors involve multiple carcinomas of the head and neck and may involve only select branches of the facial nerve or other cranial nerves, presenting as multiple cranial neuropathies. Neurovascular stroke involves ischemia or hemorrhage with forehead sparing most often and extremities often involved. Traumatic injury to the facial nerve is tied to trauma, including forceps delivery, with timing of injury coinciding with the trauma.

### Zoster sine herpete causing facial palsy [^ee0ebb57]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to verify the characteristics of zoster sine herpete (ZSH) causing facial palsy and the effects of different treatments and to confirm the difference from other etiologies.

Methods

From March 2010 to March 2011, a prospective study was performed on patients with ZSH with facial palsy. Patients were divided into a steroid-treated group and a steroid-antiviral combination group, and then the effects according to regimen of treatment were prospectively analyzed. Last, the difference between the ZSH group and patients diagnosed with Bell palsy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome in the same study period was confirmed retrospectively.

Results

Forty-five patients were diagnosed as having ZSH. Significant improvement was not observed in the ZSH group regardless of the treatment regimen during a 3-week period (P < .05). In patients with ZSH with accompanying typical pain, significant continuous improvement after 6 weeks was observed in patients with combination therapy (P < .05). Compared with patients with Bell palsy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome, there was a significant difference in recovery rate between patients with ZSH (accompanying pain) and those with Bell palsy (89.9%) (P < .05).

Conclusion

The initiation of recovery in ZSH started later than that in other peripheral palsies, and slower recovery was shown in patients with ZSH with pain compared with those with Bell palsy. Steroid-antiviral combination therapy was a more effective regimen for treatment compared with steroid-only treatment. To improve the accuracy of ZSH diagnosis, confirming the presence of accompanying typical pain is necessary.

### Patients' perspectives of ophthalmic management of facial nerve paralysis [^48947f41]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Ophthalmic complications following facial nerve paralysis (FNP) from Bell's palsy, tumours, trauma and herpes zoster oticus/Ramsay Hunt syndrome include lagophthalmos which may result in exposure keratopathy, corneal ulcers or scarring. Patients report reduced quality of life, with eye complications both socially and functionally debilitating, requiring eye protection.FNP disrupts the innervation of orbicularis oculi, leaving levator palpebrae to act unopposed, affecting volitional eye closure and blinking. This causes retraction and suboptimal function of the upper and lower eyelids, including paralytic ectropion.

Management of FNP and lagophthalmos requires a multidisciplinary approach including conservative and surgical interventions. Conservative interventions include moisture chambers, silicon-hydrogel contact lenses, preservative-free drops and gel, manual eyelid stretching and eyelid taping. To lift the lower eyelid, a strip of adhesive tape may be applied from the centre of the lower eyelid with a superior-lateral pull to the lateral orbital rim aiming for lower eyelid elevation. This improves lagophthalmos by reducing the aperture of the palpebral fissure to assist with effective eye closure and improves lacrimation by restoring the lower eyelid position to bring the reservoir of tears back into contact with the cornea. Furthermore, botulinum toxin type A injections may be used to weaken levator palpebrae, inducing temporary upper eyelid ptosis for corneal protection. Despite these measures, eye discomfort occurs during showering or swimming, and windy, dry and dusty conditions.

### Prognostic factors of peripheral facial palsy: multivariate analysis followed by receiver operating characteristic and kaplan-meier analyses [^46d2e72a]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To search for prognostic predictors and reexamine the usefulness of electroneurography (ENoG) in predicting the prognosis of peripheral facial palsy using statistical methods.

Study Design

Prospective study.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Consecutive 142 patients with Bell's palsy and 26 with Ramsay Hunt syndrome treated with steroid plus antiviral agents.

Interventions

Multivariate analysis was used to identify which factors, including Yanagihara grading score and ENoG, predict better recovery. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for ENoG and grading score. The cumulative recovery rate by ENoG was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Recovery was defined as the improvement of grading score to 36 points or more (full score, 40) without synkinesis.

Results

Multivariate analysis revealed that Ramsay Hunt syndrome, the worst grading score and ENoG were the significant prognostic predictors. The area under the ROC curve for ENoG was broader than those for grading score, indicating that ENoG was superior to grading score in terms of accuracy for prognosis prediction. The ROC curve revealed that more than 85% degeneration on ENoG had the best specificity (77.8%) and sensitivity (71.4%) to predict nonrecovery. When ENoG was subjected to the analysis of cumulative recovery rate using Kaplan-Meier plots, patients with more than 85% degeneration on ENoG had significantly poorer prognosis.

Conclusion

ENoG was the most effective factor for prediction of the prognosis of peripheral facial palsy, and more than 85% degeneration had the best specificity and sensitivity to predict nonrecovery.

### Tolosa-hunt syndrome presenting with features of a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias and pituitary enlargement [^23ff1017]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is understood as a steroid-responsive, relapsing-remitting, unilateral headache disorder associated with ipsilateral cranial neuropathies, of a probable granulomatous aetiology. The diagnosis is made clinically from the history and examination, supported by appropriate imaging. Here the authors report a case of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome with a headache phenotype mimicking a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (hemicrania continua), and serial MRI studies showing a stable enlarged pituitary. Due to her initial lack of clinical signs, she was diagnosed with chronic migraine, revised to hemicrania continua based on indomethacin response, then revised back to chronic migraine. Her final diagnosis was achieved after she developed a left cavernous sinus syndrome 4 years into her disease course. This case shows that Tolosa-Hunt syndrome may present with a non-side-locked headache and delayed development of clinical signs. Clinicians should also maintain a high degree of suspicion when faced with incidental MRI findings.

### Herpes zoster vaccine safety in the aotearoa New Zealand population: a self-controlled case series study [^deddb343]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In Aotearoa New Zealand, zoster vaccine live is used for the prevention of zoster and associated complications in adults. This study assessed the risk of pre-specified serious adverse events following zoster vaccine live immunisation among adults in routine clinical practice. We conducted a self-controlled case series study using routinely collected national data. We compared the incidence of serious adverse events during the at-risk period with the control period. Rate ratios were estimated using Conditional Poisson regression models. Falsification outcomes analyses were used to evaluate biases in our study population. From April 2018 to July 2021, 278,375 received the vaccine. The rate ratio of serious adverse events following immunisation was 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37–0.50). There was no significant increase in the risk of cerebrovascular accidents, acute myocardial infarction, acute pericarditis, acute myocarditis, and Ramsay–Hunt Syndrome. The herpes zoster vaccine is safe in adults in Aotearoa New Zealand.

### Bilateral simultaneous facial nerve palsy: clinical analysis in seven cases [^dfcb2810]. Otology & Neurotology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze clinical manifestations and prognosis of bilateral simultaneous facial nerve palsy (BS-FNP).

Study Design

Retrospective case review with current follow-up wherever possible.

Setting

Tertiary referral centers.

Patients

Patients (n = 7; 4 women and 3 men; mean age, 37 yr; range, 18–58 yr) diagnosed with BS-FNP at the time of their first visit.

Intervention

Therapy with systemic corticosteroids and antiviral agents and outpatient follow-up for 1 month to 4 years after discharge.

Main Outcome Measure

Assessment of recovery from FNP using the House-Brackmann grading system.

Results

The occurrence rate of BS-FNP of total FNP cases for the past 10 years was 0.4%. All patients showed palsy more severe than House-Brackmann Grade IV and similar grades of FNP bilaterally. Patients complained of the involvement of the other side within 1 to 6 days of the involvement of 1 side (mean period, 3.4 d). Bell's palsy was the most common cause (5 of 7; 71.4%), the other 2 being infectious mononucleosis and Ramsay Hunt syndrome zoster sine herpete (1 of 7; 14.3% each). Although most patients recovered completely within 1 to 6 months, 1 with a positive Varicella zoster virus immunoglobulin M titer showed bilateral House-Brackmann Grade II FNP after recovery. No recurrence was noted during the follow-up period.

Conclusion

Bell's palsy is the most common cause of BS-FNP in authors' centers. Although BS-FNP may show more severe paralysis, the overall prognosis in most cases is as good as that in unilateral FNP, excluding life-threatening or traumatic cases. Differential diagnosis is very important because the treatment outcome of BS-FNP depends on the cause.

### Melkersson-rosenthal syndrome: recurrent facial swelling and food refusal [^d96c29a9]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis of MRS is extensive, including other causes of facial palsy; idiopathic, congenital (eg, Moebius syndrome, hemifacial microsomia), infection (eg, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, otitis media, mycobacterial infections), autoimmune (eg, Guillain-Barré), neoplastic, iatrogenic; as well as causes of orofacial oedema (angioedema, allergy, atopy, infections, rheumatological). Investigations should be targeted to exclude differential diagnoses and may include otorhinolaryngological evaluation, neuroimaging and histological examination. In the absence of the characteristic triad, the presence of two of the classical features is sufficient to make a diagnosis once other possible differentials have been excluded. In its monosymptomatic form, a mucocutaneous biopsy identifying a non-caseating granuloma is diagnostic.

Differential diagnosis for an antalgic gait in the paediatric population is broad and includes transient synovitis, myositis, bacterial infections (septic arthritis, osteomyelitis), oncological causes, trauma including non-accidental injury and referred pain. In this case, the antalgic gait resolved during the initial overnight admission and did not recur. An aetiological diagnosis was not achieved.

In the case discussed, the presence of the pathognomonic triad of features (recurrent facial palsy with orofacial swelling and a fissured tongue) led to a diagnosis of MRS on the fourth presentation.

### Incidence and risk factors for varicella-zoster virus-associated central nervous system infections: a nationwide Swedish retrospective case-control study [^a311f902]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Varicella‐zoster virus (VZV) is one of the most common causes of viral central nervous system (CNS) infection. After a primary infection causing varicella, the virus establishes latency in neurons and reactivates most commonly as herpes zoster. Rarely, VZV reactivates to cause CNS infection, including encephalitis, vasculitis, meningitis, and peripheral facial palsy (Ramsay Hunt syndrome [RHS]), potentially leading to significant morbidity or mortality in affected individuals. The overall incidence of herpes zoster is estimated to be between 3 and 5 per 1000 person‐years. It has increased over the past decades in several countries, independent of changes in age and immunosuppression. Similarly, the incidence of VZV‐associated CNS infection has reportedly also increased over time. However, the calculated incidence rates for VZV‐associated CNS infection are mostly based on small studies with varying results.

Risk factors for herpes zoster are well‐known and include older age, immunosuppression due to disease or treatment, and chronic diseases. By contrast, the risk factors for VZV‐associated CNS infection have been insufficiently studied. Nonetheless, there are indications of the important role of innate and T‐cell immunity, as indicated by severe VZV‐associated CNS infections in certain specific immunodeficiencies. Furthermore, patients with hematological cancer experience more zoster episodes as well as a higher proportion of CNS‐related zoster complications, as compared with patients with solid cancer. Omland et al. demonstrated that risk factors of VZV‐associated CNS infection included comorbidities and immunosuppressive conditions, but they did not investigate the contribution of different diagnoses or medications in detail. Here, regional and nationwide registers were used to estimate the adult incidence of different manifestations of VZV‐associated CNS infection between 2010 and 2019. In addition, cases with VZV‐associated CNS infection were compared to matched controls without a VZV diagnosis during the study period to identify specific risk factors with a focus on immunosuppressive conditions and comorbidities.

### A new gene for autosomal dominant facial palsy / migraine identified in a family by whole exome sequencing [^6d0c27d8]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Facial palsy is a relatively common disorder with heterogeneous aetiologies, manifesting as unilateral or bilateral weakness or inability to move the facial muscles, which can occur suddenly or gradually and can be temporary or permanent. In the acute phase, it can cause very marked changes in facial features and problems in speaking, eating or communicating through natural facial expressions.

Recurrent facial palsy may be idiopathic (70%) or caused by infections (4.5%–7%), brain tumours (2.2%–5%), trauma (such as temporal bone fractures) or it can be associated with chronic neurological diseases or be part of syndromic cases.

The most common form of facial palsy is the idiopathic form, called Bell's palsy, which usually affects only one side of the face and is caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. Virus or bacterial infection is the second most common ethology of palsy like Ramsay Hunt syndrome associated with a varicella zoster infection or Lyme disease associated with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. A progressive onset of facial palsy should raise suspicion of malignancy; acoustic or facial nerve neurinoma, meningioma, parotid tumours and schwannoma should be considered.

Facial palsy has also been associated with other medical conditions such as vascular diseases, immunogenic factors, coeliac disease and neurological disorders like Melkersson−Rosenthal syndrome, Moebius syndrome and hereditary neuropathies.

In recent years, migraine has also been associated with facial palsy. Migraine is a neurovascular disorder characterized by mild to severe intensity headaches associated or not with aura. Auras are reversible neurological symptoms, occurring before or during a migraine episode, most frequently visual, but can involve other senses. In migraine, an increased risk of idiopathic facial palsy (often unilateral) has been observed, and also neuro‐ophthalmological symptoms including conjunctival injection, lacrimation and diplopia have been reported.

Overall, the aetiology of facial palsy is unclear, but previous reports support that genetic predisposition may play an important role. So far, in the literature about 40 familial cases of facial palsy have been described, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance with low penetrance.

### The clinical features and outcomes of tolosa-hunt syndrome [^4a3b2c30]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) is an uncommon idiopathic granulomatous inflammatory disease of the cavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure, or orbit associated with ocular pain and ophthalmoplegia. However, the etiology of THS is still unknown. Thus, the diagnosis of THS should exclude other causes of painful ophthalmoplegia such as tumors, vasculitis, meningitis, sarcoidosis, diabetic ophthalmoplegia, and pseudotumor. THS is described in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD 3-beta) diagnostic criteria as unilateral orbital pain associated with paresis of one or more of the third, fourth, and/or sixth cranial nerves caused by a granulomatous inflammation in the cavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure or orbit (Table 1). In clinical practice, the disorder is diagnosed based on the above diagnostic criteria and treatment with corticosteroids is generally recommended. There are relatively few reports on the clinical course of THS, so the objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of THS.

### Ocular and palpebral manifestations of facial palsy: an epidemiologic descriptive study [^6b7ca28c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The facial nerve (CN VII) contains multiple fiber types, such as motor, sensory and parasympathetic fibers and their corresponding nuclei. Facial Palsy (FP) has a myriad of etiologies, from the use of forceps during complicated vaginal delivery to neoplastic lesions, but the most common culprit is Bell's Palsy, which is thought to have its origin in a reactivation of viral replication by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) in the nerve's cranial ganglia. Other important etiologies include Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, Lyme's disease, ear infections, iatrogenic, tumoral, congenital, granulomatous and traumatic conditions, and many more. Depending on the degree of nerve damage, the end result can range from a complete and persistent FP to a complete recovery in function. Its incidence can vary from 11 to 40 cases per 100,000 people annually.

Diagnosis of this ailment is mainly clinical, with an acute onset, a duration of hours or days, and is generally accompanied by retroauricular pain. In peripheral FP, a total laxity of the hemiface is observed, with absent expression and a downward deviation of the ipsilateral mouth. The severity of FP is graded with the House-Brackmann clinical scale, although the Sunnybrook scale has gained more popularity internationally due to a more comprehensive scoring system. Inferior palpebral laxity and, ultimately, lagophthalmos can cause a variety of ocular surface damage, such as conjunctival irritation, corneal dryness and erosions, and even ulceration and/or perforation of the cornea. Bell's phenomenon should be assessed to determine whether it is present or absent, since it represents a protective factor. It is also important to assess Meibomian gland dysfunction, since a growing body of evidence demonstrates structural alterations in these glands, which ultimately lead to tear film instability.

### Tolosa-hunt syndrome relapse during pregnancy following chronic intake of combined oral contraceptives [^5ec6b2b6]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

BACKGROUND

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) is a rare condition characterised by painful ophthalmoplegia attributed to an idiopathic granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure or orbit. It has an estimated incidence of nearly one to two cases per million per year and is ultimately a diagnosis of exclusion. While its aetiology remains unknown, few reports in the literature have documented its dysimmune pathogenesis influenced by pregnancy and pregnancy-related hormones.

### Complete ophthalmoplegia diagnosed as tolosa-hunt syndrome on interval MRI [^ff1101e6]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare cause of painful ophthalmoplegia, most commonly presenting with retro-orbital pain and eye motor nerve palsy, most often affecting a single eye. The condition is characterised by an idiopathic process causing granulomatous inflammation to the cavernous sinus affecting, one or multiple cranial nerves that pass therein. The mechanism underlying the inflammation is not well understood, but patients have been observed to respond to steroids during a flare. We present this as a unique case where a multidisciplinary team diagnosed Tolosa-Hunt syndrome despite non-specific MRI findings in the cavernous sinus 1day following an initially normal MRI.

### Incidence of acute complications of herpes zoster among immunocompetent adults in england: a matched cohort study using routine health data [^4440628f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

The cohort included 178 964 patients with zoster (115 790 from GOLD and 63 174 from Aurum) and 1 799 380 sex‐, age‐ and practice‐matched unexposed patients. Almost 60% of the final cohort were female and the median age at cohort entry was 62 years (Table 2). Patients with zoster had a higher prevalence of medical conditions including depression (3.1% vs. 2.7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.9% vs. 3.6%) and chronic kidney disease (7.7% vs. 6.0%) (Table 2). Characteristics of the patients in GOLD and Aurum were similar in terms of age, socioeconomic status and comorbidities (Table S1; see Supporting Information). The mean follow‐up time was 88 days (SD 9 days) in the exposed and in the unexposed.

Table 2
Baseline characteristics of patients with zoster and matched patients without zoster in Clinical Practice Research Datalink (n = 1 978 344) and by individual database

Table 3 shows the percentage of patients with zoster with zoster‐attributable complications in the 3 months following diagnosis, overall and by risk group. In total, 0.48% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44–0.51] of patients with zoster developed neurological complications, 1.33% (95% CI 1.28–1.39) ocular complications, 0.29% (95% CI 0.26–0.32) cutaneous complications and 0.78% (95% CI 0.73–0.84) visceral complications, attributable to zoster. Regarding the zoster‐specific complications, 0.37% of patients with zoster developed Ramsay Hunt syndrome, 0.01% developed disseminated zoster, 0.04% died of zoster and 0.97% were hospitalized. A higher proportion of older patients with zoster (≥ 50 years) developed each primary outcome, compared with younger patients (< 50 years), aside from Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

### Incidence of acute complications of herpes zoster among immunocompetent adults in england: a matched cohort study using routine health data [^ac175eb9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Variables

The primary exposure, zoster, was identified in CPRD data and in HES data (all codes listed in Appendix S1; see Supporting Information). If zoster was identified in both HES and CPRD, the earliest recorded zoster diagnosis was used. Hospitalizations were considered related to zoster if the zoster diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field of any hospitalization. A secondary exposure, primary care prescription of antivirals within 7 days of zoster diagnosis (given for the treatment of acute zoster), was identified in CPRD.

Outcomes

We searched for complications in CPRD GOLD and Aurum, as well as linked HES data (first diagnostic field of any episode). Detailed definitions of each outcome are provided in Appendix S1 (see Supporting Information). There were five primary outcome groups (Table 1): (i) acute neurological complications (not including PHN or Ramsay Hunt syndrome); (ii) cutaneous complications (not including disseminated zoster); (iii) visceral or systemic complications; (iv) ocular complications (not including cranial nerve palsies as these were included within neurological complications) and (v) zoster‐specific outcomes. Secondary outcomes were specific types of complications, which collectively comprise the primary outcomes (Table 1). We searched for these outcomes from the day of zoster diagnosis up to 1 year after zoster. Complications were selected based on the existing literature and biological plausibility.

Table 1
Zoster complications: the five primary outcomes and the specific conditions comprising each outcome

Covariates

Comorbidities included all long‐term health conditions that have been associated with increased risk of zoster and/or PHN, including liver disease, asthma, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, diabetes and autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus or inflammatory bowel disease).

Other covariates included age (< 50 and ≥ 50 years), sex (male and female), ethnicity (white and not white, from CPRD and HES data), other health and lifestyle factors (body mass index and smoking status) and finally socioeconomic status (quintiles of the 2015 IMD, using patient IMD and, if missing, practice IMD).

### Factors that influence tolosa-hunt syndrome and the short-term response to steroid pulse treatment [^f64afe9c]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Some but not all patients with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) have dramatic responses to steroid treatment. A systematic study about the factors that may influence the steroid response of THS patients has not been published. We retrospectively identified 40 patients diagnosed with THS and treated with steroids with respect to patient age at onset, gender, the cranial nerve(s) involved, as well as imaging findings and laboratory tests. Within the context of these data we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of steroid treatment and recurrence of attacks. We did not note a significant relationship between genders, whether THS was benign or inflammatory, the distribution of cranial nerve palsies, the initial dose of steroids and the effectiveness of steroid treatment for relief of orbital pain or cranial nerve palsies at 72 h or 1 week after treatment. Our study reveals that a rapid alleviation of pain by steroid treatment is a characteristic feature of THS patients. The alleviation of cranial nerve palsy is somewhat slower and more variable, and may involve additional mechanisms. There is an effect of patient age and whether attacks will recur (recurrence was more likely in patients who were young at the time of first attack), whether THS will be benign or inflammatory (more likely to be inflammatory in young patients) and the short-term response of cranial nerve palsy to steroid treatment, which was more effective in young patients. These relationships may be of value in counseling patients presenting with THS.

### Tolosa-hunt syndrome masquerading as a carotid artery dissection [^94e2be92]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Painful ophthalmoplegia (PO) is a common presentation of a dissection of the internal carotid artery (ICA), and is believed to be caused by a disruption of blood flow to the vascular supply of the inferolateral trunk. It can be associated with headaches or facial pain, and may involve other cranial nerves.–The differential diagnosis for PO includes aneurysms, thrombosis, parasellar lesions, tumors, orbital pseudotumor, sarcoidosis, infection, head and neck trauma, and hypertensive or diabetic microvascular infarction. The clinical presentation is also similar to Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS), which is a disease that results from a cryptogenic granulomatous lesion within the cavernous sinus/superior oblique fissure of the orbit. It produces PO with ipsilateral periorbital or hemicranial pain.–The myriad of presentations and rarity of this condition continues to make THS an elusive diagnosis.

### Treatment outcomes in patients with conjunctival mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma [^bca4153f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rituximab is known to have systemic adverse effects, including pancytopenia, infection, cardiac disease, and decreased blood pressure. However, Annibali et al reported that, among seven eyes in six patients with OAML, one patient had varicella zoster virus reactivation (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) and herpetic keratitis, while Tuncer et al reported no systemic or ocular adverse events. Regarding chemotherapy, Song et al reported systemic adverse events such as neutropenia, anemia, elevated alanine aminotransferase, and paresthesia in patients with ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma treated with CVP. In our study, fever and general malaise were noted as systemic adverse events after rituximab monotherapy (Case 15), while Case 12, who was treated with rituximab and CHOP+CVP, had numbness of the hands and fingers, abdominal pain, and pancytopenia. All adverse events in the current study were systemic, and no ocular adverse events occurred.

This study was limited by the small number of patients. Further studies with larger numbers of patients are therefore needed to verify the results.

### Lymphoma of the orbit masquerading as tolosa-hunt syndrome [^f2255560]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by painful ophthalmoplegia and ipsilateral cranial neuropathies. It is caused by an idiopathic granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus or orbital apex complex that is exquisitely responsive to parentral glucocorticoids. The estimated annual incidence is one case per million per year in the US. This rare clinical entity was first described in 1954 as a syndrome comprised of two features: (a) pain in the first division of the trigeminal nerve; and (b) progressive paralysis, partial or total, of the oculomotor nerve and occasionally of the fourth, sixth, and the fifth cranial nerves. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and must be carefully differentiated from life threatening diagnoses, a mandate challenged by the lack of a specific diagnostic test to identify this disorder.

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is caused by an inflammatory process of unknown etiology. The inflammation leads to compression and secondary dysfunction of the structures within the cavernous sinus, including cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, as well as the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve resulting in clinical symptoms.

### Lymphoma of the orbit masquerading as tolosa-hunt syndrome [^1aaf414c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

A high index of suspicion is indicated to exclude neoplasia and any lymphoproliferative disorder in high risk patients with evolving multiple cranial neuropathies. New or evolving findings on successive clinical exams, particularly after treatment with parenteral steroids, should prompt neuroimaging and extensive diagnostic testing to exclude malignancy or a space-occupying lesion mimicking THS. Tolosa-Hunt should remain a diagnosis of exclusion.

### Incidence of acute complications of herpes zoster among immunocompetent adults in england: a matched cohort study using routine health data [^30daaa88]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Zoster diagnoses in UK primary and secondary care are based on clinical judgement, without laboratory confirmation, and have not been validated in CPRD or HES. However, a validation study of zoster in a primary care setting in the Netherlands demonstrated a high positive predictive value of zoster diagnosis of 91%, when confirmed by the presence of varicella zoster virus antibodies.

There might be differential misclassification of antiviral receipt with respect to zoster severity, for example if more severe cases of zoster are treated within secondary care. Prescription data in secondary care were not available, and although we removed patients with a zoster‐related hospitalization within 7 days of zoster diagnosis, misclassification of antiviral status may lead to those 'not given' antivirals representing more severe cases receiving treatment in hospital. There was strong evidence that patients given antivirals were less likely to have a hospitalization for zoster and Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which may reflect this misclassification.

There may be misclassification of some zoster complications. We included nonspecific zoster complication codes (such as encephalitis), potentially overestimating zoster‐attributable complications. However, by comparing with a cohort without zoster we were able to account for the baseline rate of each complication in the general population. Alternatively, we may have underestimated zoster complications. A US study comparing zoster complication rates among 1959 patients with zoster obtained from administrative data and supplemented by medical record review found that administrative data alone significantly underestimated complication rates (0.6% vs. 6.4%), for all complications besides PHN and ophthalmic zoster. However, only zoster‐specific codes were used to identify complications (specifically ICD‐9 codes beginning O.53); our study has supplemented specific zoster codes with nonspecific zoster codes, and therefore we have made some progress in improving the estimates of our outcomes.

### The clinical features and outcomes of tolosa-hunt syndrome [^b2b9f60b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical features and outcomes of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS).

Methods

A retrospective review of the medical records was performed on patients with THS between March 2016 and January 2020. A total of eleven patients fulfilling the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3 beta) diagnostic criteria for THS were included in this study.

Results

The average age of the patients with THS was 57.18 ± 15.32 years and the mean duration of recovery was 26.91 ± 24.35 days. All eleven patients had orbital or periorbital pain as the first symptom followed by diplopia. Ptosis was found in five patients (45.45%) in the involved eye. Sixth cranial nerve (CN) palsy was most common (eight cases, 72.73%), followed by third and fourth CN palsy (five cases, 45.45%, respectively), optic neuritis (two cases, 18.18%), and trigeminal nerve and facial nerve palsy (one case, 9.09%, respectively). One patient with optic neuritis failed to recover visual acuity and the other ten patients completely recovered their ocular motor limitation. All patients were initially treated with steroids. One patient relapsed after five weeks and one patient had a history of THS five years earlier.

Conclusions

THS responded well to steroid treatment, but if it was accompanied by optic neuritis as optic nerve involvement, we suggest follow-up with high dose steroid treatment especially was important.

Table 4 shows the burden and association with zoster for each primary outcome among all adults in CPRD GOLD or Aurum, overall and by age group. The relative risk of each primary outcome was elevated among all patients with zoster, compared with patients without zoster. The overall relative risk was largest for neurological complications (HR 3.63, 95% CI 3.35–3.94), then ocular (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.92–2.07), cutaneous (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.52–1.77) and visceral complications (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.25–1.35). There was strong evidence that the risks varied by age at zoster diagnosis (P ‐value for interaction < 0.001); the magnitude of the relative risks were greater in younger patients (< 50 years) than in older patients. Table S2 (see Supporting Information) shows the burden and association between zoster and individual conditions making up the composite primary outcomes. Encephalitis, meningitis and nerve palsies had the strongest associations of the neurological conditions (all HRs > 8), and orbital myositis, iritis and keratitis had strongest associations of the ocular complications (all HRs > 8).

Table 5 shows the association between antiviral use and each primary outcome among cases of zoster; 3164 (1.8%) patients were dropped from analysis as they might have received antivirals in hospital. There was good evidence that patients prescribed antivirals in primary care were at reduced risk of certain complications, specifically Ramsay Hunt syndrome (adjusted HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.45–0.62), zoster hospitalization (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50–0.78) and neurological complications (adjusted HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.53–0.70), compared with patients with zoster not prescribed antivirals.

### Patients' perspectives of ophthalmic management of facial nerve paralysis [^95409f80]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Results

Demographics

49 participants completed the survey (17 males, 32 females; mean age 55 years, SD 14.94). Mean duration FNP: 8 years, 5 months (range 12 months to 47 years). Bell's palsy most common cause of FNP, accidental trauma least common. Mean duration of FNP: 8 years 5 months. The longest duration of FNP was herpes zoster oticus/Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Accidental trauma, iatrogenic injury and Bell's palsy had shorter durations of FNP. 26 participants had eye-related surgery including gold or platinum weights, lower eyelid sling, brow lift, tarsorrhaphy and canthoplasty. Participants with iatrogenic surgical trauma had most eye-related surgery (n = 13) and herpes zoster oticus/Ramsay Hunt syndrome the least (n = 1) (table 1).

Table 1
Participant aetiology and demographics

Conservative interventions

40 participants used conservative eye-protective interventions for more than 4 weeks, especially following Bell's palsy (n = 14) (table 1). Artificial tears were the most commonly used intervention by participants with all causes of FNP. Artificial tears, lubricating ointment and tape to shut the eye were used by participants of all aetiologies. Those with Bell's palsy used tape to shut the eye more frequently than lubricating ointment, while those with iatrogenic surgical causes of FNP used lubricating ointment more frequently than tape to shut the eye. Participants with iatrogenic causes of FNP were the only subgroup to use all eye-protective interventions, and the only subgroup to use moisture chambers and scleral contact lenses (table 2).

### Tolosa-hunt syndrome: an arcane pathology of cavernous venous sinus [^4aa42651]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, an idiopathic granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus, is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion. The majority of patients present with unilateral orbital pain and features suggestive of paralysis of one or more of the cranial nerves passing through the cavernous sinus and/or superior orbital fissure. MRI of the head may show unilateral enhancement of the cavernous sinus and orbital apex. Treatment is with high-dose intravenous steroids followed by tapering oral steroids. Rapid amelioration of pain within 24-48h supports this rare diagnosis. Resolution of neuropathies may take longer. We describe a case of a young man who presented with left periorbital pain, complete ophthalmoplaegia and ptosis of the left eye. MRI showed enhancement of the left cavernous sinus and orbital apex. High dose steroids led to complete resolution of pain, while ptosis and ophthalmoplaegia improved gradually.

### A case review of the MRI features in alternating tolosa-hunt syndrome [^022506bb]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) consists of a painful ophthalmoplegia with typical features in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The recurring nature of this affliction has been known since its first description. However, compromise of the contralateral cavernous sinus, known as alternating THS, is very rare and has never been examined using MRI. We report clinical data, laboratory data and imaging features of a patient with alternating THS. According to our literature review, this is the first MRI study of THS.

### For whom the Bell's toll: recurrent facial nerve paralysis, A retrospective study and systematic review of the literature [^7cffef0b]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To examine the etiology, clinical course, and management of recurrent peripheral facial nerve paralysis.

Methods

Retrospective review at a single tertiary academic center and systematic review of the literature. Clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment and outcome for all cases of recurrent ipsilateral, recurrent contralateral, and bilateral simultaneous cases of facial paralysis are reviewed.

Results

Between 2000 and 2017, 53 patients [41.5% men, 29 median age of onset (range 2.5 wk-75 yr)] were evaluated for recurrent facial nerve paralysis at the authors' institution. Twenty-two (41.5%) cases presented with ipsilateral recurrences only, while the remaining 31 patients (58.5%) had at least 1 episode of contralateral recurrent paralysis. No cases of bilateral simultaneous facial nerve paralysis were observed. The median number of paretic events for all patients was 3 (range 2–20). The median nadir House-Brackmann score was 4, with a median recovery to House-Brackmann grade 1.5 over a mean recovery time of 61.8 days (range 1–420 d). Diagnostic evaluation confirmed Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome in four (7.5%) cases, neurosarcoidosis in two (3.7%), traumatic neuroma in one (1.9%), Ramsay Hunt syndrome in one (1.9%), granulomatosis with polyangiitis in one (1.9%), and neoplastic causes in three (5.7%) cases [facial nerve schwannoma (n = 2; 3.7%), metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the deep lobe of the parotid gland (n = 1; 1.9%)]; ultimately, 77.4% (41) of cases were deemed idiopathic. Facial nerve decompression via a middle cranial fossa approach was performed in three (5.7%) cases without subsequent episodes of paralysis.

Conclusion

Recurrent facial nerve paralysis is uncommon and few studies have evaluated this unique population. Recurrent ipsilateral and contralateral episodes are most commonly attributed to idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (i.e. Bell's palsy); however, a subset harbor neoplastic causes or local manifestations of underlying systemic disease. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is warranted in patients presenting with recurrent facial nerve paralysis and therapeutic considerations including facial nerve decompression can be considered in select cases.

### Incidence and risk factors for varicella-zoster virus-associated central nervous system infections: a nationwide Swedish retrospective case-control study [^6b6af0f9]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Incidence

The average incidence of VZV‐associated CNS infection was 1.92/100 000 person‐years in the adult population. For the different manifestations, the average incidences were 0.73/100 000 person‐years for encephalitis, 0.86/100 000 person‐years for meningitis, and 0.33/100 000 person‐years for RHS (Figure 1A). The yearly incidence rate of VZV‐associated CNS infection increased between 2010 and 2019 (p < 0.001). The highest incidence of VZV‐associated CNS infection was observed in individuals over 70 years of age, with 4.15 cases per 100 000 person‐years (Figure 1B). This increase consisted mostly of encephalitis cases, which accounted for 63% of the incidence in individuals ≥ 70 years, while meningitis accounted for 73% in the age group 18–29 years. RHS was more uncommon, accounting for approximately 17% of the total incidence of VZV‐associated CNS infection. Both encephalitis and RHS incidence increased with advancing age.

### Tolosa-hunt syndrome masquerading as a carotid artery dissection [^6588ca82]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To demonstrate the difficulties of diagnosing a patient with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) due to its complicated presentation and extensive diagnostic testing, and how to manage the treatment of a patient in an emergent setting.

Patients and methods

A female patient with THS affecting the left eye was examined using two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The patient was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol ®) and prednisone. A follow-up MRI and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) was also performed 4 months later.

Results

The second MRI scan disclosed a 5×9×10 mm lesion in the left superior orbital fissure/cavernous sinus. After administration of methylprednisolone and prednisone, the patient's pain completely resolved, and the left eye regained full duction and eyelid mobility. The MRI and MRA obtained after the treatment showed no abnormalities.

Conclusion

The rarity of THS makes it difficult to diagnose, especially when there is a question of accuracy and reproducibility of the testing performed. An ophthalmologic consultation in such cases is crucial.

### Steroid-responsive painful ophthalmoplegia: tolosa-hunt syndrome, eales disease, or both? [^5ec93b27]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) is one of the most common 'benign' causes of painful ophthalmoplegia. Diagnosis is based on clinical and imaging findings and the exclusion of other causes because there is no specific biomarker for the syndrome. Eales disease, an idiopathic inflammatory venous disease that primarily affects the eye, can also affect the central (as stroke or myelitis) and peripheral nervous system. Case report We report the case of a 32-year-old woman with a subacute left ophthalmoplegia and evidence of a gadolinium-enhanced lesion suggesting an inflammatory granuloma that resolved within 48 hours after treatment with steroids. A diagnosis of THS was considered at this time. On a follow-up ophthalmological examination, a diagnosis of Eales disease with involvement of the left eye was made. The patient was treated successfully. Conclusion Eales disease could be a cause of painful ophthalmoplegia and may mimic THS. Long-term follow-up of patients diagnosed with THS may be necessary to exclude other diagnoses.

### Tolosa-hunt syndrome masquerading as a carotid artery dissection [^93233c53]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

THS may be part of the same pathological process of idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease, confined to the cavernous sinus/superior orbital fissure. In this case report, the presence of an enlarged ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle and optic nerve edema with visual loss would support this etiology. We emphasize the fact that patients with this diagnosis should be followed carefully as neoplasms can have "false positive" responses to steroids, and a full understanding of this condition has not yet been obtained.

### Unusual clinical course in pediatric tolosa-hunt syndrome [^89cfcc8f]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

We report on a 7-year-old immunocompetent boy initially presenting with right-sided frontal cephalalgia, painful ophthalmoplegia, and ptosis for 1 month. Initial cerebrospinal fluid analysis produced normal results. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an inflammatory pseudotumor of the right cavernous sinus after intravenous gadolinium administration, indicating a rare idiopathic inflammatory disorder of the cavernous sinus, i.e. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. Ptosis and cephalalgia resolved after steroid treatment, although right-sided ophthalmoplegia remained. Breakthrough headache, associated with signs of meningeal irritation, developed 6 weeks later. Follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed no enhancing cavernous soft tissue mass. A further lumbar puncture disclosed central nervous system infection with Staphylococcus saprophyticus. After 6 weeks of vancomycin, the headache resolved completely, and neuroimaging produced normal results. A diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome should be rendered cautiously, because the etiology may involve a rare but not "idiopathic" infection. Moreover, if clinical signs are not fully responsive to steroid treatment, the underlying problems should receive careful investigation.

### Even low level of physical activity is associated with reduced mortality among people with metabolic syndrome, a population based study (the HUNT 2 study, Norway) [^3df2ac59]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

It has been shown that PA may improve the factors that constitute metabolic syndrome. Therefore, beneficial effects on weight, blood pressure, serum lipid levels and metabolism of carbohydrates may be important for the lower mortality associated with PA among people with metabolic syndrome. Also, improvement in cardiac function, especially in relation to the intensity of PA, is likely to play a role.

The question about leisure time PA in the HUNT 2 questionnaire did not distinguish between strength and aerobic exercise, and therefore we cannot attribute the observed effects to a particular type of exercise. People who report being inactive are likely to be inactive; however, PA in questionnaire-based data is typically overreported. In this study, misclassification caused by overreporting of PA would place some people into a higher PA category than their true activity level would indicate. The possible effect of this misclassification would most likely underestimate the effect of PA in this study.

The use of nonfasting glucose values in our study could have been a potential source of bias. Glucose level was used as a diagnostic criterion for metabolic syndrome only if the levels were elevated four hours postprandial. Thus, there was a potential risk of placing some people with metabolic syndrome into the category of people without metabolic syndrome. However, in a subanalysis, glucose was used as a criterion in all subjects regardless of the time since their most recent meal, and the results were essentially the same. Validation of the PA questionnaire in the HUNT 2 study showed that the "light activity" question was not adequately correlated with other measures of PA, whereas the reliability of hard PA and occupational activity was found to be satisfactory. The validation was conducted among 108 men ages 20 to 39 years, however, and therefore we cannot be certain that the results can be generalized to the rest of our study population. In this study, an attempt was made to classify self-reported PA so that it would correspond to the currently recommended guidelines for PA. However, the classification was not exact, and caution should be taken when interpreting these data. Also, some participants might have changed their PA levels after data collection, and these changes might also have influenced the results. However, such changes most likely would have underestimated the differences in mortality between the inactive group and the groups with different activity levels.

### Lymphoma of the orbit masquerading as tolosa-hunt syndrome [^09acf8a5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by painful ophthalmoplegia and ipsilateral cranial neuropathies. It is caused by an inflammatory process of unknown etiology.

Case presentation

We present a case of a 77-year-old white man with history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia transforming to large B-cell lymphoma who presented to a community physician complaining of 4 months of isolated right retro-orbital pain and later with diplopia, ptosis, 6th nerve and pupil-sparing partial 3rd nerve palsies as well as progressive neurological findings. His clinical course was complicated by debilitating neurological symptoms and multiple hospitalizations leading to a delay in diagnosis caused by incomplete initial workup.

Conclusion

This case is a reminder that lymphoproliferative disorders often mimic other neurologic disorders and that Tolosa-Hunt is a rare diagnosis that must be considered a diagnosis of exclusion.

### Tolosa-hunt syndrome masquerading as a carotid artery dissection [^9dcc8183]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

When evaluating a patient with PO, an expeditious systematic approach should be utilized to rule out any emergent etiologies. Vascular origins such as dissection of the ICA, aneurysm, and cavernous sinus thrombosis require immediate attention.CTA and MRI are the standard measures for diagnosing vascular causes of ophthalmoplegia. The sensitivity of a CTA ranges from 98% to 100% in detecting aneurysms less than 5 mm in diameter, and the sensitivity of MRI combined with MRA approaches 100% in detecting cerebral vein thrombosis. Furthermore, ophthalmoscopy can detect venous dilation and tortuosity in the setting of an occluded superior ophthalmic vein, as would occur with a carotid cavernous thrombosis. In the presence of normal imaging and laboratory studies, hypertensive microvascular infarction can be considered as the cause of PO, but hypertension alone has not been shown to cause paralysis of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cranial nerves simultaneously.–

One of the rare causes of PO is THS, which results from a granulomatous inflammation in the region of the superior orbital fissure/cavernous sinus.–In the past it has been a condition of exclusion. We describe a hypertensive patient who presented with PO, with a mild narrowing of the intracavernous portion of the ICA, and normal laboratory test results. Stenosis of the ICA was found by CTA, which is commonly observed with THS, but the diagnosis could not be validated with a negative MRI. A repeat MRI very clearly showed a lesion in the superior oblique fissure, indicating THS. The lesion was not present on the initial MRI, which can be explained by disease evolution or volume averaging (slice thickness). No one specific study has addressed this complexity, and some have suggested to proceed with treatment and to determine whether or not the patient has THS based on their response to steroids. The clinical and imaging response to high-dose steroids has been considered to be one of the principal criteria of diagnosing THS. Infectious causes of this or any other syndrome are exacerbated by using high-dose steroids, and microvascular causes may exhibit worsening. Neoplasms may initially respond to steroids, which would provide a false sense of security. Thus, treatment with high-dose steroids may be an issue of controversy. We would recommend a repeat MRI study when serologic and CSF studies are normal and the clinical suspicion for THS remains.

### The clinical features and outcomes of tolosa-hunt syndrome [^33f8cd43]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective study of eleven cases of THS based on ICHD-3 beta criteria showed that the clinical manifestations were variable. The sixth CN (72.73%) was most commonly involved, followed by the third (45.45%), and fourth CN (45.45%). Previous studies reported a high rate of third CN (78–91%) involvement, however, Curone et al. reported a low rate of third CN (39%) involvement. As such, CN involvement has been variably reported in each study. THS is usually treated with steroid, but there are no rules regarding drugs, formulations, routes of administration, or therapeutic doses. Steroid treatment generally includes prednisone, MPD, and dexamethasone given orally or by IV injection. In this study, five patients were treated with IV MPD at 1 g/day for three days, and six patients received oral MPD at 50 mg/day for seven days, then the dosage was tapered. The difference in treatment dose was determined in consideration of the patient's age, the severity of their symptoms, and underlying diseases. After the initiation of MPD treatment, pain resolved within two days in all patients, and ocular motor limitation gradually improved. Other studies reported that most patients achieved pain relief within 72 hours and that CN palsy resolved over two to eight weeks. In the patients in this study, the recovery period varied from one to eight weeks, similar to the previous report. Steroid treatment relieves the pain quickly, but the signs do not resolve immediately after treatment. As in this study and previous studies, because steroid administration had dramatic effects, when THS is diagnosed, it is important to start steroid therapy immediately. An accurate diagnosis is important for quick and appropriate treatment, but many diseases must be considered in the differential diagnosis of painful ophthalmoplegia. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring various examination and careful evaluation to rule out tumors, vascular causes, or other forms of inflammation in the lesion of the cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure (Table 4). The role of MRI in the criteria has been included as "granulomatous inflammation demonstrated by MRI or biopsy" in the ICHD-3 beta criteria. In most studies and our study, no patient had a biopsy or pathological examination. Also, the location of lesion is an important factor in the differential diagnosis, especially an orbital pseudotumor with characteristics and steroid response similar to THS. Therefore, MRI plays a key role in the diagnosis of THS. Since THS can be diagnosed by anatomical location, MRI should be performed if THS is suspected in a case of painful ophthalmoplegia. The recurrence rate in our study (18.18%) was similar to that of Rui et al. (23%) and Colnaghi et al. (21%) but was lower than that reported by Zhang et al. (37%). Two patients in this study experienced recurrences, one recurred after five weeks and the other had a history of THS diagnosis five years earlier. THS patients have a good prognosis but recurrences occur in about 21–50% of the cases over an interval of months to years. Thus, it is important to consider follow-up and the possibility of a recurrence after a full recovery. In this study, the laboratory test results showed elevated ESR values in three patients, which were the patients with all third, fourth, and sixth CN involvement. However, no patients with non-elevated ESR had paralysis of all third, fourth, and sixth CNs. In patients with elevated ESR, one patient did not recover from visual impairment, and the other two showed complete recovery, but the recovery period of the three patients was about 2 months, which was longer than the average recovery period of all patients. The longer recovery period can be considered in association with the clinical findings that there are many involved CN palsy, and the ESR values could be considered as a factor predicting the severity of the disease and the recovery period. However, it is expected that further studies of the blood test results in more patients will be needed in the future. Meanwhile, ON dysfunction has been reported, indicating that the pathological process may involve the orbital apex. Two patients in this study had optic neuritis as ON involvement and enhanced apex lesions were confirmed by orbit MRI. One patient had fourth CN palsy and optic neuritis and recovered completely after steroid treatment. In contrast, in other patients with third, fourth, and sixth CN palsy, relapsed five weeks later with retrobulbar optic neuritis and third, fourth, and sixth CN palsy. After high-dose steroid treatment, the ocular motor limitation was completely recovered, but the vision loss (recognition of hand motion) did not improve and a pale optic disc was observed at follow-up. Kline and Hoyt reported that the optic disc may be normal, swollen, or pale in appearance, with visual decline ranging from minimal to blindness, and variable final visual acuity. In the two cases in this study, the opposite results were found. In one case, the visual acuity was completely recovered and in the other case, it was not recovered despite the same treatment. In patients whose vision did not recover, oral MPD at 50 mg/day was prescribed at the initial examination because of old age and uncontrolled diabetic history. At recurrence of THS with optic neuritis, 1 g of MPD was administered, but the loss of vision did not recover. It is thought that the damaged ON axons could not be recovered due to persistent granulomatous inflammation. We suggest that initial IV MPD at 1 g/day might have a better prognosis considering the elevated ESR and extended inflammation of cavernous sinus and orbital apex. Although optic neuritis as ON involvement is not common in THS, the occurrence of ON dysfunction should be confirmed through a visual acuity examination during the follow-up period and immediate high dose steroid treatment should be initiated. In addition, even if the ocular motor limitation have improved, it is necessary to check for recurrence or ON function through sufficient follow-up. Our study had several limitations. First, it was a retrospective, single-hospital-based study, suggesting possible selection bias. Second, the sample size was small due to the relatively uncommon occurrence of the disease. Third, the follow-up intervals were not standardized and were not long-term. Nevertheless, this study showed the strength of analyzing eleven cases and reporting various THS clinical symptoms. In conclusion, considering that THS may cause optic neuritis as ON involvement, immediate high dose steroid treatment should be performed at the time of diagnosis. In addition, since there is a possibility of recurrence, long-term follow-up is necessary.
