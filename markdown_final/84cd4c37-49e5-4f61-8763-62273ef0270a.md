## Question

Is mupirocin active against Staphylococcus aureus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether mupirocin is active against Staphylococcus aureus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism of action and whether it plausibly covers S. aureus. Then, I should verify the in vitro and in vivo spectrum, including MRSA. Next, I will review clinical efficacy data for skin infections and for nasal decolonization and prevention strategies. After that, I need to assess resistance mechanisms and prevalence. I will then consider pharmacologic and site-specific factors that influence real-world activity. I should confirm labeled indications, dosing, and key safety points. Finally, I will synthesize a focused conclusion and recommendation with caveats about resistance and appropriate use [^115dtGUL] [^116yDAXB] [^114XWAh4] [^111h1fVi] [^114ect3m] [^113Qas9N].

> Let me first confirm the mechanism of action, because that sets expectations for activity against S. aureus. Mupirocin specifically and reversibly inhibits bacterial isoleucyl–tRNA synthetase, interrupting protein synthesis with no cross-resistance to other antibiotic classes, and at concentrations achieved with topical use it is bactericidal rather than merely bacteriostatic, which I should explicitly verify in the label before proceeding [^115dtGUL] [^113brbdA].

> Wait, let me verify spectrum rather than assume it from mechanism. The FDA labeling confirms activity against susceptible S. aureus in vitro and in clinical studies, including many methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, and also notes activity against S. epidermidis in vitro, with no cross-resistance due to the unique target [^115dtGUL].

> Hold on, I should anchor this to clinical endpoints in skin infections. For impetigo, mupirocin ointment showed superior clinical efficacy and high pathogen eradication in randomized trials compared with placebo and comparable or better outcomes than oral erythromycin, and the product is indicated for impetigo due to susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, which directly supports real-world anti–staphylococcal activity on skin [^111h1fVi] [^116yDAXB].

> Next, I should review data for nasal decolonization and prevention, since decolonization efficacy is a practical measure of activity against S. aureus in vivo. In NICU infants, randomized and multicenter trials show very high primary decolonization rates with intranasal/topical mupirocin, with signals toward fewer invasive infections, and in long-term care residents, double-blind randomized data show rapid eradication with sustained decolonization in a substantial proportion at 90 days, supporting potent anti–staphylococcal activity in the nares [^114ect3m] [^114Lj83t] [^113Qas9N].

> I will now examine broader implementation outcomes, but I need to be careful to tie them back to activity rather than policy. During ICU and NICU programs, adding intranasal mupirocin to infection prevention reduced MRSA healthcare-associated infections and transmission, and in the CLEAR trial, regimens including nasal mupirocin reduced colonization across multiple body sites after discharge, which indirectly corroborates practical effectiveness against S. aureus carriage [^112oEPDw] [^1141a5q5].

> Let me consider perioperative use where prevention depends on activity against nasal S. aureus. The AAOS guideline endorses considering preoperative nasal mupirocin decolonization for MRSA carriers before arthroplasty as a reasonable low-risk option, and systematic reviews suggest benefit in selected non-general surgical populations, although effects vary by procedure and implementation strategy, so I should not overgeneralize beyond carriers and targeted contexts [^116qJv5Q] [^113iPQc9] [^113tSRzo].

> Hold on, I should verify resistance mechanisms and how they might limit activity. High-level resistance is usually plasmid-mediated via mupA encoding an alternate IleRS with low affinity for mupirocin and is linked to decolonization failure, whereas low-level resistance arises from mutations in the native ileS, with structural work clarifying how IleRS variants reduce binding, and surveillance shows variable prevalence with higher rates where use is intensive, emphasizing the need for stewardship and local susceptibility awareness [^115dtGUL] [^112pBGpg] [^115DkWQV] [^112xUTjP] [^112gN2jN] [^112AagHB].

> But wait, pharmacology at the site of use can modulate apparent activity, so I should double-check those factors. Mupirocin is highly protein bound, and the effect of wound or nasal secretions on MICs is not fully defined, plus intranasal administration may create low drug levels in the pharynx that could select for resistance in colonized sites, so technique, coverage of colonized niches, and course completion matter for preserving efficacy [^115dtGUL] [^113brbdA] [^116ai874].

> I need to ensure dosing guidance is correct, since misuse can masquerade as lack of activity. For decolonization, the labeled intranasal regimen is 2% ointment applied to each nostril twice daily for 5 days, and for skin infections, apply a small amount of ointment or cream to affected areas typically three times daily for up to 10 days, avoiding intranasal or ophthalmic use of the topical formulations not intended for mucosa and reassessing if no response in 3 to 5 days [^115PyR89] [^115GNJnw] [^116o4usB] [^1138y4ng].

> Next, I should review key safety and limitations, because activity must be balanced with appropriate use. Hypersensitivity to mupirocin or excipients is a contraindication, common adverse reactions are usually local application-site symptoms and mild systemic complaints, and mupirocin should not be used with intravenous cannulae or at central sites due to risks of fungal superinfection and resistance selection, reinforcing that its role is topical and decolonization rather than systemic therapy [^113dyUDn] [^114XYzBE] [^112XesTA] [^1126kfUR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, does wider decolonization drive resistance enough to negate activity. In the REDUCE-MRSA analysis of ICU isolates, odds of mupirocin resistance did not increase during intervention periods compared with baseline, but observational and mechanistic data still associate higher institutional use with more resistance, so I should recommend judicious, protocolized use with periodic resistance surveillance rather than indiscriminate application [^115WiHgM] [^112pBGpg].

> I almost said mupirocin could be used for systemic S. aureus infection, but I should correct that after checking absorption data. Systemic absorption from intranasal application is negligible and the product is not indicated for systemic S. aureus infections, so for bacteremia, pneumonia, or deep infections, systemic anti-staphylococcal agents are required while mupirocin's role, if any, is adjunctive decolonization or topical lesion management [^116JVmAT] [^115dtGUL].

> Putting this together, I can conclude that mupirocin is indeed active against susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, including many MRSA strains, with a unique IleRS-targeting mechanism, demonstrated clinical efficacy for impetigo and strong performance in nasal decolonization and prevention programs, but its effectiveness can be undermined by emerging high-level mupA-mediated resistance and suboptimal application or site penetration, so it should be used judiciously within evidence-based protocols and not as a systemic therapy for invasive disease [^115dtGUL] [^116yDAXB] [^111h1fVi] [^114ect3m] [^113Qas9N].

---

Yes — mupirocin is active against Staphylococcus aureus [^115dtGUL], including methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA), and is indicated for topical treatment of impetigo [^116yDAXB] and secondarily infected skin lesions due to susceptible S. aureus [^114XWAh4]. It is also used for **nasal decolonization** of S. aureus, particularly MRSA, to reduce infection risk in healthcare settings [^113brbdA] [^112fMWcn]. However, **resistance can occur**, especially with prolonged or repeated use, so susceptibility testing and judicious use are recommended [^112pBGpg] [^111XJ2ta].

---

## Clinical indications and efficacy

Mupirocin is indicated for topical treatment of **impetigo** [^116yDAXB] and secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions caused by susceptible S. aureus [^114XWAh4]. Clinical trials show high efficacy in eradicating S. aureus from skin lesions [^111h1fVi] and nasal colonization sites [^112fMWcn]. In **impetigo**, mupirocin ointment achieved clinical efficacy rates of 71% compared with 35% for placebo, and pathogen eradication rates of 94% with mupirocin versus 62% with placebo [^111h1fVi]. For **nasal decolonization**, mupirocin nasal ointment [^113brbdA] effectively eradicates nasal colonization of S. aureus, including MRSA, reducing the risk of subsequent infections in healthcare settings [^1141a5q5].

---

## Spectrum of activity against staphylococcus aureus

Mupirocin exhibits **potent activity** against both methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [^115dtGUL]. Its unique mechanism of action — inhibiting bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase [^115dtGUL] — results in bactericidal activity at topical concentrations. **MSSA coverage** is strong: mupirocin is highly effective against MSSA [^111h1fVi], making it a first-line topical agent for mild skin infections caused by this organism. **MRSA coverage** is also robust: mupirocin is effective against most MRSA strains, making it valuable for nasal decolonization [^112fMWcn] and topical treatment of MRSA-related skin infections.

---

## Resistance considerations

Despite its efficacy, **resistance to mupirocin** can develop, particularly with prolonged or repeated use. Resistance mechanisms include mutations in the ileS gene encoding isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase [^115DkWQV] and acquisition of plasmid-mediated resistance genes such as mupA [^111XJ2ta] [^112pBGpg].

- **Low-level resistance**: Typically results from point mutations in the native ileS gene, leading to MICs of 8–256 µg/mL [^111XJ2ta]. The clinical significance of low-level resistance remains unclear [^112pBGpg].

- **High-level resistance**: Mediated by plasmid-encoded mupA gene [^1143a6vk], resulting in MICs ≥ 512 µg/mL. High-level resistance is clinically significant and associated with decolonization failure [^112pBGpg].

- **Prevalence**: Resistance rates vary geographically and by clinical setting. Studies report resistance rates ranging from 3.4% to 25% among MRSA isolates [^112gN2jN], with higher rates observed in healthcare settings with frequent mupirocin use.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **judicious use** of mupirocin [^112pBGpg] to minimize resistance; susceptibility testing is recommended, particularly in settings with known resistance or frequent mupirocin use. **Decolonization protocols** recommend mupirocin [^113brbdA] for nasal decolonization of MRSA carriers, particularly in healthcare settings [^113iPQc9], to reduce the risk of subsequent infections [^116qJv5Q]. **Alternative agents** such as retapamulin or fusidic acid may be considered when mupirocin resistance is present, although resistance to these agents can also develop [^114e23VP].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Clinical studies consistently demonstrate the **effectiveness** of mupirocin in reducing S. aureus colonization and infection rates. **Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)** [^115dacWK] have experienced significant reductions in S. aureus colonization and infection rates among neonates with mupirocin-based decolonization [^113kW7ZM]. For **surgical site infections**, preoperative nasal mupirocin decolonization reduced the incidence of S. aureus surgical site infections in orthopedic and cardiac surgery patients [^113iPQc9] [^112nhKDx].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While mupirocin is effective, several **limitations** must be considered:

- **Resistance development**: Prolonged or repeated use can lead to resistance, necessitating careful monitoring and susceptibility testing [^112pBGpg].

- **Limited systemic absorption**: Mupirocin is not suitable for systemic infections due to minimal systemic absorption [^115dtGUL] [^116JVmAT].

- **Adverse reactions**: Localized adverse reactions such as application site burning, itching, and rash may occur [^112XesTA].

---

Overall, mupirocin is **effective against Staphylococcus aureus**, including MRSA, and is indicated for topical treatment and nasal decolonization. Because resistance can develop, susceptibility testing and judicious use are recommended.

### Mupirocin-induced mutations in ileS in various genetic backgrounds of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^111XJ2ta]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Topical mupirocin is widely used for the decolonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriers. We evaluated the capacity of various MRSA clonotypes to develop mutations in the ileS gene associated with low-level mupirocin resistance. Twenty-four mupirocin-sensitive MRSA isolates from a variety of genotypes, determined by a multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat assay, were selected. Mupirocin MICs were determined by Etest. The isolates were then incubated in subinhibitory concentrations of mupirocin for 7 to 14 days. Repeat MIC determinations and sequencing of the ileS gene were then performed. Doubling times of isolates exposed to mupirocin and of unexposed isolates were compared.

We found that exposure to mupirocin led to rapid induction of low-level resistance (MICs of 8 to 24 μg/ml) in 11 of 24 (46%) MRSA isolates. This phenomenon was observed in strains with diverse genetic backgrounds. Various mutations were detected in 18 of 24 (75%) MRSA isolates. Acquisition of mutations appeared to be a stepwise process during prolonged incubation with the drug. Among the five isolates exhibiting low-level resistance and the highest MICs, four tested sensitive after incubation in the absence of mupirocin, but there was no reversion to the susceptible wild-type primary sequence. Resistance was not associated with significant fitness cost, suggesting that MRSA strains with low-level mupirocin resistance may have a selective advantage in facilities where mupirocin is commonly used. Our findings emphasize the importance of the judicious use of this topical agent.

### Bactroban [^113brbdA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Mupirocin is an antibacterial agent produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase. Due to this mode of action, mupirocin demonstrates no in vitro cross-resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents. When mupirocin resistance does occur, it appears to result from the production of a modified isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (MIC > 1,024 mcg/mL) has been reported in some strains of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved topically by intranasal administration. However, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against relevant intranasal pathogens is generally 8-fold to 30-fold higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In addition, mupirocin is highly protein bound (> 97%), and the effect of nasal secretions on the MICs of intranasally applied mupirocin has not been determined. Mupirocin has been shown to be active against most strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, both in vitro and in clinical studies of the eradication of nasal colonization.

Bactroban nasal only has established clinical utility in nasal eradication as part of a comprehensive program to curtail institutional outbreaks of infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

### Mupirocin resistance [^112pBGpg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

With increasing pressure to prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, the use of mupirocin for nasal decolonization of MRSA is likely to increase. Understanding the mechanisms, clinical significance, and epidemiology of mupirocin resistance is important for predicting how changes in mupirocin use may affect bacterial populations and MRSA control.

High-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus is mediated by a plasmid-encoded mupA gene, which can be found on conjugative plasmids carrying multiple resistance determinants for other classes of antimicrobial agents. High-level resistance has been associated with decolonization failure, and increased resistance rates have been associated with increased mupirocin use.

Low-level mupirocin resistance is mediated via mutation in the native ileS gene, although the clinical significance of this resistance is unclear. Laboratory tests to detect and distinguish between these types of resistance have been described but are not widely available in the United States. Institutions considering the implementation of widespread mupirocin use should consider these resistance issues and develop strategies to monitor the impact of mupirocin use.

### Mupirocin [^115dtGUL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Mupirocin is an RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens.

- **Mechanism of action**: Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase. It is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration. Mupirocin is highly protein-bound (greater than 97%), and the effect of wound secretions on the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of mupirocin has not been determined.

- **Resistance**: When mupirocin resistance occurs, it results from the production of a modified isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase or the acquisition of, by genetic transfer, a plasmid mediating a new isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (MIC ≥ 512 mcg/mL) has been reported in increasing numbers of isolates of S. aureus and with higher frequency in coagulase-negative staphylococci. Mupirocin resistance occurs with greater frequency in methicillin-resistant than methicillin-susceptible staphylococci.

- **Cross resistance**: Due to its mode of action, mupirocin does not demonstrate cross resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents.

- **Antimicrobial activity**: Mupirocin has been shown to be active against susceptible isolates of S. aureus and S. pyogenes, both in vitro and in clinical trials [see Indications and Usage (1)]. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Mupirocin is active against most isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis.

### Chlorhexidine and mupirocin for clearance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization after hospital discharge: A secondary analysis of the changing lives by eradicating antibiotic resistance trial [^1141a5q5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The CLEAR Trial demonstrated that a multisite body decolonization regimen reduced post-discharge infection and hospitalization in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriers. Here, we describe the decolonization efficacy.

- **Methods**: We performed a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of MRSA decolonization among adult patients after hospital discharge with MRSA infection or colonization. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either MRSA prevention education or education plus decolonization with topical chlorhexidine, oral chlorhexidine, and nasal mupirocin. Participants were swabbed in the nares, throat, axilla/groin, and wound (if applicable) at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 9 months after randomization. The primary outcomes of this study are follow-up colonization differences between groups.

- **Results**: Among 2121 participants, 1058 were randomized to decolonization. By 1 month, MRSA colonization was lower in the decolonization group compared with the education-only group (odds ratio [OR] = 0.44; 95% confidence interval, .36-.54; P ≤ .001). A similar magnitude of reduction was seen in the nares (OR = 0.34; 95% CI, .27-.42; P < .001), throat (OR = 0.55; 95% CI, .42-.73; P < .001), and axilla/groin (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, .43-.75; P < .001). These differences persisted through month 9, except at the wound site, which had a relatively small sample size. Higher regimen adherence was associated with lower MRSA colonization (P ≤ .01).

- **Conclusions**: In a randomized, clinical trial, a repeated post-discharge decolonization regimen for MRSA carriers reduced colonization effectively.

### Mupirocin ointment for preventing Staphylococcus aureus infections in nasal carriers [^112fMWcn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the leading nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pathogen in hospitals throughout the world. Traditionally, the control of S. aureus has focused on preventing cross-infection between patients; however, it has been shown repeatedly that a large proportion of nosocomial S. aureus infections originate from the patient's own flora. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is now considered a well-defined risk factor for subsequent infection in various groups of patients. Local antibiotic treatment with mupirocin ointment is often used to eradicate nasal S. aureus.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether the use of mupirocin nasal ointment in patients with identified S. aureus nasal carriage reduced S. aureus infection rates.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (May 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2008), EMBASE (1980 to May 2008), and CINAHL (1982 to May 2008). To identify unpublished trials, abstract books from major scientific meetings (ICAAC, ESCMID, and SHEA) were hand-searched. Researchers and manufacturers of mupirocin were contacted, and other electronic databases were searched (SIGLE, ASLIB Index, mRCT, USA Clinical Trials).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nasal mupirocin with no treatment, placebo, or alternative nasal treatment in the prevention of S. aureus infections in nasal S. aureus carriers were included.

### Mupirocin resistance among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-colonized patients at admission to a tertiary care medical center [^112gN2jN]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

All patients admitted to our tertiary care hospital from 1 December 2007 to 10 June 2008 were screened for methicillin (meticillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal colonization, and the isolates were tested for mupirocin susceptibility using Etest. Mupirocin resistance (MR) was noted to occur in 3.4% of MRSA carriers, and high-level MR was observed in 0.62% of carriers.

### Acquisition of high-level mupirocin resistance and its fitness cost among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains with low-level mupirocin resistance [^1143a6vk]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

We investigated whether methicillin (meticillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates with low-level mupirocin resistance can serve as recipients of a pSK41-like plasmid conferring high-level mupirocin resistance without substantial fitness cost. Our results suggest that acquisition of the plasmid conferring high-level mupirocin resistance was not necessarily associated with fitness cost in some MRSA recipients with low-level mupirocin resistance.

### Prevention of surgical site infections: Decontamination with mupirocin based on preoperative screening for Staphylococcus aureus carriers or universal decontamination [^113iPQc9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

Perioperative decolonization of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers with mupirocin, together with chlorhexidine body washing, reduces the incidence of S. aureus surgical site infection. A targeted strategy, applied in S. aureus carriers only, is costly, and implementation may reduce effectiveness. Universal decolonization is more cost-effective but increases exposure of non-carriers to mupirocin and the risk of resistance to mupirocin in staphylococci. High-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus can emerge through horizontal gene transfer originating from coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and through clonal transmission. The evidence on the occurrence of high-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus and CoNS, in combination with the results of mathematical modeling, strongly suggests that the increased selection of high-level mupirocin resistance in CoNS does not constitute an important risk for high-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus. Compared with a targeted strategy, universal decolonization seems associated with an equally low risk of mupirocin resistance in S. aureus.

### Comprehensive strategy including prophylactic mupirocin to reduce Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection in high-risk neonates [^113kW7ZM]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). High credibility.

To examine the use of long-term prophylactic mupirocin as part of a comprehensive strategy in reducing Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), a study was conducted.

- **Study design**: Twice daily mupirocin was applied to all infants admitted to the NICU throughout their hospitalization starting in 2004. S. aureus surveillance began in 2008. The efficacy of these practices was evaluated with a retrospective review of infants admitted from 2004 to 2010 who were found to be colonized or infected with S. aureus.

- **Results**: During the study period, 66 of 6,283 NICU infants had a S. aureus infection, with 67% showing methicillin resistance. There were three distinct S. aureus outbreaks; the first involved a methicillin-resistant strain in July 2004. After the implementation of daily mupirocin, the outbreak was eradicated, and the rate of S. aureus infection significantly decreased from 1.82 to 0.40 per 1,000 patient-days-at-risk (P = 0.0049). Mupirocin was discontinued in March 2005, which was followed by a methicillin-sensitive S. aureus outbreak in November 2005. In December 2005, mupirocin was reinstituted and has continued to the present day, again significantly reducing S. aureus infections from 1.42 to 0.33 per 1,000 patient-days-at-risk (P < 0.0001), with zero isolates resistant to mupirocin. In the pre-mupirocin period, S. aureus colonization was upwards of 60%, now with rates typically below 5%. S. aureus colonization strongly predicted later invasive infection (P < 0.0001).

In conclusion, although controversial, prophylactic mupirocin in all NICU infants has acted as a barrier to colonization and markedly decreased S. aureus infections.

### Controlling the usage of intranasal mupirocin does impact the rate of Staphylococcus aureus deep sternal wound infections in cardiac surgery patients [^112nhKDx]. American Journal of Infection Control (2006). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the major cause of surgical site infections (SSI). At The Christ Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, S. aureus accounted for over 80% of sternal wound infections in cardiac surgery patients. Approximately 700 cardiac surgeries are performed each year, with an associated infection rate of 1.8% per 100 procedures performed. In an attempt to reduce S. aureus sternal wound infections, the use of prophylactic intranasal mupirocin was examined.

- **Methods**: Each patient undergoing cardiac surgery was nasally cultured before entering the operating room, and then intranasal mupirocin was applied and continued every 12 hours. Culture results were finalized within 48 hours. Mupirocin was discontinued when the culture returned negative and continued for 7 days when the culture returned positive for S. aureus.

- **Results**: Cultures showed a S. aureus carrier rate of 21%. These patients received mupirocin for 7 days. A decrease in S. aureus-associated SSI rates was observed from a case rate of 1.68% to 0.37% per 100 procedures over a 17-month period.

- **Conclusion**: Identifying and treating S. aureus carriers with a full course of mupirocin does impact the rate of S. aureus surgical site infections.

### Antibiotic hyper-resistance in a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase with altered active site signature motif [^115DkWQV]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The mechanism of mupirocin resistance has not yet been fully understood. The structural basis was indecisive because a comparison of the mupirocin-bound structures of *T. thermophilus* IleRS2 and *S. aureus* IleRS1 is not straightforward, considering that the IleRS1 structure, besides mupirocin, also contains the tRNA, which may promote conformational changes of the active site loops. To alleviate this problem, we solved the structures of IleRS1 (sensitive) and IleRS2 (resistant) from *P. megaterium* bound to mupirocin only. These structures provide important progress in understanding the resistance mechanism by identifying that the closed conformation of the active site KMSKS loop in IleRS2 precludes H-bonding stabilization of mupirocin's carboxylate.

Because H-bonding to a charged group has been shown as a powerful mechanism to ensure a high level of specificity in molecular recognition and may strongly contribute to the binding of mupirocin to IleRS1, the loss of this interaction in IleRS2 may have been adopted as an efficient resistance mechanism during evolution. In accordance, no H-bonding to mupirocin's carboxylate was observed in the *TtIleRS2*:mupirocin structure or a model of mupirocin bound to eukaryotic IleRS2. The structural data are also consistent with the finding that monic acid A alone cannot act as an inhibitor.

### Mupirocin and chlorhexidine genotypic resistance found in Staphylococcus aureus isolated from young infants below 90 days old: A genetic basis for eradication failure [^116YXn88]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The study investigates the genetic characteristics associated with the eradication failure of Staphylococcus aureus in infants below 90 days old. S. aureus was isolated from clinical specimen cultures, including blood, surgical tissue, drainage, pus, and routine screening cultures in the neonatal intensive care unit (nasal and axillary skin swab), from patients below 90 days old. The collection was conducted prospectively for one year, from August 2017 to July 2018. The isolates underwent typing and screening for genes associated with chlorhexidine (qacA/B), quaternary ammonium (smr), and mupirocin resistance (iles mutation, mupA, mupB), as well as Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin.

During the study period, 40 nonduplicate isolates were included for analyses, with 70.0% identified as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Mupirocin resistance was found in 25% of the total isolates, 17.4% of the colonizers, and 35.3% of the pathogens (P = 0.196). The chlorhexidine resistance gene was found in three MRSA isolates colonized in the nares of preterm infants. All isolates harbored the disinfectant quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) resistance gene. The PVL toxin gene was present in 57.5% of the isolates, with similar presence among colonizers and pathogens (69.6% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.072).

In conclusion, mupirocin, chlorhexidine, and QAC-resistant MRSAs harboring the PVL toxin gene were found in the nasal carriages of preterm infants. In this highly vulnerable patient population, one-fourth of the isolates harbored mupirocin-resistant genes, and all were resistant to QAC disinfectants.

### Mupirocin [^111h1fVi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of topical mupirocin ointment in impetigo was tested in two clinical trials.

- **First trial**: In this study, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment or a vehicle placebo three times daily for 8 to 12 days. The clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy in the evaluable populations (including both adults and pediatric subjects) were 71% for mupirocin ointment (n = 49) and 35% for the vehicle placebo (n = 51). Pathogen eradication rates in these populations were 94% for mupirocin ointment and 62% for vehicle placebo.

- **Second trial**: Here, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment three times daily or 30 mg per kg to 40 mg per kg oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate per day. This was an unblinded trial conducted over 8 days, with a follow-up visit 1 week after treatment ended. The clinical efficacy rates at the follow-up visit in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric subjects included) were 93% for mupirocin ointment (n = 29) and 78.5% for erythromycin (n = 28). Pathogen eradication rates were 100% for both test groups.

Pediatrics

There were 91 pediatric subjects aged 2 months to 15 years in the first trial described above. Clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy in the evaluable populations were 78% for mupirocin ointment (n = 42) and 36% for vehicle placebo (n = 49). In the second trial described above, all subjects were pediatric except for 2 adults in the group receiving mupirocin ointment. The age range of the pediatric subjects was 7 months to 13 years.

### Retapamulin activity against pediatric strains of mupirocin-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^114e23VP]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). High credibility.

Retapamulin activity against 53 isolates obtained from a mupirocin-resistant community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pediatric disease cluster was evaluated using broth microdilution. All strains were susceptible to retapamulin with minimum inhibitory concentrations ≤ 0.5 μg/mL. DNA sequence analysis of rplC and cfr identified one rplC strain variant that did not demonstrate reduced phenotypic susceptibility to retapamulin. These results demonstrate that retapamulin may be a useful alternative therapy for mupirocin-resistant community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus, especially in disease clusters.

### Low concentrations of mupirocin in the pharynx following intranasal application may contribute to mupirocin resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^116ai874]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

We describe a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonizing the pharynx. The MIC of mupirocin was 0.25 microg/ml before treatment and increased after treatment to 8 microg/ml. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we confirmed that the genotypes of MRSA that colonized the pharynx before and after the use of mupirocin were identical.

We measured the delivery of mupirocin to the pharynx in three normal volunteers and two patients. Low concentrations of mupirocin were present in the pharynx in all cases 10 minutes to 3 days after intranasal application. Our data suggested that low concentrations of the drug in the pharynx after intranasal application of mupirocin ointment might explain the selection of mupirocin resistance in MRSA.

### Screening and treatment for Staphylococcus aureus in patients undergoing hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162e7n3]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Boelaert et al. reported that the incidence of S. aureus bacteremia was four times lower after nasal decolonization with mupirocin in patients with end-stage renal disease than in the untreated group (0.024 vs. 0.097 per patient-year, p = 0.008). Johnson et al. conducted a clinical trial involving patients undergoing HD and found a significantly lower incidence of bacteremia-related bloodstream infection (7% vs. 35%, p < 0.01) and longer survival duration (108 vs. 31 days, p < 0.05) in patients treated with dermal mupirocin at the CVC exit site three times a week than in untreated patients. Sesso et al. performed a prospective randomized study and found that the proportion of patients with S. aureus skin infection at the CVC insertion site was lower in the mupirocin group than in the untreated group (4.3% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.001). In their study, S. aureus bacteremia was observed in 17 patients: 2 in the mupirocin group (0.71 episodes per 1,000 patient-days) and 15 in the control group (8.92 episodes per 1,000 patient-days; p < 0.001).

An issue of concern when mupirocin is used for long periods is the emergence of mupirocin resistance. However, resistance has not been reported when treatment is limited to mupirocin prophylaxis or healthy patients.

Three studies in the present meta-analysis evaluated resistance to mupirocin, and only one showed resistance associated with prolonged therapy. Notably, however, the long-term effect on the development of resistance is unknown because no studies have reported follow-up results of more than two years. Moreover, the techniques used varied among the studies, affecting the consistency of the results.

### Temporary hemodialysis catheters: Recent advances [^1162cGbX]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Bacterial decolonization with intranasal mupirocin has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of S. aureus bacteremia for chronic hemodialysis patients with tunneled HD catheters. We are unaware of any studies that have assessed decolonization strategies specifically for patients with NTHCs.

Given that NTHCs are often used for AKI in the context of critical illness, studies of decolonization strategies for unselected ICU patients are relevant to patients who have NTHCs in that setting. A recent, large, cluster-randomized trial (n = 74,256 patients in 73 ICUs) utilized a 5-day decolonization protocol consisting of twice daily intranasal mupirocin and daily bathing with chlorhexidine-impregnated cloths. This protocol, when applied to all ICU patients, significantly reduced the rate of bloodstream infections (from any pathogen) compared to a strategy of applying the same decolonization protocol only to methicillin-resistant S. aureus carriers or using a strategy that only involved isolation of methicillin-resistant S. aureus carriers (i.e. no decolonization). It should be noted that this study did not report any analysis on the basis of whether patients had a NTHC in place, and its applicability to non-ICU patients with NTHCs is tenuous.

### Perioperative intranasal mupirocin for the prevention of surgical-site infections: Systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis [^113tSRzo]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2005). Low credibility.

The study aimed to review the evidence evaluating perioperative intranasal mupirocin for the prevention of surgical-site infections according to the type of surgical procedure.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis of published clinical trials.

- **Setting**: Studies included were either randomized clinical trials or prospective trials at a single institution that measured outcomes both before and after an institution-wide intervention (before-after trial). In all studies, intervention and control groups differed only by the use of perioperative intranasal mupirocin in the intervention group.

- **Patients**: Patients undergoing general or non-general surgery (e.g. cardiothoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and neurosurgery).

- **Main outcome measure**: Risk of surgical-site infection following perioperative intranasal mupirocin versus usual care.

- **Results**: Three randomized and four before-after trials met the inclusion criteria. No reduction in surgical-site infection rate was seen in randomized general surgery trials (summary estimates: 8.4% in the mupirocin group and 8.1% in the control group; relative risk [RR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI95], 0.81 to 1.33). In non-general surgery, the use of mupirocin was associated with a reduction in surgical-site infection in randomized trials (summary estimates: 6.0% in the mupirocin group and 7.6% in the control group; RR, 0.80; CI95, 0.58 to 1.10) and in before-after trials (summary estimates: 1.7% in the mupirocin group and 4.1% in the control group; RR, 0.40; CI95, 0.29 to 0.56).

### Mupirocin resistance in patients colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a surgical intensive care unit [^112AagHB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Nasal colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can be a precursor to serious infection, and decolonization with topical mupirocin has been studied as a means of preventing clinical infection. Mupirocin resistance in patients with MRSA has been reported, usually in the context of widespread mupirocin use.

- **Methods**: Patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) had nasal swab cultures for MRSA performed at admission, weekly, and at discharge in an active surveillance program. Collected MRSA isolates were tested for mupirocin resistance, and molecular analysis was performed. Clinical data on the characteristics and outcomes of the patients who stayed in the SICU for more than 48 hours were collected prospectively.

- **Results**: Of the 302 MRSA isolates available for testing, 13.2% were resistant to mupirocin, with 8.6% having high-level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration, ≥ 512 microg/mL) and 4.6% having low-level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration, 8–256 microg/mL). Patients admitted to the SICU for more than 48 hours who were colonized with mupirocin-resistant MRSA were more likely to have been admitted to our hospital during the previous year (P = 0.016), were older (P = 0.009), and had higher in-hospital mortality (16% vs. 33%; p = 0.027) compared with patients colonized with mupirocin-susceptible MRSA. Molecular analysis of the mupirocin-resistant isolates revealed that 72.5% of isolates contained staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec II. Repetitive sequence polymerase chain reaction typing revealed that high-level mupirocin resistance was present in the isolates.

### The evaluation of nasal mupirocin to prevent Staphylococcus aureus burn wound colonization in routine clinical practice [^111DTuuh]. Burns (2014). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus wound colonization frequently occurs in patients with burns and can cause impaired wound healing. Nasal mupirocin application may contribute to the reduction of burn wound colonization of endogenous origin, whereas colonization by the exogenous route can be reduced by blocking cross-infection from other sources. In this study, we evaluated whether the implementation of routine treatment of patients and burn center personnel using nasal mupirocin ointment reduces S. aureus burn wound colonization.

- **Methods**: We composed three study groups, consisting of a control period (Control), a mupirocin period (MUP), in which patients with burns were all receiving nasal mupirocin at admission, and a mupirocin + personnel period (MUP + P), in which we also screened the burn center personnel and decolonized S. aureus carriers by nasal mupirocin.

- **Results**: The patients who carried S. aureus in their nose and did not have S. aureus burn wound colonization at admission were considered as patients susceptible to the use of nasal mupirocin. In these patients, the S. aureus burn wound colonization rate was the same in all study groups. S. aureus nasal carriage was a significant independent risk factor for burn wound colonization (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.4–7.6) when analyzed within the three study groups.

- **Conclusion**: Although S. aureus carriage is a significant risk factor for developing burn wound colonization, the routine use of nasal mupirocin did not contribute to a reduction of burn wound colonization.

### Topical mupirocin treatment reduces interferon and myeloid signatures in cutaneous lupus erythematous lesions through targeting of Staphylococcus species [^116UNMr1]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an inflammatory skin manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Type I interferons (IFNs) promote inflammatory responses and are elevated in CLE lesions. We recently reported that CLE lesions are frequently colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we follow up via a proof-of-concept study to investigate whether type I IFN and inflammatory gene signatures in CLE lesions can be modulated with mupirocin, a topical antibiotic treatment against S. aureus-mediated skin infections.

- **Methods**: Participants with active CLE lesions (n = 12) were recruited and randomized into a week of topical treatment with either 2% mupirocin or petroleum jelly vehicle. Paired samples were collected before and after seven days of treatment to assess microbial lesional skin responses. Microbial samples from nares and lesional skin were used to determine baseline and post-treatment Staphylococcus abundance and microbial community profiles by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Inflammatory responses were evaluated by bulk RNA sequencing of lesional skin biopsies.

- **Results**: We identified 173 differentially expressed genes in CLE lesions after topical mupirocin treatment. Decreased lesional Staphylococcus burden correlated with decreased IFN pathway signaling and inflammatory gene expression and barrier dysfunction. Interestingly, mupirocin treatment lowered skin monocyte levels, and this mupirocin-associated depletion of monocytes correlated with decreased inflammatory gene expression.

- **Conclusion**: Mupirocin treatment decreased lesional Staphylococcus.

### Prevention of Staphylococcus aureus burn wound colonization by nasal mupirocin [^114tjrVJ]. Burns (2008). Low credibility.

There are two important routes for the transmission of *Staphylococcus aureus* to burn wounds. In the endogenous route, patients who naturally carry *S. aureus* colonize their own wounds, whereas, in the exogenous route, burn wounds are cross-infected from other sources. In this study, we evaluated the effect of blocking the endogenous route on *S. aureus* burn wound colonization by applying mupirocin in the nose of patients at the time of admission.

- **Methods**: From September 2000 to January 2002, all patients with burns admitted to a single dedicated burn centre received nasal mupirocin upon admission. This period was compared to two control periods (C1: July 1999 to July 2000 and C2: January 2002 to January 2003) for *S. aureus* burn wound colonization. The colonization risk was analyzed, adjusting for confounding, with Cox proportional hazard regression.

- **Results**: A total of 98 patients did not have *S. aureus* burn wound colonization at the time of admission and were thus considered at risk for *S. aureus* acquisition during their stay. Compared to C1, the relative risk of acquiring *S. aureus* in their wound was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.24–0.97) in the mupirocin period and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.28–1.1) during the C2 period. *S. aureus* nasal/pharyngeal colonization was a significant independent risk factor for wound colonization (RR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.2–4.2).

- **Conclusion**: Nasal mupirocin may contribute to the risk reduction of *S. aureus* wound colonization in patients with burns.

### Topical mupirocin treatment reduces interferon and myeloid signatures in cutaneous lupus erythematous lesions through targeting of Staphylococcus species [^112EtcuM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Mupirocin treatment lowers Staphylococcus burden on lesional skin. We next determined the impact of mupirocin or vehicle treatment on the microbial diversity and abundance of Staphylococcus on CLE lesions. Before treatment, the targeted lesion was swabbed, and a second swab was collected in the same location after one week of vehicle or mupirocin treatment. Paired nasal swabs were also collected. Staphylococcus abundance and cutaneous and nasal microbial diversity were assessed before and after topical treatment of the active CLE lesion. CLE lesional skin and nasal swab samples were assayed by 16S rRNA sequencing.

The relative abundance of bacterial genera colonizing CLE lesions was largely unaltered by mupirocin treatment, with the exception of Staphylococcus, whereas vehicle treatment did not significantly change lesional microbiota composition. Figure 3A depicts the pre‐ and post-treatment mean alpha diversities of each patient; intraindividual diversity is shown in Supplemental Figure 1A. Mupirocin reduced Staphylococcus burden on CLE lesions (P = 0.0352; Figure 3B) without altering overall microbial diversity (P = 0.2812; Figure 3C) or levels of other Gram‐positive bacteria, such as species within the Streptococcus genus (P = 0.1095; Supplemental Figure 1B).

Taken together, these data demonstrate compliance with topical therapy and the desired specificity of S. aureus as the target microbe for treatment.

### Mupirocin for decolonization of infants in neonatal intensive care units [^114Lj83t]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

- **Background and objectives**: Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is the second leading cause of late-onset sepsis among infants in the NICU. As colonization of nasal mucosa and/or skin frequently precedes invasive infection, decolonization strategies, such as mupirocin application, have been attempted to prevent clinical infection, although data supporting this approach in infants are limited. We conducted a phase 2 multicenter, open-label, randomized trial to assess the safety and efficacy of intranasal plus topical mupirocin in eradicating SA colonization in critically ill infants.

- **Methods**: Between April 2014 and May 2016, infants under 24 months old in the NICU at 8 study centers underwent serial screening for nasal SA. Colonized infants who met eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive 5 days of mupirocin versus no mupirocin to the intranasal, periumbilical, and perianal areas. Mupirocin effects on primary (day 8) and persistent (day 22) decolonization at all three body sites were assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 155 infants were randomly assigned. Mupirocin was generally well tolerated, but rashes (usually mild and perianal) occurred significantly more often in treated versus untreated infants. Primary decolonization occurred in 62 of 66 (93.9%) treated infants and 3 of 64 (4.7%) control infants (P < .001). Twenty-one of 46 (45.7%) treated infants were persistently decolonized compared with 1 of 48 (2.1%) controls (P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Application of mupirocin to multiple body sites was safe and effective in reducing SA colonization among critically ill infants in the NICU.

### Molecular characterization of resistance to mupirocin in methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from nasal samples [^115BGci1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

A total of 15 of 101 (14.8%) nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates exhibited mupirocin resistance (Mup(r)) compared with 1 of 154 (0.6%) methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates. A total of 14 (93%) isolates exhibiting high-level Mup(r) belonged to a single clone. Horizontal plasmid transfer and transmission of Mup(r) strains contribute to a high incidence of Mup(r) MRSA at our institution.

### Bactroban [^115okW1v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Mupirocin is an antibacterial agent produced by fermentation using the organism *Pseudomonas fluorescens*. It is active against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA), and certain gram-negative bacteria. Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase. Due to this unique mode of action, mupirocin demonstrates no in vitro cross-resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents.

Resistance occurs rarely; however, when mupirocin resistance does occur, it appears to result from the production of a modified isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (MIC > 1024 mcg/mL) has been reported in some strains of *Staphylococcus aureus* and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical application. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against relevant pathogens is generally 8-fold to 30-fold higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In addition, mupirocin is highly protein bound (> 97%), and the effect of wound secretions on the MICs of mupirocin has not been determined.

Mupirocin has been shown to be active against most strains of *S. aureus* and *Streptococcus pyogenes*, both in vitro and in clinical studies. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Mupirocin is active against most strains of *Staphylococcus epidermidis* and *Staphylococcus s*.

### What's hot this year in infectious diseases clinical science [^115PNY2C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Despite data showing that universal ICU decolonization with daily chlorhexidine gluconate bathing and nasal mupirocin reduces the rates of MRSA infections in ICUs, there is hesitancy to adopt mupirocin decolonization given concerns about selecting for mupirocin resistance. Iodophor (povidone-iodine) has been suggested as an acceptable alternative to mupirocin for nasal decolonization.

In a large RCT, over 800,000 patients across 137 US hospitals were randomized at the hospital level to receive either 5 days of twice-daily iodophor nasal decolonization or 5 days of twice-daily mupirocin decolonization, in addition to receiving daily chlorhexidine gluconate bathing. This study found that during the intervention period, there was a significantly increased risk of recovering S. aureus in a clinical culture, attributable to a patient's ICU stay, in the patients who underwent nasal decolonization with iodophor.

There were no differences, however, in the secondary outcome of all-cause bloodstream infections. Despite concerns about the potential development of mupirocin resistance, mupirocin is still the preferred option for S. aureus decolonization in ICUs, based on the results of this study.

### The association between socioeconomic factors and the success of decolonization treatment among individuals diagnosed with methicillin-resistant: A cohort study from 2007 to 2020 [^112kgqEa]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

We included MRSA-diagnosed patients who were treated for 5 or 10 days (throat carriers) with 2% mupirocin nasal ointment (Bactroban nasal) in the primary healthcare sector from 2007 to 2018. Patients were included from the day the prescription of the initial decolonization treatment was redeemed. Information on cases with later colonization or infection with MRSA (relapse) after successful decolonization treatment was not included in the analysis. We excluded individuals who died, moved from the region, or left Denmark within 2 years of follow-up. In the analysis of the success rate, we excluded participants who did not have posttreatment follow-up swab samples taken after 6 months. MRSA-diagnosed individuals were identified using a regional MRSA database. Statistics Denmark replaced Central Personal Register numbers with unique identifier numbers (pseudo-anonymized), and the study population (MRSA-diagnosed individuals) was matched with national registry data.

In Denmark, MRSA carriage is treated with a topical application of 2% mupirocin to the anterior nose twice a day, combined with daily bathing with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate and environmental cleaning for 5 days. In cases of throat carriage, the treatment period is extended to 10 days, and retreatment is recommended in case of treatment failure. Treatment is not recommended for children aged less than 2 years or for individuals with day-to-day contact with live pigs. There is no general recommendation to test household members before beginning treatment.

### Mupirocin-based decolonization of Staphylococcus aureus carriers in residents of 2 long-term care facilities: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113Qas9N]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). High credibility.

Mupirocin has been used in nursing homes to prevent the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), despite the lack of controlled trials. In this double-blind, randomized study, the efficacy of intranasal mupirocin ointment versus that of placebo in reducing colonization and preventing infection was assessed among persistent carriers of S. aureus.

Twice-daily treatment was given for 2 weeks, with a follow-up period of 6 months. Staphylococcal colonization rates were similar between residents at the Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs (VA) Extended Care Center, Michigan (33%), and residents at a community-based long-term care facility in Ann Arbor (36%), although those at the VA Center carried MRSA more often (58% vs. 35%; p = 0.017). After treatment, mupirocin had eradicated colonization in 93% of residents, whereas 85% of residents who received placebo remained colonized (p < 0.001).

At day 90 after study entry, 61% of the residents in the mupirocin group remained decolonized. Four patients did not respond to mupirocin therapy; 3 of the 4 had mupirocin-resistant S. aureus strains. Thirteen (86%) of 14 residents who became recolonized had the same pretherapy strain; no strain recovered during relapse was resistant to mupirocin. A trend toward reduction in infections was seen with mupirocin treatment.

### A high prevalence of mupirocin and macrolide resistance determinant among Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from burnt patients [^111xD7o8]. Burns (2012). Low credibility.

Infections due to Staphylococcus aureus have become increasingly common among burn patients. This study investigated the antibiotic resistance profile of S. aureus isolates and inducible resistance against clindamycin. The presence of mecA gene, mupA gene, and macrolide resistance genes were detected using PCR and multiplex-PCR. The resistance rates to methicillin, erythromycin, and mupirocin were 58.5%, 58%, and 40%, respectively. The prevalence of constitutive and inducible resistance among macrolide-resistant isolates was 75% and 25%, respectively. Ninety-five percent of the isolates were positive for one or more erm genes. The most common genes were ermA (75%), ermC (72%), and ermB (69%). The ermA gene predominated in strains with the inducible phenotype, while ermC was more common in isolates with the constitutive phenotype. The msrA gene was only found in one MRSA isolate with the constitutive phenotype. A total of 27 isolates (25%) carried the mupA gene. All the mupirocin-resistant isolates and almost all the erythromycin-resistant isolates were also resistant to methicillin, which may indicate an outbreak of MRSA isolates with high-level mupirocin and erythromycin resistance in the burn unit assessed.

Mupirocin MICs and the presence of mupA were determined in 108 staphylococci causing prosthetic joint infections. Zero out of 35 isolates (0%) of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus were mupirocin resistant, while 4 out of 15 (27%) methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates showed resistance. Among methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, 3 out of 16 (19%) were resistant. Additionally, 11 out of 42 (26%) methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci exhibited mupirocin resistance. The mupA gene was detected in all five high-level mupirocin-resistant staphylococci as well as in one mupirocin-susceptible staphylococcus.

Staphylococcus aureus (SA) colonization is frequent in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR). Mupirocin has well-recognized antistaphylococcal activity, and its nasal formulation is approved for the eradication of SA nasal colonization.

- **Objective**: To investigate the frequency of SA nasal carriage, its possible influence on AR severity, and nasal mupirocin's role on AR clinical severity.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients, aged 5 to 60 years, with AR were included, and 55 healthy individuals served as a control group. Nasal smear specimens were drawn from both nares. A skin prick test to inhalational allergens and a score-graded clinical evaluation of AR were performed. Carriers of SA were treated with topical nasal mupirocin.

- **Results**: The SA carrier (SAC) state was found in 23 (38%) of the patients with AR and in 8 (15%) of the healthy controls (P = 0.004). Comparing SACs with AR SA noncarriers, nasal symptom scores (SSs) tended to be higher in the SAC group (mean [SD], 11.09 [2.16] vs. 8.86 [1.43]; P < .005). Treatment with topical nasal mupirocin diminished the SAC state to 10% (P = 0.009) but did not change AR clinical severity, as assessed by the SS.

In conclusion, in patients with PAR, the SAC state is more prevalent compared with the healthy population. Topical nasal mupirocin reduces the SAC state but fails to clinically improve PAR, as assessed by the SS.

### Treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis exacerbations due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with mupirocin irrigations [^115wfY9Z]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) exacerbations due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are routinely encountered. Treatment often involves intravenous antibiotics that provide only transient benefits. Mupirocin has well-recognized antistaphylococcal activity, and its nasal formulation is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the eradication of nasal colonization with MRSA.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to describe the use of mupirocin nasal irrigations for the treatment of CRS exacerbations due to MRSA.

- **Materials and methods**: Charts of patients who received mupirocin nasal irrigations for MRSA exacerbations of CRS between January 2000 and October 2003 were reviewed.

- **Results**: Forty-two MRSA-positive cultures were obtained from 24 patients (mean age, 61 years; range, 38–82 years; 15 women and 6 men). Twenty-eight episodes were treated with mupirocin nasal irrigations and doxycycline; 4 were treated with mupirocin nasal irrigations and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 7 episodes were treated with mupirocin nasal irrigations alone. Patients were reevaluated at approximately 4 to 6 weeks. Repeat cultures were not obtained in 12 patients due to clinical and endoscopic resolution. Adequate follow-up was unavailable for 3 patients, and of the 27 repeat cultures, only 1 grew MRSA. Twelve patients had at least one recurrence, with a mean number of episodes of 1.75 (range, 1–8 episodes). The mean follow-up was 11.8 months (range, 3–27 months).

- **Conclusions**: Mupirocin nasal irrigations may avoid the need for intravenous antibiotics.

### The mutational landscape of Staphylococcus aureus during colonisation [^112xUTjP]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Five of the eight protein-altering mutations in ileS are known (Val588Phe and Val631Phe) or are in a codon (Gly593Ala) known to confer mupirocin resistance and exhibited elevated MICs compared to the wild-type clonal isolate from the same individual (Supplementary Table 3). We confirmed the role of a previously unreported frameshift mutation (Ile473fs) in mupirocin resistance (E-test MIC 1024 μg/mL, breakpoint > 12 μg/mL) and ruled out the effect of Gly591Ser (E-test MIC 0.5 μg/mL).

Out of the five S. aureus isolates with missense variants in dfrA, three had amino acid changes reported to confer resistance to trimethoprim (His150Arg and two Phe99Tyr). The available isolate with Phe99Tyr was phenotypically resistant (MIC ≥ 16 μg/mL), but the isolate carrying His150Arg was not (MIC ≤ 0.5 μg/mL, zone diameter 27 mm), ruling out the role of this mutation in trimethoprim resistance in this particular strain background.

### Topical mupirocin treatment reduces interferon and myeloid signatures in cutaneous lupus erythematosus lesions through targeting of Staphylococcus species [^114bnpMe]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an inflammatory skin manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Type I interferons (IFNs) promote inflammatory responses and are elevated in CLE lesions. We recently reported that CLE lesions are frequently colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we follow up via a proof-of-concept study to investigate whether type I IFN and inflammatory gene signatures in CLE lesions can be modulated with mupirocin, a topical antibiotic treatment against S. aureus–mediated skin infections.

- **Methods**: Participants with active CLE lesions (n = 12) were recruited and randomized into a week of topical treatment with either 2% mupirocin or petroleum jelly vehicle. Paired samples were collected before and after seven days of treatment to assess microbial lesional skin responses. Microbial samples from nares and lesional skin were used to determine baseline and post-treatment Staphylococcus abundance and microbial community profiles by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Inflammatory responses were evaluated by bulk RNA sequencing of lesional skin biopsies.

- **Results**: We identified 173 differentially expressed genes in CLE lesions after topical mupirocin treatment. Decreased lesional Staphylococcus burden correlated with decreased IFN pathway signaling and inflammatory gene expression and barrier dysfunction. Interestingly, mupirocin treatment lowered skin monocyte levels, and this mupirocin-associated depletion of monocytes correlated with decreased inflammatory gene expression.

- **Conclusion**: Mupirocin treatment decreased lesional Staphylococcus presence, correlating with diminished interferon pathway signaling and inflammation.

### Successful control of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus outbreak in a burn intensive care unit by addition of universal decolonization with intranasal mupirocin to basic infection prevention measures [^112oEPDw]. American Journal of Infection Control (2019). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is frequently implicated in health care-associated outbreaks in burn intensive care units, incurring substantial morbidity and mortality to these high-risk patients and excess costs to health care systems.

- **Methods**: MRSA health care-associated infections (HAIs) were noted before and after the implementation of basic infection prevention measures and the subsequent implementation of universal decolonization with intranasal mupirocin. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the relatedness of clinical isolates. A case-control study was conducted to characterize the risk factors for MRSA HAIs.

- **Results**: Basic interventions failed to decrease the rate of MRSA HAIs, although compliance with these interventions was high throughout the study. MRSA HAIs decreased from 8.53 HAIs per 1,000 patient days before the implementation of intranasal mupirocin to 3.61 HAIs per 1,000 patient days after the implementation of intranasal mupirocin (P = 0.033). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis disclosed 10 unique clones with no large clusters. The case-control study revealed a significant association between MRSA HAIs and lengths of stay, body surface area burned, intubation, pressor requirement, leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, development of pneumonia, MRSA colonization, and death.

- **Conclusions**: Basic environmental and behavioral interventions fell short of controlling a low-count, sporadic, and multiclonal MRSA outbreak in the burn intensive care unit of a tertiary medical center. However, the added implementation of universal decolonization with intranasal mupirocin proved effective in reducing the incidence of MRSA HAIs.

### Bacterial infections in neonates following mupirocin-based MRSA decolonization: A multicenter cohort study [^114p5R2h]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective was to characterize the risk of infection after MRSA decolonization with intranasal mupirocin.

- **Design**: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) from three urban hospitals in the United States, ranging in size from 45 to 100 beds.

- **Methods**: MRSA-colonized neonates were identified from NICU admissions occurring from January 2007 to December 2014, during which a targeted decolonization strategy was used for MRSA control. In two time-to-event analyses, MRSA-colonized neonates were observed from the date of the first MRSA-positive surveillance screen until (1) the first occurrence of novel gram-positive cocci in sterile culture or discharge or (2) the first occurrence of novel gram-negative bacilli in sterile culture or discharge. Mupirocin exposure was treated as time-varying.

- **Results**: A total of 522 MRSA-colonized neonates were identified from 16,144 neonates admitted to site NICUs. Of the MRSA-colonized neonates, 384 (74%) received mupirocin. The average time from positive culture to mupirocin treatment was 3.5 days (standard deviation, 7.2 days). The adjusted hazard of gram-positive cocci infection was 64% lower among mupirocin-exposed versus mupirocin-unexposed neonates (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.17–0.76), whereas the adjusted hazard ratio of gram-negative bacilli infection comparing mupirocin-exposed and -unexposed neonates was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.42–2.62).

- **Conclusions**: In this multicenter cohort of MRSA-colonized neonates, mupirocin-based decolonization treatment appeared to decrease the risk of infection.

### Editorial commentary: Duration of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: A question with many answers [^114VnL4p]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

As one final point, I would like to comment on the observation that receipt of mupirocin and/or chlorhexidine baths was not associated with a shorter duration of MRSA colonization in the study being discussed. Prior studies have shown eradication therapy to be effective in decreasing MRSA colonization and subsequent infection, but these studies paid close attention to adherence. Cluzet et al. appropriately mention a number of limitations that might have impacted their assessment of the association between the use of mupirocin and/or chlorhexidine/bleach baths and the time to clearance of MRSA colonization. They specifically mention that compliance with these two agents was not determined and that decolonization regimens may have been given more commonly to patients with a perceived higher risk of recurrence.

Overall, Cluzet et al. have presented stimulating results from a well-designed study that took great efforts to longitudinally follow the MRSA colonization status of a cohort of patients and their household members following diagnosis of community-acquired MRSA SSTI. Both the shorter duration of time to clearance of MRSA colonization and the putative association between SSTI treatment with clindamycin and a shorter duration of MRSA colonization deserve further investigation.

### Topical mupirocin treatment reduces interferon and myeloid signatures in cutaneous lupus erythematous lesions through targeting of Staphylococcus species [^114kf8aU]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Treatment with mupirocin resulted in the down-regulation of pathways involved in mitosis and cell division, which could reflect the normalization of keratinocyte proliferation. The presence of epidermal scale is considered an indicator of disease in CLE. Discoid lupus erythematosus lesions, in particular, show hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes, manifesting clinically as hyperkeratosis and follicular plugging from keratin. Here, treatment with mupirocin resulted in down-regulation of pathways involved in mitosis and cell division, and increased keratinization, which could reflect the normalization of keratinocyte maturation. Thus, mupirocin treatment may offer benefits in this regard. Longer-term studies are needed to assess the clinical response.

Type I IFN-related gene changes were observed to correlate with decreased monocytes and activated dendritic cells after mupirocin treatment. PLSCR1 is an IFN-inducible phospholipid scramblase family member known to be involved in immune responses and antiviral activity. Monocytes in patients with SLE have enhanced PLSCR1 gene expression. PLSCRs are important for lipid metabolism and contribute to inflammation, which is also modulated by mupirocin treatment. PLSCR1 negatively regulates Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis during macrophage differentiation from precursors such as monocytes. Furthermore, PLSCR1 may play a role in the antiviral response of IFN by amplifying and enhancing the IFN response through increased expression of a select subset of potent antiviral genes.

### Chlorhexidine and mupirocin susceptibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates in the REDUCE-MRSA trial [^115WiHgM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Whether targeted or universal decolonization strategies for the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) select for resistance to decolonizing agents is unresolved. The REDUCE-MRSA trial (ClinicalTrials registration no. NCT00980980) provided an opportunity to investigate this question. REDUCE-MRSA was a three-arm, cluster-randomized trial of either screening and isolation without decolonization, targeted decolonization with chlorhexidine and mupirocin, or universal decolonization without screening to prevent MRSA infection in intensive-care unit (ICU) patients.

Isolates from the baseline and intervention periods were collected and tested for susceptibility to chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) by microtiter dilution; mupirocin susceptibility was tested by Etest. The presence of the qacA or qacB gene was determined by PCR and DNA sequence analysis. A total of 3,173 isolates were analyzed; 2 were nonsusceptible to CHG (MICs, 8 μg/ml), and 5 out of 814 (0.6%) carried qacA or qacB. At baseline, 7.1% of MRSA isolates expressed low-level mupirocin resistance, and 7.5% expressed high-level mupirocin resistance. In a mixed-effects generalized logistic regression model, the odds of mupirocin resistance among clinical MRSA isolates or MRSA isolates acquired in an ICU in intervention versus baseline periods did not differ across arms, although estimates were imprecise due to small numbers. Reduced susceptibility to chlorhexidine and carriage of qacA or qacB were rare among MRSA isolates in the REDUCE-MRSA trial.

The odds of mupirocin resistance were no different in the intervention period compared to baseline.

### The effect of total household decolonization on clearance of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^1171M3Td]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of total household decolonization with intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine gluconate body wash on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection among subjects with MRSA skin and soft-tissue infection. This was designed as a three-arm nonmasked randomized controlled trial conducted in five academic medical centers in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Participants included adults and children presenting to ambulatory care settings with community-onset MRSA skin and soft-tissue infection (i.e. index cases) and their household members.

Enrolled households were randomized into one of three intervention groups:

- **Education on routine hygiene measures**: Basic hygiene education was provided without additional interventions.
- **Education plus decolonization without reminders**: This group received intranasal mupirocin ointment twice daily for seven days and chlorhexidine gluconate use on the first and last day, without further reminders.
- **Education plus decolonization with reminders**: In addition to the same decolonization protocol, subjects received daily telephone calls or text message reminders.

Main outcome measures focused on the time to clearance of colonization in the index cases, as re-infections were minimal. Out of 223 households, 73 were assigned to education-only, 76 to decolonization without reminders, and 74 to decolonization with reminders. Results indicated no significant difference in time to clearance of colonization between the education-only group and the decolonization groups (log-rank P = 0.768). However, secondary analyses showed that compliance with decolonization was associated with decreased time to clearance (P = 0.018).

In conclusion, total household decolonization did not result in a decreased time to clearance of colonization.

### Randomized placebo-controlled trial of topical mupirocin to reduce Staphylococcus aureus colonization in infants in the neonatal intensive care unit [^114ect3m]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of topical mupirocin in reducing Staphylococcus aureus colonization in infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

- **Study design**: A prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial of mupirocin versus placebo in S. aureus-colonized infants was conducted in a tertiary care NICU between October 2016 and December 2019. Weekly universal active surveillance with polymerase chain reaction screening identified colonized infants. The colonized infants received a 5-day course of mupirocin (mupirocin group) or petroleum jelly (control group). Repeat courses were given for additional positive screens.

- **Results**: A total of 216 infants were enrolled, and 205 were included in data analyses. Primary decolonization was more successful for mupirocin-treated infants (86 of 104 [83%]) than for controls (20 of 101 [20%]) (P < .001). Although reS. aureus colonization occurred frequently (59 of 81 [73%] mupirocin-treated and 26 of 33 [79%] controls), subsequent decolonization remained more successful for mupirocin-treated infants than for controls (38 of 49 [78%] vs. 2 of 21 [10%]; P < .001). Subgroup analyses of infants of ≤ 30 weeks' gestational age yielded similar results; decolonization occurred more often in mupirocin-treated infants compared with control infants (63 of 76 [83%] vs. 13 of 74 [18%]; P < .001). Bacterial sterile site infections tended to be less frequent in mupirocin-treated infants compared with controls (2 of 104 [2%] vs. 8 of 101 [8%]; p = 0.057). No invasive S. aureus infections occurred in mupirocin-treated infants.

### Mupirocin prophylaxis against nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus infections in nonsurgical patients: A randomized study [^1135ZTp9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage is a major risk factor for nosocomial S. aureus infection. Studies show that intranasal mupirocin can prevent nosocomial surgical site infections; however, no data are available on the efficacy of mupirocin in nonsurgical patients.

- **Objective**: To assess the efficacy of mupirocin prophylaxis in preventing nosocomial S. aureus infections in nonsurgical patients.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Three tertiary care academic hospitals and one nonacademic hospital.

- **Patients**: 1602 culture-proven S. aureus carriers hospitalized in nonsurgical departments.

- **Intervention**: Therapy with mupirocin 2% nasal ointment (n = 793) or placebo ointment (n = 809), administered twice daily for 5 days, initiated 1 to 3 days after admission.

- **Measurements**: Nosocomial S. aureus infections according to defined criteria, in-hospital mortality, duration of hospitalization, and time to nosocomial S. aureus infection. Staphylococcus aureus isolates were genotyped to assess whether the infection was caused by endogenous strains.

- **Results**: The mupirocin and placebo groups did not statistically differ in the rates of nosocomial S. aureus infections (mupirocin, 2.6%; placebo, 2.8%; risk difference, 0.2 percentage point [95% CI, -1.5 to 1.9 percentage points]), mortality (mupirocin, 3.0%; placebo, 2.8%; risk difference, -0.2 percentage point [CI, -1.9 to 1.5 percentage points]), or duration of hospitalization (median for both, 8 days). However, time to nosocomial S. aureus infection was decreased in the mupirocin group from 12 to 25 days (P > 0.2).

### Decolonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus using oral vancomycin and topical mupirocin [^113i6Q9s]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a short course of oral vancomycin and intranasal mupirocin ointment in the eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization. During an outbreak of MRSA, the colonized subjects received oral vancomycin and topical mupirocin. They were screened for MRSA at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after decolonization. A questionnaire was developed to evaluate the side effects of oral vancomycin. Thirty-five subjects were treated. Clearance was achieved in all cases, with 24 (69%) subjects achieving clearance after one course of therapy. Twenty-eight (80%) subjects experienced some side effects, including six (17%) who did not tolerate oral vancomycin. Although oral vancomycin, in combination with topical mupirocin, is effective in the elimination of MRSA colonization, there is a need for further studies to confirm our results and to evaluate the safety of oral vancomycin.
