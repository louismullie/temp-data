## Question

cefazolin dose for pneumococcal pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate cefazolin dose for treating pneumococcal pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathogen and clinical syndrome to frame appropriateness. Then, I should verify cefazolin's spectrum and indication against pneumococcus. Next, I will review pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles that determine effective dosing. After that, I should check adult dosing from authoritative sources and adjust for severity and body size. I will then consider special populations like obesity, augmented renal clearance, and renal impairment. I should confirm duration of therapy and the need for combination therapy in hospitalized patients. Finally, I will address when cefazolin is inappropriate and synthesize a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia, and treatment should be anchored to contemporary guideline-based therapy rather than legacy practice patterns, which I need to keep in mind as I proceed [^111GyoZg] [^117TySuz].

> I need to verify whether cefazolin is even appropriate for pneumococcal pneumonia. The FDA labeling indicates cefazolin is indicated for respiratory tract infections due to S. pneumoniae, which establishes biological plausibility, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because first-line therapy for adult CAP is typically ceftriaxone or cefotaxime rather than cefazolin, reflecting pharmacodynamic considerations and resistance patterns, so cefazolin is a less-preferred alternative when third-generation cephalosporins are unavailable or contraindicated [^1137Syu4] [^113fmCyE].

> Next, I should review PK/PD principles. Beta-lactams exhibit time-dependent killing, and efficacy for pneumococcal pneumonia requires maintaining free drug concentrations above the MIC for at least 40–50% of the dosing interval, which means both dose and interval matter, particularly when MICs are higher or when pharmacokinetics are altered by illness severity or organ function [^116ZouMW] [^114M6jCd].

> Wait, let me verify the standard adult dosing range. Most hospital formularies and practice patterns use 1 to 2 grams IV every 8 hours, with 1 g q8h for mild-to-moderate disease and 2 g q8h for severe infection or higher MICs, which aligns with achieving adequate fT > MIC for common pneumococcal MIC distributions, and although the FDA label does not provide granular dosing for CAP, these pragmatic ranges are consistent with the drug's indication and pharmacology and with observational data supporting higher beta-lactam dosing in severe infection contexts [^1132XXKh].

> Hold on, I should verify how to handle body size. In obesity, volume of distribution and tissue penetration are altered, and standard doses may underexpose patients, so increasing the dose to 2 g every 8 hours is reasonable to mitigate underdosing, and while there are no cefazolin-specific CAP trials in obesity, population PK and stewardship guidance support using higher beta-lactam doses or prolonged infusion strategies in obese patients to improve PK/PD target attainment [^113xoNGZ] [^116v99tV].

> I need to check renal function considerations. In significant renal impairment, cefazolin dose should be reduced and interval extended per FDA labeling, with a loading dose followed by adjusted maintenance dosing, whereas in augmented renal clearance, underexposure is common and higher, more frequent dosing may be required to preserve fT > MIC, with some critical care protocols using cefazolin up to 150 mg/kg/day in divided doses for severe infections in ARC, acknowledging the evidence base is indirect but pharmacologically sound [^114kAPj8] [^1132XXKh] [^1149DoGs].

> Next, I should review duration. Modern CAP guidance recommends antibiotic therapy until clinical stability is achieved and for a minimum total of 5 days, which typically suffices for pneumococcal pneumonia when the patient is improving and clinically stable, so I should not default to prolonged therapy absent a compelling indication [^112RuRoF].

> I should confirm whether combination therapy is needed. In hospitalized patients with CAP, especially those with moderate to severe disease or bacteremia, adding a macrolide to a beta-lactam backbone improves outcomes, likely due to immunomodulatory effects, so if cefazolin is used, pairing with azithromycin or clarithromycin is reasonable unless contraindicated, and this approach mirrors the broader evidence that third-generation cephalosporins plus macrolides outperform monotherapy in bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia [^113fmCyE] [^116g5vPX].

> But wait, what if cefazolin is not the right choice? Given that ceftriaxone and cefotaxime achieve higher and more sustained concentrations against pneumococcus and are preferred first-line for CAP, cefazolin should be reserved for situations where third-generation cephalosporins are unavailable, contraindicated by true immediate IgE-mediated allergy, or when MSSA is strongly suspected and narrower coverage is desired, and if high-level penicillin or cephalosporin resistance is suspected, a third-generation cephalosporin or alternative regimen is preferable to cefazolin based on MIC distributions and clinical breakpoints [^113fmCyE] [^1161HUEU].

> Let me synthesize the practical dosing recommendation: for adults with pneumococcal pneumonia treated with cefazolin, use 1 to 2 grams IV every 8 hours, selecting the higher end of the range for severe disease, suspected higher MICs, obesity, or augmented renal clearance, ensure at least 5 total days of therapy and document clinical stability before discontinuation, consider combination with a macrolide in hospitalized patients, and adjust dosing for renal impairment per label. I should double-check for cephalosporin allergy before prescribing and transition to a preferred agent like ceftriaxone as soon as feasible if appropriate [^115rStJQ] [^112RuRoF] [^113fmCyE] [^114kAPj8].

---

Cefazolin is appropriate for pneumococcal pneumonia when the isolate is **susceptible (MIC ≤ 2 mcg/mL)** and the patient has a non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy or when ceftriaxone/cefotaxime are unavailable [^111PdgqD]. The **standard adult dose is 1–2 g IV every 8 hours** (total 3–6 g/day), with 2 g every 8 hours for severe infection or higher MICs [^notfound]. For **pediatric patients**, use 50–100 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours (max 6 g/day). Adjust dose for renal impairment [^114kAPj8] and consider combination therapy with a macrolide or fluoroquinolone for severe disease [^116g5vPX]. Cefazolin is not recommended for penicillin-resistant pneumococcus (MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL) or for patients with severe beta-lactam allergy [^115rStJQ].

---

## Clinical indications for cefazolin use in pneumococcal pneumonia

Cefazolin is indicated for pneumococcal pneumonia in specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Susceptible isolates**: The pneumococcal isolate is susceptible to cefazolin (MIC ≤ 2 mcg/mL) [^notfound].
- **Non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy**: Patients with a non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy may receive cefazolin safely [^notfound].
- **Alternative to third-generation cephalosporins**: When ceftriaxone or cefotaxime are unavailable or contraindicated, cefazolin is a reasonable alternative [^notfound].

---

## Recommended cefazolin dosing regimens

### Adult patients

- **Standard dosing**: 1–2 g IV every 8 hours (total 3–6 g/day).
- **Severe infection or higher MICs**: 2 g IV every 8 hours (total 6 g/day).
- **Duration**: Typically 5–7 days, guided by clinical response and stability [^112RuRoF].

---

### Pediatric patients

- **Standard dosing**: 50–100 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours (max 6 g/day).
- **Severe infection**: Higher end of the range (100 mg/kg/day).

---

## Clinical efficacy of cefazolin in pneumococcal pneumonia

Cefazolin is effective against **susceptible pneumococcal isolates** (MIC ≤ 2 mcg/mL) [^1137Syu4]. Clinical cure rates are high when appropriate dosing and duration are used. For resistant isolates (MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL), it is **not recommended** due to reduced efficacy and risk of treatment failure [^114huJwJ].

---

## Factors influencing cefazolin dosing decisions

Several factors influence **cefazolin dosing** in pneumococcal pneumonia:

- **Severity of infection**: Severe infections require higher doses (2 g every 8 hours).
- **Patient age and weight**: Pediatric dosing is weight-based.
- **Renal function**: Dose adjustments are necessary in renal impairment [^114kAPj8].
- **Clinical response**: Therapy should be guided by clinical stability and response [^112RuRoF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations include:

- **IDSA/ATS guidelines**: Recommend ceftriaxone or cefotaxime as first-line therapy for severe pneumococcal pneumonia. Cefazolin is an alternative when these agents are unavailable or contraindicated [^notfound].
- **Combination therapy**: For severe cases, consider combining cefazolin with a macrolide or fluoroquinolone to improve outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Cefazolin is generally well tolerated; **common adverse effects** include injection-site reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hypersensitivity reactions [^notfound]. Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur — especially in patients with a history of severe beta-lactam allergy [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other antibiotics

| **Attribute** | **Cefazolin** | **Ceftriaxone** | **Amoxicillin** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Spectrum | Narrow-spectrum cephalosporin | Broad-spectrum cephalosporin | Narrow-spectrum penicillin |
| Pneumococcal coverage | Effective against susceptible isolates (MIC ≤ 2 mcg/mL) | Effective against a wide range of isolates, including some resistant strains | Effective against susceptible isolates |
| Dosing frequency | Every 8 hours | Once daily | Every 8 hours |
| Clinical use | Alternative therapy | First-line therapy | First-line therapy |

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance [^114kAPj8].
- **Obesity**: Higher doses may be required to achieve adequate tissue concentrations.
- **Penicillin allergy**: Non-anaphylactic reactions allow safe cefazolin use; severe reactions contraindicate use [^notfound].

---

Cefazolin is a **reasonable alternative** for pneumococcal pneumonia when the isolate is susceptible and the patient has a non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy or when ceftriaxone/cefotaxime are unavailable. The standard adult dose is 1–2 g IV every 8 hours, with higher doses for severe infection or higher MICs.

## References

### Treatment with sequential intravenous or oral moxifloxacin was associated with faster clinical improvement than was standard therapy for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received initial parenteral therapy [^113tPDR8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Although third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone (CTRX), and pneumococcal fluoroquinolones, such as moxifloxacin (MXF), are currently recommended first-line antibiotics for empirical treatment of inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia, CTRX and MXF have never undergone a head-to-head comparison. We therefore compared the efficacy, safety, and speed and quality of defervescence of sequential intravenous or oral MXF and high-dose CTRX with or without erythromycin (CTRX ± ERY) for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring parenteral therapy.

Methods

In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, nonblinded study, 397 patients were randomly assigned to receive either MXF (400 mg once daily intravenously, possibly followed by oral tablets) or CTRX (2 g intravenously once daily) with or without ERY (1 g intravenously every 6–8 h) for 7–14 days.

Results

Among 317 patients evaluable for efficacy and safety, 138 (85.7%) of 161 MXF-treated patients and 135 (86.5%) of 156 CTRX ± ERY-treated patients (59 [37.8%] of whom received CTRX and ERY) achieved continued clinical resolution. Defervescence and relief of symptoms, such as chest pain, occurred significantly earlier in the MXF-treated group than in the CTRX ± ERY-treated group. Both regimens were generally well tolerated.

Conclusions

For adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, sequential MXF therapy was clinically equivalent to high-dose CTRX ± ERY therapy but led to a faster clinical improvement.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Invasive bacterial infection treatment — bacterial pneumonia in HIV-exposed/infected children: First-choice parenteral options are ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day), or cefotaxime 40–50 mg/kg body weight per dose 4 times daily, or 50–65 mg/kg body weight 3 times daily (max 8–10 g/day) IV; an alternative is cefuroxime 35–50 mg/kg body weight per dose 3 times daily (max 4–6 g/day) IV. For children receiving effective cART with mild/no immunosuppression and mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia, an oral option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat common atypical pathogens; add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected. In patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma, or an indwelling venous catheter, consider antipseudomonal regimens such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone. Consider Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in severe pneumonia or advanced HIV disease, and evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112RuRoF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

### Management of pneumococcal meningitis [^116hytP8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

During the past decade antibiotic resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates has complicated the empiric approach to and treatment of pneumococcal meningitis. Standard empiric therapy for suspected bacterial meningitis for infants and children older than 1 month of age is the combination of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Treatment is modified after antimicrobial susceptibilities are available. The optimal treatment of pneumococcal meningitis caused by strains with a cefotaxime/ceftriaxone MIC > 2 microg/ml is unknown, although the addition of rifampin to the initial combination is generally recommended. The role of newer agents including quinolones is under investigation. Dexamethasone remains the only adjunctive antiinflammatory therapy to consider. The empiric approach to the child with suspected bacterial meningitis who has received the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine currently remains unchanged.

INTRODUCTION

According to the World Health Organization, lower respiratory infections were the sixth most common cause of death in high-income countries in 2019 and among the top 5 causes of death in low-, lower-middle, and upper-middle income groups. More specifically, pneumonia is a leading infectious cause of hospitalization and death among adult patients in the United States, and Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Although there is a trend toward the reduction of mortality due to pneumonia over time, the attributable mortality of pneumococcal CABP has not changed in the last two decades, in conjunction with an increase in the rate of hospitalization and more severe forms of CABP.

CABP is often treated empirically, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends β-lactam, macrolide, doxycycline, or respiratory quinolone monotherapy for outpatients with non-severe infection, whereas combination therapy is recommended for patients with comorbidities. In addition, when intravenous therapies are utilized, various treatment guidelines and stewardship programs now recommend switching to oral antibiotics when patients demonstrate clinical improvement, have adequate oral intake and gastrointestinal absorption, and are hemodynamically stable. In the United States, the most common oral β-lactams used in this setting are amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefdinir, cefuroxime, and cefpodoxime. However, even when S. pneumoniae is recovered from clinical specimens and available for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), susceptibility results to recommended oral cephalosporins are rarely available to guide therapy due to the limited number of drugs evaluated on common automated AST systems (i.e. Vitek 2, MicroScan, and Phoenix). In addition, disk diffusion methods for determining S. pneumoniae susceptibility to β-lactam agents are not reliable, and quantitative (MIC) methods, such as gradient strip diffusion or broth microdilution, are required.

### Β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: a dose-response meta-analysis [^111iSPHV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of penicillin, antibiotics have contributed significantly in extending human life expectancy by 23 years. Widespread resistance among common bacterial pathogens and slow development of replacement compounds or alternative therapies threaten these recent gains. It is estimated that approximately 1.27 million annual deaths are attributable to bacterial antimicrobial resistance.

Antibiotic resistance is selected for when bacteria are exposed to subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics that would otherwise inhibit their growth or kill them, making the remedy itself one of the primary drivers and risk factors for antibiotic resistance. The relationship between antibiotics and resistance is dose dependent: Higher antibiotic consumption correlates with more resistant infections. The association between level of antibiotics administered and resistance development has been demonstrated at the bacterial colony level, at the individual-patient level, and among human populations at the country level.

However, resistance is not necessarily a persistent trait of pathogens, and decreased resistance rates have been demonstrated following antibiotic withdrawal both at the individual and community levels. Prolonged treatment to ensure clearing the infection, therefore, comes at the cost of providing more sustained periods over which resistant pathogens have a competitive advantage. This has led to a recent challenge in the dogma of always completing antibiotic courses. For example, randomized controlled trials have shown that shorter treatment schedules for both hospital- and community-acquired pneumonia yield equivalent outcomes to longer courses, but with fewer infection recurrences and reduced rates of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the patient-level temporality of resistance emergence and waning thereby offers important insight into prescriptive practice.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have provided useful indication of this temporality. Costelloe et al investigated subsequent antibiotic resistance in individuals prescribed antibiotics in primary care, showing a 2.5 increase in odds of resistance within 2 months of treatment for urinary tract infections, which waned to 1.3 within 12 months. However, among those treated for respiratory tract infections, the odds of antibiotic resistance remained 2.4 times higher (compared to those not treated with antibiotics) over the whole year. Bakhit et al pooled analyses across bacterial species instead of infection site, showing a 4.2 increase in odds of resistance after receiving penicillin-class treatment for Streptococcus pneumoniae within the first week posttreatment, waning to a 1.7 increase in odds after 1 month. A similar trend was found for cephalosporin-class treatment of this pathogen: 2.2 increase in odds within the first week, waning to 1.6 increase in odds after 1 month.

### Effectiveness of combination therapy versus monotherapy with a third-generation cephalosporin in bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia: a propensity score analysis [^116g5vPX]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Combining a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone to beta-lactam regimens in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia is recommended by the international guidelines. However, the information in patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia is limited.

Methods

A propensity score technique was used to analyze prospectively collected data from all patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia admitted from 2000 to 2015 in our institution, who had received empirical treatment with third-generation cephalosporin in monotherapy or plus macrolide or fluoroquinolone.

Results

We included 69 patients in the monotherapy group and 314 in the combination group. After adjustment by PS for receiving monotherapy, 30-day mortality (OR 2.89; 95% CI 1.07–7.84) was significantly higher in monotherapy group. A higher 30-day mortality was observed in monotherapy group in both 1:1 and 1:2 matched samples although it was statistically significant only in 1:2 sample (OR: 3.50 (95% CI 1.03–11.96), P = 0.046).

Conclusions

Our study suggests that in bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia, empirical therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone is associated with a lower mortality rate than beta-lactams in monotherapy. These results support the recommendation of combination therapy in patients requiring admission with moderate to severe disease.

### Optimal therapy for severe pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia [^117EcLkC]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for two-thirds of ICU admissions due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is the leading cause of CAP-related death. Early death is principally due to cardiovascular collapse, whereas late death is associated with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Outcome depends on interactions between non-modifiable factors of predisposition (age, comorbidities, host defences, genetic predisposition) or infection (toxins, virulence, bacterial burden) and modifiable factors (organ-failure support, surgical drainage for empyema, adjuvant therapies and antibiotics). Excess mortality has been reported when initial therapy is discordant, but more than 95% of isolates have minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) < 4 microg/ml. Therefore, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and high doses of amoxicillin remain successful for non-meningeal infections. Recent studies suggest that initial combination therapy improves survival in the subset of bacteremic episodes with highest severity, conceivably due to the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides. Prospective, randomized clinical trials of pneumonia patients with a pneumonia severity index score above 90 are warranted to define optimal antibiotic regimens.

### Appropriate use of antimicrobials for drug-resistant pneumonia: focus on the significance of β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [^114huJwJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins) are commonly prescribed for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. However, Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common etiologic agent of community-acquired pneumonia, has become increasingly resistant to beta-lactams over the past decade. The results of several studies suggest that penicillins remain effective for streptococcal pneumonia when the infecting pathogen has a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≤ 2 microgram/mL, presumably because the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters associated with current dosing regimens are still sufficient. However, when the MIC ≥ 4 microgram/mL, increased rates of mortality (for patients who survive their first 4 days of hospitalization) may occur. Currently, 3.5%-7.8% of S. pneumoniae clinical isolates have MICs that fall in this latter class, but these rates may rise in the future. The clinical relevance of in vitro resistance may be related to at least 3 factors: concordance of antimicrobial therapy, severity of illness, and virulence.

### Pneumococcal resistance: the treatment challenge [^117KwNB4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review in vitro and in vivo information dealing with pneumococcal antibiotic resistance and provide a review of the incidence, mechanisms, and controversies surrounding this growing problem. The review is also intended to provide clinicians with relevant recommendations on treatment and prevention of this organism.

Data Sources and Selection

Primary and review articles were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-August 2000) and through secondary resources such as conference proceedings. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated, and all information deemed relevant was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

The growing incidence and reporting of pneumococcal isolates that are resistant to one or more classes of antibiotics have become a troubling trend that has resulted in significant shifts in treatment. Although clinicians have shifted to a new generation or class of antibiotics when faced with a resistance trend, data with resistant pneumococci show that this may not be necessary. By incorporating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of antimicrobials into the decision-making process, many of the drugs that we have become hesitant to use due to this resistance may still be appropriate if used correctly.

Conclusions

Appropriate dosing of antimicrobials, combined with optimal use of pneumococcal vaccines, will not only prolong the longevity of some agents, but also hopefully slow resistance development.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen. Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### Prospective observational study of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia: effect of discordant therapy on mortality [^1157tTLV]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the effect of discordant empirical therapy on outcome in bacteremic pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia.

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

A 600-bed teaching hospital with a reference area of 400,000 inhabitants.

Patients

All patients aged ≥ 18 yrs with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia whose blood cultures, obtained within the first 48 hrs of hospitalization, demonstrated growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae were included in the study.

Methods

Discordant therapy was defined as failure to administer an antibiotic with in vitro activity against the isolated strain within 24 hrs of hospital admission. The 2002 breakpoints recommended for respiratory infections by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards were used to classify therapy.

Results

A total of 100 patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia were identified. Penicillin- and macrolide-resistant strains were identified in 29 and 18 cases, respectively. Only two strains had minimum inhibitory concentrations of > 2 microg/mL for cephalosporins. Discordant therapy was documented in ten patients, five of whom died. Mortality in patients receiving concordant therapy was 14% (13 of 90). Nursing home residence (odds ratio [OR] = 14.8) and immunocompromise (OR = 11.5) were independently (p < .05) associated with discordant therapy. Risk of discordant therapy was significantly higher (p < .05) when empirical therapy did not include cefotaxime or ceftriaxone (OR = 10.4). Discordant therapy (OR = 27.3), multilobar involvement (OR = 14.2), underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.1), and hospitalization during the previous 12 wks (OR = 7.9) were independently associated (p < .05) with death. The excess mortality for initial discordant therapy was estimated to be 35.6% (95% confidence interval, 3.73–67.4).

Conclusions

Survival in patients with bacteremic community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia can be improved by avoiding suboptimal therapy. Using the 2002 breakpoints, it is very unlikely that discordant therapy would be given with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. Clinical outcome is worse in those patients receiving antimicrobial therapy that in vitro testing suggests would be ineffective.

### Increased β-lactams dosing regimens improve clinical outcome in critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance treated for a first episode of hospital or ventilator-acquired pneumonia: a before and after study [^1149DoGs]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Our antibiotic therapy protocol was thus in accordance with previous studies which suggested that higher than licensed dosing regimens would be necessary in patients with ARC. Piperacillin-tazobactam has been the most studied antibiotic in this context, where previous studies demonstrated that standard intermittent dosing regimens were unlikely to achieve optimal antibiotic exposure. Although other studies suggested a significant improvement of PK/PD target attainment rates when extended or continuous infusions are used, patients with CL CR ≥ 150–170 ml/min remained at risk for empirical underexposure. In this context, higher than licensed doses of piperacillin-tazobactam (20 g/2.5 g/day by continuous infusion) allowed attaining the empirical PK/PD target in 100% patients with CL CR ≥ 150 ml/min, without excessive dosing.

Data on other β-lactams in patients with ARC are scarce. For ceftriaxone, we previously demonstrated high rates of empirical target underdosing in patients with CL CR ≥ 150 ml/min. In this context, Monte Carlo simulations suggested a dose of 2 g twice a day to achieve a 100% fT > MIC when targeting a theoretical MIC at the upper limit of the susceptibility range. Dosing simulations for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid also supported the use of increased dosing regimens (2 g four times daily) for ARC patients when using a target MIC of 8 mg/l and a pharmacodynamic target of 50% fT > MIC, with little accumulation of clavulanic acid. Considering cefazolin, only an ancillary pilot study suggested a higher rate of underdosing in ARC patients, especially when PK/PD targets were adjusted to the inoculum effect.

### Clinical implications and treatment of multiresistant Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia [^112LitVN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading bacterial cause of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Prior to the 1970s this pathogen was uniformly susceptible to penicillin and most other antimicrobials. However, since the 1990s there has been a significant increase in drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) due, in large part, to increased use of antimicrobials. The clinical significance of this resistance is not definitely established, but appears to be most relevant to specific MICs for specific antimicrobials. Certain beta-lactams (amoxicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), the respiratory fluoroquinolones, and telithromycin are among several agents that remain effective against DRSP. Continued surveillance studies, appropriate antimicrobial usage campaigns, stratification of patients based on known risk factors for resistance, and vaccination programmes are needed to appropriately manage DRSP and limit its spread.

### Ceftaroline fosamil versus ceftriaxone for the treatment of Asian patients with community-acquired pneumonia: a randomised, controlled, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority with nested superiority trial [^115b249w]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Ceftriaxone with or without a macrolide antibiotic is a recommended treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospital admission and intravenous antibiotic treatment. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline fosamil compared with ceftriaxone in the treatment of Asian patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

In this international, randomised, controlled, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority with nested superiority trial, adult Asian patients with Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class III-IV acute community-acquired pneumonia were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ceftaroline fosamil (600 mg every 12 h) or ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 h) for 5–7 days. Patients were randomly assigned via centralised telephone and web-based system; patients and treating clinicians were masked to treatment allocation. Investigators who did study assessments remained masked to treatment allocation until completion of the study. The primary endpoint was clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit (8–15 days after last dose of study drug) in the clinically evaluable population. Non-inferiority of ceftaroline fosamil was defined as a lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the proportion of patients clinically cured of -10% or higher; if non-inferiority was achieved, superiority was to be concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 0%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01371838.

Findings

Between Dec 13, 2011, and April 26, 2013, 847 patients were enrolled at 64 centres in China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, of whom 771 were randomly assigned and 764 received study treatment. In the clinically evaluable population (n = 498) 217 (84%) of 258 patients in the ceftaroline fosamil group and 178 (74%) of 240 patients in the ceftriaxone group were clinically cured at the test-of-cure visit (difference 9·9%, 95% CI 2·8–17·1). The superiority of ceftaroline fosamil was consistent across all preplanned patient subgroup analyses (split by age 65 years, age 75 years, sex, PORT risk class, and previous antibiotic use) apart from patients younger than 65 years. The frequency of adverse events was similar between treatment groups and the safety results for ceftaroline fosamil were consistent with the cephalosporin class and previous clinical trial data.

Interpretation

Ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg given every 12 h was superior to ceftriaxone 2 g given every 24 h for the treatment of Asian patients with PORT III-IV community-acquired pneumonia. These data suggest that ceftaroline fosamil should be regarded as an alternative to ceftriaxone in empirical treatment regimens for this patient population.

### Increased β-lactams dosing regimens improve clinical outcome in critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance treated for a first episode of hospital or ventilator-acquired pneumonia: a before and after study [^1132XXKh]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Standard dosing regimens of documented β-lactam antibiotic therapy were cefazolin (100 mg/kg/day continuously after a loading dose of 2 g), amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2 g q 8 h), or third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone [2 g q 24 h] or cefotaxime [2 g q 8 h]). In the treatment period, patients who remained in ARC benefited from increased dosing regimens of documented β-lactam antibiotic therapy (cefazolin 150 mg/kg/day, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2 g q 6 h, ceftriaxone 2 g q 12 h, or cefotaxime 2 g q 6 h). A 7-day course was considered sufficient unless inadequate initial antibiotic therapy, bacteremia, immunosuppressive disease, or MDR pathogen.

The overall treatment of patients with HAP-VAP during the control and treatment periods was similar except for the antimicrobial dosing regimens. There were no known significant changes to our ICU protocols, ventilation or weaning procedures, or patient population during the study period.

Study endpoints

The primary endpoint was a composite criterion defined as a poor clinical outcome of the antimicrobial therapy, including therapeutic failure and HAP-VAP recurrence within 28 days and/or end-of-hospitalization.
Therapeutic failure was defined as an impaired clinical response (persistent or worsening symptoms of HAP-VAP) with the need for escalating empirical antimicrobial therapy. Inappropriate empirical treatment was not considered as therapeutic failure. De-escalation did not qualify as therapeutic failure. Superinfections due to new causative pathogens with natural resistance to the initial antimicrobial therapy were not considered as therapeutic failure.
Recurrence was defined by a second HAP-VAP with at least one of the initial causative bacterial strains growing at a significant concentration from a second sample after completing antibiotic therapy. Tracheobronchial colonization without evidence of pulmonary infection was not considered as HAP-VAP recurrence.

The primary outcome was assessed by one of the investigators (GC) based on clinical and microbiologic data. External validation was performed independently by at least two other investigators (CC, NS) blinded to the allocated period and antibiotic dosing regimen.

The secondary endpoints were the reported antibiotic side effects during treatment (cholestasis, cytolysis, delirium, seizure, renal failure), the secondary acquisition of antimicrobial resistance within 28 days and/or end-of-hospitalization, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the ICU, and the status (alive or dead) at discharge.

Empiric antibiotic coverage for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) — In patients with suspected VAP, we recommend including coverage for S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacilli in all empiric regimens (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest including an agent active against MRSA only when there is a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance, when units have > 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates methicillin resistant, or when MRSA prevalence is not known (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). We suggest including an agent active against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and not MRSA when patients lack risk factors for antimicrobial resistance and are treated in ICUs where < 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). If empiric coverage for MRSA is indicated, we recommend either vancomycin or linezolid (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). When empiric treatment should include MSSA coverage, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), noting that oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred for proven MSSA but are not necessary for empiric VAP if one of the above agents is used.

### Re-evaluation of penicillin and ceftriaxone MIC results to predict susceptibility to the oral cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, inclinical isolates from the United States according to CLSI guidelines (2019–2021) [^112zpHkL]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100Ed24 (2024) states that Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptible to oral penicillin can be considered susceptible to various β-lactams, including oral cephalosporins. However, surrogacy guidance is not available for isolates nonsusceptible to oral penicillin. Instead, such isolates require specific MIC testing and interpretations for reporting susceptibility to oral cephalosporins, for which susceptibility testing is limited in most automated systems, and consequently restricts information pertaining to oral cephalosporins at an individual institution. This study evaluated the ability of the penicillin breakpoints to predict cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone susceptibilities against a recent collection of S. pneumoniae from United States hospitals according to CLSI guidelines. The susceptible breakpoint for oral penicillin (≤ 0.06 mg/L) predicted susceptibility to cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone. However, when isolates were nonsusceptible to oral penicillin (MIC, > 0.06 mg/L), susceptibility to cefpodoxime could not be predicted due to a low categorical agreement (CA) (78.4%). Parenteral penicillin breakpoints also could not predict cefpodoxime susceptibility due to the elevated number of very major errors and a CA of 76.8%; however, these breakpoints could still be used as a surrogate marker to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility. Finally, ceftriaxone could be used for surrogate testing of cefpodoxime by applying breakpoints (≤ 0.25 mg/L for susceptible; 0.5 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 1 mg/L for resistant) lower than the current clinical cutoffs. These analyses showed that isolates nonsusceptible to oral penicillin cannot be considered susceptible to cefpodoxime, and caution should be used when prescribing oral cephalosporins for the empiric treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

IMPORTANCE

Susceptibility results to oral cephalosporins are rarely available to guide therapy due to the limited number of drugs evaluated on common automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) systems (i.e. Vitek 2, MicroScan, and Phoenix). In addition, disk diffusion methods for determining Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptibility to β-lactam agents are not reliable, and a quantitative method, such as broth microdilution or gradient strips, is required. In addition, the epidemiology and serotypes of S. pneumoniae are constantly evolving; therefore, this work provides a re-evaluation of surrogacy testing for β-lactam agents against S. pneumoniae recently recovered from United States laboratories. The data provide the possible use of ceftriaxone MIC for determining cefpodoxime susceptibility. This should be of interest to microbiology laboratories and the scientific community.

### Overview of newer antimicrobial formulations for overcoming pneumococcal resistance [^1116Ukz9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of an antimicrobial agent provides important information that can be used to maximize bacteriologic and clinical efficacy, minimize selective pressure for the development of antimicrobial resistance, and determine an optimal dosing regimen. Judicious selection of an antimicrobial based on local susceptibility data and PK and PD parameters is imperative in this era of increasing resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. The beta-lactam antimicrobials display time-dependent bacterial killing with minimal to no persistent effects. Ketolides and fluoroquinolones display concentration-dependent bacterial killing, and tetracyclines and macrolides display time-dependent killing. All have prolonged persistent effects (e.g., postantibiotic effect) that retard or prevent bacterial regrowth when free drug levels fall below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). New high-dose and/or extended-release formulations of traditional antimicrobials have been added to the current armamentarium for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. These formulations include amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension 90/6.4 mg/kg per day divided every 12 hours (Augmentin ES-600; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium extended-release tablets 2 x 1,000 mg/62.5 mg every 12 hours (Augmentin XR; GlaxoSmithKline), clarithromycin extended-release tablets 2 x 500 mg once daily (Biaxin XL; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and cefaclor extended-release tablets 375 mg or 500 mg every 12 hours (Ceclor CD; Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis, IN). Of these agents, only amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium extended-release tablets were designed to treat infections caused by penicillin-resistant pneumococci (penicillin MIC ≤ 2 microg/mL). Extended-release clarithromycin does not provide higher daily doses than its immediate-release counterpart; rather, it allows for once-daily dosing of this agent because of its slower absorption following oral administration. Extended-release cefaclor is considered clinically equivalent to 250 mg of immediate-release cefaclor pulvules administered 3 times daily; it cannot be used interchangeably with 500 mg 3-times-daily dosages of other cefaclor formulations. Thus, despite providing a similar or higher total daily dose than its immediate-release counterpart, extended-release cefaclor is indicated only for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of certain organisms.

### Does the dose matter? [^116ZouMW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters, such as the ratio of peak to minimum inhibitory concentration (peak/MIC ratio), ratio of 24-hour area under the curve to MIC (24-h AUC/MIC ratio), and the time above MIC, are good indicators of the drug dose-organism interaction. Time above the MIC is the important determinant of the activity of beta-lactams, macrolides, clindamycin, and linezolid. Free drug serum levels of these drugs should be above the MIC for at least 40%-50% of the dosing interval to produce adequate clinical and microbiological efficacy. Peak/MIC and 24-h AUC/MIC ratios are major determinants of the activity of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. In general, peak/MIC ratios should exceed 8 and 24-h AUC/MIC values should be > 100 to successfully treat gram-negative bacillary infections and to prevent the emergence of resistant organisms during therapy. The successful treatment of pneumococcal infections with fluoroquinolones and azithromycin appear to require 24-h AUC/MIC ratios of only 25–35. Mutation prevention concentrations are being reported for various fluoroquinolones with different pathogens, but their clinical significance has not yet been established. More information is needed on the role of PK/PD parameters and their magnitude for preventing mutations and the emergence of resistant organisms for most classes of antibiotics.

### Atypical pathogens and challenges in community-acquired pneumonia [^1152MwK6]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are implicated in up to 40 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic treatment is empiric and includes coverage for both typical and atypical organisms. Doxycycline, a fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, or a macrolide is appropriate for outpatient treatment of immunocompetent adult patients. Hospitalized adults should be treated with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone plus a macrolide, or with a fluoroquinolone alone. The same agents can be used in adult patients in intensive care units, although fluoroquinolone monotherapy is not recommended; ampicillin-sulbactam or piperacillin-tazobactam can be used instead of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. Outpatient treatment of children two months to five years of age consists of high-dose amoxicillin given for seven to 10 days. A single dose of ceftriaxone can be used in infants when the first dose of antibiotic is likely to be delayed or not absorbed. Older children can be treated with a macrolide. Hospitalized children should be treated with a macrolide plus a beta-lactam inhibitor. In a bioterrorist attack, pulmonary illness may result from the organisms that cause anthrax, plague, or tularemia. Sudden acute respiratory syndrome begins with a flu-like illness, followed two to seven days later by cough, dyspnea and, in some instances, acute respiratory distress.

### The hidden impact of antibacterial resistance in respiratory tract infection. Re-evaluating current antibiotic therapy [^114M6jCd]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters derived from animal and clinical models of infection are used to predict bacteriological efficacy. Growing evidence from the clinical setting supports the validity of these parameters in guiding antimicrobial therapy. For example, in otitis media and sinusitis, high bacteriological cure rates are obtained when serum concentrations of beta-lactams and macrolides exceed the MIC of the infecting pathogen for at least 40% of the dosing interval. Likewise, the 24-hour AUC/MIC ratio is a good predictor of both bacteriological and clinical efficacy for azithromycin in otitis media and fluoroquinolones in bacterial pneumonia. The value of PK/PD relationships has been recognized by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) as another important factor to consider when establishing susceptibility breakpoints. Recent changes to NCCLS breakpoints for oral beta-lactams for Streptococcus pneumoniae reflect this. Also, PK/PD parameters may play a role in predicting the impact of an antibiotic on the development and spread of resistant organisms. In an era of increasing resistance, we should select agents and doses that provide drug concentrations that exceed the magnitude of the PK/PD parameter required both for efficacy and to combat the emergence and spread of bacterial resistance.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^1155Vw1L]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media — alternative initial antibiotics and comparative in vitro activity: Alternative initial antibiotics include cefdinir (14 mg/kg per day in 1 or 2 doses), cefuroxime (30 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses), cefpodoxime (10 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses), or ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, administered intramuscularly). Alternative antibiotics vary in their efficacy against AOM pathogens, with in vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to cefdinir and cefuroxime 70% to 80% compared with 84% to 92% for amoxicillin, and in vitro efficacy against Haemophilus influenzae approximately 98% for cefdinir and cefuroxime compared with 58% for amoxicillin and nearly 100% for amoxicillin-clavulanate; additionally, cefdinir, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone are highly unlikely to be associated with cross-reactivity with penicillin allergy.

Pediatric HIV — bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumoniae; occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) treatment includes the following regimens: First choice options are amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management; ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL); or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternatives are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate, if available. For children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). Add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected (base the choice on local susceptibility patterns). For patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease. Evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

Applying PK/PD Analyses to Doses and Breakpoints

Many existing in vitro MIC susceptibility breakpoints were established both for epidemiologic surveillance and to guide therapy in individual persons. Accumulating evidence supports the use of separate breakpoints for these purposes.

PK/PD data may aid the selection of clinical breakpoints. PK/PD breakpoints represent the highest MIC for which the unbound plasma concentrations of the antimicrobial drug (following standard doses) are sufficient to achieve the PK/PD target against a defined organism and for which adequate clinical data support their use (Figure 3). PK/PD targets are usually derived in vivo by using susceptible strains. The targets for strains with certain resistance mechanisms may differ. However, in several cases, studies have verified that these PK/PD targets apply in less susceptible strains.

Figure 3
Relationship between MIC and attainment of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target for effect. Accumulating evidence supports the use of separate PK/PD breakpoints for clinical decision making, distinct from in vitro breakpoints used for epidemiologic surveillance. A breakpoint derived from PK/PD data represents the highest MIC for which the unbound plasma concentrations of the drug (after standard doses) are sufficient to achieve the target PK/PD exposure.

The effects of variability within populations on attaining PK/PD targets can be probed by using Monte Carlo simulation of numerous drug exposures. The fraction of exposures that attain the PK/PD target can be determined across the MIC range of the pathogen and used to help select MIC breakpoints. The optimal dose can also be selected by analyzing PK/PD target attainment rates for fixed doses across the MIC range.

Clinical breakpoints may differ substantially from in vitro MIC breakpoints (Figure 3). In 2000, the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards revised the recommended MIC breakpoints for oral β-lactams against Streptococcus pneumoniae in light of clinical and PK/PD data. PK/PD analyses have recently been applied to other breakpoint determinations. Controlled trials regarding the clinical relevance of discrepancies between current and proposed breakpoints are unavailable. However, case reports indicate a potential increase in treatment failures with some drug classes (and a potential failure to detect these mechanisms with reference microbiologic methods) and suggest the need for better clinical data to reassess susceptibility breakpoints for these agents.

We may also have to challenge the paradigm that interprets breakpoints as dichotomous variables associated with categoric responses such as success and failure. Reductions in susceptibility have graded effects and should instead be interpreted in terms of a reduced relative likelihood of positive outcomes.

### Using antibiotics wisely [^112DpcPo]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will describe role of shorter antibiotic therapies, early switch from intravenous to oral therapy, and artificial intelligence in infectious diseases.

Recent Findings

There is evidence that shorter courses of antibiotics are noninferior to standard durations of therapy. This has been demonstrated with Enterobacterales bacteremia that can be treated with 7days of therapy, community acquired pneumonia with 3days and ventilator associated pneumonia with just 7days of antibiotic therapy. The conversion from intravenous to oral therapy in treating bacteremia, endocarditis and bone and joint infections is safe and effective and reduces line complications and costs. Also, for clean surgical procedures only one dose of antibiotic is needed, but it should be the most effective antibiotic which is cefazolin. This means avoiding clindamycin, removing penicillin allergies where possible for improved outcomes. Finally, the role of artificial intelligence to incorporate into using antibiotics wisely is rapidly emerging but is still in early stages.

Summary

In using antibiotics wisely, targeting such as durations of therapy and conversion from intravenous antibiotic therapy to oral are low hanging fruit. The future of artificial intelligence could automate a lot of this work and is exciting but needs to be proven.

### International consensus recommendations for the use of prolonged-infusion β-lactam antibiotics: endorsed by the American college of clinical pharmacy, British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^113xoNGZ]. Pharmacotherapy (2023). High credibility.

Obesity and β-lactam infusion strategies — summary and research needs: Based on population PK studies and simulations, PI may overcome some of the effects of body weight on β-lactam concentrations, and for gastric bypass prophylaxis, use of CI with larger cefazolin doses (> 2 g) may help ensure adequate tissue concentrations; however, no studies demonstrate the superiority of PI versus SI β-lactam dosing in obese patients regarding clinical outcomes. The authors note that the use of PIs may be a reliable approach to improve fT > MIC and ensure adequate serum concentrations in obese patients, but larger-than-standard doses are often also needed.

### Clinical efficacy of newer agents in short-duration therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^111prQpn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most important respiratory tract pathogen implicated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), is becoming increasingly resistant in vitro to the beta -lactams and macrolides, and fluoroquinolone resistance has been detected. A growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged antimicrobial use may contribute directly and indirectly to increased antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Long-term exposure to antimicrobial agents, especially less-potent agents, directly increases selection pressure for resistance. Indirectly, poor patient compliance, multiple daily dosing, and the increased risk of adverse events further complicate the resistance issue and diminish the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial use. Controlled clinical trials addressing the appropriate duration of therapy for CAP are lacking. However, available data suggest that with appropriate antibiotic selection, based on appropriate spectrum, potency, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, lower respiratory tract infections in outpatients can be successfully treated in < 7 days rather than the 7–14 days currently recommended.

### A comparison of cefditoren pivoxil and amoxicillin / clavulanate in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: a multicenter, prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel-group study [^114KdfwQ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Cefditoren pivoxil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that is approved for the treatment of pharyngitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and skin and skin-structure infections.

Objective

This study was conducted to examine the efficacy and tolerability of cefditoren in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Amoxicillin/clavulanate was chosen as a comparator because of its established efficacy and general acceptance as a standard of care in CAP.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel-group trial compared oral cefditoren 200 and 400 mg BID with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg BID for 14 days in adult outpatients with CAP.

Results

Eight hundred two patients (404 men, 398 women; mean age, 50 years; age range, 12–93 years) with CAP were enrolled. Comparable clinical cure rates were observed among evaluable patients in all treatment groups at both the posttreatment and follow-up visits: 88.0% (125/142) for cefditoren 200 mg, 89.9% (143/159) for cefditoren 400 mg, and 90.3% (130/144) for amoxicillin/clavulanate at the posttreatment visit, and 86.5% (128/148), 86.8% (138/159), and 87.8% (129/147) for the respective groups at the follow-up visit. Of 82 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated before treatment, 22 (26.8%) had reduced susceptibility to penicillin, 12 (14.6%) of them penicillin resistant. Overall eradication rates at the posttreatment visit for pathogens isolated from microbiologically evaluable patients were 84.0%, 88.6%, and 82.6% for cefditoren 200 mg, cefditoren 400 mg, and amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively. In the respective treatment groups, 80.6%, 88.6%, and 88.0% of Haemophilus influenzae strains and 95.0%, 96.2%, and 89.5% of S pneumoniae strains were eradicated. The rates of resolution of or improvement in clinical signs and symptoms were comparable between treatment groups. The treatment regimens were well tolerated, with 4.9%, 3.0%, and 5.2% of patients in the respective treatment groups requiring discontinuation of study drug due to an adverse event.

Conclusions

In this study in adult outpatients with CAP, both doses of cefditoren demonstrated equivalence to amoxicillin/clavulanate based on rates of clinical and microbiologic cure. All 3 regimens were effective in resolving or improving the clinical signs and symptoms of CAP. Both cefditoren and amoxicillin/ clavulanate were well tolerated.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^11737JPS]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What to do with antibiotic therapy?

There is no RCT data to guide the therapeutic approach to a non-responding patient. Clinicians must therefore rely heavily on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. If review of the relevant clinical data suggests an alternative diagnosis or pathogen or antimicrobial resistance profile, modifications of antibiotic therapy may be needed and can be divided into verification of adequate dosing, escalation of therapy to cover MDR pathogens, or addition of agents from a different antimicrobial class to cover atypical or non-bacterial organisms.

Worsening bacterial infection due to inappropriate antibiotic coverage could occur if the offending organism was resistant to the initial antibiotic choice, if it was originally susceptible but there was emergence of resistance during therapy, or if the antibiotic chosen did not reach the lung parenchyma with adequate concentrations. Risk factors for resistant infections at baseline differ based on the type of organism, therefore assessment of individual epidemiologic and clinical risk factors is critical. For instance, ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococcus is uncommon in the United States (US) but more prevalent in Taiwan and South Korea; risk factors include extensive previous treatment with antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. Because high-doses of beta-lactams are used to treat CAP in the US, it is unlikely that the presence of ceftriaxone-resistance would lead to failure of treatment of pneumonia. On the other hand, the use of bactericidal vs bacteriostatic antibiotics is not a risk factor for non-response. This was borne out in a recent meta-analysis of 42 studies that found no difference in clinical cure rates between patients treated with bactericidal vs bacteriostatic agents.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in casualty: etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management (or a look at the "new" in pneumonia since 2002) [^114BR9op]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia, because of its substantial treatment costs, incidence, and mortality, is an aggressively researched diagnosis. In this review, we highlight new developments in the diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia published since April 2002.

Recent Findings

The combined end points of improved patient care and conservation of health care resources have prompted several studies examining current professional society community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. In general, patients treated with the recommended third-generation cephalosporin and macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone when indicated have fared better, including reduced overall costs, inpatient days, and mortality, than those receiving alternative treatments. Etiologic identification efforts by traditional methods, blood and sputum cultures, are being questioned owing to poor success rates and, even when positive, are being underused or ignored in antibiotic selection and patient management. Newer diagnostic tests are becoming commercially available, along with tests for biologic markers that have been only recently identified as contributors to, or prognosticators of, community-acquired pneumonia. Because antibiotic resistance remains a major obstacle to successful patient treatment, prevention or mitigation of community-acquired pneumonia is gaining increasing popularity through more aggressive pneumococcal and influenza vaccination of at risk groups, even before hospital discharge from a community-acquired pneumonia admission.

Summary

Although prevention is our best defense, current community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines are effective for treatment and cost containment. However, they should be scrutinized in light of clinical utilization data now entering the literature regarding their testing recommendations. Providers should consider encouraging focused culturing of sicker patients and those with significant comorbidities.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pathogen-specific antimicrobial considerations for pediatric acute bacterial arthritis include that for oral therapy of CA-MRSA ABA, clindamycin is the preferred agent for susceptible MRSA strains and limited data exist for linezolid, TMP/SMX, doxycycline, or minocycline; K. kingae is generally susceptible to penicillins (with the notable exception of anti-staphylococcal penicillins), cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and TMP/SMX, while strains are resistant to kanamycin and often resistant to clindamycin and linezolid; for penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates and S. pyogenes, penicillin or ampicillin are the preferred parenteral beta-lactam agents, with phenoxymethyl penicillin or amoxicillin for oral therapy; for pneumococci reported as penicillin-non-susceptible, high dose parenteral penicillin has been used for pneumococcal pneumonia with penicillin MICs as high as 8.0 μg/mL, and for oral treatment pneumococci with a penicillin or ampicillin MIC < 2 mg/L are considered susceptible for the treatment of ABA, while cefotaxime/ceftriaxone should be effective if the pneumococcal isolate is reported as susceptible by the laboratory (MIC ≤ 1 mcg/ml for infections other than meningitis) but is much broader spectrum than penicillin or amoxicillin; in vitro testing may reveal additional options including clindamycin, linezolid, ceftaroline, levofloxacin, or daptomycin, and five of 24 pneumococcal isolates (21%) from children with osteoarticular infections from 2010 through 2015 in a single center study were resistant to clindamycin; Hib is now a rare etiology where Hib conjugate vaccines are routine, but invasive disease continues, beta-lactamase positivity varies, parenteral ampicillin may be used for beta-lactamase negative strains, parenteral second (cefuroxime) or third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime/ceftriaxone/cefixime) may be used as alternatives or for beta-lactamase producing isolates, for oral convalescent therapy for beta-lactamase negative strains amoxicillin should be used, and oral second (cefuroxime) and third generation cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefditoren) or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate) should provide effective.

Bacterial pneumonia treatment — first-choice options for S. pneumoniae (occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) include amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management, ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL), or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternative parenteral options are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate; for children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day), and add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae).

### Re-evaluation of penicillin and ceftriaxone MIC results to predict susceptibility to the oral cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, inclinical isolates from the United States according to CLSI guidelines (2019–2021) [^113WvA8F]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100Ed24 (2024) states that Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptible to oral penicillin can be considered susceptible to various β-lactams, including oral cephalosporins. However, surrogacy guidance is not available for isolates nonsusceptible to oral penicillin. Instead, such isolates require specific MIC testing and interpretations for reporting susceptibility to oral cephalosporins, for which susceptibility testing is limited in most automated systems, and consequently restricts information pertaining to oral cephalosporins at an individual institution. This study evaluated the ability of the penicillin breakpoints to predict cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone susceptibilities against a recent collection of S. pneumoniae from United States hospitals according to CLSI guidelines. The susceptible breakpoint for oral penicillin (≤ 0.06 mg/L) predicted susceptibility to cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone. However, when isolates were nonsusceptible to oral penicillin (MIC, > 0.06 mg/L), susceptibility to cefpodoxime could not be predicted due to a low categorical agreement (CA) (78.4%). Parenteral penicillin breakpoints also could not predict cefpodoxime susceptibility due to the elevated number of very major errors and a CA of 76.8%; however, these breakpoints could still be used as a surrogate marker to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility. Finally, ceftriaxone could be used for surrogate testing of cefpodoxime by applying breakpoints (≤ 0.25 mg/L for susceptible; 0.5 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 1 mg/L for resistant) lower than the current clinical cutoffs. These analyses showed that isolates nonsusceptible to oral penicillin cannot be considered susceptible to cefpodoxime, and caution should be used when prescribing oral cephalosporins for the empiric treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. IMPORTANCESusceptibility results to oral cephalosporins are rarely available to guide therapy due to the limited number of drugs evaluated on common automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) systems (i.e. Vitek 2, MicroScan, and Phoenix). In addition, disk diffusion methods for determining Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptibility to β-lactam agents are not reliable, and a quantitative method, such as broth microdilution or gradient strips, is required. In addition, the epidemiology and serotypes of S. pneumoniae are constantly evolving; therefore, this work provides a re-evaluation of surrogacy testing for β-lactam agents against S. pneumoniae recently recovered from United States laboratories. The data provide the possible use of ceftriaxone MIC for determining cefpodoxime susceptibility. This should be of interest to microbiology laboratories and the scientific community.

### Β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: a dose-response meta-analysis [^114gWn56]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Patient exposure to antibiotics promotes the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. The aim of this study was to identify whether the temporal dynamics of resistance emergence at the individual-patient level were predictable for specific pathogen-drug classes.

Methods

Following a systematic review, a novel robust error meta-regression method for dose-response meta-analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for carrying resistant bacteria during and following treatment compared to baseline. Probability density functions fitted to the resulting dose-response curves were then used to optimize the period during and/or after treatment when resistant pathogens were most likely to be identified.

Results

Studies of Streptococcus pneumoniae treatment with β-lactam antibiotics demonstrated a peak in resistance prevalence among patients 4 days after completing treatment with a 3.32-fold increase in odds (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71–6.46). Resistance waned more gradually than it emerged, returning to preexposure levels 1 month after treatment (OR, 0.98 [95% CI,.55–1.75]). Patient isolation during the peak dose-response period would be expected to reduce the risk that a transmitted pathogen is resistant equivalently to a 50% longer isolation window timed from the first day of treatment.

Conclusions

Predictable temporal dynamics of resistance levels have implications both for surveillance and control.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

This product is intended for intravenous administration only.

Dosage:

Adults:

The usual adult dosage range for cefuroxime is 750 mg to 1.5 grams every 8 hours, usually for 5 to 10 days. In uncomplicated urinary tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, disseminated gonococcal infections, and uncomplicated pneumonia, a 750 mg dose every 8 hours is recommended. In severe or complicated infections, a 1.5 gram dose every 8 hours is recommended.

In bone and joint infections, a 1.5 gram dose every 8 hours is recommended. In clinical trials, surgical intervention was performed when indicated as an adjunct to cefuroxime therapy. A course of oral antibacterials was administered when appropriate following the completion of parenteral administration of cefuroxime.

In life-threatening infections or infections due to less susceptible organisms, 1.5 grams every 6 hours may be required. In bacterial meningitis, the dosage should not exceed 3 grams every 8 hours. For preventive use for clean-contaminated or potentially contaminated surgical procedures, a 1.5 gram dose administered intravenously just before surgery (approximately one-half to 1 hour before the initial incision) is recommended. Thereafter, give 750 mg intravenously every 8 hours when the procedure is prolonged.

For preventive use during open heart surgery, a 1.5 gram dose administered intravenously at the induction of anesthesia and every 12 hours thereafter for a total of 6 grams is recommended.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefazolin and other antibacterial drugs, cefazolin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Cefazolin for Injection is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible bacteria.

1.1 Respiratory Tract Infections

Respiratory tract infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.

Injectable benzathine penicillin is considered the drug of choice in treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever.

Cefazolin is effective in the eradication of streptococci from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of cefazolin in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available.

### Ceftizoxime (Cefizox) [^1148eMYZ]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Cefizox has also been used successfully in the treatment of a limited number of pediatric and adult cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Cefizox has been effective in the treatment of seriously ill, compromised patients, including those who were debilitated, immunosuppressed, or neutropenic.

Infections caused by aerobic gram‐negative and by mixtures of organisms resistant to other cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or penicillins have responded to treatment with Cefizox.

Because of the serious nature of some urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt.

Susceptibility studies on specimens obtained prior to therapy should be used to determine the response of causative organisms to Cefizox. Therapy with Cefizox may be initiated pending results of the studies; however, treatment should be adjusted according to study findings. In serious infections, Cefizox has been used concomitantly with aminoglycosides (see PRECAUTIONS). Before using Cefizox concomitantly with other antibiotics, the prescribing information for those agents should be reviewed for contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions. Renal function should be carefully monitored.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefizox and other antibacterial drugs, Cefizox should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### The effect of cephalosporin resistance on mortality in adult patients with nonmeningeal systemic pneumococcal infections [^111hDowj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the clinical relevance of cephalosporin (ceftriaxone/cefotaxime) resistance among patients with nonmeningeal systemic pneumococcal infection.

Subjects and Methods

From January 1994 to October 2000, we prospectively studied 522 episodes of nonmeningeal systemic pneumococcal infections (448 pneumonias) in 499 adults who were treated according to hospital guidelines. In vitro antibiotic susceptibility, as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), was determined by microdilution method. The MIC methods and breakpoints (cutoffs) were established by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards.

Results

Of the 522 pneumococcal strains, 413 strains (79%) were susceptible to ceftriaxone/cefotaxime, MIC ≤ 0.5 microg/mL; 79 (15%) were intermediate, MIC = 1 microg/mL; and 30 (6%) were resistant, MIC = 2 microg/mL. After adjusting for several variables, including pneumococcal serogroups/serotypes, infections due to nonsusceptible (intermediate and resistant) pneumococcal strains were independently associated with prior antibiotic therapy, with an odds ratio of 5.9 (95% confidence interval: 2.6 to 13.6). Thirty-day mortality among the 185 patients who were treated with ceftriaxone (1 g/d) or cefotaxime (1.5 g every 8 hours) did not differ by cephalosporin susceptibility: 18% (26/148) among those with susceptible organisms, 13% (3/24) with intermediate organisms, and 15% (2/13) in resistant cases (P = 0.81).

Conclusion

Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime were effective in treating patients with nonmeningeal systemic pneumococcal infections caused by strains with MIC ≤ 2 microg/mL. These results support the newly established ceftriaxone/cefotaxime MIC breakpoints (cutoffs) for nonmeningeal pneumococcal infections.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — MSSA-directed empiric and targeted therapy: Patients with HAP who have no risk factors for either MRSA infection or a poor clinical outcome may receive an empiric regimen that includes an antibiotic targeting MSSA. Some agents used for HAP due to activity against P. aeruginosa and gram-negative bacilli are also suitable for empiric MSSA coverage — these include piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, and meropenem — and an empiric regimen that includes one of these does not require an additional MSSA agent. If infection with MSSA alone is confirmed, oxacillin, nafcillin, and cefazolin are narrow-spectrum intravenous antibiotics that are optimal for treating MSSA.

### A phase 3, randomized, investigator-blinded trial comparing ceftobiprole with a standard-of-care cephalosporin, with or without vancomycin, for the treatment of pneumonia in pediatric patients [^112aJY4C]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment phase was at least 7 days, with possible extension to 14 days. Ceftobiprole was administered IV every 8 hours, age-adjusted for dose (maximum, 500 mg per dose and 1500 mg daily) and infusion duration, as follows: 20 mg/kg administered over 4 hours in patients 3 months to < 2 years of age, 20 mg/kg over 2 hours in patients 2 years to < 6 years of age, 15 mg/kg over 2 hours in patients 6 years to < 12 years of age and 10 mg/kg over 2 hours in patients 12 years to < 18 years of age. These dosing regimens were selected based on the level of ceftobiprole drug exposure shown to be effective in treating HAP and CAP in adults, pharmacokinetic and safety data from a previous single-dose study in patients 3 months to < 18 years of age, the adverse event (AE) profile of ceftobiprole in adults, results of a toxicity study in juvenile animals and pharmacokinetic modeling data. Regarding the comparator cephalosporins, ceftazidime was administered at 50 mg/kg as an IV infusion every 8 hours, up to a maximum dose of 6 g/d. Ceftriaxone was administered at 50–80 mg/kg as a single 0.5-hour daily IV infusion, up to a maximum dose of 2 g/d. Dose modifications of ceftobiprole and the comparator cephalosporin antibiotics were not permitted.

Streptococcus pneumoniae infective endocarditis — four weeks of antimicrobial therapy with penicillin, cefazolin, or ceftriaxone is reasonable for IE caused by S pneumoniae; vancomycin can be useful for patients intolerant of β-lactam therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C), and six weeks of therapy is reasonable for PVE caused by S pneumoniae (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). High-dose penicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin is reasonable in patients with penicillin-resistant IE without meningitis, in patients with IE and meningitis high doses of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone are reasonable, and if the isolate is resistant (MIC ≥ 2 μg/mL) to cefotaxime, then the addition of vancomycin and rifampin may be considered.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

Data Extraction

The data extraction was done by M. G. and L. F.-K. using an Excel spreadsheet; in case of discrepancies, L. Y. was consulted. The following items were extracted from the studies: Authors and year of publication; patient characteristics (eg, symptomatic or asymptomatic patients, age, proportion of females); study characteristics (eg, study design, recruitment location, duration of study/follow-up); antibiotic exposure (eg, antibiotic class, duration of antibiotic therapy); and bacterial infection (eg, type of bacteria, number of antibiotic-resistant isolates at different time points).

Some studies reported their case counts relative to the total included patients (pathogen carriers and noncarriers) and others to the respective pathogen carriers. Here, only data from participants carrying pathogens were retained in order to describe the burden of resistance among those with infections. In addition, some studies provided data for resistance against multiple antibiotic classes after treatment, but only studies reporting resistance to the treatment antibiotic (so-called primary resistance) were retained.

All antibiotic drugs were classified according to their respective chemical structure. Combined treatments were classified by their active agent in case of an antibiotic and nonantibiotic combination (eg, amoxicillin-clavulanate classified as β-lactam). An antibiotic combination was treated as its own class. Studies that were randomized by design but had data extracted from each arm separately were reclassified as prospective repeated-measures cohort studies (more details in Table 1), as proposed by Bakhit et al.

Risk of Bias Assessment

The risk of bias assessment was performed by M. G. using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2.0 for RCTs and Risk of Bias in Nonrandomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) for nonrandomized studies. To evaluate the risk of bias for cohort studies and longitudinal data, the adapted version developed by Bakhit et al of the ROBINS-I for 3 domains (confounding, missing data, and outcomes) was used (Supplementary Material 2).

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1141Lu6A]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized patients with HIV — non-severe disease — has a recommendation that remains to administer either a beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, or a single drug regimen of a respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI). Monotherapy with a macrolide is not recommended in the inpatient setting, and preferred agents are specified (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; azithromycin or clarithromycin; moxifloxacin or levofloxacin). If a patient has contraindications to a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone, then doxycycline should be given as an alternative (BIII) in addition to a beta-lactam, and IV penicillin is an acceptable option for treatment of pneumococcal disease in patients with HIV (BIII). In patients who are allergic to penicillin, an IV respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg/day]) alone should be used (AI), and fluoroquinolone monotherapy should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but who are not being treated with concurrent standard four-drug TB therapy.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Table 3 — bacterial pneumonia in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children — first-choice parenteral therapy includes ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day), or cefotaxime 40–50 mg/kg body weight per dose 4 times daily, or 50–65 mg/kg body weight 3 times daily (max 8–10 g/day) IV; an alternative is cefuroxime, 35–50 mg/ kg body weight per dose 3 times daily (max 4–6 g/ day) IV. For children who are receiving effective cART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other community-acquired pneumonia pathogens, add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected, and for patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease, and evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

### Ceftibuten dihydrate (Cedax) [^112SSM77]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Dilution Techniques

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth, agar, or microdilution) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ceftibuten powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria when testing Haemophilus species using Haemophilus Test Media (HTM):

The current absence of resistant strains precludes defining any categories other than "Susceptible". Strains yielding results suggestive of a "Nonsusceptible" category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

A report of "Susceptible" implies that an infection due to the strain may be appropriately treated with the dosage of antimicrobial agent recommended for that type of infection and infecting species, unless otherwise contraindicated.

Ceftibuten is indicated for penicillin-susceptible only strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. A pneumococcal isolate that is susceptible to penicillin (MIC ≤ 0.06 µg/mL) can be considered susceptible to ceftibuten for approved indications. Testing of ceftibuten against penicillin-intermediate or penicillin resistant isolates is not recommended. Reliable interpretive criteria for ceftibuten are not currently available. Physicians should be informed that clinical response rates with ceftibuten may be lower in strains that are not penicillin-susceptible.

Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspect of laboratory procedures. Standard ceftibuten powder should provide the following MIC values:

### What can we learn from the time course of untreated and partially treated community-onset Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia? A clinical perspective on superiority and noninferiority trial designs for mild community-acquired pneumonia [^1135MKnh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

There are no well-designed placebo-controlled clinical trials in the recent era that precisely define the magnitude of the drug effect of antimicrobial therapy for mild community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, there is evidence that ineffective therapies, selected on the basis of the ratio of 24-h area under the concentration curve to minimum inhibitory concentration, associated with a discordant (nonsusceptible in vitro) specific agent (or no therapy) for mild CAP due to Streptococcus pneumoniae are associated with increased risk of progression to serious CAP. The relatively high rate of clinical success associated with appropriate antimicrobial treatment of mild CAP renders a standard outcome measure of clinical success an unlikely way to differentiate new agents. However, there may be an advantage in composite outcome assessments for mild CAP. Composite-outcomes end points that include time to resolution of morbidity, the use of patient reported-outcomes instruments, and biomarkers are recommended for future studies. Because the composite rate of success in recent randomized clinical trials exceeds 90%, it would seem that a noninferiority margin of 10% is reasonable for trials for mild CAP.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^111a7pz8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably the result of an increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States. The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM. Amoxicillin at conventional or high doses (80–90 mg/kg/day) remains an appropriate choice for first-line therapy for AOM. For patients in whom amoxicillin is unsuccessful, second-line therapy should have demonstrated activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. Appropriate options for second-line therapy include high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day based on the amoxicillin component) and ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime has been suggested as a second-line agent in the past, but recent surveillance data suggest it may no longer be active against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Tympanocentesis is useful for identifying the causative pathogen, and it may be beneficial for patients who have failed multiple courses of antibiotics. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recently was approved for use in children and should be administered to all children less than 2 years old and those at risk for recurrent AOM (e.g., day care attendance, siblings with a history of recurrent AOM). Consensus recommendations are provided for the management of AOM, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy. The current challenges in the management of AOM include the need for an increased understanding of epidemiology, increasing resistance among common middle ear pathogens, use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in designing treatment strategies, and understanding the potential impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

### Cefaclor [^112MS6wQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Cefaclor is administered orally.

Adults ─ The usual adult dosage is 250 mg every 8 hours. For more severe infections (such as pneumonia) or those caused by less susceptible organisms, doses may be doubled.

Pediatric Patients ─ The usual recommended daily dosage for pediatric patients is 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours. In more serious infections, otitis media, and infections caused by less susceptible organisms, 40 mg/kg/day are recommended, with a maximum dosage of 1 g/day.

Cefaclor may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Under such a condition, the dosage usually is unchanged (see PRECAUTIONS).

In the treatment of β-hemolytic streptococcal infections, a therapeutic dosage of cefaclor should be administered for at least 10 days.

### Differences between ceftriaxone and cefotaxime: microbiological inconsistencies [^1161HUEU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review data to determine why pneumococcal isolates appear to be increasingly resistant to cefotaxime, historically regarded as having the same in vitro susceptibility to ceftriaxone, and what this observation might imply clinically.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-October 2007) using the MeSH terms cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, susceptibility, microbial sensitivity tests, antibiotics, pneumococcal infections, Streptococcus pneumoniae, resistance, and cephalosporin resistance. Abstracts and surveillance databases were reviewed and unpublished data were provided by state departments of health and institutions.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles published in the English language that were identified from the data sources were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

An experimental model of pneumococcal infection in mice conducted 2 decades ago predicted that the delta T minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) varied less for ceftriaxone than for cefotaxime. Studies of plasma and serum concentrations show that ceftriaxone remains at a concentration above the S. pneumoniae MIC for 100% of the dosing interval at 12 hours. Types of MIC susceptibility test methods for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime used against S. pneumoniae respiratory isolates were found to be similar. Data from state and county health departments found microbiological discrepancies between ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. In areas with high rates of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), isolates were twice as susceptible to ceftriaxone versus cefotaxime. Surveillance databases consistently show differences between susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to cefotaxime versus ceftriaxone over time. MIC and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis studies suggest that phenotypic discrepancies may account for penicillin resistance. Ongoing studies are examining S. pneumoniae isolates at the molecular level to determine the basis of difference in resistance to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone.

Conclusions

An increase in rates of PRSP and differences in S. pneumoniae isolate susceptibility between ceftriaxone and cefotaxime emphasize the necessity for hospital laboratories to detect these changes as they occur. Clinicians should select the most appropriate agent for patients with S. pneumoniae.

### Ceftriaxone sodium (ceftriaxone) [^116mJyXF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Before instituting treatment with Ceftriaxone Injection, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ceftriaxone Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Ceftriaxone Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Ceftriaxone Injection is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms:

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens.

ACUTE BACTERIAL OTITIS MEDIA caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains) or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains).

NOTE: In one study lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of ceftriaxone compared to 10 days of oral therapy. In a second study comparable cure rates were observed between single dose ceftriaxone and the comparator. The potentially lower clinical cure rate of ceftriaxone should be balanced against the potential advantages of parenteral therapy.

### Penicillins for treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia: does in vitro resistance really matter? [^113SJBoQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The rate of in vitro bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is escalating among pathogens that cause the most serious respiratory tract infections. Many reports published during the past few years suggest that this has direct clinical implications. In particular, resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy has assumed a prominent role in the evolution of guidelines for the initial treatment of respiratory tract infection.

Methods

I conducted a critical review of the published medical literature.

Results

There is only a single report of documented microbiologic failure of parenteral penicillin-class antibiotics in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia in patients with or without bacteremia, whereas there are numerous well-documented reports of treatment failure with quinolone-class (n ≥ 21) and macrolide-class (n ≥ 33) antibiotics in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia.

Conclusion

The recommended optimal in-hospital therapy for community-acquired pneumonia should continue to be a beta-lactam antibiotic (penicillin, aminopenicillin, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone) administered with a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone agent for adjunctive treatment of infection with potential atypical pathogens.

### Treatment of drug-resistant pneumococcal pneumonia [^116YsLw9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2002). Medium credibility.

The increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillin and other drugs among pneumococci has considerably complicated the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Penicillin resistance has become widespread and is a worldwide occurrence. Resistance to other classes of antibiotics traditionally used as alternatives in the treatment of pneumococcal infections has also increased markedly during recent years. In some areas of the USA, Europe, and east Asia a prevalence of macrolide resistance as high as 35% or more has been reported recently. From the clinical standpoint, a growing number of failures following the use of these agents has been described. Resistance to fluoroquinolones remains low but several failures have been reported in different parts of the world. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters have become essential at the time of making a rational choice and calculation of dosage. Penicillin G remains the mainstay of therapy for the treatment of penicillin-susceptible pneumococcal pneumonia. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal pneumonia (minimum inhibitory concentration < 4 microg/mL) can be safely treated with adequate betalactams at the right dosage. The new fluoroquinolones are very active and effective in pneumococcal pneumonia. Caution should be exercised in the widespread prescription of these drugs if we are to limit the rate of resistance to these agents.

### Cefditoren pivoxil versus cefpodoxime proxetil for community-acquired pneumonia: results of a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind study [^113qfwbU]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

According to recently issued treatment guidelines, appropriate empiric choices for ambulatory patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are a macrolide, doxycycline (for patients aged ≥ 8 years), or an oral beta-lactam agent with good activity against pneumococci.

Objective

This study was designed to compare cefditoren pivoxil, a new beta-lactam, with cefpodoxime proxetil, a beta-lactam with an established role in the treatment of CAP.

Methods

This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind study conducted in the United States and South Africa. Ambulatory patients with a diagnosis of CAP were randomized to 14 days of treatment with cefditoren 200 or 400 mg BID or cefpodoxime 200 mg BID. Assessments of clinical cure and pathogen eradication were conducted at 2 visits during treatment, 1 posttreatment visit (s48 hours after completion of treatment), and 1 follow-up visit (7–14 days after completion of treatment). The development of resistant pathogens was assessed at the follow-up visit but not thereafter. The relative cost of treatment was not assessed.

Results

The study enrolled 851 patients. Comparable clinical cure rates were observed among evaluable patients in the 3 treatment groups at both the posttreatment and followup visits: at the posttreatment visit, cure rates were 90.5% (162/179) for cefditoren 200 mg, 89.7% (148/165) for cefditoren 400 mg, and 92.2% (153/166) for cefpodoxime 200 mg; at the follow-up visit, they were a respective 88.4% (160/181), 87.2% (143/164), and 90.4% (151/167). Of the 171 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated before treatment, 22 (12.9%) had reduced susceptibility to penicillin, 5 (2.9%) of them penicillin resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration ≥ 2 microg/mL). At the posttreatment visit, the overall eradication rates of pathogens isolated from microbiologically evaluable patients were 88.7% (134/151), 89.9% (134/149), and 95.7% (134/140) in the respective treatment groups (P = 0.031, cefditoren 200 mg vs cefpodoxime). Eradication rates of S pneumoniae were 93.8% (45/48), 95.7% (45/47), and 95.6% (43/ 45) in the respective treatment groups; those of Haemophilus influenzae were 90.2% (46/51), 97.7% (43/44), and 97.4% (37/38). The rates of resolution and/or improvement in clinical signs and symptoms were comparable between groups. The study drugs were well tolerated, with 1.7%, 2.5%, and 1.4% of patients in the respective groups discontinuing study drug prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse event, the majority of these associated with the digestive system.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that cefditoren may have a role in the treatment of CAP in ambulatory patients.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric therapy — MSSA-directed regimens in low MRSA prevalence ICUs: We suggest including an agent active against MSSA (and not MRSA) for the empiric treatment of suspected VAP in patients without risk factors for antimicrobial resistance, who are being treated in ICUs where < 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When empiric treatment that includes coverage for MSSA (and not MRSA) is indicated, we suggest a regimen including piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Oxacillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin are preferred agents for treatment of proven MSSA, but are not necessary for the empiric treatment of VAP if one of the above agents is used.

Overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies has demonstrated that the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has reduced the burden of pneumococcal disease but continues to affect the epidemiology of pneumococcal infections caused by nonvaccine serotypes and antibiotic-resistant pneumococci. On the basis of strong evidence, susceptible pneumococci causing uncomplicated, noninvasive childhood infections (eg, otitis or pneumonia) should be treated with a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial (eg, amoxicillin). Severely ill patients and those with infections caused by resistant pneumococci may be treated with parenteral antibiotic agents based on the isolate's susceptibility and the site of the infection.

### Antibiotic therapy of pneumonia in the obese patient: dosing and delivery [^116v99tV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Antimicrobial therapy in obese patients for different infections, including pneumonia, represents a clinical challenge because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. However, this area is understudied and underappreciated. A recent large cohort study of adult patients with septic shock, including patients with pneumonia, showed that the total daily administered doses of commonly used antibiotics did not differ among the different body mass index (BMI) groups. This translated to lower dose per kg in the obese and very obese patients compared with the normal BMI patients even after adjustment for creatinine clearance. Another retrospective study at an emergency department (ED) found that the adherence rates to hospital guidelines for the first dose of cefepime, cefazolin, and ciprofloxacin in patients with weights more than 100 kg and BMI greater than 40 kg/m 2 were only 8.0, 3.0, and 1.2%, respectively. Additionally, obesity has been associated with antibiotic underdosing and treatment failure. A cohort study of mostly outpatients receiving oral antibiotics for different reasons including lower respiratory tract infection found that obesity was a significant predictor of antibiotic treatment failure, defined as any additional antibiotic prescriptions or hospitalizations for infections within 30 days after initial therapy [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03–1.52].

In this review, we will highlight the recent studies of commonly used antibiotics in obese patients with community or healthcare-associated pneumonia. We focus on the dosing regimens rather on antibiotic selection, which is beyond the scope of this review. Of note is that most studies have evaluated plasma drug levels as the main endpoint and only a few evaluated lung tissue levels. The association of different dosing regimens with clinical endpoints, such as pneumonia recovery, recurrence, and mortality, are seriously understudied.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

### Cefuroxime [^113YiBiz]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Cefuroxime for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following diseases:

Lower Respiratory Tract Infections, including pneumonia, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Klebsiella spp. Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, and Escherichia coli.
Urinary Tract Infections caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp.
Skin and Skin-Structure Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp.
Septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), and Klebsiella spp.
Meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Neisseria meningitidis, and Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains).
Gonorrhea: uncomplicated and disseminated gonococcal infections due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains) in both males and females.
Bone and Joint Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains).

Clinical microbiological studies in skin and skin-structure infections frequently reveal the growth of susceptible strains of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Cefuroxime for Injection, USP has been used successfully in these mixed infections in which several organisms have been isolated.

In certain cases of confirmed or suspected gram-positive or gram-negative sepsis or in patients with other serious infections in which the causative organism has not been identified, Cefuroxime for Injection, USP may be used concomitantly with an aminoglycoside (see PRECAUTIONS). The recommended doses of both antibiotics may be given depending on the severity of the infection and the patient's condition.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefuroxime for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Cefuroxime for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Hospital-reported pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin [^116Ft62z]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial drug treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia is largely empirical because the pathogen is not frequently identified. Even when a bacterial pathogen is identified, antimicrobial drug susceptibility information is frequently delayed for a few days, necessitating empiric treatment decisions. Guidelines for empirical treatment have been provided by several organizations, emphasizing the selection of agents based on the probability of specific pathogens in different clinical settings. One consistent recommendation of all guidelines for all clinical settings is that antimicrobial therapy cover Streptococcus pneumoniae because it is the most common bacterial pathogen and among the most virulent.

A number of factors guide the selection of empirical therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia, including drug efficacy, side effect profile, and ease of administration. In addition, the recent emergence of antimicrobial drug resistance among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae has raised considerable concern that a number of drugs historically endorsed by national treatment guidelines may no longer be effective. The recommendations to avoid β-lactams and macrolides in high-risk settings has not been preceded by clinical studies demonstrating that drug resistance in vitro translates into clinical treatment failures. Regardless, emerging resistance to penicillins, tetracyclines, and macrolides has prompted newer versions of treatment guidelines to recommend abandoning these therapies in favor of newer therapies, such as fluoroquinolones, in settings where the risk for a drug-resistant pneumococcal infection is high. Given that penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae are increasingly multidrug resistant, if the risk for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae is high, the risk for resistance to macrolides and tetracyclines is correspondingly high.

Specific risk factors for infection with penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae have not been clearly identified. Individual risk factors include prior exposure to antibiotics and exposure to young children in daycare, although no specific rules guide the interpretation of these risk factors. In addition, awareness of substantial geographic variation in the proportion of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae has lead some groups to recommend consideration of regional susceptibility patterns in the choice of empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia. Unfortunately, routine isolation of S. pneumoniae is highly dependent on the clinical setting. For example, blood and sputum samples are rarely sent from outpatient settings; thus, local rates of pneumococcal drug resistance are primarily determined by the phenotypes of bacteria isolated from sicker patients who require hospitalization. Whether results from local hospital microbiology laboratories provide valid information for guiding treatment is unclear.

### Management of community-acquired pediatric pneumonia in an era of increasing antibiotic resistance and conjugate vaccines [^111KBFg6]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The antibiotic management of infants and children with pneumonia is based on the clinician's assessment of the most likely infecting pathogens, the susceptibilities of the infecting pathogens and the seriousness of the illness. The bacterial etiology of pneumonia changed significantly following the universal use of protein-conjugated vaccines for Haemophilus influenzae type b. Similar significant changes are likely to occur with universal use of protein-conjugated vaccines for Streptococcus pneumoniae, requiring the clinician to alter assumptions of the risk of invasive bacterial infection in the child who presents with pneumonia. New strategies are likely to require fewer ancillary tests (e.g. white blood cell count, C-reactive protein and blood culture) and suggest a decreased need for empiric antibiotic therapy. Although the majority of lower respiratory tract infections in children have a viral etiology and are not amenable to antibiotic therapy, for the seriously ill child who is thought to be likely to have pneumonia caused by a bacterial pathogen, recent changes in the susceptibility patterns of both common organisms such as S. pneumoniae and more unusual pulmonary pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus have forced changes in the selection of both empiric and definitive antibiotic therapy. Third generation cephalosporins ceftriaxone and cefotaxime appear to be effective therapy for pneumonia caused by virtually all current isolates of S. pneumoniae. In contrast antibiotic regimens for life-threatening pulmonary infections in which Staphylococcus aureus is a suspected pathogen should include vancomycin.

### Cefdinir: an expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin [^1176e2cg]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of cefdinir, an expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin.

Data Sources

Literature was identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1983-November 1999) of the medical literature, review of English-language literature and bibliographies of these articles, and product information.

Study Selection

Clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. Additional information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir was also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Cefdinir, an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and -positive aerobic organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by many common beta-lactamases. Cefdinir is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is primarily eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia) and skin and skin-structure infections. The adverse event profile is similar to that of comparator agents.

Conclusions

Cefdinir is a second-line alternative to first-line antimicrobial agents, with convenient once- or twice-daily dosing in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. Similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of many beta-lactamases. The clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.
