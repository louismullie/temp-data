## Question

Treatment for Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease mechanism and why antibiotics are used. Then, I should verify the universal supportive care elements. Next, I will examine when and how to use antibiotics, including alternatives for penicillin allergy. After that, I need to check indications for immunosuppression and dialysis. I will then consider special populations and follow-up. Finally, I should review prevention and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and treatment rationale. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an immune complex–mediated glomerular injury that occurs after a latent period following streptococcal pharyngitis or impetigo; the renal disease is already established by the time of presentation, so antibiotics do not directly modify the glomerulonephritis course, but they are used to eradicate ongoing streptococcal carriage and prevent transmission, which is why guidelines still recommend antibiotics when streptococci are cultured or suspected in the community context [^5fc44503] [^7c0afda1] [^bbaf3cde].

> Wait, let me verify the universal foundation of care. Supportive management is mandatory for all patients and includes strict salt and fluid restriction, loop or thiazide diuretics for edema and hypertension, and antihypertensives such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs when indicated, with close monitoring for hyperkalemia and transient effects on renal function; most children recover fully with this approach, and adults generally improve though with higher risks of persistent disease [^f41d6685] [^da72509e] [^505f98a0].

> I need to check antibiotic indications and choices. Even though antibiotics do not reverse established PSGN, guidelines recommend penicillin to treat the underlying streptococcal infection and reduce community spread; in penicillin allergy, use erythromycin or a macrolide, noting local resistance patterns, and in outbreaks or high-burden settings, systemic antibiotics are advised to interrupt transmission of nephritogenic strains [^5fc44503] [^bbaf3cde] [^a50b4813].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about steroids. I initially thought corticosteroids might help in severe cases, but wait, I should double-check the evidence. KDIGO advises that there is insufficient evidence to support routine corticosteroids in postinfectious GN, and they should be avoided in endocarditis-related GN; immunosuppression may be considered only in rapidly progressive, crescentic PSGN after infection is controlled, balancing infection risks, and even then the evidence is anecdotal and low quality [^4f6b089c] [^ff7fc5ad] [^bbaf3cde].

> Next, I should review when dialysis is needed. Temporary kidney replacement therapy is reserved for severe acute kidney injury with life-threatening complications such as hyperkalemia, volume overload with pulmonary edema, or uremic symptoms; most children recover renal function within weeks to months, though a minority may have persistent abnormalities [^f41d6685] [^da72509e].

> Let me consider special populations and follow-up. In children, prognosis is excellent with more than 90% full recovery, but persistent microscopic hematuria or proteinuria can occur in a minority and warrants periodic urinalysis and blood pressure checks; in adults, especially older adults or those with comorbidities, risks of chronic kidney disease are higher, and persistent low C3 beyond 12 weeks should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses such as C3 glomerulopathy; in endemic settings, subclinical disease is common, so surveillance and public health measures matter [^505f98a0] [^b7dd8500] [^a61f6857].

> I should confirm prevention strategies. Primary prevention hinges on improving hygiene, sanitation, and prompt treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis and impetigo; in high-prevalence communities, mass antimicrobial strategies and addressing scabies can reduce outbreaks, and household contacts of index cases may be screened and treated to limit transmission, aligning with KDIGO and public health guidance [^c50c84d5] [^a50b4813] [^5376fabf].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the course is prolonged. I need to ensure we keep mimics in mind: persistent hypocomplementemia beyond 12 weeks, heavy proteinuria, or an unusual pattern should prompt consideration of C3 glomerulopathy or other immune complex diseases, and kidney biopsy becomes more important when the diagnosis is uncertain, there is rapidly progressive GN, or there is no expected recovery; histology in PSGN typically shows diffuse endocapillary proliferation with subepithelial humps, but overlap entities exist, so integrating clinical, serologic, and pathologic data is essential [^b7dd8500] [^8da4e7fd] [^67bb8e6a].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. For all patients, initiate supportive care with salt and fluid restriction, diuretics, and antihypertensives as needed. Give penicillin or an appropriate alternative if streptococcal infection is confirmed or strongly suspected to eradicate carriage and prevent spread. Reserve immunosuppression for rapidly progressive, crescentic disease only after infection control and with careful risk–benefit assessment. Provide dialysis for severe AKI complications. And arrange follow-up with urinalysis, blood pressure, and complement until complete remission or baseline is reached, extending surveillance in high-risk populations or when abnormalities persist [^f41d6685] [^5fc44503] [^17e929b0].

---

Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is managed with **supportive care** — fluid and salt restriction, diuretics, and antihypertensives — as the cornerstone of therapy [^f41d6685] [^da72509e]. Antibiotics (penicillin preferred) are given to eradicate streptococcal carriage and prevent transmission, but **do not alter the renal course** once PSGN is established [^5fc44503] [^7c0afda1]. Immunosuppression is not routinely used and is reserved for severe crescentic or rapidly progressive disease after infection control, with evidence limited to anecdotal reports [^bbaf3cde] [^4f6b089c]. Most children recover fully, but adults and high-risk groups have higher risks of persistent proteinuria, hypertension, and CKD, so monitor renal function, blood pressure, and urinalysis for 6–12 months [^b7dd8500] [^17e929b0].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care is the **foundation of PSGN management**, aiming to control edema, hypertension, and acute kidney injury (AKI) [^f41d6685].

- **Fluid and salt restriction**: Limit sodium intake to reduce edema and hypertension; fluid restriction is adjusted based on urine output and clinical status [^fa963aab].

- **Diuretics**: Loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) are first-line for edema and hypertension; thiazide diuretics may be added if needed [^da72509e].

- **Antihypertensive therapy**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred for persistent hypertension; calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers are alternatives if ACE inhibitors/ARBs are contraindicated or not tolerated [^da72509e].

- **Dialysis**: Temporary dialysis is indicated for severe AKI with life-threatening complications (e.g. hyperkalemia, pulmonary edema, uremic symptoms) [^f41d6685].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are used to eradicate streptococcal carriage and prevent transmission; they **do not modify the established renal disease** [^5fc44503] [^7c0afda1].

- **Indication**: Give antibiotics if streptococci are cultured from any site or if there is a credible history of recent infection, primarily to prevent spread in the community [^5fc44503] [^7c0afda1].

- **First-line therapy**: Penicillin V orally for 10 days; amoxicillin is an acceptable alternative [^bbaf3cde].

- **Penicillin allergy**: Use erythromycin or a first-generation cephalosporin (if no immediate hypersensitivity) [^bbaf3cde].

- **Duration**: Treat for 10 days to ensure eradication and prevent rheumatic complications [^efd56a12].

---

## Immunosuppressive therapy

Immunosuppression is **not routinely recommended** because PSGN is a self-limited immune complex disease; consider only in severe cases after infection control [^4f6b089c].

- **Indication**: Consider corticosteroids only for severe crescentic or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with renal failure, and only after infection is controlled [^bbaf3cde] [^57c56ae3].

- **Evidence**: Data are limited to anecdotal reports; no randomized trials support routine immunosuppression in PSGN [^bbaf3cde] [^4f6b089c].

- **Risks**: Immunosuppression can worsen infection; weigh risks and benefits carefully [^ff7fc5ad].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to detect persistent renal disease or hypertension; **most children recover fully**, but adults and high-risk groups need closer surveillance [^b7dd8500].

- **Duration**: Monitor renal function, blood pressure, and urinalysis for 6–12 months after acute illness [^notfound].

- **Persistent abnormalities**: Proteinuria, hematuria, or hypertension beyond 3–6 months warrant further evaluation and possible nephrology referral [^notfound].

- **Long-term outcomes**: Persistent proteinuria and hypertension increase the risk of chronic kidney disease; prognosis is worse in adults, the elderly, and those with preexisting renal disease [^b7dd8500] [^cb2f2984].

---

## Special considerations

- **Epidemic settings**: Mass antimicrobial use and public health measures may be considered in high-prevalence communities to limit outbreaks [^c50c84d5].

- **Prevention**: Early recognition and treatment of streptococcal infections, along with hygiene and sanitation improvements, reduce PSGN incidence [^6da72a13].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Supportive care | All patients | - Fluid/salt restriction <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Antihypertensives <br/> - Dialysis if indicated [^f41d6685] [^da72509e] |
| Antibiotics | Confirmed or suspected streptococcal infection | Penicillin V for 10 days; alternatives if allergic [^5fc44503] [^bbaf3cde] |
| Immunosuppression | Severe crescentic or rapidly progressive GN | Consider only after infection control; evidence limited [^bbaf3cde] [^4f6b089c] |
| Monitoring | All patients | - Renal function <br/> - Blood pressure <br/> - Urinalysis for 6–12 months [^b7dd8500] [^17e929b0] |

---

PSGN management centers on **supportive care**, with antibiotics to eradicate streptococcal carriage and selective immunosuppression only for severe disease. Most children recover fully, but persistent proteinuria or hypertension requires ongoing follow-up.

Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is the leading cause of acute glomerulonephritis in children worldwide, owing to the high incidence of nephritogenic strains of group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal throat and skin infections. The incidence of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is declining in developed countries because of better access to clean drinking water, enhanced sanitation, and improved hygiene. However, it remains a public health problem and a significant cause of hospitalisation in low-income and middle-income countries. The pathogenesis of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis involves the activation of the alternate complement pathway mediated by immune complexes, resulting in glomerular inflammation and subsequent kidney injury. The disease characteristically presents with features of acute nephritic syndrome and occasionally with complications such as hypertensive emergencies, congestive cardiac failure, nephrotic syndrome, severe acute kidney injury, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Preventing streptococcal throat and skin infections, early diagnosis and identification of complications, and prompt initiation of treatment are the cornerstones of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis management and recovery. Treatment primarily consists of supportive care along with diuretics and antihypertensive therapy, while only a small number of patients require immunosuppressants or kidney replacement therapy. Kidney biopsies are seldom required to guide subsequent treatment, particularly in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, or atypical disease progression. Most patients make a full recovery from the disease. However, persistent proteinuria, hypertension, and progression to chronic kidney disease may require long-term monitoring. Here, we review current treatment standards and discuss novel developments in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome prediction, and management of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in children.

### The current state of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis [^65948fcc]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is one of the oldest recognized renal diseases. In the past three decades, significant changes have occurred in its epidemiology, in new insight gained in the nephritogenic characteristics of streptococcal antigens, and in the natural history of the disease. The disease is now rare in industrialized nations, but in the underprivileged world, the burden of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis ranges between 9.5 and 28.5 new cases per 100,000 individuals per year. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment is advisable in epidemic conditions and to household contacts of index cases in communities where the prevalence of the disease is high. The long-term prognosis is variable; in general, prognosis is excellent in children but significantly worse when it occurs in elderly individuals and in populations that present other risk factors of chronic kidney disease. Contemporary large-scale research strategies such as genome-wide sequencing may uncover new information about pathogenic factors contributing to disease.

Infection-related glomerulonephritis (GN) management — For post-streptococcal GN, infective endocarditis-related GN, and shunt nephritis, we suggest appropriate treatment of the infectious disease and standard approaches to the management of the kidney manifestations (2D). Poststreptococcal GN is the prototypical infection-related acute GN, and although classic poststreptococcal GN occurs 1–3 weeks after the initial clinical manifestations of pharyngitis or impetigo, affected individuals should be treated with penicillin (or erythromycin, if penicillin-allergic) even in the absence of persistent infection in order to decrease the antigenic load; the nephritic syndrome should be treated with diuretics, antihypertensives, supportive care, and dialysis if necessary, and corticosteroids are suggested for severe crescentic GN based on anecdotal evidence only.

Regarding medical management for infection-related glomerulonephritis, more specifically with respect to antimicrobial therapy, KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antibiotics in patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis if streptococci are cultured from any site, primarily to prevent the spread of infection within community sites.

### Epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment and outcomes of infection-associated glomerulonephritis [^785dd7c9]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

For over a century, acute 'post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis' (APSGN) was the prototypical form of bacterial infection-associated glomerulonephritis, typically occurring after resolution of infection and a distinct infection-free latent period. Other less common forms of infection-associated glomerulonephritides resulted from persistent bacteraemia in association with subacute bacterial endocarditis and shunt nephritis. However, a major paradigm shift in the epidemiology and bacteriology of infection-associated glomerulonephritides has occurred over the past few decades. The incidence of APSGN has sharply declined in the Western world, whereas the number of Staphylococcus infection-associated glomerulonephritis (SAGN) cases increased owing to a surge in drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, both in the hospital and community settings. These Staphylococcus infections range from superficial skin infections to deep-seated invasive infections such as endocarditis, which is on the rise among young adults owing to the ongoing intravenous drug use epidemic. SAGN is markedly different from APSGN in terms of its demographic profile, temporal association with active infection and disease outcomes. The diagnosis and management of SAGN is challenging because of the lack of unique histological features, the frequently occult nature of the underlying infection and the older age and co-morbidities in the affected patients. The emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacterial strains further complicates patient treatment.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^73db0712]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2021.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2023, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Elsevier, and Web of Science (Clarivate) up to 19 March 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials, 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials, 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Based on an analysis of evaluable participants, we are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials, 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials, 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials, 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials, 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Children treated with macrolides seemed to experience more adverse events than those treated with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; 1 trial, 489 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, the test for subgroup differences between children and adults was not significant. Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial, 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial, 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial, 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial, 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials, 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better at preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. Antibiotics have a limited effect in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis and the results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin. In the context of antimicrobial stewardship, penicillin can be used if treatment with an antibiotic is indicated. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and disadvantaged populations, where the risk of complications remains high.

### A narrative review of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in nepali children [^169d8663]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) is the primary cause of acute glomerulonephritis in children in Nepal and contributes significantly to paediatric hospitalisations in the country. This review discusses the current status of streptococcal infections, epidemiological trends, and the challenges in diagnosing and managing APSGN in Nepalese children. This study aimed to develop local data on acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis to help compare epidemiological trends and patterns with regions where this disease is less prevalent.

Methods

A targeted literature review was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Nepal Journals Online (a local database) to identify relevant literature published between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2024. Additional searches of conference abstracts and reviews were performed using Google. The collected literature was analysed to determine the kidney disease patterns, current status of Group A Streptococcal infection, epidemiological trends, clinical manifestations, management, and outcomes of APSGN in Nepali children aged < 16 years.

Results

Thirty-four articles were selected for in-depth review. A synthesis of local hospital studies revealed significant differences in the application of diagnostic criteria for APSGN owing to the inaccessibility of serological tests and complement testing. Children over five years of age, particularly those aged 8 to 11 years and predominantly male, were more severely affected. The disease was present year-round, with pyoderma identified as the main route of preceding streptococcal infection rather than throat infection, particularly affecting economically disadvantaged children. The classical manifestations were oedema, hypertension, gross haematuria, and oliguria, whereas complications included acute kidney injury, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, hypertensive emergency, congestive cardiac failure, and the need for kidney replacement therapy. The anti-streptolysin O titre was positive in 34–72.7% of patients, while complement C3 levels were depressed in 61.9–100% of cases. Urinalysis showed haematuria in 67–100% of patients and pyuria in 7.9–37%. Kidney ultrasonography indicated increased echogenicity in 37–78% of the cases. Most patients were managed conservatively with diuretics and anti-hypertensives. Atypical cases and those with a progressive disease course were further managed with steroids, kidney biopsies, or kidney replacement therapy. Most patients exhibited favourable short-term kidney outcomes. There was low mortality among patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and those who required kidney replacement therapy.

Conclusions

This review highlights that acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis remains a common cause of hospitalisation in Nepal. It remains a diagnostic difficulty owing to the inaccessibility of serological and complement tests. The disease has distinct clinical manifestations, demographic patterns, histological findings and outcomes in Nepali children.

### Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis: the most common acute glomerulonephritis [^da72509e]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

On the basis of strong research evidence, the prevalence of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is decreasing worldwide, although it still remains the leading cause of glomerulonephritis in children. The overall decrease in prevalence of PSGN has been mainly driven by a significant decrease in pyoderma seen in the last half-century, such that postpharyngitic PSGN is most commonly seen in developed nations. On the basis of primarily consensus because of a lack of relevant clinical studies, the latency period between streptococcal infection and the development of nephritis is a hallmark of PSGN, with this period lasting 1 to 2 weeks with pharyngeal infections or 2 to 6 weeks with skin infections. Concurrent infectious and nephritis symptoms should elicit further suspicion of other causes of glomerulonephritis. On the basis of expert opinion, PSGN is one of a handful of nephritic disorders with hypocomplementemia (low C3 level). The decrease in C3 is found in more than 90% of PSGN cases and is typically seen earlier than an increase in antistreptolysin O titers. Measuring C3 and C4 may also be helpful in the evaluation of other causes of acute nephritis. On the basis of primarily consensus because of a lack of relevantclinical studies, the main sequelae of PSGN (hypertension, edema, gross hematuria, and impaired renal function) are greatest in thefirst 7 to 10 days of disease. Therefore, this period requires themost vigilance for adverse effects. On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, the most effective treatment of hypertension and edema in PSGN is loop or thiazide diuretics, which may also address hyperkalemia. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may be effective in hypertension control but carry the risk of hyperkalemia and temporarily impairing recovery of renal function. On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, the prognosis for PSGN, even long term, is good. Despite being the most prevalent of the childhood glomerulonephritides, it often does not cause chronic kidney disease, but persistent microscopic hematuria and proteinuria may be seen in less than 10% of patients.

### Safety of Streptococcus pyogenes vaccines: anticipating and overcoming challenges for clinical trials and post-marketing monitoring [^afb7e233]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A), a human pathogen, afflict more than 800 million people each year and result in an estimated 639 000 deaths, most attributable to rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and invasive infections. Clinical manifestations vary from mucosal diseases (pharyngitis, tonsillitis, superficial skin infections) to locally invasive and systemic diseases (bacteremia, meningitis, puerperal sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome) and immune-related sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF), acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and RHD. While most manifestations of S. pyogenes infection can be treated with penicillin, the lack of prevention strategies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), leads infection to progress to severe disease and death. Hence, the 71st World Health Assembly asked the World Health Organization (WHO) in May 2018 to prioritize the development of a safe and effective S. pyogenes vaccine.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^17e929b0]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Bacterial infection–related glomerulonephritis (GN) — general management and monitoring: No randomized controlled trials guide the treatment in any of these conditions. Antibiotics for underlying infection (although this will not alter GN course in postinfectious GN) per local guidelines; antibiotics can be given in poststreptococcal GN if streptococci are cultured from any site and this is primarily done to prevent the spread of infection within community sites. Supportive care includes to treat edema, hypertension, etc. as well as persistent proteinuria and/or progressive GFR decline as per Chapter 1, and to follow kidney function, serum C3 and C4, urinalysis, albumin–creatinine ratio (ACR), and proteinuria at appropriate intervals until complete remission or return to baseline.

### A narrative review of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in nepali children [^6da72a13]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

APSGN is a common paediatric problem and an important cause of acute glomerulonephritis and has profound public health concerns in developing countries such as Nepal. Long-term kidney outcomes are generally good except in patients with RPGN and those requiring KRT. Improving hygiene and sanitation, reducing overcrowding, and promptly diagnosing and treating pyoderma and sore throat should be strategies for reducing the incidence of APSGN in Nepal.

Recommendations

The uniform standard protocols for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up should be implemented in all healthcare facilities providing paediatric services in Nepal. These standard protocols will facilitate the collection of robust data, help in comparison among studies and further provide a better understanding of epidemiological trends. Future studies should also document mild cases treated in peripheral hospitals and investigate the incidence of subclinical diseases. Furthermore, an electronic data records system or the establishment of a kidney disease registry will facilitate further documentation.

### Clinical guidelines for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis… [^505f98a0]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can occur after streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infections.
- PSGN often requires hospitalization, but subclinical cases can occur.
- The prognosis for PSGN is good, especially for children.
- Treatment focuses on symptom management and giving antibiotics. Clinical features The clinical features of acute glomerulonephritis include:

- Edema
- Hypertension
- Proteinuria
- Macroscopic hematuria, with urine appearing dark, reddish-brown
- Complaints of lethargy, generalized weakness, or anorexia Edema is often pronounced in the face and around the eyes, especially on arising in the morning. Laboratory findings Laboratory examination usually reveals:

- Mild normocytic normochromic anemia
- Slight hypoproteinemia
- Elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
- Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
- Low total hemolytic complement and C3 complement Patients usually have decreased urine output.

Urine examination often reveals protein and hemoglobin with red blood cell casts. Subclinical illness Subclinical cases of PSGN can occur. Some individuals may have symptoms that are mild enough to not come to medical attention. Treatment Treatment of PSGN focuses on managing hypertension and edema. Antibiotics Patients should receive penicillin to eradicate any remaining group A strep. This will help prevent spread of the bacteria to other people. Complications The prognosis of PSGN in children is very good. More than 90% of children make a full recovery. Adults with PSGN are more likely to have a worse outcome due to residual renal function impairment. Preventing primary illness It's important to prevent the primary group A streptococcal skin or pharyngeal infection. Treating patients with PSGN with antibiotics can stop group A strep from circulating in a household.

Thus, treating patients with PSGN can prevent additional infections among close contacts.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^f6e792b4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

Objectives

To assess the evidence on the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing relapse; and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March week 3, 2016), Embase Elsevier (1974 to March 2016), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (2010 to March 2016). We also searched clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications or adverse events, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE tool to assess the overall quality of evidence for the outcomes.

Main Results

We included 19 trials (5839 randomised participants); seven compared penicillin with cephalosporins, six compared penicillin with macrolides, three compared penicillin with carbacephem, one trial compared penicillin with sulphonamides, one trial compared clindamycin with ampicillin, and one trial compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All included trials reported clinical outcomes. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. The overall quality of the evidence assessed using the GRADE tool was low for the outcome 'resolution of symptoms' in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and very low for the outcomes 'resolution of symptoms' of evaluable participants and for adverse events. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals (CIs). There was a difference in symptom resolution in favour of cephalosporins compared with penicillin (evaluable patients analysis odds ratio (OR) for absence of resolution of symptoms 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 20, N = 5, n = 1660; very low quality evidence). However, this was not statistically significant in the ITT analysis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12; N = 5, n = 2018; low quality evidence). Clinical relapse was lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; NNTB 50, N = 4, n = 1386; low quality evidence), but this was found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33, N = 2, n = 770). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin for any of the outcomes. One unpublished trial in children found a better cure rate for azithromycin in a single dose compared to amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; NNTB 18, N = 1, n = 482), but there was no difference between the groups in ITT analysis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; N = 1, n = 673) or at long-term follow-up (evaluable patients analysis OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; N = 1, n = 422). Children experienced more adverse events with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; N = 1, n = 673). Compared with penicillin carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children combined (ITT analysis OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14, N = 3, n = 795), and in the subgroup analysis of children (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8, N = 1, n = 233), but not in the subgroup analysis of adults (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, N = 2, n = 562). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides compared with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; N = 1, n = 489). Studies did not report on long-term complications so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be regarded as a first choice treatment for both adults and children. All studies were in high-income countries with low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities where risk of complications remains high.

Regarding preventative measures for infection-related glomerulonephritis, more specifically with respect to prevention of epidemic poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend to consider implementing socioeconomic interventions and mass antimicrobial use to improve living conditions and limit the spread of infection to prevent epidemic poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in populations where group A streptococcus infection and scabies are highly prevalent.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^ecb36ae6]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a scoping review of the literature for all studies evaluating Strep A treatment or prevention strategies from an economic perspective. A review protocol was developed but not registered at the start of the study and is described here, along with the main findings by following the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses" (PRISMA) guidelines.

Eligibility criteria

We included all studies published between Jan 1, 2000 and Oct 12, 2022, that measured and valued, in monetary terms, the resources used to treat or prevent Strep A infections or clinical manifestations. We did not include studies on nosocomial infections and on diseases caused by a pathogen other than Strep A (e.g. bacteraemia or toxic shock syndrome due exclusively to Staphylococcus aureus). There were no restrictions on study language or country; however, the search terms were in English only. Clinical manifestations arising from Strep A infection included pharyngitis, tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess (quinsy), impetigo, cellulitis, erysipelas, scarlet fever, necrotising fasciitis, bacteraemia, toxic shock syndrome, sepsis (including maternal sepsis), septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, meningitis, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), rheumatic heart disease (RHD), and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN).

Relevant economic study designs included cost-of-illness, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, budget-impact, and return-on-investment studies. Studies that did not calculate the intervention cost and compare it to the intervention benefits (clinical or economic) were excluded from the analysis. We did not attempt to calculate cost-effectiveness ratios because any number of measures of effectiveness could be chosen (e.g. cost per disease averted, cost per surgery averted, cost per anaphylaxis reaction averted, cost per days of illness reduced, etc) and interpretation of the ratio is subjective.

Search strategy

A literature search was conducted using Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science (WoS) search platform, which includes multiple databases such as the WoS core collection and Medline, and Elsevier's Embase search platform. Search strings for each database are provided in Supplemental Material 1.

General economic terms and disease terms were restricted to a title search to increase the sensitivity of the search strategy. However, to maximize that chance of identifying all relevant data, references lists of each eligible study were evaluated and hand-searched for studies not identified by the search string.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^b7dd8500]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (GN) — prognosis and specific considerations: Short-term prognosis in children is excellent, and in endemic regions persistent albuminuria may occur and some adults develop low eGFR. In the elderly, kidney prognosis is poor for those who develop persistent albuminuria; mortality may be up to 20%. The value of high dose glucocorticoids remains unproven. For disease course and evaluation, persistently low C3 beyond 12 weeks may be an indication for kidney biopsy to particularly exclude C3GN, and prevention of epidemic poststreptococcal GN may include socioeconomic interventions and mass antimicrobial use to improve living conditions and limit the spread of infection in populations where Group A streptococcus infection and scabies are highly prevalent.

### A narrative review of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in nepali children [^30e3549e]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

APSGN is a significant health problem and one of the leading causes of hospitalisation and outpatient clinic visits among children in Nepal. This high incidence of APSGN is primarily attributed to the prevalence of streptococcal pyoderma and pharyngitis in Nepali children. However, the lack of comprehensive data on APSGN in paediatric populations from various geographical locations (plains, hills, and mountains), diverse clinical severities (severe, mild, and subclinical cases), and different clinical settings (tertiary or peripheral hospitals) complicates the task of accurately determining the actual prevalence of APSGN in Nepal.

Epidemiological data on APSGN in Nepali children were primarily gathered from hospital records at tertiary care facilities. These centres mainly manage severe and complicated cases of APSGN, meaning that milder cases often do not reach these facilities. Furthermore, there are significant information gaps regarding cases that resolve without medical intervention, frequency of subclinical diseases, predominant routes of preceding infections, and specific serotypes of Streptococcus responsible for APSGN in Nepal. Additionally, many health centres in Nepal do not have access to streptococcal serological tests, complement analysis, and kidney biopsy, making it difficult to diagnose APSGN.

This narrative review aimed to analyse hospital-based data on APSGN from different regions of Nepal in order to estimate the epidemiological burden of APSGN in Nepali children. This review also collected information on various clinical manifestations, diagnostic findings, complications, and treatment outcomes of APSGN in different regions. The results of this review can help healthcare professionals manage and understand the different disease patterns among populations in different regions of Nepal.

### Staphylococcus-related glomerulonephritis and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis: why defining "post" is important in understanding and treating infection-related glomerulonephritis [^d62f0f03]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

A spate of recent publications describes a newly recognized form of glomerulonephritis associated with active staphylococcal infection. The key kidney biopsy findings, glomerular immunoglobulin A (IgA) deposits dominant or codominant with IgG deposits, resemble those of IgA nephritis. Many authors describe this condition as "postinfectious" and have termed it "poststaphylococcal glomerulonephritis". However, viewed through the prism of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, the prefix "post" in poststaphylococcal glomerulonephritis is historically incorrect, illogical, and misleading with regard to choosing therapy. There are numerous reports describing the use of high-dose steroids to treat poststaphylococcal glomerulonephritis. The decision to use steroid therapy suggests that the treating physician believed that the dominant problem was a postinfectious glomerulonephritis, not the infection itself. Unfortunately, steroid therapy in staphylococcus-related glomerulonephritis can precipitate severe staphylococcal sepsis and even death and provides no observable benefits. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is an authentic postinfectious glomerulonephritis; poststaphylococcal glomerulonephritis is not. Making this distinction is important from the perspective of history, pathogenesis, and clinical management.

Infection-related glomerulonephritis (GN) — research recommendations: RCT is needed to evaluate the treatment of crescentic poststreptococcal GN with high-dose glucocorticoids with or without immunosuppression, and research is needed to determine the nature of the streptococcal antigen(s) as a basis for developing immunoprophylactic therapy. In patients whose kidney lesion transforms, further research is needed to elucidate the distinctions and relationships between immune complex–mediated post-streptococcal GN and C3-dominant, but nonimmune complex–mediated C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), and research is needed to confirm the utility of anti-factor B antibodies in the diagnosis of poststreptococcal GN. For shunt nephritis, multicenter observational studies are needed to determine the incidence, prevalence, and long-term prognosis of shunt nephritis, and the outcome of those with PR3-ANCA antibodies. For infective endocarditis-related GN, multicenter studies are needed to determine the incidence, prevalence, long-term prognosis, and mechanism of glomerular injury. For IgADIRGN, RCTs of IgADIRGN are needed to assess the value, or lack of, glucocorticoid and/or immunosuppressive agents when the infection is controlled.

### Atypical presentation of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in a child with genetically confirmed susceptibility to C3-glomerulopathy: a case report and brief review of the literature [^42c60e68]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) is one of the leading causes of acute nephritis in children worldwide. While most cases of PIGN resolve spontaneously, a subset presents with atypical features, complicating diagnosis and management. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), a distinct form of PIGN primarily triggered by streptococcal species, can manifest in a spectrum ranging from subclinical cases to acute nephritic and/or nephrotic syndrome. Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms of PSGN has not yet been clearly elucidated, evidence suggests that immune complex deposition and subsequent activation of the alternative complement pathway play a crucial role, leading to glomerular inflammation and injury.

C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is a rare and well-established form of glomerulonephritis, that primarily manifests in childhood characterised by either genetic or acquired dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway leading to predominant C3 deposition within the glomeruli. The estimated annual incidence is 1–3 per 1.000.000 individuals. C3G may manifest with low C3 titres, nephritic and nephrotic features, hence mimicking PSGN presentation. The overlap of atypical PSGN and C3G has attracted considerable attention in recent clinical trials. Importantly, while C3 levels typically normalize within eight weeks in most PSGN cases, persistent hypocomplementemia is more suggestive of C3G, which carries a higher risk for progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). According to the 2021 KDIGO guidelines, immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil is the mainstay of treatment for C3G. However, clinical trials concerning the treatment of C3G in children are indeed lacking.

Herein, we describe the first case of a child with atypical features of PSGN and autoimmune haemolytic anemia with a concomitant rare THBD gene polymorphism, known to be associated with C3G pathogenesis.

### Pathogen-driven degradation of endogenous and therapeutic antibodies during streptococcal infections [^f331c550]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as Group A streptococcus (GAS), is a human specific pathogen that causes a broad spectrum of both local and systemic infections –. The global burden of GAS diseases has been estimated to ~18 million severe cases and ~500,000 deaths each year, constituting a substantial source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. GAS infections display significant heterogeneity regarding tissue tropism, disease severity, and occurrence of post-infectious sequelae. For example, GAS is responsible for a variety of relatively mild and localized skin and throat infections that result in impetigo and pharyngitis. These localized infections are often self-limiting and responsive to antimicrobial treatments, but in some cases, patients may progress into life-threatening invasive conditions, including sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. GAS infections are also linked to a wide array of severe postinfectious immune-mediated disorders, such as glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever. The basis for this large disease heterogeneity is poorly understood. Defining the underlying factors that modulate bacterial virulence in different disease contexts is instrumental to the development of more sensitive diagnostics and more effective targeted therapeutics.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^d5580b5e]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infection by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, or 'Strep A') can cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Superficial infections of the upper respiratory tract and skin can lead to pharyngitis and impetigo, respectively, as well as blood stream and other sterile site infections, manifesting as necrotising fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, sepsis, maternal sepsis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis. Strep A infection can also cause the immune-mediated sequelae of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), which in turn can lead to chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), respectively.

Collectively, Strep A infections and complications cause over half a million deaths globally each year, making it — before the emergence of SarS-COVID-2 — the fifth most lethal pathogen on the planet behind HIV, Mycobacterium, tuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The morbidity and mortality from Strep A infection is inequitably concentrated in resource-limited settings, though the burden of sepsis and superficial infections is also significant in high-resource settings. For example, sore throat is the third most common diagnosis with an antibiotic prescription in the U.S. and the most common reason for antibiotic self-medication in Europe.

### About post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis… [^8f9e7b73]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an inflammatory disease affecting the kidneys.
- It's rare, but PSGN can develop after strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo.
- Symptoms of PSGN usually point to kidney issues and long-term kidney damage can occur.
- Treatment usually focuses on managing swelling and blood pressure but can include antibiotics. Symptoms After strep throat or scarlet fever symptoms start: PSGN can develop about 10 days later. After impetigo symptoms start: PSGN can develop about 3 weeks later. Someone with PSGN usually has protein in the urine and hypertension. Symptoms can also include:

- Dark, reddish-brown urine
- Decreased need to pee or decreased amount of urine
- Edema
- Fatigue due to anemia The swelling occurs especially in the face, around the eyes, and in the hands and feet.

Some people may have no symptoms or symptoms that are so mild that they don't seek medical help. Complications Most people who develop PSGN recover within a few weeks without any complications. While rare, long-term kidney damage, including kidney failure, can occur. These rare complications are more common in adults than children. Risk factors Anyone can get PSGN after having strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo. People at increased risk for those infections are also at increased risk for getting PSGN. Age PSGN is more common in children than adults. After strep throat or scarlet fever Developing PSGN after strep throat or scarlet fever is most common in young, school-age children. After impetigo Developing PSGN after impetigo is most common in preschool-age children. Treatment and recovery Treatment of PSGN focuses on managing symptoms as needed. Healthcare providers limit salt and water intake or prescribe a diuretic to decrease swelling.

A diuretic is a medicine that increases the flow of urine. Healthcare providers prescribe blood pressure medicine to manage the patient's blood pressure. Antibiotics People with PSGN who still have a group A strep infection are often given antibiotics.

Treatment pattern of APSGN

Medical management (supportive care, diuretics, and anti-hypertensives) was the standard of care, and only a small percentage of patients needed kidney replacement therapy. There was no documentation of antibiotic use in any of the studies. Immunosuppressive medications (primarily corticosteroids and one patient received cyclophosphamide) were required in only a few patients (Table 7). In one study, seven of 50 patients (14%) with suspected PIGN required immunosuppressive therapy for various indications at presentation. These patients showed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (DPGN) without crescents on kidney biopsy, and steroid therapy was stopped. Other studies have indicated that 10–11.6% of patients required steroids (Table 7). Patients with different grades of disease severity were mainly managed in general wards rather than intensive care units.

Outcomes of APSGN and PIGN

The mean length of hospital stay was between 4 and 8 days, ranging from two to 15 days, although some patients were hospitalised for up to 38 days (Table 7). Many studies have reported rapid resolution of proteinuria within weeks, and only 3.9% had persistent nephrotic-range proteinuria after three months of follow-up. However, the limited long-term follow-up beyond three months in most studies makes it difficult to predict the overall resolution rate of proteinuria in these patients. Other abnormalities observed during a two-month follow-up included microscopic haematuria, persistent proteinuria, and elevated creatinine levels, seen in 10.9%, 8.3%, and 4.4% of cases, respectively. At the three-month follow-up, 6.5% of patients continued to have persistent proteinuria, hypertension, and impaired renal function, either alone or in combination. Approximately 1.3 to 17.8% of patients required kidney replacement therapy at presentation or within three months of illness. Studies have demonstrated that most patients have favourable kidney outcomes, experience minimal complications, and have low mortality rates in the short term (Table 7). No studies have followed these patients for long-term complications, such as hypertension, microscopic haematuria, and CKD, over three months of illness. None of the studies examined recurrence or its occurrence in other siblings.

### An update on acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis worldwide [^2114bf21]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Postinfectious glomerulonephritis is an immunologic response of the kidney to infection, commonly triggered by streptococci, although many other organisms can cause the condition. In recent decades, the prevalence of postinfectious glomerulonephritis has tended to decline in most industrialized countries, but high rates persist in some developing communities. Nowadays, patients in developed countries are usually adult and male, and those with comorbidities such as diabetes and alcoholism are at increased risk of developing the disease. The acute presentation ranges from nephritic syndrome to asymptomatic glomerulonephritis. The exact pathophysiology of postinfectious glomerulonephritis is still unknown; however, several possible pathologic antigens are under investigation. The majority of children and patients with the epidemic form of postinfectious glomerulonephritis have an excellent prognosis, which contrasts with the poor long-term outcome of sporadic cases. Therapy is largely supportive unless renal function fails to recover after eradication of the causative organism. This Review focuses on acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and covers its epidemiology, presentation, pathology, pathogenesis, treatment and outcomes.

Discussion

The prognosis of APSGN is relatively benign in the low-risk populations; however, it is associated with a 5- to 6-fold increased risk of CKD in resource-limited settings. The incidence of APSGN has declined globally in the past four decades and particularly in some developed countries. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, however, remains an important health problem in developing countries and tropical regions of a number of developed countries. Some developing countries report APSGN as the most common cause of acute nephritis. Carapetis et al. analyzed data from 11 population-based studies and calculated the annual incidence of APSGN as ranging from 6 to 24.3 per 100,000 person-years in the more developed to the less developed countries, respectively. The true incidence of the disease is difficult to determine because of the under-recognition of the milder cases of APSGN and the transient nature of the illness. Indeed, the subclinical cases are thought to be 4–19 times more common than symptomatic disease. Thus, we assume that incidence is higher than reported.

### A narrative review of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in nepali children [^f88aff7b]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The review identified AGN as one of the leading causes of hospitalisation among children in Nepal. In the Nepalese context, the primary cause of AGN is post-infectious glomerulonephritis, with APSGN being the predominant cause. APSGN is typically linked to skin infections and can occur in any season. Most APSGN children are admitted to hospitals with the characteristic symptoms of acute glomerulonephritis, and only a minority of these patients develop complications. The review concluded that these children are usually treated conservatively and have favourable short-term renal outcomes.

APSGN is the leading cause of acute nephritis globally, with most cases occurring in developing countries. The exact prevalence of APSGN in Nepal remains unknown. In developed countries such as the USA, the prevalence is 0.13, and the incidence is 0.78, while in similar environments in neighbouring countries in India, the prevalence is 10.14, and the incidence is 39.24 per 100,000 person-years. APSGN is particularly prevalent in regions where streptococcal infections are common due to poor hygiene, malnutrition, and overcrowding. GABHS sometimes causes community outbreaks and epidemics in natural disasters, resulting in high rates of throat and skin infections, with consequences such as rheumatic fever, APSGN, and other invasive infections. The situation was similar in Nepal following the 2015 earthquake, when an increased incidence of streptococcal pneumonia and APSGN was reported in many regions. Furthermore, pharyngitis (5–7.2%), asymptomatic carrier conditions (9.2%), and skin infections caused by GABHS are common among school-aged Nepali children, similar to other regions of the world. Additionally, previous research from Nepal indicated that invasive pneumococcal disease rarely presents as glomerulonephritis. Therefore, Streptococcal infection remains a significant public health problem in Nepal and many developing countries because of the aforementioned factors. Patients with medical conditions that weaken the immune system, such as chronic conditions or immunosuppressants, are also susceptible to GABHS infections. Recently, the role of genetic factors in increasing susceptibility to APSGN after GABHS infection has been studied, although no specific gene has been identified. APSGN was found to be present in 12–25% of glomerular problems among young, asymptomatic school-going children in Nepal during urine screenings. Additionally, of the 83 patients who experienced glomerular haematuria, 36.3% were diagnosed with APSGN, the most common glomerular cause worldwide. These findings suggest that subclinical APSGN is prevalent not only among Nepalese children but also among children from other countries.

### End-stage kidney disease in patient with epidermolysis bullosa-what are the treatment options?-case report [^fe4f8ef7]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The disease affects 1 in 17,000 live births. The most common "simplex" type, is associated just with skin damage, while in other types internal organs are involved. The main morbidity and mortality causes in the population are squamous cell skin cancer and sepsis originating from infected skin lesions.

In most cases, the first clinical signs occur in early childhood or infancy. Nowadays available treatment options are focused on limiting the severity of the skin symptoms. The molecular or genetic therapies are still in preclinical trials.

Kidney injury is observed mainly in the course of non-simplex EB type. It may be caused by ureter stenosis, glomerulonephritis or amyloidosis. It develops also as a result of systemic inflammatory response. Researchers from Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London observed different forms of urinary tract disorders like IgA nephropathy, post streptococcal glomerulonephritis, ureter obstruction, hypospodiasis in 5 juvenile patients during 10-year-long observation of dystrophic and junctional type. In one case the aetiology of kidney injury was unidentified. In some of the EB types, end stage kidney disease is the common cause of death reaching even 12% as in patients with Hallopeau-Siemens (subtype of DEB). Nevertheless, as only minority of EB types involves internal organs, information on the kidney diseases in those patients are scarce. Unfortunately, the available reports indicate, that some patients died due to lack of treatment possibilities (no vascular access for haemodialysis). On the other hand, some possibly lethal complications of the RRT may appear. The question arises therefore, which of the RRT methods is the most suitable for this specific group of patients.

### Polymeric epitope-based vaccine induces protective immunity against group A Streptococcus [^84338f7a]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Group A Streptococcus (Strep A, S. pyogenes) is an important global human pathogen that leads to a wide range of infections from such as mild pharyngitis and impetigo to invasive diseases such as toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis and cellulitis –. Strep A pharyngitis has a considerable global health and economic burden. Robust surveillance mechanisms must be put in place to accurately measure and analyze disease burden between populations, and evaluate the potential impact of future Strep A vaccines. This bacterium is heavily equipped with multiple virulence factors and genetic regulators enabling its diverse infection profile. Recurrence of streptococcal infection may result in post-infection sequelae of acute rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease, and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Strep A infections are a major problem in many low- and middle-income countries and indigenous populations of developed countries where inadequate access to health care and socioeconomic issues occur. The main killers of Strep A infection are rheumatic heart disease mostly in resource-poor settings and invasive infection in high-income countries. Excess mortality due to Strep A is indirectly caused by the development of antimicrobial resistance resulting from the massive consumption of antibiotics. Globally, Strep A causes approximately 700 million human infection each year and there are more than 500,000 deaths due to Strep A diseases. Treatments of streptococcal infection are also very expensive. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine available to prevent this infection. Hence, a globally available safe and effective vaccine against Strep A is urgently needed to prevent streptococcal infection to reduce associated morbidity and mortality.

### Clinical guidelines for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis… [^433536c4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can occur after streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infections.
- PSGN often requires hospitalization, but mild or subclinical cases can occur.
- The prognosis for PSGN is good, especially for children.
- Treatment focuses on symptom management and giving antibiotics.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with PSGN. Clinical features The clinical features of acute glomerulonephritis include:

- Edema
- Hypertension
- Proteinuria
- Macroscopic hematuria, with urine appearing dark, reddish-brown
- Complaints of lethargy, generalized weakness, or anorexia Edema is often pronounced in the face and around the eyes, especially on arising in the morning.

Laboratory findings Laboratory examination usually reveals:

- Mild normocytic normochromic anemia
- Slight hypoproteinemia
- Elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
- Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
- Low total hemolytic complement and C3 complement Patients usually have decreased urine output. Urine examination often reveals protein and hemoglobin with red blood cell casts. Subclinical and mild illness Subclinical cases of PSGN with only microscopic hematuria and decreased complement levels can occur. Some individuals may have symptoms that are mild enough to not come to medical attention. Treatment Treatment of PSGN focuses on managing hypertension and edema. Antibiotics Patients should receive penicillin to eradicate any remaining group A strep. This will help prevent spread of the bacteria to other people. Complications The prognosis of PSGN in children is very good.

More than 90% of children make a full recovery. Adults with PSGN are more likely to have a worse outcome due to residual renal function impairment. Preventing primary illness It's important to prevent the primary group A streptococcal skin or pharyngeal infection. Treating patients with PSGN with antibiotics can stop group A strep from circulating in a household. Thus, treating patients with PSGN can prevent additional infections among close contacts.

Methods

Setting.

In 2016, the estimated resident population in the NT was 228,833. Aboriginal Australians constitute approximately 30% of the population, and 80% of the NT Aboriginal population live in remote or very remote locations. The Top End of the NT has two seasons: the cooler dry season which runs from April to September and the hot, rainy, and humid wet season from October to March. In Central Australia, there is a desert climate with intermittent rain throughout the year and cooler weather from April to September (mean temperature range 4–28°C) than the months of October to March (mean temperature range 15–36°C).

Epidemiological data.

Data were collected as previously described, with the period of study identified from notifications between 1991 and 2016. This study concentrates on describing post-2008 data, a previously undescribed period. Table 1 describes the case definition of a confirmed and probable case. Reoccurrence of disease was identified through matching at least two of the following notification fields including first name, surname, and date of birth. An outbreak year was declared if the number of notifications in the NT for a particular year more than doubled the mean number of notifications for the preceding 4 years.

Ethics approval.

Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee, Menzies School of Health Research. HREC 2017–2914.

Statistical analysis.

Population data for incidence calculations were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and NT Department of Health Analysis and reported as a rate per 100,000 person-years. Unless stated otherwise, calculations for incidence were based on confirmed cases only.

Review criteria.

We searched Medline, Ebsco, and Pubmed using the terms (glomerulonephritis AND (strep OR streptococcal OR post-streptococcal OR poststreptococcal OR Group A Strep)) AND (studies OR study). The search was restricted to articles published in English language after 1965. We also searched reference lists of nephrology textbooks, review articles, and all articles and relevant reviews identified.

### Prevalence of group ain primary care patients and the utility of C-reactive protein and clinical scores for its identification in Thailand [^69cb2ee7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

A 2016 Cochrane review compared antibiotic treatment against placebo for sore throats and found some reduction in symptom severity. However, average symptom duration was reduced by only 16 hours. Reducing the risk of complications is often used as a justification for antibiotic treatment, but a large cohort study from 2006 to 2009, albeit from a high-income setting (UK), found the risk of suppurative complications (otitis media, sinusitis, quinsy, and cellulitis) to be around 1% with or without antibiotic treatment. There were no cases of acute rheumatic fever or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Nonetheless, these findings may not be applicable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is higher. The 2015 global burden of disease study found a high burden of rheumatic heart disease in Oceania, South Asia, and central sub-Saharan Africa. The burden is lower in Southeast Asia, and Thailand is considered non-endemic for rheumatic heart disease. Current guidelines recommend antibiotics for pharyngitis caused by GAS and that narrow-spectrum penicillins are most suitable. Concern is growing about increasing levels of GAS resistance to macrolide antibiotics.

It is important to identify those most likely to benefit from antibiotic use and to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use to limit AMR; to achieve this, a variety of methods have been used, but with limited success. The best current reference standard for diagnosis of GAS is culture, although the length of time required to generate results limits its use to affect management decisions in primary care. Alternatives for use in primary care include rapid antigen testing, clinical scores such as Centor and FeverPAIN, and biomarkers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP). Studies assessing CRP's performance in identifying the presence of GAS in patients presenting to primary care with sore throats or pharyngitis have produced mixed results, with some studies finding CRP predictive, – whereas others have not.– Rapid molecular tests for GAS are also being developed and have proved valuable in settings such as northern Australia, where a high burden of GAS, acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and acute rheumatic fever is evident.

Data sources and search strategy

This narrative review employed a targeted literature review methodology to identify relevant studies published in English in both local and international peer-reviewed journals. The databases searched included PubMed, Nepal Journals Online (NepJOL), Google Scholar, Web of Science, Hinari, and various local journals that were not indexed in these databases. Additional searches for conference abstracts and reviews were conducted using Google searches. The keywords used for the search included acute glomerulonephritis (AGN), post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN), infectious glomerulonephritis, Nepal, and children. All studies conducted between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2024 on APSGN or PIGN in Nepali children under 16 years of age were included in the review. The literature search was restricted to studies published since 2000 because relevant studies on APSGN before this period could not be found in local databases or printed journals. We excluded studies that focussed on the prevalence of streptococcal skin and throat infections in adults, APSGN in adults, and articles for which the abstract or full text could not be retrieved. All the authors searched the research databases separately and reviewed the studies independently and collaboratively.

Abstract.

Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) is an inflammatory kidney disease following infection with nephritogenic strains of Group A Streptococcus. In 1991, APSGN became notifiable in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia with cases recorded on the NT Notifiable Disease Database (NTNDS). The case definition of a confirmed case requires laboratory definitive evidence or laboratory suggestive evidence in conjunction with a clinically compatible illness. Probable cases require clinical evidence only. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis notifications from 2009 to 2016 were extracted from the NTNDS. Of the 322 cases, 261 were confirmed and 61 probable. The majority, 304 (94%), were Aboriginal and the median age was 8 years (range: 0–62 years). Incidence for confirmed cases was 13.8/100,000 person-years, with inclusion of probable cases increasing incidence to 17.0/100,000 person-years. Highest incidence of confirmed cases was in Aboriginal children less than 15 years of age at 124.0 cases/100,000 person-years. The rate ratio of confirmed cases in Aboriginal to non-Aboriginal Australians was 18.9 (95% confidence interval: 11.4–33.6). Recent trends show a consistently high number of notifications annually with less frequent outbreaks. The Aboriginal population of the NT continues to have high rates of APSGN with recent trends showing higher rates than previously reported. Sustained preventative efforts and continued surveillance strategies are needed.

Geographical location of the study population

Nepal is a landlocked South Asian country bordered largely by India to the east, south, and west and China to the north. The country is divided into three central geographical regions: the Himalayan, Hilly, and Terai lowlands, with distinct topographical features according to attitude (Fig. 1). The total population of Nepal is 29 million as of November 2021, of which 15 million are females (51.1%) and about 14 million are males (48.9%). Furthermore, the proportion of the population aged 14 years and younger was 27.8%. The average household size was 4.37 people per household, and the population density (number of people per square kilometre of area) was 198 in 2021. According to the 2021 census, the literacy rate in Nepal is 76.2% (men: 83.6% and women: 69.4%).

Nepal's healthcare system consists of private and public hospitals, with most people receiving healthcare services in public hospitals. The public health sector emphasises preventive care and curative services and plans the healthcare system. In contrast, the private sector focuses primarily on preventive and curative services. The government implements several public health programs, including financial assistance in kidney replacement services and health insurance, to improve the health of its citizens. Despite recent improvements in the healthcare infrastructure, health status and education status, several challenges persist. These include issues related to the performance of the healthcare system, the shortage of the healthcare workforce, the need for external financing to support healthcare expenditures, and the challenge of maintaining minimum quality standards for care at the point of service delivery.

Climate significantly influences human health and well-being as it is linked to air quality, sanitation, and infectious disease outbreaks. The climate of Nepal varies significantly with altitude. The southern lowlands experience a tropical-subtropical climate, whereas the lower mountain ranges or hilly areas have a temperate climate. In contrast, the Himalayas are characterised by a cold climate. Due to these geographical differences, Nepal has five distinct seasons (spring, summer, monsoon, autumn, and winter), unlike many Western countries. The changing climate and temperature during these seasons make Nepalese children more susceptible to recurrent skin and respiratory infections.

### Case report: concurrent rheumatic fever and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in a high-burden setting [^fafd37b7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

We report a case of acute rheumatic fever with severe pancarditis occurring simultaneously with probable acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in a previously well, Australian Aboriginal, 29-year-old male. These autoimmune streptococcal sequelae are usually considered pathogenetically distinct, and concurrence has not previously been reported from this high-burden setting. We hypothesize that a single type of infecting group A Streptococcus (Strep A) triggered both autoimmune sequelae. Salient features included mitral and aortic regurgitation that worsened during the acute illness, painful pericarditis, and high troponin; severe acute kidney injury with oliguria, hematuria, and macroalbuminuria; reduced complement (C3); and elevated streptococcal serology. The case highlights important diagnostic and management challenges. It also illustrates the serious morbidity impact of the complications of Strep A.

### Poststreptococcal illness: recognition and management [^eedd5a93]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus can cause several postinfectious, nonsuppurative immune- mediated diseases including acute rheumatic fever, poststreptococcal reactive arthritis, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders, and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Except for sporadic outbreaks, poststreptococcal autoimmune syndromes occur most commonly in sub-Saharan Africa, India, Australia, and New Zealand. Children younger than three years are rarely affected by group A streptococcus pharyngitis or rheumatic fever, and usually do not require testing. Rheumatic fever is a rare condition that presents as a febrile illness characterized by arthritis, carditis or valvulitis, and neurologic and cutaneous disease, followed many years later by acquired valvular disease. Recurrence rates are high. In addition to evidence of recent streptococcal infection, two major or one major and two minor Jones criteria are required for diagnosis. Electrocardiography, chest radiography, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and an antistreptolysin O titer are the most useful initial tests. Echocardiography is recommended to identify patients with subclinical carditis. The arthritis usually responds within three days to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis is nonmigratory, can affect any joint, and typically does not respond to aspirin. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders affect the basal ganglia and are manifested by obsessive-compulsive and tic disorders. The presentation of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis ranges from asymptomatic microscopic hematuria to gross hematuria, edema, hypertension, proteinuria, and elevated serum creatinine levels.

### Acute post-bacterial glomerulonephritis in renal transplant patients: description of three cases and review of the literature [^1d18c292]. American Journal of Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Only a few cases of acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis have been described in renal transplant patients. We report here three cases of acute post-bacterial glomerulonephritis in renal transplants. In contrast to the classic cases of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis the type of infection was heterogeneous: respectively, Escherichia coli bacteremia, a skin abscess, and cholangitis. The clinical presentation was characterized by a deterioration of graft function in two of our three patients. Acute renal dysfunction recovered in both patients, but in the long term the outcome was severe; two of the three patients lost their graft function. It is difficult to ascertain whether progression was due to chronic allograft nephropathy, to glomerulonephritis, or both. It may be concluded that acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis is a possible, although rare, complication in renal transplant recipients. It has an unusual presentation and may have a poor outcome in the long term. The role of therapy, if any, is still undefined.

Conclusion

This case reflects the diagnostic challenge of differentiating between PSGN and C3G in pediatric patients, particularly in the early stages, due to their overlapping clinical and pathological features. Herein, we describe a rare and complex presentation of atypical PSGN, complicated by autoimmune hemolytic anemia and a THBD gene polymorphism associated with C3G. Corticosteroids had a beneficial effect towards the reduction of proteinuria and haematuria. Nevertheless, more studies are deemed necessary to further investigate the exact role of the THBD gene in children with PSGN and complement dysregulation in general and provide further insight into the prognosis and benefits of immunosuppression in this rare population. Whether our patient has a greater risk of progression to C3G and consequently chronic kidney disease in the future remains to be further investigated.

In modern series, streptococcal infections account for only 28%–47% of postinfectious acute GN, with Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated in 12%–24% of cases and gram negative bacteria in up to 22% of cases. Shunt nephritis is described as an immune complex–mediated GN that "rarely develops" as a complication of chronic infection of ventriculoatrial, ventriculojugular, or ventriculoperitoneal shunts.

### A narrative review of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in nepali children [^abbc26b0]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The incidence of APSGN is slowly decreasing, while that of staphylococcal-associated glomerulonephritis is increasing in Western countries. A similar trend of decreasing incidence of PIGN has also been observed in Nepal, according to a recent study. Few studies have documented scrubs, mumps, and pneumonia as aetiologies of post-infectious glomerulonephritis. PIGN was often used interchangeably with APSGN because of the lack of diagnostic modalities, such as complement levels, serological testing, and kidney biopsy, which are necessary for evaluating various types of glomerulonephritis and potential causes of PIGN. The inaccessibility of these tests to confirm APSGN diagnosis in many health centres in Nepal is not different from that in many developing countries. Fortunately, there have been improvements in access to kidney services and diagnostic facilities in various health centres across major cities in recent years. This has led to an increase in the number of APSGN and other cases of glomerulonephritis cases being diagnosed. A study observed a decline in the number of children seeking nephrology services at a clinic over a ten-year period. This trend may be due to improved access to kidney services in various healthcare settings rather than an actual decrease in the incidence of kidney diseases.

### A rare sequela of untreated Streptococcus pharyngitis: a case report [^a73bb84e]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharyngitis is commonly caused by the gram positive bacteria, streptococcus. Given the potential morbid complications of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis, antibiotics are critical. One of the rarer complications is pulmonary-renal syndrome (PRS), defined as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. PRS is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, making swift diagnosis and treatment imperative for survival. More common causes of PRS are tied to autoimmune diseases. This case describes a novel progression of PRS caused by streptococcus. A 26-year-old male with no significant medical history presented to our emergency department with streptococcal group A-positive sore throat. After discontinuing amoxicillin due to pruritus, the patient returned one month later with persisting hematuria and dysuria, diagnosed with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Despite receiving another antibiotic prescription, it was not filled. He returned six days later with worsening symptoms, leading to ICU admission due to hemoptysis requiring subsequent intubation. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was confirmed with bronchial washings. Negative autoimmune laboratory results and clinical symptoms suggest streptococcal pharyngitis induced pulmonary-renal syndrome. Although only the sixth case of streptococcal induced PRS, it is imperative to consider when treating patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, due to its possible mortality. Prompt recognition and treatment with pulse steroids and plasmapheresis is crucial for PRS resolution. Laryngoscope, 135:1940–1942, 2025.

### A rare sequela of untreated Streptococcus pharyngitis: a case report [^ce79b248]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Streptococcus is a common bacterium that causes pharyngitis. Timely antibiotic treatment is critically important to prevent severe complications. One of the rarest complications of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis is pulmonary‐renal syndrome (PRS), defined by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (PGN) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).PGN is a swiftly worsening form of kidney inflammation within the glomeruli, causing a reduction in the kidney's ability to filter waste. This presents with edema, hematuria, and hypertension which leads to kidney failure if not treated promptly.DAH presents with hemoptysis and respiratory distress due to small capillaries bleeding into the alveolar spaces of the lungs. The accumulation of blood impairs gas exchange, leading to rapidly developing respiratory failure, often requiring mechanical ventilation.

Together these conditions form PRS, a condition with high rates of morbidity and mortality, requiring urgent medical intervention. Although PRS is more commonly associated with autoimmune disorders, post‐streptococcal PRS is exceedingly rare, highlighting the need for early recognition and treatment. The goal of this case report is to raise awareness of an extremely rare complication of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis: pulmonary‐renal syndrome. This case emphasizes the importance of early antibiotic adherence and guiding providers on the swift diagnosis and management of PRS to improve patient outcomes.

Histopathological finding

In a study of patients who underwent kidney biopsies for various indications of glomerular disease, PIGN was identified as a common condition, with 18 of 97 patients (18.6%) diagnosed with PIGN. In Nepalese studies, kidney biopsies were performed in complex cases of APSGN/PIGN with rapid deterioration of kidney function or delayed resolution of clinical or laboratory parameters, diagnostic dilemmas and positive ANA status. Recent studies indicate that approximately 7.9–15.6% of patients require kidney biopsy to confirm their diagnosis or investigate persistent clinical symptoms to rule out other conditions. These recent findings are further supported by additional studies indicating that only a small number of patients with APSGN or PIGN require kidney biopsy (Table 7). In most studies, diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (DPGN) was the characteristic histopathological feature of APSGN. Among the 12 children who underwent kidney biopsy for proteinuria due to APSGN, 10 had features of DPGN. These findings highlighted that DPGN was the most prevalent histopathological finding in the clinical context of APSGN in Nepali children, although other histopathological findings may be infrequently present (Table 7). The most common indications for kidney biopsy in cases of APSGN/PIGN included rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, persistent nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypertension, and impaired renal function.

In a study of 97 paediatric kidney biopsies, 10 (9.7%) children underwent biopsy for rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, with post-infectious glomerulonephritis accounting for half of these cases (five patients). All cases of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis due to PIGN showed crescentic glomerulonephritis in kidney biopsies. However, another study found that only one in three patients with PIGN with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis had crescentic glomerulonephritis, while the remaining patients had DPGN.

### Perineal streptococcal dermatitis / disease: recognition and management [^a329877d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Perianal streptococcal dermatitis (PSD) is a pediatric dermatologic infectious disease predominantly affecting children, particularly younger children, which is most commonly caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). Although the clinical picture of a sharply demarcated erythema is very characteristic, PSD is often misdiagnosed for long periods of time and patients are subjected to treatments for a variety of differential diagnoses. Vulvar and penile involvement with similar signs and symptoms have been documented in several patients with PSD. The diagnosis is made by either a swab of the affected region submitted for microbiological analysis with the specific question for GABHS, or a rapid strep test. Systemic antibiotics such as penicillin, erythromycin, newer macrolides, or others, probably augmented by topical antiseptic or antibiotic ointments are the treatment of choice. Treatment duration should be at least 14 days or, even better, 21 days, and be dictated by clinical and microbiological cure. Therefore treatment success should be investigated not only by clinical examination but also by post-treatment perineal swabs as well as a urine analysis to monitor for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. The author of this review supports the recent suggestion to summarize GABHS-induced vulvovaginal and penile infections together with PSD under the inclusive term 'perineal streptococcal disease' because these conditions coincide, share important clinical characteristics and, therefore, represent manifestations of the same disease.

Introduction

Aboriginal Australians suffer one of the highest rates of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the world. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) is an inflammatory kidney disease caused by prior infection with nephritogenic strains of Group A Streptococcus (GAS). Previous work by Hoy et al.reported APSGN as a major risk factor for the development of CKD in the Australian Aboriginal population living in remote communities.

Recognition of the heavy burden of disease in the Northern Territory (NT) led to establishment of case definitions, mandatory clinician notification of disease, and establishment of an APSGN database in 1991. The purpose of notification includes facilitating accurate disease monitoring and directed public health response. The confirmed case requires either laboratory definitive evidence (renal biopsy suggestive of APSGN) or the presence of both laboratory suggestive evidence and clinical evidence (Table 1). A contact is defined as those staying in the house in the 2 weeks preceding the onset of the illness.

Table 1
Case definition for notification of APSGN in the Northern Territory

The epidemiology of APSGN in the NT from 1991 to 2008 has previously been reported. This article describes the epidemiology of APSGN in the NT from 2009 to 2016 and identifies trends. A review of the literature enables a comparison of NT disease burden against global trends.

### C3-glomerulonephritis in new zealand-a case series [^3b2788a3]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are no randomized trials to guide treatment decisions. Other treatments, such as plasma exchange and rituximab have only been discussed in case reports. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody widely used in complement-mediated HUS, has also been used in several case reports. Eculizumab acts on complement protein C5 to reduce the production of downstream complement factors which lead to glomerular injury in C3GN. Patients being considered for immunosuppression for treatment of C3GN in New Zealand usually receive prednisone and MMF. Prospective randomized trials would be useful to confirm the best treatment regimen.

Interestingly, we found only one underlying complement abnormality, although comprehensive complement testing was not performed in many cases. Previous reports state that up to 50% of cases of C3GN are caused by the presence of C3NeF. This patient had factor H deficiency on gene testing and was treated with prednisone and MMF and had stable disease at follow-up. Initial screening available in New Zealand includes testing for C3NeF and Factor H deficiency. Testing for underlying complement pathway abnormalities may have particularly utility in those being considered for future renal transplantation. Three of our cases had underlying monoclonal gammopathy, which has a well-established association with C3GN. It is unknown whether Pacific Island patients have an underlying susceptibility to complement dysfunction which may account for the higher disease incidence in this population, or whether other novel mechanisms exist. Pacific Island patients have higher rates of diabetes, hypertension and obesity which result in higher rates of ESRD. Aside from post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, it is unknown whether Pacific Island patients are more susceptible to other forms of glomerulonephritis. Pacific Island patients in our cohort did not appear to have significant differences in treatment or clinical outcomes.

The main limitation of this study is the small number of patients, however our data set represents all cases in our region of New Zealand over the past 10 years. Our histopathology laboratory serves around 1.9 million patients giving an estimated annual incidence of 1.3 per million, similar to that documented elsewhere. We were not able to collect a sufficient number of patients to allow multivariate logistic regression to detect important predictors of renal outcome. As a result, any inferences of treatment efficacy are limited. Patients with more severe disease may have been more likely to receive immunosuppression. Although not performed in our centre, it has been suggested that C3GN patients with monoclonal gammopathy should undergo pronase immunofluorescence studies to rule out masked Ig deposits. As noted, limited complement and genetic testing was available at our centre and this information could have implications on the treatment that patients are offered.

### Reversible encephalopathy complicating post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [^86a82548]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

We describe a 15-year-old boy with acute transient encephalopathy complicating poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Based on advanced magnetic resonance imaging, cerebral alterations were related to cerebrovascular autoregulatory dysfunction (ie, a vasogenic edema) and vasculitis was excluded. These insights into the pathophysiology improve patient management and argue against the therapeutic immunosuppression postulated by some authors.

### Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of macrolide, lacosamide, and streptogramin resistance in clinically resistant streptococci and their correlation with reduced biocide susceptibility [^1212275e]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Streptococci are a genus of Gram-positive bacteria responsible for a wide range of infections, from mild pharyngitis (caused by S. pyogenes) to severe conditions like pneumonia (S. pneumoniae), sepsis, and necrotizing fasciitis. Their clinical importance lies in their ability to cause both localized and systemic diseases, as well as post-infectious complications such as rheumatic heart disease and glomerulonephritis. Treatment often involves β-lactam antibiotics like penicillin, but MLS agents are critical alternatives, especially for penicillin-allergic patients. MLS antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. Furthermore, lincosamides like clindamycin are valuable in deep-seated infections due to their ability to suppress toxin production and penetrate biofilms. MLS antibiotics remain a key component of tailored therapy, guided by susceptibility testing and resistance patterns, ensuring effective management of streptococcal infections in diverse clinical scenarios. However, rising resistance to MLS antibiotics, driven by mechanisms such as ribosomal target modification, efflux pumps, and enzymatic inactivation, poses a significant challenge to their clinical utility. These resistance pathways reduce drug efficacy, complicating treatment strategies and underscoring the need for ongoing resistance surveillance to guide appropriate antibiotic stewardship.

### The global burden of sore throat and group apharyngitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^757b7ced]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical and methodological heterogeneity was high among the studies, with no two studies sharing the same combination of age range, surveillance type, screening methodology, and microbiological testing protocol, which makes within- and between-country comparisons unreliable. We excluded studies with six or fewer months of follow up from meta-analysis, as the extrapolated annual rate could be biased due to the seasonal pattern of Strep A sore throat. Further, few studies included data collected within the past several years, which introduces uncertainty regarding the accuracy of disease burden estimates for 2020. For example, it is possible that there have been temporal changes in incidence, which is not reflected in our estimate. Considering prospective vaccines targeted at Strep A sore throat, more globally representative data and more consistent surveillance methodology needs to be adopted to better determine the full potential health, economic, and societal value of vaccines. This requires epidemiological protocols that include consensus case definitions and best practice surveillance guidelines to improve the accuracy of global disease estimates and allow accurate within- and between-country comparisons in the future.

Notwithstanding these limitations, our results indicate that Strep A sore throat causes 0.1 million DALYs among children each year globally. RHD, one of the gravest clinical endpoints of Strep A infection, was reportedly responsible for 0.5 million DALYs among 5–14 year-old children and 10.7 million DALYs among all age groups in 2019. Global DALYs due to other Strep A clinical manifestations, such as cellulitis, sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, ARF, and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis have not been estimated. This study suggests that estimating the DALYs caused by all Strep A clinical manifestations could significantly increase our understanding of the burden of Strep A and provide evidence for the importance of Strep A sore throat as a clinical indicator for vaccines.

### Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in the Northern territory of Australia: a review of data from 2009 to 2016 and comparison with the literature [^a447f7b1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Marshall et al.have previously reported 16 years data on APSGN from the NT of Australia. They reported 415 confirmed cases and 23 probable cases during the study period of 1991 to July 2008. The current data reveal that the NT of Australia continues to have a heavy burden of APSGN with 261 confirmed and 61 probable cases between 2009 and 2016.

Incidence in children less than 15 years of age has significantly increased in both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. Before 2009, Marshall et al. identified an incidence in Aboriginal children less than 15 years of age at 94.3 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 84.2–105.3) compared with our more recent finding of 124.0 person-years (95% CI: 108.4–141.2). In non-Aboriginal children, incidence has increased from 2.3 (95% CI: 1.2–4.2) for the 1991–2008 period to 6.6 (95% CI: 3.7–10.6) cases per 100,000. It is not known if there is a real increase in the number of cases or greater reporting of cases. Interestingly, the Aboriginal to non-Aboriginal rate ratio in the same age group has significantly decreased from 53.6 (95% CI: 32.6–94.8) to 18.9 (95% CI: 11.4–33.6) pre- and post-2009. We do not know if this decreasing gap between disease burden in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children represents greater burden of disease in non-Aboriginal children or greater identification and reporting of APSGN in this population.

Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (GN) — epidemiology and management — shows increasing occurrence due to staphylococcal species and health care–associated endocarditis, and antibiotic treatment needs to be continued for 4–6 weeks, although hematuria, proteinuria, and azotemia may persist for months. An IgA-dominant postinfectious GN associated with staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is most common in the elderly and in diabetics, hypocomplementemia is present in the majority of cases, and it needs to be distinguished from idiopathic IgAN and HSP so that it is not treated with corticosteroids.

### Clinicopathological and prognostic study of IgA-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis [^38ad7118]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

IgA-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis, as a special form of postinfectious glomerulonephritis, has been reported increasingly since it was first proposed by Nasr et al. in 2003. Most of the classic cases are secondary to skin infection and often relate to staphylococcal infection. Diabetes and advanced age are the risk factors. The diagnosis mainly depends on renal pathology, which is characterized by diffuse endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis under light microscopy, IgA-dominant or codominant immune complex deposits under immunofluorescence, and hump-like electron dense deposition in mesangial area and subepithelium under electron microscopy. However, there were also reports of atypical cases of IgA-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis, which were difficult to be distinguished from other diseases. For example, Mark Haas et al. and Yao-Ko Wen et al. reported 13 cases and 10 cases of IgA-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis respectively. They pointed out that IgA-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis was similar to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in light microscopy, immunofluorescence and ultrastructure. The underlying infection may be subclinical, non-staphylococcal or both, and can occur in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Eric Wallace et al. reported a case of IgA-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis associated with colitis caused by Clostridium difficile. Its pathogenesis was similar to that of active IgA nephropathy, and the clinical and pathological manifestations were highly similar. Marc Saad et al. also reported a case with pulmonary-renal syndrome as the main manifestation. The above study found some difficulty in differentiating IgA-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis when the presentation is atypical from other glomerulonephritis, especially primary IgA nephropathy, which can have similar light microscopy and immunofluorescence manifestations, but the treatment options for the two are different, and the prognosis of patients with IgA-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis is often reported worse. However, the above studies are mainly case reports, or retrospective reviews, or single-center case series, and the sample size is often small, so it is difficult to fully explain the clinicopathological characteristics, prognosis and differentiation of the disease from other similar diseases.

The patient has poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The latent period is one to three weeks after GABHS pharyngitis or three to six weeks after GABHS pyoderma. The presentation varies from asymptomatic microscopic hematuria to gross hematuria, edema, hypertension, proteinuria, and elevated serum creatinine levels. More than 97% of the 470, 000 annual cases occur in resource-poor settings. 42, 43 The prognosis is excellent for most children, but less so for older adults or certain high-risk populations. 9 Treatment is supportive. Salt and water restriction with concurrent furosemide can help treat the edema and hypertension, if present. Diuresis usually begins within one week; dialysis is rarely required.

Renal function normalizes in four to six weeks and hematuria resolves in three to six months, but proteinuria may persist for up to three years. 14 Rarely, a patient will have a relapse years after the initial illness. 14.

### Scabies [^5376fabf]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Scabies is a neglected parasitic disease that is a major public health problem in many resource-poor regions. It causes substantial morbidity from secondary infections and post-infective complications such as acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Disease control requires treatment of the affected individual and all people they have been in contact with, but is often hampered by inappropriate or delayed diagnosis, poor treatment compliance, and improper use of topical compounds such as permethrin, lindane, or benzyl benzoate. In addition to concerns over toxicity with such compounds, parasite resistance seems to be increasing. Oral ivermectin is an alternative that has been used successfully in community control programmes. Plant derivatives such as turmeric, neem, and tea tree oil are also promising future treatments. The disease is strongly associated with poverty and overcrowding, and the associated stigma can ostracise affected individuals. Treatment of scabies in poor countries needs to integrate drug treatment programmes with efforts to improve the socioeconomic conditions and education programmes to reduce stigma. We expect the future to bring more sensitive and specific clinical and laboratory-based diagnostic methods, as well as new therapeutic strategies.

### A rare sequela of untreated Streptococcus pharyngitis: a case report [^83db0753]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharyngitis is commonly caused by the gram positive bacteria, streptococcus. Given the potential morbid complications of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis, antibiotics are critical. One of the rarer complications is pulmonary‐renal syndrome (PRS), defined as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. PRS is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, making swift diagnosis and treatment imperative for survival. More common causes of PRS are tied to autoimmune diseases. This case describes a novel progression of PRS caused by streptococcus.

A 26‐year‐old male with no significant medical history presented to our emergency department with streptococcal group A‐positive sore throat. After discontinuing amoxicillin due to pruritus, the patient returned one month later with persisting hematuria and dysuria, diagnosed with post‐streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Despite receiving another antibiotic prescription, it was not filled. He returned six days later with worsening symptoms, leading to ICU admission due to hemoptysis requiring subsequent intubation. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was confirmed with bronchial washings. Negative autoimmune laboratory results and clinical symptoms suggest streptococcal pharyngitis induced pulmonary‐renal syndrome.

Although only the sixth case of streptococcal induced PRS, it is imperative to consider when treating patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, due to its possible mortality. Prompt recognition and treatment with pulse steroids and plasmapheresis is crucial for PRS resolution. Laryngoscope, 135:1940–1942, 2025

### Diagnostic accuracy of quickVue® dipstick strep A test and its effect on antibiotic prescribing in children in the United Arab Emirates [^cc33c406]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) has reached alarming proportions. It is estimated that ARB account for 700,000 annual deaths globally. This number could multiply to 10 million deaths a year by 2050 without a coordinated global response to this epidemic. The primary driver for increasing resistance rates is the inappropriate use of antibiotics in healthcare settings. Measures taken to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use have led to a reduction in rates of antibiotic resistance. In countries that lack guidelines on responsible antibiotic prescribing, however, rising rates of ARB threaten the dawn of a post-antibiotic era.

Children are frequently prescribed oral antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), even though the majority of episodes are viral in origin. This unnecessary antibiotic use not only drives increasing rates of antibiotic resistance but also leads to adverse drug reactions. In the United States, adverse drug reactions from antibiotic use are the most common reason for paediatric and adolescent visits to the emergency room.

In an earlier study in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), bacterial pharyngotonsillitis secondary to group A ß-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) infection accounted for only 14% of paediatric URTIs. Most children with GAS pharyngotonsillitis will recover without antibiotics. However, treatment is recommended to prevent transmission to contacts and limit complications such as acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which can cause significant morbidity.

Clinical features alone are ineffective in distinguishing between GAS and viral pharyngitis except when typical viral features like rhinorrhea, cough, and oral ulcers are present. In addition, clinical scoring systems for GAS lack the required sensitivity or specificity to eliminate the need for microbiologic testing in children and adolescents with clinical features suggestive of GAS infection. Throat culture, the current gold standard for diagnosis of GAS, can take up to 48 h to become available. Efforts have been ongoing to develop increasingly sensitive rapid tests for the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis. An ideal test should be quick, simple and accurate.

We describe the case of a 48-year-old man with an acute nephritis and respiratory failure. Clinical history, streptococcal antibody titres and renal biopsy led to a diagnosis of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Respiratory investigations excluded pulmonary oedema and infection. We hypothesize that this man had a co-existing post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and an immune-mediated pneumonitis. This is a very rare association, which was last described in 1982.

Distinguishing potentially reversible causes of central nervous system events from primary cerebral infarction or hemorrhage in patients with sickle cell disease is important because the management and prognosis of these complications is very different. Similarly, because of the difference in prognosis between APSGN and other forms of sickle cell nephropathy, it is also important to differentiate these conditions.

Linear IgA bullous disease of childhood is a rare autoimmune blistering disease. We report eight patients with this disease seen in our autoimmune bullous diseases clinic over a span of 12 years. They constituted 89% of the total number of those with linear IgA bullous disease of childhood seen during this period, with an age-adjusted minimum estimated incidence of 2.3 cases/million population/year. Males outnumbered females by a 1.7:1 ratio. The age at onset ranged between 10.5 months and 13 years, with a mean of 6.8 ± 4.17 years. The majority of patients (62.5%) had moderately severe disease. Fifty percent of patients were observed to have an association with either an autoimmune disease (Crohn disease and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in one each) or an infection (beta-hemolytic streptococcal and hepatitis A virus infection in one each). The treatment of choice was dapsone alone or in combination with systemic steroids. Seventy-one percent of patients achieved complete remission by the end of 2 years.

Although there was the possibility of post-infectious glomerulonephritis based on findings of glomerular deposits in the kidney biopsy, the patient did not show symptoms of streptococcal infection such as pharyngitis or a rash prior to admission. The patient's C3 level was normal and he was not hypertensive. Based on patient's previous exposure to nivolumab and lymphocyte infiltration observed in the biopsy, immunotherapy-induced kidney injury was taken into consideration. Nivolumab was discontinued and methylprednisolone administration 40 mg intravenously twice a day was started. The following day, serum potassium increased to 5.6 mmol/L, and creatinine and BUN were elevated at 11.01 and 63 mg/dL, respectively. Nephrology was consulted and hemodialysis was initiated. Methylprednisolone was increased to 40 mg three times a day (1 mg/kg/day). After the biopsy report, the patient was started on pulse dose steroids, methylprednisolone 1 g intravenously daily for 3 days, followed by methylprednisolone 40 mg intravenously three times a day. The creatinine level decreased after steroid treatment and hemodialysis. Four days later, steroids were changed to oral prednisone 40 mg twice a day and the patient was discharged on steroid treatment and outpatient hemodialysis. On the day of discharge, his creatinine level was 8.80 mg/dL.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^cb2f2984]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Prognosis and therapy of classic bacterial infection–related glomerulonephritis (GN) syndromes — postinfectious GN, shunt nephritis, endocarditis-related GN, and IgA-dominant infection-related GN — are outlined with general management and monitoring guidance. In postinfectious GN, short-term prognosis in children is excellent but in the elderly mortality may be up to 20%, and persistently low C3 beyond 12 weeks may be an indication for kidney biopsy to particularly exclude C3GN. In shunt nephritis, outcome is good with early diagnosis and treatment of infection and most patients recover some kidney function but are left with residual chronic kidney disease; the natural history of the PR3-ANCA seen in some patients is unclear and requires follow-up. In endocarditis-related GN, immediate prognosis is good with prompt infection eradication and some may require valve replacement, while the utility of glucocorticoids and immunosuppression is unproven and carries serious potential risks, even in cases with crescentic GN. For IgA-dominant infection-related GN, dialysis is frequently required in the acute setting and recovery is guarded, with < 20% returning to pre-morbid levels of kidney function; for severe kidney functional impairment, weigh risks and benefits of immunosuppression, and a role for immunosuppression remains unproven and these agents should generally not be used, and the prognosis for recovery is poor, especially in diabetic subjects. Across conditions, no randomized controlled trials guide the treatment in any of these conditions; antibiotics for underlying infection are used per local guidelines, and follow kidney function, serum C3 and C4, urinalysis, albumin–creatinine ratio (ACR), and proteinuria at appropriate intervals until complete remission or return to baseline.

### Systematic literature review on the incidence and prevalence of heart failure in children and adolescents [^d5047470]. Pediatric Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Incidence of HF Associated with Anthracycline Treatment, HIV/AIDS, and Pneumonia

Three retrospective studies reported an incidence of HF between 1 and 5%, following anthracycline treatment of various childhood cancers (Table 4). In a cohort of 808 children from the Netherlands (aged 0‒16 years), 94% of 17 cases occurred during or within the first year of anthracycline therapy. In a US study, HF developed in 1% of 97 doxorubicin-treated patients aged 7 months–17 years. The one patient who developed HF received a cumulative dose of 450 mg/m² doxorubicin. The highest rate of 5% was reported in a Japanese study, in which 6 of patients on anthracycline developed HF. In the Japanese study, the mean total anthracycline dose received by these patients was 383 mg/m² (range: 180–520).

Multiple publications from the US-based P 2 C 2 HIV study reported the incidence of HF in children of HIV-infected mothers (Table 4). The study categorized children into two groups: group 1 included 199 vertically infected children aged 0.1–14 years with echocardiographic evaluations and group 2 included newborns (93 HIV-infected and 463 uninfected). In group 1, a 5-year cumulative HF incidence of 14% was reported during the 5-year follow-up. In group 2, a 5-year cumulative HF incidence of 5.1 versus 0.2% was reported among the infected and uninfected infants, respectively (Table 4).

In a further prospective Turkish study, 14% of 50 children aged 2–24 months with pneumonia developed HF (Table 4).

### Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis: where are we now [^b56c8dc3]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

The risk of carditis after PSRA in children is ∼8%, but remains unclear in adults. van Bemmel et al suggested no increased risk of carditis after median follow-up of 8.9 years, and advised no long-term prophylaxis. This was also reflected in a long-term follow-up case series from Mayo Clinic. There are strategies for primary and secondary prevention of carditis in ARF, but the need for chemoprophylaxis after PSRA is still debated. However the American Heart Association recommends 1 year of secondary prophylaxis with clinical monitoring for carditis.

Our case highlights the need of considering PSRA as one of the differentials for acute polyarthritis in adults and raises a number of unanswered questions about the management of PSRA. Most of the data of PSRA has come from paediatric follow-up studies, and adult inception cohort studies are lacking. There is no agreement about the need for and duration of penicillin prophylaxis. Giving 1–2 years of antibiotics prophylaxis to an adult without clear evidence is counterintuitive, particularly in view of increasing antibiotic resistance. As streptococcal infections in the adult population are increasingly reported, it is a timely opportunity to revisit PSRA and develop comprehensive treatment and antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines.

Learning points

Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis (PSRA) has now emerged as a different clinical entity to acute rheumatic fever.
PSRA should be considered as one of the differentials for acute polyarthritis in adults.
There is no agreement about the need and duration of penicillin prophylaxis for PSRA in current literature.

Guideline statements — bacterial infection-related GN prognosis and treatment — there are no randomized data to guide our treatment, and antibiotics should universally be given for treatment of the underlying infection. The decision to use glucocorticoids should weigh the potential risk of worsening infection versus the potential kidney benefit. Immunosuppressive agents should only be considered in those with rapidly progressive disease such as crescentic GN, and should account for the possibility of exacerbating the infection, and the best approach is to control the infection whenever possible prior to using steroids.

### Glomerulonephritis and managing the risks of chronic renal disease [^5ce1b17f]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The rising global burden of chronic renal disease, the high cost of providing renal replacement therapies, and renal disease also being a risk factor for cardiovascular disease is increasing focus on renal disease prevention. This article focuses on the aspects of renal disease (specifically poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis [PSGN] and chronic kidney disease [CKD]) in Indigenous populations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States that diverge from those typically seen in the general population of those countries. The spectrum of renal and many other diseases seen in Indigenous people in developed countries is similar to that seen in developing countries. Diseases like PSGN that have largely disappeared in developed countries still occur frequently in Indigenous people. CKD during the childhood years is due to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract in up to 70% of cases and occurs later in polycystic kidney disease and childhood-onset diabetes. Several risk factors for CKD in adulthood are already present in childhood.

Variant Forms

Rapidly progressive disease (defined as a ≥ 50% decline in eGFR over ≤ 3 months and > 50% crescentic glomeruli on kidney biopsy) has a poor prognosisand qualifies for urgent treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. Staphylococcus-associated GN with dominant IgA staining should be ruled out in these cases. Early treatment with glucocorticoids is also recommended for patients with IgA nephropathy and minimal change-like lesions.

C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) diagnostic approach — rule out infection-related or postinfectious GN before assigning a C3G diagnosis, perform comprehensive complement analysis to assist diagnosis, and evaluate for monoclonal protein in first presentations at ≥ 50 years of age; while the suggestion targets older adults, the commentary notes the phenomenon is more common in older adults but can occur at lower frequencies in younger adults.

Regarding medical management for immunoglobulin A nephropathy, more specifically with respect to management of IgAN with AKI, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that IgAN may also present with AKI either de novo or during its natural history due to RPGN, often with extensive crescent formation, commonly in the absence of visible hematuria. Perform a kidney biopsy as soon as possible when other causes of RPGN, such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis and anti-GBM disease, and reversible causes, such as drug toxicity and common pre- and post-kidney causes, have been excluded.

Guideline statements — bacterial infection-related glomerulonephritis (GN) diagnosis — kidney biopsy can be useful in suspected bacterial infection-related GN, particularly when evidence of infection is elusive or the diagnosis is in doubt, to assess prognosis and/or for potential therapeutic reasons, and in some cases biopsy may be critical for arriving at the correct diagnosis as comorbidities may contribute to confounding effects; the diagnosis of infection-related GN can be challenging, and kidney biopsy remains the gold standard. Despite the kidney biopsy's diagnostic utility, treatment is geared toward the clinical picture rather than the tissue-specific findings, and a presumptive diagnosis also can be made with positive cultures and/or serologic markers in patients with glomerular injury, particularly in children; even with an elusive infection, confirming a diagnosis of infection-related GN with a kidney biopsy rarely affects treatment and may not be necessary unless there is high suspicion for alternative disease.

### Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis: where are we now [^7864662d]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 35-year-old man presented with polyarthritis and constitutional symptoms, and a recent history of multiple tick bites and skin rash on trekking holiday. He did not respond to oral doxycycline and cephalexine for presumed Lyme's disease. Further investigation confirmed strongly positive streptococcal serology. There was absence of clinical or echocardiography evidence of heart involvement and immunological screening for inflammatory arthritis was negative. In the absence of other major Jones criteria for acute rheumatic fever, besides polyarthritis and the serological evidence of a recent streptococcal infection, a diagnosis of post-streptococcal reactive arthritis (PSRA) was also made. He responded well to penicillin therapy and has been started on oral penicillin prophylaxis as per available guidance. As streptococcal infections in the adult population are increasingly reported, it is a timely opportunity to revisit PSRA, and develop comprehensive treatment and antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines.

Implementation and challenges — bacterial infection-related GN histology — there is a broad range of histologic findings seen in bacterial-infection related GN, the spectrum is heterogeneous and evolving, and standardization between various case series is challenging; it should also be noted that some immune- or complement-mediated kidney diseases can be unmasked or triggered by infections.

### Acute rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal reactive arthritis: diagnostic and treatment practices of pediatric subspecialists in Canada [^2c00e878]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

We conducted a survey of pediatric specialists in rheumatology, cardiology, and infectious diseases to ascertain present Canadian clinical practice with respect to diagnosis and treatment of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and poststreptococcal reactive arthritis (PSReA), and to determine what variables influence the decision for or against prophylaxis in these cases.

Methods

A questionnaire comprising 6 clinical case scenarios of acute arthritis occurring after recent streptococcal pharyngitis was sent to members of the Canadian Pediatric Rheumatology Association, and to heads of divisions of pediatric cardiology and pediatric infectious diseases at the 16 university affiliated centers across Canada.

Results

There is considerable variability with respect to diagnosis in cases of ReA following group A streptococcal (GAS) infection both within and across specialties. There is extensive variability regarding the decision to provide prophylaxis in cases designated as ARF or PSReA. Findings indicated that physicians are most comfortable prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis in the presence of clear cardiac risk and are less inclined to such intervention for patients diagnosed with PSReA. When prophylaxis was recommended for cases of PSReA, the majority of respondents prescribed longer term courses of antibiotics.

Conclusion

The lack of observed consistency in diagnosis and treatment in cases of reactive arthritis post-GAS infection likely reflects the lack of universally accepted criteria for diagnosis of PSReA and insufficient longterm data regarding carditis risk within this population. There is a need for clear definitions and treatment guidelines to allow greater consistency in clinical practice across pediatric specialties.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): The panel made an explicit decision that the primary outcome driving the decision for any post-exposure prophylaxis is the ability to prevent infection; when the evidence demonstrates a very low likelihood of effective post-exposure prophylaxis, other outcomes become secondary; and when healthy persons are considered for preventive medications (such as would occur in post-exposure settings), a higher threshold for benefits is required and (even putative) harms become more important. The panel agreed that the overall certainty of the evidence against prophylaxis treatment with HCQ was moderate (failure to prevent infection) due to concerns with imprecision, and the panel balanced the lack of clear benefit with the increased risk of harms from the body of evidence reported in the treatment section, in addition to the side effects reported in the trials to make a strong recommendation. The guideline panel recommended against the use of HCQ as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for persons exposed to COVID-19.

### About post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis | Group A strep… [^dab4a680]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an inflammatory disease affecting the kidneys.
- It's rare, but PSGN can develop after strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo.
- Symptoms of PSGN usually point to kidney issues and long-term kidney damage can occur.
- Treatment usually focuses on managing swelling and blood pressure but can include antibiotics. Symptoms After strep throat or scarlet fever symptoms start: PSGN can develop about 10 days later. After impetigo symptoms start: PSGN can develop about 3 weeks later. Someone with PSGN usually has protein in the urine and hypertension. Symptoms can also include:

- Dark, reddish-brown urine
- Decreased need to pee or decreased amount of urine
- Edema
- Fatigue due to anemia The swelling occurs especially in the face, around the eyes, and in the hands and feet.

Some people may have no symptoms or symptoms that are so mild that they don't seek medical help. Complications Most people who develop PSGN recover within a few weeks without any complications. While rare, long-term kidney damage, including kidney failure, can occur. These rare complications are more common in adults than children. Causes PSGN can develop after infections caused by group A Streptococcus, specifically: PSGN is not a group A strep infection of the kidneys. Instead PSGN results from the body's immune system fighting off strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo. Spread to others People cannot catch PSGN from someone else. However, if someone with PSGN is still infected with group A strep bacteria, they can spread the bacteria to others. Group A strep bacteria are contagious. Keep ReadingCauses and How the Bacteria Spread. Treatment and recovery Treatment of PSGN focuses on managing symptoms as needed.

Healthcare providers limit salt and water intake or prescribe a diuretic to decrease swelling. A diuretic is a medicine that increases the flow of urine. Healthcare providers prescribe blood pressure medicine to manage the patient's blood pressure. Antibiotics People with PSGN who still have a group A strep infection are often given antibiotics.
