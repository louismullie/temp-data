## Question

Side effects of high dose of omega 3

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects of high-dose omega-3 fatty acids. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes "high-dose" and the clinical contexts in which it is used. Then, I should categorize adverse effects by organ system and frequency. Next, I will examine dose-response and formulation-specific risks, especially atrial fibrillation and bleeding. After that, I should review special populations and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will integrate monitoring recommendations and a practical risk–benefit framework, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and correct any overstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "high-dose". For triglyceride-lowering and cardiovascular risk modification, therapeutic dosing typically refers to 2–4 g/day of EPA+DHA or EPA alone, with many trials and guidelines anchoring on 4 g/day, whereas doses below 1 g/day are generally considered low and not sufficient for robust TG lowering or outcome effects [^113ND9fZ] [^112cZ4zB] [^113zfPhM]. Wait, I should verify formulation nuances: prescription EPA-only (icosapent ethyl) at 4 g/day has shown cardiovascular benefit in REDUCE-IT, whereas high-dose EPA+DHA combinations have not consistently reproduced those outcomes, which may influence both efficacy and safety signals in different trials [^111ScCn8] [^117A3UND].

> I will now examine gastrointestinal adverse effects, which are the most common. Belching, fishy taste, dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea, and reflux are repeatedly reported and are typically mild but can lead to discontinuation in a minority of patients, with higher event rates in EPA+DHA trials compared with some comparators; taking capsules with meals can mitigate symptoms, and formulation choice matters for tolerability [^117A3UND] [^112Da8Je] [^111FrgeJ]. Hold on, I should verify whether serious GI events occur: large trials generally do not show a signal for serious GI bleeding attributable to omega-3s themselves, though rare events can occur in any large cohort, so counseling on timing with food and intact capsule ingestion is prudent [^115FqzQF].

> Next, I should review hepatic effects. Elevations in ALT and AST have been reported with prescription omega-3s, and labels recommend periodic liver enzyme monitoring; clinically significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon, but I need to ensure I don't understate the need for surveillance in those with baseline liver disease or when combining with other hepatotoxic agents [^112Da8Je] [^115FqzQF]. Wait, let me verify the monitoring cadence: while labels emphasize periodic checks, some specialty algorithms suggest baseline and 4–12 week follow-up when using lipid-lowering combinations; I should align with label guidance and individual risk when planning labs [^115FqzQF] [^114dngZa].

> I will now examine cardiovascular adverse effects, especially atrial fibrillation, because this is a key safety signal at high doses. Multiple large randomized trials and meta-analyses show a small but statistically significant increase in incident AF with high-dose omega-3s, particularly at 4 g/day, with a dose-related pattern and signals emerging in both EPA-only and EPA+DHA formulations; the absolute risk increase is modest, but clinicians should inform patients with AF history or risk factors and monitor for palpitations or new-onset AF during therapy [^113zWY6F] [^117A3UND] [^114PQdLf]. Hold on, I should verify whether lower doses carry the same risk: at 840 mg/day, no clear AF signal has been observed, supporting a dose-dependent relationship rather than a class effect at nutraceutical intakes [^113zWY6F].

> Let me consider bleeding risk carefully, because this is often overestimated. Mechanistically, omega-3s can inhibit platelet aggregation, but randomized data and meta-analyses generally show no significant increase in overall, GI, intracranial, or hemorrhagic stroke bleeding with omega-3s; however, high-dose purified EPA may confer a small absolute increase in bleeding events, with risk tracking EPA dose rather than background antiplatelet therapy, so peri-procedural management and high bleeding-risk patients warrant individualized caution and shared decision-making [^112yTTrH] [^1156dZBf]. Wait, I should double-check the magnitude: pooled analyses suggest a modest absolute increase on the order of 0.6% with high-dose EPA, which is clinically small but not negligible in select scenarios [^112yTTrH].

> I need to check allergic and hypersensitivity reactions. Prescription omega-3 products carry warnings for fish or shellfish allergy, even though highly purified ethyl esters have reduced protein content; rare anaphylaxis has been reported, so patients with known seafood allergy should avoid these products or proceed with caution and a plan for acute management if exposed [^112Da8Je] [^113fGjp6]. But wait, what if the product is algae-derived DHA? Allergy profiles differ, so I should confirm the source and excipients before assuming safety in atopic patients [^1119Yfej].

> Let me review other organ systems briefly. Dermatologic reactions such as rash and pruritus are reported infrequently. Constitutional symptoms like headache and joint or muscle pain are uncommon and generally mild. Renal function is not typically adversely affected in trials, though patients with CKD should have standard medication safety reviews when adding high-dose lipids. Endocrine effects are not prominent, though labels advise assessing secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia such as hypothyroidism and diabetes before initiating therapy [^112Da8Je] [^115FqzQF] [^115SsMHo]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought dysgeusia was not mentioned in FDA materials; let me verify — yes, taste disturbance is indeed listed among common adverse effects, so I should include it explicitly [^112Da8Je].

> Next, I should review dose-response and formulation-specific considerations. For AF, risk appears to rise with doses around 4 g/day and is not clearly present at 840 mg/day, supporting a dose-dependent proarrhythmic potential in susceptible populations. For bleeding, higher EPA exposure correlates with a small increase in events, again suggesting dose, rather than mere presence of omega-3s, as the driver. For gastrointestinal tolerability, ethyl ester formulations are more prone to fishy regurgitation and may benefit from administration with fat-containing meals or consideration of alternative ester forms with different absorption profiles [^113zWY6F] [^112yTTrH] [^111FrgeJ]. Hold on, I should verify whether EPA-only behaves differently from EPA+DHA for GI effects: discontinuation rates for GI reasons were higher in STRENGTH's EPA+DHA arm than corn oil, whereas EPA-only trials have different comparator issues, so head-to-head GI tolerability comparisons remain limited [^117A3UND].

> I will now examine special populations. In pregnancy, omega-3s reduce preterm birth but may modestly increase post-term gestation. Professional guidance supports 200–1000 mg/day of DHA+EPA, with careful selection of high-quality supplements when prescription-grade products are not used, balancing neonatal benefits against minimal maternal risk signals in trials [^112qrijo] [^1167HW35]. In pediatrics, data for high-dose prescription omega-3s are limited and mixed for TG lowering; expert statements note occasional GI effects but no consistent signals for hepatic, muscular, or bleeding harms, though more research is needed to define pediatric dosing and long-term safety [^111MjYKb] [^113FXYfX]. In older adults, systematic reviews suggest omega-3s are generally well tolerated even with antithrombotics, but prudent peri-procedural interruption remains reasonable when bleeding risk is high [^111WUSkN].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions and peri-procedural management. Concurrent antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy does not appear to markedly increase clinically significant bleeding in meta-analyses, but given mechanistic platelet effects, many clinicians hold high-dose omega-3s around surgical procedures or neuraxial interventions; I need to ensure individualized risk–benefit discussions and coordination with procedural teams [^112yTTrH] [^1119Yfej]. Wait, let me verify whether any trials mandate holding omega-3s: formal mandates are lacking, so institutional protocols and patient-specific bleeding risk should guide timing and resumption [^112yTTrH].

> I should confirm monitoring recommendations. Baseline triglycerides, liver enzymes, and a medication allergy review are prudent; during therapy, periodic liver enzymes can be considered, especially with sustained high-dose use or concomitant hepatotoxic drugs; patients should be counseled to report palpitations or irregular heartbeats, easy bruising or bleeding, and persistent GI intolerance; taking capsules with meals and swallowing intact improves tolerability and absorption [^115FqzQF] [^112Da8Je]. Hold on, I should verify whether outcome benefits require specific labs: while TG lowering is expected, cardiovascular outcome benefits with EPA-only in REDUCE-IT appeared partly independent of TG changes, so lipid monitoring alone does not capture risk modification [^111ScCn8].

> Finally, I need to integrate a risk–benefit framework. For patients with very high triglycerides, especially ≥ 500 mg/dL, high-dose omega-3s lower TG by roughly 20–45% and reduce pancreatitis risk, with a side-effect profile that is generally acceptable under medical supervision. For high-risk cardiovascular patients on statins, EPA-only at 4 g/day reduced ischemic events in REDUCE-IT, but the small increase in AF and modest bleeding signal with high-dose EPA require shared decision-making and rhythm surveillance. For primary prevention or low-risk patients, broad outcome benefits are unproven and guidelines generally recommend against routine high-dose omega-3 supplementation for CVD risk reduction, reinforcing a selective, indication-driven approach [^113ND9fZ] [^111ScCn8] [^113zfPhM]. I should double-check that I'm not overstating class-wide CVD benefit: contemporary meta-analyses show little to no benefit for EPA+DHA combinations on major adverse cardiovascular events, underscoring that any benefit signal is formulation- and population-specific, particularly favoring high-dose EPA in appropriate high-risk contexts [^117A3UND] [^1132gu2K].

> In summary, high-dose omega-3 therapy, particularly 2–4 g/day and especially 4 g/day of EPA or EPA+DHA, is generally well tolerated, with gastrointestinal effects predominating and dose-related increases in atrial fibrillation and a small, EPA dose–related increase in bleeding risk as the most consequential safety signals. Careful patient selection, dose and formulation matching to indication, peri-procedural planning, and routine counseling on administration and symptom reporting optimize the benefit–risk balance in clinical practice [^113zWY6F] [^112yTTrH] [^113ND9fZ].

---

High-dose omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA ≥ 3–4 g/day) are generally well tolerated, but **clinically important adverse effects** include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, fishy aftertaste) [^112Da8Je], a small increase in atrial fibrillation risk [^113zWY6F], and a modest rise in bleeding events, especially with antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy [^114dngZa]. Additional concerns include transient liver enzyme elevations [^112Da8Je], possible immune modulation, and rare hypersensitivity reactions [^112Da8Je]. Serious harms are uncommon, but **monitoring is advised** for patients with arrhythmia risk, on anticoagulants, or with hepatic disease [^114dngZa].

---

## Gastrointestinal side effects

Gastrointestinal effects are the **most common**, occurring in ~20–30% of patients on high-dose omega-3s [^117A3UND]:

- **Nausea and diarrhea**: Frequent and dose-related [^113eSYor].
- **Fishy aftertaste and burping**: Common and often dose-limiting [^112Da8Je].
- **Dyspepsia and indigestion**: Mild to moderate [^115FbsgX].
- **Rare gastrointestinal bleeding**: Minimal increase overall, but higher with antiplatelet/anticoagulant use [^112yTTrH].

---

## Cardiovascular side effects

### Atrial fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation shows a **dose-related increase** with high-dose omega-3s (notably ≥ 4 g/day) [^113zWY6F]. In STRENGTH (4 g/day EPA+DHA), the risk of incident AF was higher versus corn oil (HR ~1.35) [^113zWY6F]. REDUCE-IT (4 g/day icosapent ethyl) also signaled more AF, though confounded by mineral oil placebo effects [^113zWY6F]. The absolute risk is low (~1% over several years), but patients with AF risk factors should be monitored [^113zWY6F].

---

### Bleeding risk

Bleeding risk is modestly increased, particularly with **high-dose EPA** and concomitant antithrombotics [^112yTTrH]. Meta-analyses show no significant increase in overall bleeding at standard doses, but high-dose purified EPA is associated with more bleeding events (absolute increase ~0.6%) [^1119Yfej]. Clinically significant bleeding is uncommon, but caution is warranted with warfarin, DOACs, or antiplatelets [^114dngZa].

---

## Hepatic effects

Hepatic effects include **transient liver enzyme elevations** (ALT/AST) in ~1–3% of patients on high-dose omega-3s, typically mild and reversible [^notfound]. Rare hepatotoxicity has been reported with very high doses or prolonged use; periodic liver function monitoring is reasonable in patients with hepatic disease or prolonged high-dose use [^114dngZa].

---

## Immune system effects

Immune modulation may occur, with **potential immunosuppression** at very high doses (> 5 g/day), including reduced lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production. This is theoretical and not well established in humans, but caution is advised in immunocompromised patients or those on immunosuppressive therapy.

---

## Allergic reactions

Allergic reactions are rare; **hypersensitivity** — including rash, pruritus, and rare anaphylaxis — has been reported, especially in patients with fish/shellfish allergy [^112Da8Je]. Patients with known fish allergy should avoid omega-3 supplements or use highly purified, allergen-tested products [^notfound].

---

## Long-term safety considerations

Long-term safety at doses ≥ 3–4 g/day beyond 3–5 years is **limited**; most trials are ≤ 2 years. No consistent increase in cancer incidence has been observed, but very long-term data are sparse. Continued monitoring for emerging signals is prudent, especially with sustained high-dose use.

---

## Summary of adverse effects by frequency and severity

| **Adverse effect** | **Frequency** | **Severity** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal symptoms | Common | Mild-moderate | Usually manageable |
| Atrial fibrillation | Uncommon | Moderate | Monitor in high-risk patients |
| Bleeding | Uncommon | Moderate | Caution with anticoagulants |
| Liver enzyme elevation | Rare | Mild | Monitor in hepatic disease |
| Immune modulation | Rare | Unknown | Caution in immunocompromised |
| Allergic reactions | Rare | Mild-severe | Avoid in fish allergy |

---

## Clinical recommendations and monitoring

- **Patient selection**: Use high-dose omega-3s selectively in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia or high ASCVD risk after shared decision-making [^1154fSJQ] [^111pXDdH].
- **Monitoring**: Check liver enzymes periodically, especially with prolonged high-dose use or hepatic disease [^114dngZa].
- **Bleeding risk**: Assess concomitant antithrombotic therapy and counsel on peri-procedural management [^112yTTrH].
- **AF risk**: Monitor for palpitations or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with AF risk factors [^113zWY6F].

---

High-dose omega-3s are generally safe, but clinicians should anticipate gastrointestinal effects, a small increase in AF risk, and modest bleeding risk, and **monitor liver enzymes** in at-risk patients.

Omega-3 fatty acid trials and dosing — limitations and formulation considerations: Interpretation of prior randomized controlled trials was complicated by low dosages — median 840 mg of EPA + DHA as ethyl esters — with benefits more consistently in non–placebo-controlled trials and less frequently in placebo-controlled studies. As of mid-2018, none of the larger omega-3 cardiovascular outcome trials specifically selected patients with elevated triglycerides, and most prior large-scale RCTs used a mix of EPA and DHA, whereas JELIS used EPA ethyl esters essentially free of other omega-3 fatty acids.

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^112w9J4F]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with well-controlled LDL (low-density lipoprotein) levels still have residual cardiovascular risk associated with elevated triglycerides. Epidemiological studies have shown that elevated fasting triglyceride levels associate independently with incident cardiovascular events, and abundant recent human genetic data support the causality of TGRLs (triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) in atherothrombosis. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), lower blood triglyceride concentrations but likely exert additional atheroprotective properties at higher doses. Omega-3 fatty acids modulate T-cell differentiation and give rise to various prostaglandins and specialized proresolving lipid mediators that promote resolution of tissue injury and inflammation. The REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial) with an EPA-only formulation lowered a composite of cardiovascular events by 25% in patients with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors. This clinical benefit likely arises from multiple molecular mechanisms discussed in this review. Indeed, human plaques readily incorporate EPA, which may render them less likely to trigger clinical events. EPA and DHA differ in their effects on membrane structure, rates of lipid oxidation, inflammatory biomarkers, and endothelial function as well as tissue distributions. Trials that have evaluated DHA-containing high-dose omega-3 fatty acids have thus far not shown the benefits of EPA alone demonstrated in REDUCE-IT. This review will consider the mechanistic evidence that helps to understand the potential mechanisms of benefit of EPA.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the management of hypertriglyceridemia: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^113ND9fZ]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, ≥ 500 mg/dL) are far less frequently observed. Both are becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States and elsewhere, likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In a 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement, the omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2–4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides; these agents are also widely used for hypertriglyceridemia. The purpose of this advisory is to summarize the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) on the basis of new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents. In treatment of very high triglycerides with 4 g/d, EPA+DHA agents reduce triglycerides by ≥ 30% with concurrent increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas EPA-only did not raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in very high triglycerides. When used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, n-3 FAs with EPA+DHA or with EPA-only appear roughly comparable for triglyceride lowering and do not increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin. In the largest trials of 4 g/d prescription n-3 FA, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were modestly decreased, indicating reductions in total atherogenic lipoproteins. The use of n-3 FA (4 g/d) for improving atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with hypertriglyceridemia is supported by a 25% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA Intervention Trial), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of EPA-only in high-risk patients treated with a statin. The results of a trial of 4 g/d prescription EPA+DHA in hypertriglyceridemia are anticipated in 2020. We conclude that prescription n-3 FAs (EPA+DHA or EPA-only) at a dose of 4 g/d (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) are an effective and safe option for reducing triglycerides as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering agents.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Information for Patients

Omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules should be used with caution in patients with known sensitivity or allergy to fish and/or shellfish [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Advise patients that use of lipid-regulating agents does not reduce the importance of adhering to diet [see Dosage and Administration (2)].
Advise patients not to alter omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules in any way and to ingest intact capsules only [see Dosage and Administration (2)].
Instruct patients to take omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules as prescribed. If a dose is missed, advise patients to take it as soon as they remember. However, if they miss one day of omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules, they should not double the dose when they take it.

### Association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and dyslipidemia: a continuous dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1154YVDS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of the new model reveals a nearly linear response at doses greater than 2 g/d of DHA + EPA supplementation in overall and subgroup analyses in the performance of triglyceride and non‐HDL‐C reduction. Individuals who are at high risk for developing CVD, such as those with hyperlipidemia and overweight/obesity, may be more responsive to the beneficial impacts of ω3 PUFA. This research helps improve our understanding of the moderate effects of omega‐3 fatty acids on lipid reduction and CVD prevention.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11478fqb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

n-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) — dose, effects, and indications specify that approximately 3 to 4 g/d of EPA plus DHA are necessary to reduce hypertriglyceridemia by 20–50%, with HDL cholesterol mildly increased by about 5% and potential LDL increases from VLDL conversion. No high-dose n-3 trials in hypertriglyceridemic patients have shown beneficial cardiovascular outcomes, though in an open-label study EPA added to statin therapy in subjects with cholesterol above 250 mg/dl produced a 19% relative reduction in major coronary events. Omega-3 fatty acids (e.g. Lovaza) may be considered for triglyceride levels above 1000 mg/dl; over-the-counter products vary, containing EPA and DHA ranging from 20–50%.

### N-3 fatty acid supplementation for the treatment of dry eye disease [^1123apbi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study DREAM (dry eye disease) was published by Dry Eye Assessment and Management Study Research Group and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dry eye disease. In the DREAM (dry eye disease) study, the trial question was: what is the role of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in patients with dry eye disease? In the DREAM (dry eye disease) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the DREAM (dry eye disease) study, the population was: 535 patients (434 female, 101 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with moderate-to-severe dry eye disease. The key exclusion criteria were worn contact lenses in the past 30 days; underwent laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis or recent ocular surgery; history of ocular infection; contraindications to treatment with high-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. In the DREAM (dry eye disease) study, the interventions were: n = 349 omega-3 supplements (daily oral dose of 3,000 mg of fish-derived omega-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids) n = 186 placebo (an olive oil matching placebo). In the DREAM (dry eye disease) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in mean reduction in Ocular Surface Disease Index score (13.9 points vs. 12.5 points; MD 1.9, 95% CI -1.1 to 5). In the DREAM (dry eye disease) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mean reduction in conjunctival staining score (0.4 points vs. 0.4 points;) No significant difference in mean reduction in corneal staining score (0.6 points vs. 0.7 points; MD -0.1, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.2) No significant difference in mean improvement in tear break-up time (0.7 seconds vs. 0.6 seconds; MD 0.2, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.5). In the DREAM (dry eye disease) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the DREAM (dry eye disease) study, the conclusion was: in patients with moderate-to-severe dry eye disease, omega-3 supplements were not superior to placebo with respect to mean reduction in Ocular Surface Disease Index score.

### PES lipid SIG diabetes and lipids algorithm [^112CF4kT]. PES (2024). High credibility.

Triglyceride management (off label in pediatrics) — Omega-3 fatty acids and fibrates use and monitoring are outlined. For omega-3s, the "Recommended dose is 4g/day DHA/EPA". For fibrates: "Counsel about side effects, potential drug interactions, and contraindications", "Prefer fenofibrate initially due to fewer side effects, better tolerated, and only once daily dosing", and "Check baseline AST, ALT and again in 4 weeks to monitor on fibrate. If AST, ALT > 3x ULN, stop fibrate, considering restarting at lower dose once labs normalize or refer to lipid specialist". Additional notes include: "Of note, TG lowering medications in adults with diabetes have shown inconsistent results with improved CVD benefit", "Side effects: muscle toxicity, hepatotoxicity. If on a fibrate and statin, higher risk of muscle toxicity", with "Drug interactions: coumarin anticoagulants, immunosuppressives, bile acid resins" and "Contraindications: severe renal dysfunction, acute liver disease, gall bladder disease, hypersensitivity to fibrate, nursing mothers".

### Omega-3 fatty acids and major depression: a mendelian randomization study [^117BWtQz]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Our results tentatively support the role of omega-3 fatty acids in the aetiology of MDD and justify further research into underlying mechanisms. Our MVMR estimate, suggesting a stronger effect for EPA than DHA, is consistent with meta-analytical evidence for EPA-predominant formulations and may explain differential trial outcomes between omega-3 formulations with insufficient EPA doses or EPA:DHA ratios. Pure DHA supplements in animal studies appear to slow the hepatic conversion of EPA into its metabolic products, with theoretically adverse effects on MDD risk if a protective effect is EPA-driven. Assuming a differential effect of EPA and DHA on MDD may also facilitate a more targeted exploration of underlying mechanisms, with systemic inflammation a possible candidate. Many EPA derivatives are anti-inflammatory, as well as competitively inhibiting pro-inflammatory omega-6 derivatives (see Fig. 1). Studies have identified differential anti-inflammatory effects from EPA and DHA supplementation, exploration of which may extend current mechanistic understanding. A central effect of omega-fatty acids in the brain is also possible, whether directly through effects on cellular membrane properties, neurotransmitter release, or via neuroinflammatory processes. While DHA is the predominant omega-3 in the brain, eicosanoid derivatives of EPA are found in brain tissue and may moderate neuroinflammation. In contrast to other brain cells, EPA concentrations within microglial cells, the resident macrophages within the brain, appear to outweigh DHA. There is evidence that omega-3 fatty acids reduce microglial activation, affecting cytokine production that may impact neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, as well as neurotransmitter metabolism.

Further MR analyses could consider the differential effects of EPA and DHA on potential mediators, such as inflammation, which may consolidate this hypothesis and strengthen the rationale for high-dose EPA interventions. Given relatively small effect sizes, future trials could consider targeting participants with sub-optimal long-chain omega-3 fatty acid intake, high omega-6:3 ratios, or genetically low- conversion of short- to long-chain fatty acids, which might yield greater benefits and require smaller sample sizes than universal prevention efforts. Further one-sample MR studies could also investigate omega-3 fatty acid toxicity at higher concentrations by using non-linear methods, as well as whether this modest effect masks a larger threshold effect by the inherent assumption of a linear relationship in two-sample MR. Finally, in the era of environmental awareness, the question of how to generate affordable and sustainable long-chain omega-3 fatty acids for a growing global population seems pertinent.

### Effect of high-dose omega-3 fatty acids vs corn oil on major adverse cardiovascular events in patients at high cardiovascular risk: the STRENGTH randomized clinical trial [^117A3UND]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

It remains uncertain whether the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduce cardiovascular risk.

Objective

To determine the effects on cardiovascular outcomes of a carboxylic acid formulation of EPA and DHA (omega-3 CA) with documented favorable effects on lipid and inflammatory markers in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia and high cardiovascular risk.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial (enrollment October 30, 2014, to June 14, 2017; study termination January 8, 2020; last patient visit May 14, 2020) comparing omega-3 CA with corn oil in statin-treated participants with high cardiovascular risk, hypertriglyceridemia, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). A total of 13 078 patients were randomized at 675 academic and community hospitals in 22 countries in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive 4 g/d of omega-3 CA (n = 6539) or corn oil, which was intended to serve as an inert comparator (n = 6539), in addition to usual background therapies, including statins.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy measure was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization.

Results

When 1384 patients had experienced a primary end point event (of a planned 1600 events), the trial was prematurely halted based on an interim analysis that indicated a low probability of clinical benefit of omega-3 CA vs the corn oil comparator. Among the 13 078 treated patients (mean [SD] age, 62.5 [9.0] years; 35% women; 70% with diabetes; median low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level, 75.0 mg/dL; median triglycerides level, 240 mg/dL; median HDL-C level, 36 mg/dL; and median high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, 2.1 mg/L), 12 633 (96.6%) completed the trial with ascertainment of primary end point status. The primary end point occurred in 785 patients (12.0%) treated with omega-3 CA vs 795 (12.2%) treated with corn oil (hazard ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.90–1.09]; p = 0.84). A greater rate of gastrointestinal adverse events was observed in the omega-3 CA group (24.7%) compared with corn oil-treated patients (14.7%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among statin-treated patients at high cardiovascular risk, the addition of omega-3 CA, compared with corn oil, to usual background therapies resulted in no significant difference in a composite outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events. These findings do not support use of this omega-3 fatty acid formulation to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in high-risk patients.

### Omega-3 fatty acid supplements in women at high risk of breast cancer have dose-dependent effects on breast adipose tissue fatty acid composition [^113ozVEn]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Preclinical evidence of the preventive benefits of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in breast cancer continues to fuel interest in the potential role of dietary fat content in reducing breast cancer risk. The dose of fish-oil/omega-3 PUFAs needed to achieve maximal target tissue effects for breast cancer prevention remains undefined.

Objective

To determine the dose effects of omega-3 fatty acids on breast adipose tissue fatty acid profiles, we conducted a study of 4 doses of omega-3 PUFAs in women at high risk of breast cancer.

Design

In this 6-mo randomized open-label study, 48 women with increased breast cancer risk received 1, 3, 6, or 9 capsules/d of an omega-3 PUFA supplement that provided 0.84, 2.52, 5.04, and 7.56 g docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) + eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) daily, respectively. Subjects made monthly visits, at which time pill counts were made and fasting blood samples were collected to determine fatty acid profiles; anthropometric measurements were made, breast adipose tissue samples were collected, and laboratory tests of toxicity (alanine aminotransferase, LDL cholesterol, and platelet function) were made at baseline and at 3 and 6 mo.

Results

All doses led to increased serum and breast adipose tissue EPA and DHA concentrations, but the response to 0.84 g DHA+EPA/d was less than the maximum possible response with ≥ 2.52 g/d. Body mass index attenuated the dose response for serum tissue DHA and EPA (P = 0.015 and 0.027, respectively) and breast adipose tissue DHA (P = 0.0022) in all of the treatment groups. The incremental increase in DHA and EPA correlated inversely with baseline fat and serum values. Compliance over 6 mo was 92.9 ± 9.2% and was unaffected by treatment arm. No severe or serious toxicities were reported.

Conclusions

Daily doses up to 7.56 g DHA+EPA were well tolerated with excellent compliance in this cohort at high risk of breast cancer. Body mass index and baseline fatty acid concentrations modulated the dose-response effects of omega-3 PUFA supplements on serum EPA and DHA and breast adipose tissue DHA.

Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA ± DHA) — For adults with hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) who have CVD or are at increased risk for CVD and are taking statins, the task force issued a conditional recommendation for the use of EPA after shared decision-making because EPA monotherapy results in a small reduction in MI with some potential adverse effects, whereas in the same population it issued a conditional recommendation against EPA plus DHA due to trivial benefits and moderate adverse effects. Recommendations are grounded in trials evaluating doses of ≥ 1.8 g/day, approaching recommended prescribing doses in the range of 2 to 4 g/day, and should not be applied to doses < 1.8 g/day. For severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL), the task force notes a paucity of evidence and advises shared decision-making when considering EPA monotherapy or EPA plus DHA; no studies evaluated the prevention of pancreatitis in persons with severe hypertriglyceridemia.

### Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for the treatment of children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder symptomatology: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117EU9vL]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Several studies have demonstrated differences in omega-3 fatty acid composition in plasma and in erythrocyte membranes in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared with unaffected controls. Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and can alter central nervous system cell membrane fluidity and phospholipid composition. Cell membrane fluidity can alter serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission. The goal of this meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in children with ADHD.

Method

PubMed was searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials examining omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in children with ADHD symptomatology. The primary outcome measurement was standardized mean difference in rating scales of ADHD severity. Secondary analyses were conducted to determine the effects of dosing of different omega-3 fatty acids in supplements.

Results

Ten trials involving 699 children were included in this meta-analysis. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation demonstrated a small but significant effect in improving ADHD symptoms. Eicosapentaenoic acid dose within supplements was significantly correlated with supplement efficacy. No evidence of publication bias or heterogeneity between trials was found.

Conclusion

Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, particularly with higher doses of eicosapentaenoic acid, was modestly effective in the treatment of ADHD. The relative efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was modest compared with currently available pharmacotherapies for ADHD such as psychostimulants, atomoxetine, or α(2) agonists. However, given its relatively benign side-effect profile and evidence of modest efficacy, it may be reasonable to use omega-3 fatty supplementation to augment traditional pharmacologic interventions or for families who decline other psychopharmacologic options.

### Association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and dyslipidemia: a continuous dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1178RYdN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Despite the enforced lipid‐lowering measures over the past decade, global cardiovascular disease (CVD)‐caused deaths rose by almost 20% from 2010 to 2020. Between 2015 and 2018, in the United States alone, dyslipidemia prevalence ranged from 17% to 38%, determined by either total cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dL, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) ≥ 130 mg/dL, triglyceride ≥ 150 mg/dL, or high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) < 40 mg/dL.

With the hope of protecting the population with hyperlipidemia from CVD events, high‐intensity statin therapy targeting LDL‐C was recommended for the treatment of blood cholesterol. Another strategy is to lower the triglyceride level or triglyceride‐rich lipoprotein. Supplementation of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3 PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is one of the lipid‐lowering approaches. Researchers have long seen ω3 PUFA intake as a potential strategy to address vascular conditions, but there have also been concerns. ω3 PUFAs could reduce serum triglyceride concentration by approximately 15% to 30%, but could not affect or even increase LDL‐C levels. Previous systematic reviews and meta‐analyses have been unable to reveal a significant dose–response relationship. Some aggregated data have brought more uncertainty, rather than a solid conclusion. These past meta‐analyses examined the dose–response relationship using pooled linear meta‐regression, without taking into account the correlations among effects at different dose levels.

### Association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and dyslipidemia: a continuous dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116TH2S9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Our current dose–response analyses recommend taking more than 2 g/d ω3 PUFA from a pharmacokinetic perspective, securing the active substances absorbed to reach the systemic circulation or tissues, such as the cell membrane. Clinical trials revealed that ω3 PUFA supplementation of < 1 g/d resulted in a very limited reduction in atherosclerotic CVD risk of major vascular events and CVD‐caused deaths. Conversely, patients with hypertriglyceridemia treated with a medium‐to‐high dose of icosapent ethyl were less likely to develop ischemic events, including CVD death. However, taking into account the selection of the target population with a higher level of ω3 PUFA in JELISor the use of mineral oil as a comparator in REDUCE‐IT, we still need more conclusive evidence from well‐designed trials to examine the potency of ω3 PUFA supplementation to prevent cardiovascular events.

Exposure and outcome measurements play a critical role in the estimation of valid causal relationships. We used a prestandardized protocol for dose intake (exposure level) in our data extraction process, excluding trials of DHA/EPA supplementation through diet, where the exposure level was hardly determined by the accurate fraction of pure DHA/EPA amount over the food consumed daily. Exposure levels were examined from 3 different perspectives: total combined doses of DHA + EPA, individual use of DHA/EPA (monotherapy), and separate doses. To precisely reflect the exposure level, we further included the achieved omega‐3 index change in the RBC membrane. The outcome measurement was also taken into account in our risk of bias assessment. All included trials have demonstrated detailed measurement protocols (such as automatic biochemistry measurement and standardized staff training, etc.) to obtain stable lipid profile readouts, though some of these studies were not designed to test the effect on lipids as the primary outcome. Intrinsically significant variations among original trials, such as the device for lipid measurement and the year of study (conducted 1990–2022), are likely to bring some uncertainty to our results and potentially weaken the conclusion. Although we attempted to examine the influence of these factors on our overall findings in subgroup analyses, we acknowledge that it is not possible to account for this heterogeneity directly in our analyses. The overall risk of bias did not divert from our expectations.

3 Results

We reviewed a total of 798 articles for eligibility after removing duplicates and screening at the title and abstract level. Further, 760 articles were removed based on a priori study selection criteria. Ultimately, 38 trials encompassing 149,051 patients were included (Fig. 1). The characteristics of the participants and trials are reported in Table 1. Of 38 trials, 4 trials compared EPA vs. control and 34 trials compared EPA+DHA vs. control. Twenty-two trials studied primary prevention. The dose of omega-3 FAs ranged from 0.4 g/day to 5.5 g/day. The EPA trials had dose ranges from 1.8 to 4.0 g/day and EPA+DHA from 0.4 to 5.5 g/day. The patients' mean age ranged from 39 to 78 years, and the proportion of enrolled women varied from 0% to 77.5%. The median follow-up duration across the trials was 2.0 years (IQR, 1–4.2).

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^1163qksd]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study shows some benefits of EPA monotherapy on cognitive symptoms of ADHD. As amply discussed, it is possible that a combined EPA + DHA strategy might have been more beneficial, and as such we support the recent recommendation by a panel of ADHD experts that patients who prefer omega-3 supplements over stimulants should take a combination of DHA and EPA at doses ≥ 750 mg per day for at least 12 weeks. However, we additionally recommend that this strategy should be even more strongly advocated for children with evidence of low endogenous PUFAs levels, as indicated by direct measurement, dietary habits or symptoms of EFA deficiency. Conversely, in the cases where high endogenous levels of PUFAs might already be present because of a dedicated diet or previous supplements, PUFAs levels should be investigated before trialling this strategy, to limit any potential negative effects. In this way, we can start bringing the benefits of 'personalised treatment' to children with ADHD.

### Short-term, high-dose fish oil supplementation increases the production of omega-3 fatty acid-derived mediators in patients with peripheral artery disease (the OMEGA-PAD I trial) [^116ye6xQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Previously, several randomized trials in patients with coronary artery disease demonstrated that fish oil supplementation or dietary intake of oily fish correlated with a decrease in total mortality, decrease in CV death, decrease in sudden cardiac death, and a reduction in nonfatal CV events.–In a recent review, our group observed that only a limited number of studies exist on the role of n-3 PUFA in PAD. We speculate that the present body of literature concerning n-3 PUFA and PAD is limited due to 2 important factors. First, there is marked variability of n-3 PUFA dosing in major trials, and many studies have had relatively low dosing (averaging 1.5 g daily), which likely has minimal effects in the setting of increased inflammation associated with PAD. These differences contribute to the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes. Second, the majority of clinical trials that evaluate clinical effects of n-3 PUFAs have included study subjects who are at relatively low risk on the CV risk spectrum when compared to symptomatic PAD patients. In reviewing the literature, however, many studies have shown that n-3 PUFA is associated with a dramatic reduction in inflammation in diverse patient populations.–Furthermore, as described above, the most recent evidence supports the beneficial role of n-3 PUFA in the resolution of inflammation. In the future, it would be prudent to design studies that have sufficiently high n-3 PUFA dosing and duration to counteract the increased inflammatory state in PAD and to more accurately examine the nutrient's clinical effects. With specific regard to the enhancement of SPM pathways, future studies might focus on subgroups of patients who experience a secondary inflammatory insult, to determine whether clinical resolution is improved.

### Residual macrovascular risk in 2013: what have we learned? [^112yB9DM]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

In contrast, the Alpha-Omega trial (n = 4,837) failed to show a benefit on major CV events with the addition of n−3 fatty acids (margarine containing EPA plus docosahexaenoic acid with a targeted additional daily intake of 400 mg) in patients with a previous MI receiving best evidence-based antihypertensive, antithrombotic, and lipid-modifying therapy (mainly statins). More recently, the ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine Intervention) trial used a 2x2 factorial design to investigate the effect of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids (1 g capsule containing ≥ 900 mg of ethyl esters of n-3 fatty acids) versus placebo (one arm) and insulin glargine versus standard care (second arm) in subjects with or at high risk for diabetes and at increased CV risk (n = 12,536). Treatment with n-3 fatty acids had no significant effect on the primary outcome (CV death) or any of the secondary or additional outcomes. It has been suggested that the lack of effect may relate to the selected dose, and/or extensive use of concomitant cardioprotective treatments. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of trials of omega-3 supplementation (n = 68,680 subjects in 20 trials, mean dose 1.51 g/day) failed to show any significant association with all-cause mortality, cardiac death, sudden death, MI, or stroke. There is also some evidence from recent trials to suggest a possible link between high plasma concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids and increased risk of prostate cancer.

A new formulation of omega-3 fatty acids (AMR101, ≥ 96% EPA ethyl ester) is being evaluated in the REDUCE-IT trial in statin-treated patients with elevated trigycerides (> 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL) and at least one CV risk factor. However, results are not expected until 2017.

Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplements

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are a family of lipids that include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and doxosahexaenoic acid (DHA), both derived from oily fish, as well as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), derived from plant sources. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for brain development and are a significant component of neuronal membranes in the brain. Maintaining sufficient levels of omega-3 fatty acids may support the integrity of the brain's neurons and enhance synaptic neuroplasticity. Additionally, omega-3 fatty acids improve brain function through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, ultimately slowing down the progression of dementia.

The evidence regarding omega-3 fatty acids supplementation is difficult to ascertain due to the heterogeneity among studies, particularly regarding the omega-3 doses, preparations, and overall study design. Several meta-analyses examined their efficacy for the treatment of dementia. The most recent study was a Cochrane review that looked at the effects of omega-3 fatty acids to treat cognitive dysfunction. Six hundred thirty-two participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease were examined over 6, 12, and 18 months. Their results showed that there was no evidence of an increased benefit from omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on cognitive function when measured at six months with the Mini-Mental State Examination (mean different (MD) 0.18, 95% CI − 1.05 to 1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; high-quality evidence) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (SMD − 0.02, 95% confidence interval (DI) − 0.19 to 0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; high-quality evidence). There was also no evidence of a benefit from omega-3 fatty acids on activities of daily living (SMD − 0.02, 95% CI − 0.19 to 0.16; 544 participants; 2 studies; high-quality evidence). Another Cochrane Database systematic review assessed the effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on the prevention of dementia and cognitive decline in cognitively healthy older people. Information was available from 3 RCTs, including 3536 participants in total. This meta-analysis found no evidence to support a preventative effect following 24 or 40 months of intervention. Longer-term studies may be needed to detect the possible effects and consequences of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in preventing cognitive decline. Other RCTs suggest that selected patients with an MMSE score > 27 were more likely to identify a positive effect of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Progression of Atherosclerosis in Patients With Elevated Triglycerides

n3-FAs and their bioactive lipid metabolites produce complex and multifactorial biological effects that remain incompletely understood, especially at higher doses, that may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. A meta-analysis of observational and randomized trials indicated that circulating levels of n3-FAs associated inversely with modestly lower rates of cardiovascular death. Other studies indicated that the cardiovascular benefits of n3-FAs could link to either EPA or DHA but highlighted the need for more definitive evidence. A study of 218 subjects with coronary disease randomized to high-dose EPA and DHA (3.36 g/d) or placebo showed that those with n3-FAs that reached plasma phospholipid levels of at least 4% had a significantly slower progression of coronary plaque as monitored by coronary computed tomographic angiography.

Clinical studies with high-dose EPA (2–4 g/d) provide some mechanistic insights based on changes in various biomarkers in statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides that may contribute to the reduction in residual cardiovascular risk due to EPA demonstrated in REDUCE-IT. In people with elevated or very high triglycerides, treatment with a highly purified and quality-controlled preparation of EPA (2–4 g/d) reduced the arachidonic acid-to-EPA ratio in blood, hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), RLP-C (remnant-like particle cholesterol), ApoC-III (apolipoprotein C-III), and oxLDL (oxidized LDL-C) concentrations compared with placebo controls.– EPA generally produced these effects in a dose-dependent manner. Further studies of inflammatory and other biomarkers from REDUCE-IT and other trials should lead to additional insights into mechanisms of action of highly purified EPA in individuals with elevated triglycerides and cardiovascular risk.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^113hMhTZ]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A deficiency of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) may play a role in the pathogenesis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). N-3 PUFAs, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential fatty acids (EFA) for our brain and body, and have been closely associated with cognitive functionand academic performance. Our recent meta-analysis has shown that youth with ADHD have lower blood levels of DHA, EPA and total n-3 PUFAs, when compared with typically developing youth. Moreover, EFA deficiency (a measure of symptoms such as excessive thirst, dry skin, brittle nails and small skin bumps) has been described in children with ADHD, and the severity of EFA deficiency has been associated with ADHD symptom severity.

Although meta-analysis report that stimulants are tolerated and effective treatments for youth with ADHD, these drugs have side effects that need monitoring, such as insomnia, risk of abuse, and changes in blood pressure, heart rate and body weight –. N-3 PUFAs have a very good tolerability and safety profile, and thus may be a preferable treatment option for youth with ADHD. Indeed, our recent meta-analysis has shown that n-3 PUFAs treatment improves clinical symptoms in youth with ADHD, although individual studies have conflicting findings, possibly because of different dosages of EPA and DHA used across studies. Of note, a previous meta-analysis examining clinical trials in children with ADHD showed that a high dose of omega-3 (1–2 g) supplementation was required to show significant improvement in clinical symptoms. Moreover, the therapeutic effects of n-3 PUFAs in ADHD seems to be particularly evident when measuring cognitive function (for example, attention and impulsivity) rather than generic ADHD symptoms. Interestingly, most of the n-3 PUFAs studies in ADHD used either a high-dose DHA, or a relative low-doses of DHA and EPA combination treatment, despite the evidence that EPA is the more effective therapeutic component, at least in depression –. In fact, our meta-analysisshows that only studies with EPA supplementation greater or equal to 500 mg per day find an improvement in the clinical hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Np83b]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2.6 The certainty of the evidence

We evaluated the certainty of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach (. Two experienced authors (S.U.K. and A.N.L.) rated each domain separately for each comparison, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The certainty for each comparison and outcome was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low, based on considerations of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, and other considerations (publication bias, large effect, plausible confounding, and dose-response gradient). The summary of the GRADE evidence chart is reported on Appendix p 7 and 8.

2.7 Role of the funding source

This study received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. S. U. Khan and A. N. Lone accessed the data. S. U. Khan and D. L. Bhatt decided to submit for publication. All the co-authors agreed with the decision.

### Omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules (Omega-3-acid ethyl esters) [^115FqzQF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Assess TG levels carefully before initiating therapy. Identify other causes (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, medications) of high TG levels and manage as appropriate [see Indications and Usage (1)].
Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules and should continue this diet during treatment with omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules. In clinical studies, omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules were administered with meals.

The daily dose of omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules is 4 grams per day. The daily dose may be taken as a single 4-gram dose (4 capsules) or as two 2-gram doses (2 capsules given twice daily).

Patients should be advised to swallow omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules whole. Do not break open, crush, dissolve, or chew omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules.

### National Lipid Association scientific statement on the use of icosapent ethyl in statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides and high or very-high ASCVD risk [^1113Dizi]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Effects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplementation — evidence synthesis and recent trials. A 2017 Science Advisory from the AHA stated that the available evidence did not support the use of low-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (approximately 850–1000 mg of EPA and DHA/d) to reduce ASCVD risk for individuals in the general population, including those with prediabetes or diabetes, who are not at high risk of ASCVD; however, it stated that low-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was reasonable for secondary prevention of CHD in those with a recent CHD event and for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction, based on a meta-analysis showing modest risk reduction (RR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85–0.98) in secondary prevention and a reduction in total mortality (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83–0.99) in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A subsequent meta-analysis of 10 trials using aggregated study-level data involving 77,917 individuals with daily dosages of EPA from 226 to 1800 mg and DHA from 0 to 1700 mg suggested no significant effects on the risks of CHD, stroke, coronary or noncoronary revascularization or overall CVD events, although results were consistent with a possible benefit for CHD death of marginal statistical significance (RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.85–1.00, P = 0.05). With publication of three large-scale RCTs, when results from two lower-dosage primary prevention trials using 840 mg/d EPA + DHA as ethyl esters were added to the earlier meta-analysis, CHD death benefit was further supported: 1405 events in 59,684 vs 1529 in 59,560 (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86–0.99, P = 0.014), and significant lower risks were also observed for myocardial infarction, total CHD, and CVD death with pooled relative risk reduction estimates ranging from 5 to 8%.

### Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for cystic fibrosis [^116enJ3s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies suggest that a diet rich in omega-3 essential fatty acids may have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects for chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of a previously published review.

Objectives

To determine whether there is evidence that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reduces morbidity and mortality and to identify any adverse events associated with supplementation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of last search: 01 April 2020. We also searched online study registries and contacted authors. Date of last search: 12 February 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis comparing omega-3 fatty acid supplements with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

The searches identified 23 studies; five studies with 106 participants (children and adults) were included; duration of studies and interventions differed. Two studies compared omega-3 fatty acids to olive oil for six weeks; one study compared omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids to control capsules (customised fatty acid blends) for three months; one study compared a liquid dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids to one without for six months; and one study compared omega-3 fatty acids to a placebo for 12 months. Three studies had a low risk of bias for randomisation, but the risk was unclear in the remaining two studies; all studies had an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. Three of the studies adequately blinded participants; the risk of bias for selective reporting was high in one study and unclear for four studies. Two studies reported the number of respiratory exacerbations. At three months, one study (43 participants) reported no change in antibiotic usage. At 12 months the second study (15 participants) reported a reduction in the number of pulmonary exacerbations and cumulative antibiotic days in the supplement group compared to the previous year (no data for the control group); very low-quality evidence means we are unsure whether supplementation has any effect on this outcome. With regards to adverse events, one six-week study (12 participants) reported no difference in diarrhoea between omega-3 or placebo capsules; the very low-quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on this outcome. Additionally, one study reported an increase in steatorrhoea requiring participants to increase their daily dose of pancreatic enzymes, but three studies had already increased pancreatic enzyme dose at study begin so as to reduce the incidence of steatorrhoea. One study (43 participants) reported stomach pains at three months (treatment or control group not specified). One six-week study (19 participants) reported three asthma exacerbations leading to exclusion of participants since corticosteroid treatment could affect affect essential fatty acid metabolism. Four studies reported lung function. One six-week study (19 participants) reported an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) (L) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (L), but the very low-quality evidence means we are unsure if supplementation has any effect on lung function. The remaining studies did not report any difference in lung function at three months (unit of measurement not specified) or at six months and one year (FEV 1% predicted and FVC % predicted). No deaths were reported in any of the five studies. Four studies reported clinical variables. One study reported an increase in Schwachman score and weight alongside a reduction in sputum volume with supplementation compared to placebo at three months (data not analysable). However, three studies reported no differences in either weight at six weeks, in body mass index (BMI) standard deviation (SD) score at six months (very low-quality evidence) or BMI Z score at 12 months. Three studies reported biochemical markers of fatty acid status. One study showed an increase from baseline in both EPA and DHA content of serum phospholipids in the omega-3 group compared to placebo at three months and also a significant decrease in n-6/n-3 ratio in the supplement group compared to placebo; since the quality of the evidence is very low we are not certain that these changes are due to supplementation. One six-month cross-over study showed a higher EPA content of the neutrophil membrane in the supplement group compared to the placebo group, but, no difference in DHA membrane concentration. Furthermore, the leukotriene B 4 to leukotriene B 5 ratio was lower at six months in the omega-3 group compared to placebo. A one-year study reported a greater increase in the essential fatty acid profile and a decrease in AA levels in the treatment arm compared to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found that regular omega-3 supplements may provide some limited benefits for people with cystic fibrosis with relatively few adverse effects: however, the quality of the evidence across all outcomes was very low. The current evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions or recommend routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. A large, long-term, multicentre, randomised controlled study is needed to determine any significant therapeutic effect and to assess the influence of disease severity, dosage and duration of treatment. Future researchers should note the need for additional pancreatic enzymes when providing omega-3 supplementation or olive oil placebo capsules. More research is required to determine the exact dose of pancreatic enzyme required.

### Adverse effects of fish oil… [^117RpPdd]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Fisher et al1 in their article on n-3 fatty acids and cellular aspects of atherogenesis suggest that urgent trials of n-3 fatty acid supplementation are needed to assess their effects on atherosclerotic disease. While epidemiological studies2, 3 have documented a reduced incidence of ischemic heart disease in populations with a high intake of n-3 fatty acids, there is also an unexplained increased incidence of stroke. 2, 3 Apart from a high incidence of unpleasant side effects in patients taking fish oil supplements, clinical4 and laboratory studies5 have shown evidence of raised blood pressure in groups taking omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. In addition, recent epidemiological evidence has shown an increased incidence and prevalence of hypertensive related diseases3 in the same type of population in whom there is a low incidence of ischemic heart disease.

### Omega-3 fatty acid addition during pregnancy [^112qrijo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Higher intakes of foods containing omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), such as fish, during pregnancy have been associated with longer gestations and improved perinatal outcomes. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of omega-3 LCPUFA, as supplements or as dietary additions, during pregnancy on maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes and longer-term outcomes for mother and child.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (16 August 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing omega-3 fatty acids (as supplements or as foods, stand-alone interventions, or with a co-intervention) during pregnancy with placebo or no omega-3, and studies or study arms directly comparing omega-3 LCPUFA doses or types. Trials published in abstract form were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias in trials and assessed quality of evidence for prespecified birth/infant, maternal, child/adult and health service outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

In this update, we included 70 RCTs (involving 19,927 women at low, mixed or high risk of poor pregnancy outcomes) which compared omega-3 LCPUFA interventions (supplements and food) compared with placebo or no omega-3. Overall study-level risk of bias was mixed, with selection and performance bias mostly at low risk, but there was high risk of attrition bias in some trials. Most trials were conducted in upper-middle or high-income countries; and nearly half the trials included women at increased/high risk for factors which might increase the risk of adverse maternal and birth outcomes. Preterm birth < 37 weeks (13.4% versus 11.9%; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.97; 26 RCTs, 10,304 participants; high-quality evidence) and early preterm birth < 34 weeks (4.6% versus 2.7%; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.77; 9 RCTs, 5204 participants; high-quality evidence) were both lower in women who received omega-3 LCPUFA compared with no omega-3. Prolonged gestation > 42 weeks was probably increased from 1.6% to 2.6% in women who received omega-3 LCPUFA compared with no omega-3 (RR 1.61 95% CI 1.11 to 2.33; 5141 participants; 6 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence). For infants, there was a possibly reduced risk of perinatal death (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.03; 10 RCTs, 7416 participants; moderate-quality evidence: 62/3715 versus 83/3701 infants) and possibly fewer neonatal care admissions (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.03; 9 RCTs, 6920 participants; moderate-quality evidence - 483/3475 infants versus 519/3445 infants). There was a reduced risk of low birthweight (LBW) babies (15.6% versus 14%; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99; 15 trials, 8449 participants; high-quality evidence); but a possible small increase in large-for-gestational age (LGA) babies (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.36; 6 RCTs, 3722 participants; moderate-quality evidence, for omega-3 LCPUFA compared with no omega-3. Little or no difference in small-for-gestational age or intrauterine growth restriction (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 8 RCTs, 6907 participants; moderate-quality evidence) was seen. For the maternal outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of omega-3 on induction post-term (average RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.98; 3 trials, 2900 participants; low-quality evidence), maternal serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.72; 2 trials, 2690 participants; low-quality evidence), maternal admission to intensive care (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.63; 2 trials, 2458 participants; low-quality evidence), or postnatal depression (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.77; 2 trials, 2431 participants; low-quality evidence). Mean gestational length was greater in women who received omega-3 LCPUFA (mean difference (MD) 1.67 days, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.39; 41 trials, 12,517 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and pre-eclampsia may possibly be reduced with omega-3 LCPUFA (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.01; 20 trials, 8306 participants; low-quality evidence). For the child/adult outcomes, very few differences between antenatal omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation and no omega-3 were observed in cognition, IQ, vision, other neurodevelopment and growth outcomes, language and behaviour (mostly low-quality to very low-quality evidence). The effect of omega-3 LCPUFA on body mass index at 19 years (MD 0, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.83; 1 trial, 243 participants; very low-quality evidence) was uncertain. No data were reported for development of diabetes in the children of study participants.

Authors' Conclusions

In the overall analysis, preterm birth < 37 weeks and early preterm birth < 34 weeks were reduced in women receiving omega-3 LCPUFA compared with no omega-3. There was a possibly reduced risk of perinatal death and of neonatal care admission, a reduced risk of LBW babies; and possibly a small increased risk of LGA babies with omega-3 LCPUFA. For our GRADE quality assessments, we assessed most of the important perinatal outcomes as high-quality (e.g. preterm birth) or moderate-quality evidence (e.g. perinatal death). For the other outcome domains (maternal, child/adult and health service outcomes) GRADE ratings ranged from moderate to very low, with over half rated as low. Reasons for downgrading across the domain were mostly due to design limitations and imprecision. Omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy is an effective strategy for reducing the incidence of preterm birth, although it probably increases the incidence of post-term pregnancies. More studies comparing omega-3 LCPUFA and placebo (to establish causality in relation to preterm birth) are not needed at this stage. A further 23 ongoing trials are still to report on over 5000 women, so no more RCTs are needed that compare omega-3 LCPUFA against placebo or no intervention. However, further follow-up of completed trials is needed to assess longer-term outcomes for mother and child, to improve understanding of metabolic, growth and neurodevelopment pathways in particular, and to establish if, and how, outcomes vary by different types of omega-3 LCPUFA, timing and doses; or by characteristics of women.

### Fish oil administration in older adults: is there potential for adverse events? A systematic review of the literature [^111WUSkN]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The potential for undesirable anticoagulant effects with the concurrent use of fish oil and anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications have previously been highlighted. It is speculated that older adults in particular may have an increased risk of major bleeding due to increased sensitivity to anticoagulation, multiple comorbidites and polypharmacy. However, evaluation of the evidence concerning the safety considerations associated with n-3 supplementation shows little support of an increase risk in bleeding with n-3 intake, even when concurrently administered with anticoagulant agents. Despite this Bays 2007 suggested it would be prudent to discontinue high doses of n-3 fatty acid supplementation in the days prior to invasive surgical procedures or in patients at high risk for haemorrhagic stroke. Expert opinion by Harris 2007 was also in agreement suggesting that n-3 fatty acid supplementation does not increase the risk for clinically significant bleeding with the proposed cardiovascular benefits outweighing the theoretical risks for increased bleeding. In the present review only four of ten studies excluded participants at study entry medicated with oral anticoagulant or antiplatelets despite the theoretical potential for anticoagulation of n-3 fatty acids. Regardless of the previous speculation, current evidence has shown that n-3 supplementation at doses ≤ 4 g per day, even when concurrently administered with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications, are safe for general consumption. However, the doses of n-3 fatty acids in the present review were considerably smaller compared with those previously reported suggesting caution may need to be applied when administering higher doses until further evidence is obtained. Although the majority of studies in the present review (8/10 studies) indicated compliance toward the n-3 intervention, a dose–response relationship between n-3 intake and the potential for AE is unclear given the uncertainty associated with the exact quantity of EPA/DHA ingested in the majority of studies.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117YBZLX]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Administration of EPA reduced non-fatal stroke in REDUCE-IT and increased rates of bleeding in both JELIS and REDUCE-IT. Rates of AF were higher with EPA in REDUCE-IT and some of the EPA+DHA trials. Therefore, the fundamental mechanisms underlying these findings merit further investigation and may provide mechanistic insights into EPA's and DHA's differential actions.

Our study has various limitations. None of the trials studied the effects of DHA monotherapy on cardiovascular outcomes. Although we performed trial-level meta-analyses, a participant-level analysis according to demographic characteristics, comorbidities, lipid profile, dosages, and baseline medical therapy would be informative. Study-level data limit us from evaluating the association of EPA or DHA levels with clinical outcomes. A systematic review reported a threshold effect suggesting that ≥ 250 mg of omega-3 FA per day was associated with a significant 35% reduction in sudden cardiac death. In REDUCE-IT, on-treatment EPA levels were strongly correlated with the primary and secondary endpoints. Similarly, a dose-response gradient between omega-3 FA and cardiovascular outcomes has been reported in previous meta-analyses. That said, we have considered the dose-response gradient and rated the certainty of the evidence as "very serious" for indirectness during the GRADE evaluation. Another limitation of this meta-analysis is that much of the benefit seen in the pooled omega-3 FA clinical trial dataset is driven by the EPA preparation used in REDUCE-IT. Furthermore, the REDUCE-IT and JELIS trials carried the highest weight in the EPA group. We could not assess the degree of non-adherence to treatment due to side effects given the scarcity of data. A total 50% of the component trials had a high risk of bias; nevertheless, subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed that study-level methodological biases did not influence the outcomes. In the case of rare events, such as all-cause mortality, survival curves tend to separate after a longer follow-up duration. Therefore, a median follow-up of 2 years across the trials might be insufficient to demonstrate a total mortality difference. For some critical endpoints, the certainty of evidence was rated very low based on the precision of estimates and indirectness derived by qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity across the trials. Finally, heterogeneity in clinical settings in the included trials might generate some concerns, although the consistency of results across subgroup and sensitivity analyses diminishes this concern.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction update-2016 [^11498diF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) dietary measures — Summary Statement 27 advises: Consider with caution the recommendation of reduction of sodium intake and ingestion of fish oil and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplementation; results are questionable in reducing the severity of EIB [Strength of Recommendation: Weak; Evidence: A]. Evidence cited includes studies using low-salt diets, omega-3 fatty acids, and ascorbic acid with up to 3 weeks of supplementation, but protocols sometimes prolonged exercise beyond the recommendation of 6 to 8 minutes. Findings are mixed: a low-salt diet for 2 to 5 weeks and a 3-week course of high-dose omega-3 fatty acids have inhibited EIB or FEV1 decline in some studies, whereas other work using a similar high daily omega-3 dose for 3 weeks did not show inhibition, leaving the role of omega-3 fatty acids uncertain; weak evidence also suggests vitamin C may attenuate EIB either acutely or after days or a few weeks.

### Safety considerations with omega-3 fatty acid therapy [^1141QMgM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that the potential antithrombotic effect of fish oils may theoretically increase the risk for bleeding, which may be a safety concern for individual patients. However, clinical trial evidence has not supported increased bleeding with omega-3 fatty acid intake, even when combined with other agents that might also increase bleeding (such as aspirin and warfarin). Another potential safety concern is the susceptibility of omega-3 fatty acid preparations to undergo oxidation, which contributes to patient intolerance and potential toxicity. Finally, large amounts of fish consumption may result in adverse experiences due to the potential presence of environmental toxins such as mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, and other contaminants. The risks of exposure to environmental toxins and hypervitaminosis with fish consumption are substantially reduced through purification processes used to develop selected concentrated fish oil supplements and prescription preparations. Thus, in choosing which fish oil therapies to recommend, clinicians should be aware of available information to best assess their relative safety, which includes the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) advisory statement regarding fish consumption, the meaning of certain labeling (such as "verification" through the US Pharmacopeia) and the differences in FDA regulatory requirements between nonprescription fish oil supplements and prescription fish oil preparations, and how all of this is important to the optimal treatment of patients.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1132gu2K]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from oily fish (long-chain omega-3 (LCn3)), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), as well as from plants (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)) may benefit cardiovascular health. Guidelines recommend increasing omega-3-rich foods, and sometimes supplementation, but recent trials have not confirmed this.

Objectives

To assess the effects of increased intake of fish- and plant-based omega-3 fats for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, adiposity and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to February 2019, plus ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry to August 2019, with no language restrictions. We handsearched systematic review references and bibliographies and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that lasted at least 12 months and compared supplementation or advice to increase LCn3 or ALA intake, or both, versus usual or lower intake.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed validity. We performed separate random-effects meta-analysis for ALA and LCn3 interventions, and assessed dose-response relationships through meta-regression.

Main Results

We included 86 RCTs (162,796 participants) in this review update and found that 28 were at low summary risk of bias. Trials were of 12 to 88 months' duration and included adults at varying cardiovascular risk, mainly in high-income countries. Most trials assessed LCn3 supplementation with capsules, but some used LCn3- or ALA-rich or enriched foods or dietary advice compared to placebo or usual diet. LCn3 doses ranged from 0.5 g a day to more than 5 g a day (19 RCTs gave at least 3 g LCn3 daily). Meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses suggested little or no effect of increasing LCn3 on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.01; 143,693 participants; 11,297 deaths in 45 RCTs; high-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99; 117,837 participants; 5658 deaths in 29 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), cardiovascular events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 140,482 participants; 17,619 people experienced events in 43 RCTs; high-certainty evidence), stroke (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12; 138,888 participants; 2850 strokes in 31 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) or arrhythmia (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 77,990 participants; 4586 people experienced arrhythmia in 30 RCTs; low-certainty evidence). Increasing LCn3 may slightly reduce coronary heart disease mortality (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 334, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00; 127,378 participants; 3598 coronary heart disease deaths in 24 RCTs, low-certainty evidence) and coronary heart disease events (NNTB 167, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97; 134,116 participants; 8791 people experienced coronary heart disease events in 32 RCTs, low-certainty evidence). Overall, effects did not differ by trial duration or LCn3 dose in pre-planned subgrouping or meta-regression. There is little evidence of effects of eating fish. Increasing ALA intake probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; 19,327 participants; 459 deaths in 5 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.25; 18,619 participants; 219 cardiovascular deaths in 4 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), coronary heart disease mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26; 18,353 participants; 193 coronary heart disease deaths in 3 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) and coronary heart disease events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 19,061 participants; 397 coronary heart disease events in 4 RCTs; low-certainty evidence). However, increased ALA may slightly reduce risk of cardiovascular disease events (NNTB 500, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; but RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04 in RCTs at low summary risk of bias; 19,327 participants; 884 cardiovascular disease events in 5 RCTs; low-certainty evidence), and probably slightly reduces risk of arrhythmia (NNTB 91, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97; 4912 participants; 173 events in 2 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). Effects on stroke are unclear. Increasing LCn3 and ALA had little or no effect on serious adverse events, adiposity, lipids and blood pressure, except increasing LCn3 reduced triglycerides by ˜15% in a dose-dependent way (high-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health to date. Moderate- and low-certainty evidence suggests that increasing LCn3 slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease mortality and events, and reduces serum triglycerides (evidence mainly from supplement trials). Increasing ALA slightly reduces risk of cardiovascular events and arrhythmia.

### Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids for dry eye disease [^112pro5x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements, involving omega-3 and/or omega-6 components, have been proposed as a therapy for dry eye. Omega-3 PUFAs exist in both short- (alpha-linolenic acid [ALA]) and long-chain (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) forms, which largely derive from certain plant- and marine-based foods respectively. Omega-6 PUFAs are present in some vegetable oils, meats, and other animal products.

Objectives

To assess the effects of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements on dry eye signs and symptoms.

Search Methods

CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, two other databases and three trial registries were searched in February 2018, together with reference checking. A top-up search was conducted in October 2019, but the results have not yet been incorporated.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving dry eye participants, in which omega-3 and/or omega-6 supplements were compared with a placebo/control supplement, artificial tears, or no treatment. We included head-to-head trials comparing different forms or doses of PUFAs.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 34 RCTs, involving 4314 adult participants from 13 countries with dry eye of variable severity and etiology. Follow-up ranged from one to 12 months. Nine (26.5%) studies had published protocols and/or were registered. Over half of studies had high risk of bias in one or more domains. Long-chain omega-3 (EPA and DHA) versus placebo or no treatment (10 RCTs) We found low certainty evidence that there may be little to no reduction in dry eye symptoms with long-chain omega-3 versus placebo (four studies, 677 participants; mean difference [MD] -2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.14 to 0.19 units). We found moderate certainty evidence for a probable benefit of long-chain omega-3 supplements in increasing aqueous tear production relative to placebo (six studies, 1704 participants; MD 0.68, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.09 mm/5 min using the Schirmer test), although we did not judge this difference to be clinically meaningful. We found low certainty evidence for a possible reduction in tear osmolarity (one study, 54 participants; MD -17.71, 95% CI -28.07 to -7.35 mOsmol/L). Heterogeneity was too substantial to pool data on tear break-up time (TBUT) and adverse effects. Combined omega-3 and omega-6 versus placebo (four RCTs) For symptoms (low certainty) and ocular surface staining (moderate certainty), data from the four included trials could not be meta-analyzed, and thus effects on these outcomes were unclear. For the Schirmer test, we found moderate certainty evidence that there was no intergroup difference (four studies, 455 participants; MD: 0.66, 95% CI -0.45 to 1.77 mm/5 min). There was moderate certainty for a probable improvement in TBUT with the PUFA intervention relative to placebo (four studies, 455 participants; MD 0.55, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.07 seconds). Effects on tear osmolarity and adverse events were unclear, with data only available from a single small study for each outcome. Omega-3 plus conventional therapy versus conventional therapy alone (two RCTs) For omega-3 plus conventional therapy versus conventional therapy alone, we found low certainty evidence suggesting an intergroup difference in symptoms favoring the omega-3 group (two studies, 70 participants; MD -7.16, 95% CI -13.97 to -0.34 OSDI units). Data could not be combined for all other outcomes. Long-chain omega-3 (EPA and DHA) versus omega-6 (five RCTs) For long-chain omega-3 versus omega-6 supplementation, we found moderate certainty evidence for a probable improvement in dry eye symptoms (two studies, 130 participants; MD -11.88, 95% CI -18.85 to -4.92 OSDI units). Meta-analysis was not possible for outcomes relating to ocular surface staining, Schirmer test or TBUT. We found low certainty evidence for a potential improvement in tear osmolarity (one study, 105 participants; MD -11.10, 95% CI -12.15 to -10.05 mOsmol/L). There was low level certainty regarding any potential effect on gastrointestinal side effects (two studies, 91 participants; RR 2.34, 95% CI 0.35 to 15.54).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, the findings in this review suggest a possible role for long-chain omega-3 supplementation in managing dry eye disease, although the evidence is uncertain and inconsistent. A core outcome set would work toward improving the consistency of reporting and the capacity to synthesize evidence.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^1148gRGD]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical intervention studies

Statin therapy alone, in addition to best standards of care, is unable to completely normalize CV risk associated with atherogenic dyslipidaemia. Higher doses may partially correct residual dyslipidaemia, but can also increase the risk of side effects, especially myopathy. Addition of ezetimibe or bile acid resins to statin therapy has little effect on triglycerides and HDL-C levels; resins may even raise triglycerides. Evidence is supportive of therapeutic approaches aimed at concomitantly lowering TRL and raising HDL-C to reduce CV risk. Of these options, both niacin and fibrates influence levels of multiple lipids and lipoproteins (Box 2,) and therefore clinically beneficial effects observed cannot be ascribed solely to changes in any single lipoprotein fraction. Pathways implicated in the lipid effects of niacin, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acids are summarized in Table 3. –

Table 3
Mechanisms implicated in the lipid-modifying activity of niacin, fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids

Box 2
Lipid effects of niacin, fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids

Niacin

Niacin at therapeutic doses has a broad spectrum of effects on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, including raising of HDL-C (Box 2). While various pathways are implicated, – its mechanism of action is incompletely elucidated (Table 3). Niacin may also promote beneficial vasoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects independent of its lipid-modifying activity. –

Imaging trials clearly document attenuated progression of atherosclerosis and intima-media thickening by niacin. – The only major outcome study to date, the Coronary Drug Project, showed that niacin (immediate-release 3 g/day) was associated with a 26% reduction in non-fatal MI (P < 0.005) at 6–7 years, and 11% reduction in all-cause mortality (P = 0.0004) at 15 years (∼9 years after the end of treatment). These clinical benefits were similar in patients with or without hyperglycaemia, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome. A recent meta-analysis of niacin studies has confirmed these findings.

### Meta-analysis and meta-regression of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for major depressive disorder [^115JP1Yq]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has been proposed as (adjuvant) treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). In the present meta-analysis, we pooled randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on depressive symptoms in MDD. Moreover, we performed meta-regression to test whether supplementation effects depended on eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid dose, their ratio, study duration, participants' age, percentage antidepressant users, baseline MDD symptom severity, publication year and study quality. To limit heterogeneity, we only included studies in adult patients with MDD assessed using standardized clinical interviews, and excluded studies that specifically studied perinatal/perimenopausal or comorbid MDD. Our PubMED/EMBASE search resulted in 1955 articles, from which we included 13 studies providing 1233 participants. After taking potential publication bias into account, meta-analysis showed an overall beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFAs on depressive symptoms in MDD (standardized mean difference = 0.398 (0.114–0.682), P = 0.006, random-effects model). As an explanation for significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 73.36, P < 0.001), meta-regression showed that higher EPA dose (β = 0.00037 (0.00009–0.00065), P = 0.009), higher percentage antidepressant users (β = 0.0058 (0.00017–0.01144), P = 0.044) and earlier publication year (β = −0.0735 (−0.143 to 0.004), P = 0.04) were significantly associated with better outcome for PUFA supplementation. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed. In conclusion, present meta-analysis suggested a beneficial overall effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in MDD patients, especially for higher doses of EPA and in participants taking antidepressants. Future precision medicine trials should establish whether possible interactions between EPA and antidepressants could provide targets to improve antidepressant response and its prediction. Furthermore, potential long-term biochemical side effects of high-dosed add-on EPA supplementation should be carefully monitored.

### Meta-analysis and meta-regression of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for major depressive disorder [^116pijdF]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations and strengths

Despite several strengths of this meta-analysis, some limitations should be noted. First, the present meta-analysis has not been performed on patient level data. It would be interesting to confirm these findings on a patient level. Moreover, this may also lead to additional predictors of supplementation outcome, giving rise to extra targets for future precision medicine studies. We hope researchers will be motivated to share and pool available data in the future. Furthermore, while the present meta-analysis had enough power to detect small-to-medium effect sizes, smaller regression effects may have been lost as a result of the smaller number of studies due to the specific in- and exclusion criteria. In addition, several concerns regarding the quality of the available evidence could be made, like in most meta-analyses. Further high-quality evidence to support a beneficial effect of EPA in (antidepressant using) MDD patients could lead to more precise estimates of overall effect size. Finally, to maintain power for the meta-regression regarding the effect of percentage antidepressant users on supplementation outcome, we pooled all concurrent antidepressant classes together, while the effects may differ per class. It would be interesting to further test this in future studies including users of different antidepressants.

Nonetheless, the present study/analyses focused on studies that specifically included patients with MDD according to diagnostic criteria as ascertained with a structured clinical interview. We thus limited clinical heterogeneity while still maintaining a substantial overall sample size. As a second strength, by performing extensive nuanced a priori planned publication bias analyses and meta-regression analyses, we revealed new evidence for (1) an effect of EPA dose as opposed to EPA to DHA ratio and (2) an interaction between omega-3 PUFAs and antidepressants, both of which may be highly relevant for clinical practice.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the present meta-analysis observed a beneficial overall effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with MDD according to diagnostic criteria, which seemed larger in studies that supplemented higher doses of EPA and included patients taking antidepressants. Future precision/personalized medicine trials should establish whether possible interactions between EPA and antidepressants could provide targets to improve antidepressant response and its prediction. Nevertheless, potential long-term biochemical side effects of high-dosed add-on EPA supplementation should be carefully monitored.

### Using high-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplements to lower triglyceride levels in 10-to 19-year-olds [^112vj2eH]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Omega-3 fatty acids supplements lower triglyceride (TG) levels in adults; little pediatric information is available. We evaluated their effect in hypertriglyceridemic adolescents.

Methods

Twenty-five patients aged 10 to 19 years with TG levels 150 to 1000 mg/dL were randomized to 6 months double-blind trial of Lovaza (~3360 mg docosahexaenoic acid + eicosapentaenoic acid per day) versus placebo.

Results

Baseline mean TG levels were 227 mg/dL (standard deviation = 49). TG levels declined at 3 months in the Lovaza group by 54 ± 27 mg/dL (mean ± standard error; p = 0.02) and by 34 ± 26 mg/dL (P = 0.16) in the placebo group. The difference in TG lowering between groups was not significant (P = 0.52). There were no between-group differences in endothelial function, blood pressure, body mass index, C-reactive protein, or side effects.

Conclusions

High-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplements are well tolerated in adolescents. However, declines in TG levels did not differ significantly from Placebo in this small study.

### Omega-3 fatty acids and arrhythmias [^114PQdLf]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

The pro- and antiarrhythmic effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been extensively studied in preclinical and human trials. Despite early evidence of an antiarrhythmic role of n-3 PUFA in the prevention of sudden cardiac death and postoperative and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), subsequent well-designed randomized trials have largely not shown an antiarrhythmic benefit. Two trials that tested moderate and high-dose n-3 PUFA demonstrated a reduction in sudden cardiac death, but these findings have not been widely replicated, and the potential of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to reduce arrhythmic death in combination, or as monotherapy, remains uncertain. The accumulated clinical evidence does not support supplementation of n-3 PUFA for postoperative AF or secondary prevention of AF. Several large, contemporary, randomized controlled trials of high-dose n-3 PUFA for primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention have demonstrated a small, significant, dose-dependent increased risk of incident AF compared with mineral oil or corn oil comparator. These findings were reproduced with both icosapent ethyl monotherapy and a mixed EPA+DHA formulation. The proarrhythmic mechanism of increased AF in contemporary cohorts exposed to high-dose n-3 PUFA is unknown. EPA and DHA and their metabolites have pleiotropic cardiometabolic and pro- and antiarrhythmic effects, including modification of the lipid raft microenvironment; alteration of cell membrane structure and fluidity; modulation of sodium, potassium, and calcium currents; and regulation of gene transcription, cell proliferation, and inflammation. Further characterization of the complex association between EPA, EPA+DHA, and DHA and AF is needed. Which formulations, dose ranges, and patient subgroups are at highest risk, remain unclear.

Nutrition recommendations — omega-3 (EPA + DHA) therapy for triglyceride reduction: "Therapeutic dosages of EPA + DHA for TG reduction are 2.0 to 4.0 g/day". Use "should be done only under the supervision of a qualified clinician", with patient education on capsule EPA + DHA content and dosing, and "prescription forms of EPA and EPA + DHA concentrates are only indicated for treatment of very high TG (≥ 500 mg/dL) to reduce the risk of pancreatitis".

### Expert opinion: omega-3 fatty acids and bleeding-cause for concern? [^1156dZBf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters have well-known triglyceride-lowering properties and were shown > 30 years ago to inhibit platelet function. With the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of these agents for treating severe triglyceride elevations, concerns about excess bleeding naturally arise. However, an objective assessment of the evidence for clinically significant bleeding reveals that such concerns are unfounded. As such, the benefits of triglyceride lowering with omega-3 fatty acids more than outweigh any theoretical risks for increased bleeding.

### Future of stroke prevention: 7 updates in the 2024 AHA / ASA primary prevention of stroke guideline [^111qBYMc]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

New recommendations for the utilization of bempedoic acid and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation/pharmacotherapy were provided in the 2024 Primary Prevention of Stroke Guideline. Use of bempedoic acid among individuals with statin-associated side effects received a 2b recommendation in the 2024 Primary Prevention of Stroke Guideline. In secondary RCT outcomes, bempedoic acid led to a nonsignificant 15% relative risk reduction (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.67–1.07) in fatal or nonfatal stroke; however, the CLEAR Outcomes trial was not powered to detect an independent effect on stroke.

A Class 3 recommendation (no benefit) was provided for omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for stroke risk reduction. Several different meta-analyses have demonstrated that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation does not reduce risk of stroke. However, not all RCTs involving omega-3 fatty acids included in these meta-analyses have included similar control groups, or similar omega-3 fatty acid formulations, which may be an important consideration given that high-dose eicosapentaenoic acid and icosapent ethyl monotherapy may have enhanced CVD protective benefit compared to combinations including docosahexaenoic acid.REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial) found that 2 g of twice daily icosapent ethyl vs mineral oil placebo led to a 28% relative risk reduction in a secondary outcome of stroke (2.4% vs 3.3%), although subgroup analyses were not reported according to the presence vs absence of baseline stroke and/or prevalent clinical CVD. Providers should remain focused on optimal statin therapy, with the consideration of PCSK9 mAb for further LDL-C lowering or bempedoic acid in those with statin intolerance.

Moving forward, the risk of bleeding, using mineral oil, rates of AF, dosages and durations of omega-3 fatty acids (high dose versus low dose) should be taken into consideration when designing future and ongoing randomized controlled trials. The STRENGTH trial and EVAPORATE trial are studies that will further evaluate the efficacy of high-dose, pure EPA in patients with cardiovascular disease, and their results are highly anticipated.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114Ppvzw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Researchers have suggested that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from oily fish (long-chain omega-3 (LCn3), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), as well as from plants (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)) benefit cardiovascular health. Guidelines recommend increasing omega-3-rich foods, and sometimes supplementation, but recent trials have not confirmed this.

Objectives

To assess effects of increased intake of fish- and plant-based omega-3 for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CVD) events, adiposity and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to April 2017, plus ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry to September 2016, with no language restrictions. We handsearched systematic review references and bibliographies and contacted authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that lasted at least 12 months and compared supplementation and/or advice to increase LCn3 or ALA intake versus usual or lower intake.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed validity. We performed separate random-effects meta-analysis for ALA and LCn3 interventions, and assessed dose-response relationships through meta-regression.

Main Results

We included 79 RCTs (112,059 participants) in this review update and found that 25 were at low summary risk of bias. Trials were of 12 to 72 months' duration and included adults at varying cardiovascular risk, mainly in high-income countries. Most studies assessed LCn3 supplementation with capsules, but some used LCn3- or ALA-rich or enriched foods or dietary advice compared to placebo or usual diet. LCn3 doses ranged from 0.5g/d LCn3 to > 5 g/d (16 RCTs gave at least 3g/d LCn3). Meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses suggested little or no effect of increasing LCn3 on all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03, 92,653 participants; 8189 deaths in 39 trials, high-quality evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03, 67,772 participants; 4544 CVD deaths in 25 RCTs), cardiovascular events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04, 90,378 participants; 14,737 people experienced events in 38 trials, high-quality evidence), coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09, 73,491 participants; 1596 CHD deaths in 21 RCTs), stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16, 89,358 participants; 1822 strokes in 28 trials) or arrhythmia (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05, 53,796 participants; 3788 people experienced arrhythmia in 28 RCTs). There was a suggestion that LCn3 reduced CHD events (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97, 84,301 participants; 5469 people experienced CHD events in 28 RCTs); however, this was not maintained in sensitivity analyses - LCn3 probably makes little or no difference to CHD event risk. All evidence was of moderate GRADE quality, except as noted. Increasing ALA intake probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20, 19,327 participants; 459 deaths, 5 RCTs), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.25, 18,619 participants; 219 cardiovascular deaths, 4 RCTs), and CHD mortality (1.1% to 1.0%, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26, 18,353 participants; 193 CHD deaths, 3 RCTs) and ALA may make little or no difference to CHD events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22, 19,061 participants, 397 CHD events, 4 RCTs, low-quality evidence). However, increased ALA may slightly reduce risk of cardiovascular events (from 4.8% to 4.7%, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07, 19,327 participants; 884 CVD events, 5 RCTs, low-quality evidence with greater effects in trials at low summary risk of bias), and probably reduces risk of arrhythmia (3.3% to 2.6%, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.10, 4,837 participants; 141 events, 1 RCT). Effects on stroke are unclear. Sensitivity analysis retaining only trials at low summary risk of bias moved effect sizes towards the null (RR 1.0) for all LCn3 primary outcomes except arrhythmias, but for most ALA outcomes, effect sizes moved to suggest protection. LCn3 funnel plots suggested that adding in missing studies/results would move effect sizes towards null for most primary outcomes. There were no dose or duration effects in subgrouping or meta-regression. There was no evidence that increasing LCn3 or ALA altered serious adverse events, adiposity or lipids, except LCn3 reduced triglycerides by ˜15% in a dose-dependant way (high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health to date. Moderate- and high-quality evidence suggests that increasing EPA and DHA has little or no effect on mortality or cardiovascular health (evidence mainly from supplement trials). Previous suggestions of benefits from EPA and DHA supplements appear to spring from trials with higher risk of bias. Low-quality evidence suggests ALA may slightly reduce CVD event and arrhythmia risk.

### Lipid SIG algorithms [^112EF3NH]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Triglyceride management (off label in pediatrics) — omega-3 fatty acids and fibrates: For omega-3 fatty acids, the recommended dose is 4g/day DHA/EPA. For fibrates, counsel about side effects, potential drug interactions, and contraindications; prefer fenofibrate initially due to fewer side effects, better tolerated, and only once daily dosing. Check baseline AST and ALT and again in 4 weeks to monitor; if AST, ALT > 3x ULN, stop fibrate and consider starting at lower dose once labs normalize or refer to lipid specialist. Notes include that TG lowering medications in adults with diabetes have shown inconsistent results with improved CVD benefit; side effects include muscle toxicity and hepatotoxicity with higher risk of muscle toxicity if on fibrate and statin; drug interactions include coumarin anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, and bile acid resins; and contraindications include severe renal dysfunction, acute liver disease, gall bladder disease, hypersensitivity to fibrate, and nursing mothers.

### Dyslipidemia management in women of reproductive potential: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^1167HW35]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for pregnant and lactating women is described as reasonable for those unable or unwilling to eat seafood to ensure adequate intake of EPA and DHA, but dietary supplements are very loosely regulated by the FDA and are not authorized for premarket approval of safety and effectiveness; therefore, careful selection of high-quality supplements with the "USP Verified Mark" is advised to ensure GMP production, correct ingredients, absence of harmful substances, and dissolution. Regarding dosing, many professional organizations recommend 200–300 mg daily, but higher doses (up to 1000 mg/day) of DHA were found to be superior compared to 200 mg/day in reducing early preterm birth with no increased risk of adverse effects for the mother.

Reported biological actions of EPA and DHA extend well beyond TG lowering and include effects expected to be cardioprotective. 48, 54, 55, 56, 57 As summarized by Mozaffarian and Rimm, 46 and shown in Figure 1, fish oil omega‐3 PUFAs have been linked with reduced blood pressure and heart rate, as well as decreased platelet aggregation. 40, 58, 59, 60, 61 They have also been linked with anti‐inflammatory actions and stabilization of coronary plaque. 62, 63, 64, 65 Anti‐dysrhythmic actions have been observed in animal or cell models, but their significance in humans is controversial. 40 As shown in Figure 1, some of the observed cardioprotective effects of omega‐3 PUFAs require comparatively high doses of EPA/DHA; for example, lowering of diastolic blood pressure seems to require doses of ≥ 2 g per day, 59 and antithrombotic effects appear to require even higher doses. 66 It is plausible that other biological effects of omega‐3 PUFAs — such as contributions to the mediation of inflammation 67, 68 — may contribute to improvements in CV endpoints, although those relationships need extensive additional testing.

### Cardiovascular effects of omega-3 fatty acids: hope or hype? [^113Rfxyp]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids have emerged as a new option for controlling the residual risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the statin era after a clinical trial (REDUCE-IT) reported positive results with icosapent ethyl (IPE) in patients receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy. However, another trial which used high dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) combination (STRENGTH) has failed. Together, these results raise clinically important questions. Are effects of omega-3 fatty acids neutral or beneficial in patients on statin therapy, or perhaps even harmful? The current contradictory results could be attributed to different types of omega-3 fatty acids (only EPA or combination of EPA + DHA), doses (higher vs. lower dose) of omega-3 fatty acids or different comparators (corn oil or mineral oil), as well as the underlying severity of the CVD risk or use of statins. Together with these issues, we will discuss different biological and clinical effects of various types of omega-3 fatty acids and then interpret different results of past and current clinical studies and propose practical suggestions, which could be applied in patient management.

### High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels [^11443dfE]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, and much like our study, Raison et al.and Rapaport et al.find not only that high inflammation predicts a better response to the anti-inflammatory intervention, but also that low inflammation predicts a better response to placebo, i.e. lowering inflammation in people who already have low inflammation actually has adverse effects. We also find that children with the highest baseline EPA levels perform better on placebo than on EPA, in impulsivity and in parental and teachers' reports of ADHD and emotional symptoms. A previous meta-analysis in depression has also shown a "J-shaped curve" in the protective effects of PUFAs, increasing for doses of up to 1.8 g/day of n-3 PUFAs (or 0.6 g/day of EPA + DHA intake), and then decreasing for higher doses; this suggests that very high doses of PUFAs (or, by extensions, normal doses in people with high endogenous PUFAs levels), may have adverse effects. However, it is important to emphasise that this J-shaped curve has been described for the intake of PUFAs from the diet, rather than supplementation, and hence some potential mechanisms to explain these negative effects (high dietary intake of omega-6, or environmental contaminants like mercury from fish) are not present in our study. Reassuringly, most studies of children with ADHD (conducted largely in Western countries) have shown average endogenous EPA levels that are lower than those in our study, probably because of the low-fish and high-omega-6 dietary intake in non-Asian countries; thus, it is unlikely that non-Asian children would normally reach endogenous PUFAs levels that are similar to those in the highest tertile of our sample. Nevertheless, with fish intake and other natural sources of omega-3 being constantly advocated as part of a healthy diet, it is important to be aware that supplementing those who already have high levels of EPA may be detrimental.

### Omega 3 fatty acids for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease [^116mF3k2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that omega 3 (W3, n-3 or omega-3) fats from oily fish and plants are beneficial to health.

Objectives

To assess whether dietary or supplemental omega 3 fatty acids alter total mortality, cardiovascular events or cancers using both RCT and cohort studies.

Search Strategy

Five databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched to February 2002. No language restrictions were applied. Bibliographies were checked and authors contacted.

Selection Criteria

RCTs were included where omega 3 intake or advice was randomly allocated and unconfounded, and study duration was at least six months. Cohorts were included where a cohort was followed up for at least six months and omega 3 intake estimated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were assessed for inclusion, data extracted and quality assessed independently in duplicate. Random effects meta-analysis was performed separately for RCT and cohort data.

Main Results

Forty eight randomised controlled trials (36,913 participants) and 41 cohort analyses were included. Pooled trial results did not show a reduction in the risk of total mortality or combined cardiovascular events in those taking additional omega 3 fats (with significant statistical heterogeneity). Sensitivity analysis, retaining only studies at low risk of bias, reduced heterogeneity and again suggested no significant effect of omega 3 fats. Restricting analysis to trials increasing fish-based omega 3 fats, or those increasing short chain omega 3s, did not suggest significant effects on mortality or cardiovascular events in either group. Subgroup analysis by dietary advice or supplementation, baseline risk of CVD or omega 3 dose suggested no clear effects of these factors on primary outcomes. Neither RCTs nor cohorts suggested increased relative risk of cancers with higher omega 3 intake but estimates were imprecise so a clinically important effect could not be excluded.

Reviewers' Conclusions

It is not clear that dietary or supplemental omega 3 fats alter total mortality, combined cardiovascular events or cancers in people with, or at high risk of, cardiovascular disease or in the general population. There is no evidence we should advise people to stop taking rich sources of omega 3 fats, but further high quality trials are needed to confirm suggestions of a protective effect of omega 3 fats on cardiovascular health. There is no clear evidence that omega 3 fats differ in effectiveness according to fish or plant sources, dietary or supplemental sources, dose or presence of placebo.

### Bleeding risk in patients receiving omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1119Yfej]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a potential concern about increased bleeding risk in patients receiving omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The aims of this study-level meta-analysis were to determine the risk of bleeding and to assess whether this relationship is linked to the received dose of omega-3 PUFAs or the background use of antiplatelet treatment.

Methods and Results

Electronic databases were searched through May 2023 to identify randomized clinical trials of patients receiving omega-3 PUFAs. Overall bleeding events, including fatal and central nervous system events, were identified and compared with those of a control group. A total of 120643 patients from 11 randomized clinical trials were included. There was no difference in the pooled meta-analytic events of bleeding among patients receiving omega-3 PUFAs and those in the control group (rate ratio [RR], 1.09 [95% CI, 0.91–1.31]; P = 0.34). Likewise, the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial bleeding, and gastrointestinal bleeding were similar. A prespecified analysis was performed in patients receiving high-dose purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which demonstrated a 50% increase in the relative risk of bleeding but only a modest increase in the absolute risk of bleeding (0.6%) when compared with placebo. Bleeding risk was associated with the dose of EPA (risk difference, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.05–0.43]; P = 0.02) but not the background use of antiplatelet therapy (risk difference, -0.01 [95% CI, -0.02 to 0]; P = 0.056).

Conclusions

Omega-3 PUFAs were not associated with increased bleeding risk. Patients receiving high-dose purified EPA may incur additional bleeding risk, although its clinical significance is very modest.

### Antiatherosclerotic and antithrombotic effects of omega-3 fatty acids [^116ohUsY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids from both marine and plant sources have been shown to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease death. Although their beneficial cardiovascular effects are thought to be due to their antiarrhythmic properties, omega-3 fatty acids also have been shown to have a wide range of antiatherosclerotic and antithrombotic effects in animal and human studies. Review of the findings of randomized, controlled trials published through August 2005 shows that omega-3 fatty acids of marine origin consistently lower elevated plasma triglyceride levels in a dose-dependent fashion, with greater efficacy at higher triglyceride levels. Smaller effects on lowering blood pressure, improving endothelial function, and increasing plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were also found. No consistent effects on other lipid, hemostatic, inflammatory, glucose tolerance, or plaque stabilization parameters were found. Epidemiologic studies show more consistent reductions in the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke than do the clinical trials of increased omega-3 fatty acid intake, which suggests important confounding factors in observational studies. Ongoing clinical trials may clarify the non-antiarrhythmic benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.

### The efficacy and safety of omega-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms in perinatal women: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^112xMDXs]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Perinatal depression (PND) is normally defined as onset of a depression episode, ranging from mild to severe, during pregnancy or postpartum within 1 year after delivery. Depression disorder during perinatal period among childbearing-age women is increasingly common worldwide, with a prevalence of 11.9% in general and higher risk in low-income countries, as high as 25% antepartum and 20% postpartum. Different from general "maternity blues", with remission in 1 or 2 weeks; PND symptoms are more severe and persistent if they are ignored. Symptoms of PND include depressed mood, marked lack of interest or pleasure in all or most activities, significant weight loss or gain, insomnia or excessive sleep, psychomotor excitement or retardation, fatigue or poor energy, feelings of meaninglessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, and the risk of self-harm or even suicide. Moreover, babies' health can be adversely affected by PND. Depression during pregnancy without treatment can lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, such as small in size, preterm birth, and the risk for low birth weight –. In the long-term, offspring of mothers subjected to PND are prone to defects in cognitive development in childhood, have a higher risk to display depressive behavior in adolescence and be involved in criminal activities in adulthood.

The treatment of PND is a clinical dilemma. Almost all antidepressants can cross the placenta more or less. Almost all of pregnant women refuse to take medications with fear of potential side effects on offspring, for example major cardiovascular malformations and poor neonatal adaptation syndromes. Omega-3 FA, mainly comprised of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosatetraenoic acid (EPA), is a type of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). DHA constitutes an essential part of cell membranes and is found to be abundant in brains and retina. Both DHA and EPA are precursors of a group of eicosanoids, which have anti-inflammatory effects. Naturally, human is unable to synthesize omega-3 FA in vivo, hence regular dietary intake of deep-sea fish which is enriched in omega-3 is essential for health. As a kind of indispensable nutrient substance, plenty of studies have verified the moderate beneficial effects of omega-3 (monotherapy or adjuvant) on some mental diseases like major depressive disorder (MDD). The supposed mechanisms are anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant. Therefore, considering of safety in perinatal period, omega-3 FA are supposed to be a promising therapy alternative for PND.

### Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for depression in children and adolescents [^1153HvDM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Mental health disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD) are well recognized as major contributors to the global burden of disease among adolescents. The prevalence of adolescent depression is estimated to have increased by at least 25% during the COVID-19 pandemic, compounding the already challenging problem of insufficient mental health service and service accessibility that existed prepandemic. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation is currently recommended as a preventive treatment for depression in high-risk adults as well as a second-line monotherapy for adults with mild to moderate MDD, and adjunctive to antidepressants for adults with moderate to severe MDD. The benefits of omega-3 PUFA intake on depressive illness have been hypothesized to occur as a result of their effect on neurotransmission, maintenance of membrane fluidity, and anti-inflammatory action. A comprehensive synthesis and quantification of the existing evidence on omega-3 PUFA's efficacy in treating depression among children and adolescents is essential for clinicians to provide informed guidance to young people and their families, especially considering the absence of current guidelines for this age group.

Objectives

Primary objective To determine the impact of omega-3 PUFA supplementation versus a comparator (e.g. placebo, wait list controls, no treatment/supplementation, or standard care) on clinician-diagnosed depression or self-reported depression symptoms in children and adolescents. Secondary objectives To estimate the size of the effect of omega-3 PUFAs on depression symptoms. To estimate the effect of each type of omega-3 PUFA (EPA or DHA), compared with placebo, on depression. To determine if the effect is modified by dosage, format (capsule or liquid), sex, or age. To determine compliance and attrition for omega-3 PUFAs as an intervention for depression in children and adolescents. To determine the safety of omega-3 PUFAs as an intervention for depression in children and adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, reference lists of included studies, grey literature, and relevant reviews. The latest search date was 18 May 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving males and females aged 19 years or younger with diagnosed depression comparing omega-3 PUFA supplementation to placebo, wait list control, no treatment/supplementation, or standard care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were self-reported depression symptoms and clinically diagnosed resolution of depression. Our secondary outcomes were attrition, adverse effects, and compliance with the intervention. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for key outcomes.

Main Results

We included five trials with 228 participants in our meta-analysis. All trials used a placebo comparator; intervention duration ranged from 10 to 16 weeks (median: 12 weeks). Omega-3 PUFA supplementation compared to placebo may reduce self-reported depression symptoms, but the evidence is very uncertain (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.85 to 0.17; lower SMD means greater improvement in depression due to omega-3 PUFA; 5 trials, 185 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may have little to no effect on remission of depression symptoms compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (omega-3 PUFA versus placebo: 50% versus 48%; odds ratio [OR] 1.11, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.75; 4 trials, 127 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may result in little to no difference in attrition (dropouts) compared to placebo (omega-3 PUFA versus placebo: 18% versus 19%; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.90; 5 trials, 228 participants; low-certainty evidence). Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may result in little to no difference in adverse effects, with one study reporting more muscle cramps in the fish oil group (13/27 participants) compared to the placebo group (6/29 participants); one study reported more frequent defecation in the omega-3 group (1/29 participants) and one study identified mild skin rash and unusual/manic behavior in the placebo group (2/27 participants). None of the included studies reported serious adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on five small studies, omega-3 PUFA supplementation may reduce self-reported depression symptoms, but the evidence is very uncertain. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may have little to no effect on depression remission compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may result in little to no difference in attrition or adverse effects. The studies observed no serious adverse effects. This review highlights early-stage research on omega-3 PUFA and depression in young people. The evidence on the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in improving self-reported depression symptoms or achieving depression remission in children and adolescents is very uncertain. While no harms are evident, more data are needed to confirm potential risks. Addressing current limitations in the evidence base through the design and conduct of methodologically rigorous studies - larger sample sizes, varied dosages, eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid ratios, treatment durations, and safety profiles - is crucial to advance our understanding of the role of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for depression in children and adolescents.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112cZ4zB]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) — dosage and lipid effects: Therapeutic dosages (2.0 to 4.0 g/day) might lower ASCVD event risk, including in patients with elevated TG or elevated TG plus low HDL-C; in JELIS, participants with TG ≥ 150 mg/dL plus HDL-C < 40 mg/dL had a larger reduction in CV events with EPA ethyl esters 1.8 g/day (53%) than the overall sample (19%). For TG lowering, intakes of 2.0 to 4.0 g/day are generally required to achieve significant (> 15%) effects, whereas there is little evidence of clinically relevant efficacy at dosages < 1 g/day; recommended intakes of 200 to 500 mg/day lower TG by 3.1% to 7.9%, and higher intakes of 2.0 to 4.0 g/day lower TG by 20% to 35% and even up to 45% in individuals with very high TG (≥ 500 mg/dL), with greater percentage reductions at higher baseline TG in a non-linear fashion.

### Omega-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular disease prevention… [^113Zoppq]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: Adults 18 years and older with varying levels of cardiovascular risk Efficacy End Points: All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, arrhythmia, stroke Harm End Points: Nausea, abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhea, reflux, any gastrointestinal side effect, headache or worsening migraine, joint and muscle pain, skin problems, gastrointestinal bleeding, hospitalization, pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis. BENEFITS Long-Chain Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids. No significant benefits were noted with long-chain omega-3 PUFA supplementation for preventing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, arrhythmia, or stroke.

HARMS The meta-analysis assessed nonserious side effects and serious adverse effects. All other nonserious side effects were not statistically different. 5 Serious adverse events were not increased with long-chain omega-3 intake. Alpha-Linolenic Acid. Supplementation did not increase side effect–mediated study withdrawal. 5 Insufficient data were available to assess other nonserious side effects. Data were also insufficient for assessing the risk of PE or DVT. No data were available for any other serious adverse events. Lastly, this analysis did not collate data on cancers and neurologic problems associated with polychlorinated biphenyls or mercury in fish oils.

5 In summary, high-quality evidence suggests that long-chain omega-3 PUFAs do not prevent mortality or CVD events when used as primary or secondary prevention. Because of a lack of any benefit but relative safety, we have assigned a color recommendation of red to this treatment.

### Blood pressure-lowering effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: are these the missing link to explain the relationship between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease? [^113PhmqR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The stark difference between the findings of REDUCE‐IT and other contemporary RCTs, particularly STRENGH, which was of a similar design and size, are unexplained and remain the subject of debate. Factors that have been considered are the type of ω3 PUFAs (EPA‐only versus EPA+DHA [both 4 g/day]) and the placebo (mineral oil versus corn oil).

ω3 PUFAs RCT results have been the subject of multiple meta‐analyses over recent years. However, these have suffered from the significant heterogeneity within the field (eg, diet versus supplements, EPA+DHA versus EPA alone, primary versus secondary prevention, dose, eligibility criteria). One recent analysis, by the lead author of REDUCE‐IT, included 38 trials and 149 051 patients. Using a trial‐level, random‐effects model and pooling all doses used, they found ω3 PUFAs reduced cardiovascular mortality (number of RCTs = 25; relative risk, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88–0.98]) but not all‐cause mortality or stroke. They were also associated with a reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events. Effects were stronger with EPA monotherapy (4 trials), and the EPA effect remained after influence analysis removed REDUCE‐IT. With regard to adverse effects, they identified an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and total bleeding on EPA monotherapy. The authors commented that their analysis "provides reassurance about the role of omega‐3 fatty acids, specifically EPA" in the treatment of cardiovascular risk.

Despite the uncertainty generated by discordant RCT results, pooled data suggest a net modest benefit effect of ω3 PUFAs, particularly on cardiovascular mortality in patients at high risk and with raised triglycerides. As described by Zhang et al, the intake of ω3 PUFAs is associated with a BP‐lowering effect, and a dose of 2 to 3 g appears to be optimal. Given the modest effect on triglycerides, this BP‐lowering impact together with their other pleiotropic effects are likely the missing link to explain the cardiovascular risk reduction seen in REDUCE‐ITand subsequent meta‐analyses. However, further RCTs and postmarketing studies are required to resolve the remaining questions, particularly one that was raised by the disparity between REDUCE‐ITand STRENGHof EPA monotherapy versus the combination of EPA and DHA. Therefore, ω3 PUFAs are still not fully ready for prime time, and physicians should keep an open mind on these compounds with acute awareness toward of the mixed evidence base and the potential risks of increased atrial fibrillation and bleeding when prescribing.

### Bleeding risk in patients receiving omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112yTTrH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The main findings of this study could be summarized as follows: (1) the incidence of any or central nervous system bleeding events were relatively low (2.6% and < 1%, respectively); (2) omega‐3 PUFAs were not associated with an increased risk of overall, hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial or gastrointestinal bleeding; (3) high‐dose purified EPA was associated with increased bleeding risk, although the clinical significance is debatable; and (4) bleeding risk was associated with the dose of EPA rather than the background use of antiplatelet therapy.

Omega‐3 PUFAs were early recognized to be associated with favorable lipid profile and, subsequently, were linked to improved clinical outcomes. However, randomized clinical trials did not consistently demonstrate incremental benefits when using omega‐3 PUFAs in reducing future cardiovascular risk. The REDUCE‐IT trial reported a large absolute risk reduction from exposing patients with stable atherosclerotic disease to high‐dose purified EPA. This reduction was not proportionate to the change in patients' lipid profile and suggested pleotropic effects of icosapent ethyl beyond its triglyceride‐lowering effects. The use of mineral oil as placebo in the REDUCE‐IT trial may have magnified its results; nonetheless, its unfavorable impact on lipid and inflammatory profile was modest and unlikely to explain the difference in clinical outcomes. Anti‐inflammatory, cell membrane stabilization and antiplatelet effects were all proposed as plausible mechanisms that could explain the large reduction in future cardiovascular risks in patients who were exposed to icosapent ethyl.,

The antiplatelet effect of omega‐3 PUFAs is well‐recognized and subsequent bleeding has been a potential concern for patients receiving this treatment. In fact, bleeding time, as well as EPA and DHA levels in platelets, were higher among Inuit people with high consumption of omega‐3 PUFAs when compared with other groups. This potential association has led to several recommendations advising patients to stop taking omega‐3 PUFAs before surgery or to delay elective procedures in patients consuming omega‐3 PUFAs. Nonetheless, randomized clinical trials did not demonstrate an increase in periprocedural bleeding risk in patients receiving omega‐3 PUFAs. Likewise, there was no evidence to support increased bleeding events in patients who are considered at high bleeding risk when receiving omega‐3 PUFA. This includes patients with gastrointestinal cancer or patients on intensive care units. Herein, we demonstrate that there is no increased risk of overall bleeding events in patients receiving omega‐3 PUFAs. Moreover, the incidence of serious bleeding, including hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial bleeding, was comparable between the 2 groups.

### Clinical review on triglycerides [^11661MDA]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

High doses of omega-3-fatty acids (> 2 g/day) can variably decrease TG levels; at lower doses (1 g/day) these agents have generally failed to show reduced ASCVD. A recently published study, REDUCE-IT, which evaluated the effect of 4 g icosapent ethyl (Vascepa) in high-risk patients with elevated TG levels on background statin therapy, is interesting and informative in this regard. In > 9000 high-risk patients, a dramatic risk reduction (HR 0.75) for ASCVD events was observed over a period of 4.9 years. It is currently unclear whether the observed benefit relates to the particular omega-3 fatty acid formulation used (icosapent ethyl), the high daily dose of 4 g, the carefully selected study population, or a possible deleterious effect of the mineral oil comparator used as placebo. In addition, the strongly positive outcomes seemed to be mediated by factors other than TG reduction, since benefit was seen independent of baseline TG level. Another study using high-dose omega-3 fatty acids is ongoing; once results are reported — likely in 2021 — the role of omega-3 fatty acids in treating patients with elevated TG will become clearer.

### A randomized trial of high-dose compared with low-dose omega-3 fatty acids in severe IgA nephropathy [^112Mo9Lh]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Tested was the hypothesis that high-dose omega (omega)-3 fatty acids will be more effective than low-dose omega-3 fatty acids in preserving renal function in patients with severe IgA nephropathy in a randomized, open-label, parallel-group clinical trial. Patients were assigned to receive either high-dose fatty acids (EPA 3.76 g and DHA 2.94 g) or low-dose fatty acids (EPA 1.88 g and DHA 1.47 g), both given daily in a highly purified ethyl ester concentrate (Omacor). Patients were treated for a minimum of 2 yr in the absence of a treatment failure or until study closure (January 2000). Seventy-three patients were enrolled in the trial with two ranges of elevated serum creatinine (SC): 63 patients (86%) with a range of 1.5 to 2.9 mg/dl and 10 patients (14%) with a range of 3.0 to 4.9 mg/dl. The primary end point, within-patient rates of change in SC (2-yr minimum), showed an annualized median increase in SC of 0.08 mg/dl per yr in the low-dose group and 0.10 mg/dl per yr in the high-dose group (P: = 0.51). Patients in the lower entry SC range had lower SC slopes (P: = 0.02) and less end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (P: < 0.001) compared with those in the higher entry SC range. No patient died, and 18 patients developed ESRD: 10 in the low-dose group and 8 in the high-dose group (P: = 0.56). SC slopes were significantly lower, and survival free of ESRD was significantly higher (both, P: = 0.04) in the 63 Omacor-treated patients compared with the 22 placebo-treated patients from our previously reported clinical trial in which both groups had a similar level of renal impairment. Patient compliance was excellent, and no serious adverse events were noted. Low-dose and high-dose omega-3 fatty acids were similar in slowing the rate of renal function loss in high-risk patients with IgA nephropathy, particularly those with moderately advanced disease.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^112eRtRw]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Thus, in agreement with the omega-3 index concept, n-3 supplements would be protective only in patients who are more or less n-3 deficient and not in patients who are at high risk for reasons other than n-3 deficiency.

In other words, n-3 are indispensable nutrients, which means that it is dangerous to be n-3 deficient, which is not rare in many populations, and not drugs susceptible to reducing the overall risk of CVD complications independent of the n-3 status of the persons studied.

As discussed in the Introduction section, this view does not include clinical conditions other than CVD. For instance, the right dosage of n-3, in the absence of statins, for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia might be much higher than the current recommended dietary intake to prevent CVD. Further studies are needed to answer this question. The design (and results) of future RCTs testing n-3 supplement should take that issue into consideration.

In conclusion, the present analysis raises several major questions regarding the optimal strategy to prevent the development and complications of CVD.

Given the weak (or lack of) efficiency of statins in recent RCTs and their major toxic side-effects, including inhibition of n-3, what should physicians do?

The priority is to adopt a healthy lifestyle, which is the critical strategy to be actually protected. Should physicians continue to prescribe statins?

Because of the many insidious side-effects of statins and the lack of independent recent data confirming the benefits of statins in both primary and secondary prevention, we actually need a new and independent re-evaluation of the benefit/risk ratio of statins.

In contrast, and given the almost total innocuousness of n-3 in most populations, n-3 supplements should be given without restriction to any patient potentially n-3 deficient and systematically in all patients with established n-3 deficiency. This will give time to change the dietary habits - the alternative solution to correct any degree of n-3 deficiency - of these patients at high risk of fatal CVD complications because of n-3 deficiency.

Definitely, it is time to rethink the use of n-3 supplements and statins (and other cholesterol-lowering drugs) for the prevention of CVD complications. Only scientists and physicians free of conflicts of interest and independent from the pharmaceutical industry, both the n-3 supplement and statin industries, should be invited to review the whole story from the beginning.

### Big fish or No fish; eicosapentaenoic acid and cardiovascular disease [^111AyqSe]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Benefits of omega 3 fatty acids for cardiovascular and other diseases have been touted for more than 50 years. The one clear clinical benefit of these lipids is the reduction of circulating levels of triglycerides, making them a useful approach for the prevention of pancreatitis in severely hypertriglyceridemic patients. After a series of spectacularly failed clinical trials that were criticized for the choice of subjects and doses of omega 3 fatty acids used, Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) using a high dose of icosapent ethyl (IPE) reported a reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. However, this trial has generated controversy due to the use of mineral oil in the control group and the associated side effects of the IPA. This review will focus on the following topics: What are the epidemiologic data suggesting a benefit of omega 3 fatty acids? What might be the mechanisms for these benefits? Why have the clinical trials failed to resolve whether these fatty acids provide benefit? What choices should a clinician consider?

Omega-3 fatty acids

Long chain omega-3 fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 2–4 g/day] are approved as an adjunct to diet for lowering plasma triglycerides when > 5.5 mmol/L (490 mg/dL) to prevent pancreatitis. The profile of lipid-modifying activity is given in Box 2 and mechanisms involved are summarized in Table 3.–

Outcome benefits for omega-3 fatty acids have been reported but relate to lower doses than required clinically to lower triglycerides. – These benefits may be explained by anti-arrhythmic effects, independent of triglycerides. The AFORRD trial in T2DM patients showed no benefit after 4 months of omega-3 fatty acids (2 g/day) in combination with atorvastatin on estimated CV risk. Adverse effects are limited to minor dyspepsia, with no evidence of increased risk of significant bleeding, even with concomitant aspirin or warfarin.

Future options

HDL-C-raising per se may represent a key determinant of the clinical benefits associated with lipid-modifying therapy, although this concept still needs proof from randomized intervention trials.

CETP inhibitors increase HDL-C levels substantially, and some also affect LDL-C and triglyceride levels. Dalcetrapib (JTT-705) exerts moderate effects on plasma lipids (raising HDL-C by up to 37%), whereas torcetrapib was far more potent (increases in HDL-C > 70%), and modestly reduced LDL-C (∼20%) and triglycerides (9%). Despite this, the first outcome study with torcetrapib, ILLUMINATE, was prematurely terminated due to excess mortality. However, recent evidence, suggests that off-target pharmacological effects of torcetrapib were responsible for this adverse outcome rather than a class effect of CETP inhibitors. In all trials, torcetrapib treatment was associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure and electrolyte changes, mediated via hyperaldosteronism. Concerns that large HDL generated through CETP inhibition would be dysfunctional have not been supported by in vitro studies. Other CETP inhibitors (e.g. dalcetrapib and anacetrapib) do not show the off-target effects associated with torcetrapib, as indicated by recent studies. Clinical outcome data from ongoing or planned studies (dal-OUTCOMES with dalcetrapib and REVEAL with anacetrapib) are awaited.

Background Previous results provide supportive but not conclusive evidence for the use of omega-3 fatty acids to reduce blood lipids and prevent events of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but the strength and shape of dose-response relationships remain elusive. Methods and Results This study included 90 randomized controlled trials, reported an overall sample size of 72598 participants, and examined the association between omega-3 fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, or both) intake and blood lipid changes. Random-effects 1-stage cubic spline regression models were used to study the mean dose-response association between daily omega-3 fatty acid intake and changes in blood lipids. Nonlinear associations were found in general and in most subgroups, depicted as J-shaped dose-response curves for low-/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, we found evidence of an approximately linear dose-response relationship for triglyceride and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol among the general population and more evidently in populations with hyperlipidemia and overweight/obesity who were given medium to high doses (> 2g/d). Conclusions This dose-response meta-analysis demonstrates that combined intake of omega-3 fatty acids near linearly lowers triglyceride and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triglyceride-lowering effects might provide supportive evidence for omega-3 fatty acid intake to prevent cardiovascular events.

Eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (EPA plus DHA) — risk–benefit judgment indicated more harms at higher doses and lack of benefit; there was a demonstrated increase in discontinuation due to adverse effects with EPA plus DHA, including 14 025 participants with 27 more discontinuations due to adverse effects per 1000 individuals (95% CI 17 more to 39 more), and there was an increased risk of atrial fibrillation with higher doses of the combined EPA plus DHA therapy. Based on trivial desirable effects (no difference observed) and moderate undesirable effects, the task force judged the balance to not favor use of EPA plus DHA (≥ 1.8 g/day) in adults with hypertriglyceridemia, on statins, with CVD or at risk for CVD, and adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia were not assessed in the included trials, yielding insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against use of EPA plus DHA in this population.

### Clinical overview of omacor: a concentrated formulation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [^111XgCEn]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Omacor (omega-3-acid ethyl esters; Reliant Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Liberty Corner, NJ) is a highly purified, prescription omega-3 fatty acid formulation with high concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (465 mg) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (375 mg) in each 1-g capsule, along with 4 mg (6 IU) of vitamin E. At a typical dose of 4 capsules/day, Omacor significantly lowers plasma triglyceride levels either as monotherapy or in combination with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) or fibrates. Omacor also modestly increases plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and has favorable effects on lipoprotein particle size and subclass distribution. Omacor is well tolerated, with few side effects other than mild gastrointestinal symptoms. Hyperglycemia, abnormal bleeding, elevations in muscle or liver enzymes, and/or abnormalities in kidney or nerve function have not been reported. Through its intensive purification process, Omacor has minimal "fishy" smell and taste, and it has not been reported to cause hypervitaminosis or illness due to exposure to environmental toxins. Omacor provides a safe, effective, well-tolerated approach to management of hypertriglyceridemia.

Results

Characteristics of the participants

Between 1 February 2003 and 1 June 2007, 2501 participants (1987 men and 514 women) were recruited. Overall, the mean (SD) age of participants was 60.9 (8.8) years for men and 63.2 (9.7) years for women. Of the 2501 participants, 1150 (46%) had had a prior myocardial infarction, 713 (28%) an acute coronary syndrome without myocardial infarction, and 638 (26%) an ischaemic stroke. The median time between the acute event and randomisation in the trial was 101 days. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: B vitamins (n = 622), omega 3 fatty acids (n = 633), B vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids (n = 620), or double placebo (n = 626) (fig 1). The four groups were well balanced with respect to the baseline characteristics, risk factors, and medication use (table 1). The median follow-up time was 4.7 years (mean 4.2 (SD 1.0) years) with a total of 10 656 person years. All participants completed their scheduled treatment by 1 July 2009.

Compliance and side effects

The overall response rate for return of completed questionnaires was 99%, 96%, 94%, and 95% at 6, 12, and 24 months and at the end of the trial, respectively. About 86% of those who returned a questionnaire reported that they were compliant with the study treatment (defined as taking at least 80% of the allocated treatment), and compliance was similar in all four groups (87%, 86%, 86%, and 86%). Side effects (chiefly gastrointestinal disturbances, nausea, and cutaneous reactions) accounted for 2.1% of participants stopping treatment (2.6% in the group taking omega 3 fatty acids group, 2.0% in the B vitamins group, and 1.6% in the placebo group).

### A potential role for adjunctive omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for depression and anxiety symptoms in recent onset psychosis: results from a 16 week randomized placebo-controlled trial for participants concurrently treated with risperidone [^114H5bW7]. Schizophrenia Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 treatment studies for multi-episode schizophrenia or clinical high risk for conversion to psychosis states have had variable, and often negative, results. To examine adjunctive omega-3 treatment for recent onset psychosis, participants aged 15–40 years with recent onset schizophrenia-spectrum (n = 46) or bipolar (n = 4) disorders and current psychotic symptoms were treated for 16 weeks with risperidone and randomly-assigned omega-3 (EPA 740 mg and DHA 400 mg daily) or matching placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score. Mean lifetime antipsychotic exposure was 18.1 days. Length of time in treatment, risperidone dose and number of omega-3/placebo capsules taken did not differ between conditions. Longitudinal analysis of the total BPRS score revealed a trend level (p = 0.0826) treatment effect favoring omega-3 treatment. Lorazepam was an allowed concomitant medication. Among the subgroup (N = 23) who did not receive lorazepam, the treatment effect on BPRS total scores favoring omega-3 was significant (p = 0.0406) and factor scores analyses revealed a substantial decrease in depression-anxiety with omega-3 but no change with placebo (treatment-by-time interaction, p = 0.0184). Motor side effects did not differ between conditions. Analysis of Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events assessments revealed fewer adverse events overall with omega-3 compared with placebo with the largest differences between conditions (all favoring omega-3) on confusion, anxiety, depression, irritability, and tiredness/fatigue. These results suggest that omega-3 adjuvant treatment is a potential option for depression and anxiety symptoms of people with recent onset psychosis. Further research is needed to confirm this potential. Clinical trial registration: NCT01786239.

### Omega-3 fatty acids and atrial fibrillation… [^113zWY6F]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

In the past 2 years, 4 randomized clinical trials have provided data on the risk of AF with omega-3 fatty acid intake. In the STRENGTH trial, 3 13 078 high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease were randomized to receive a high dose, 4 g/d, of a carboxylic acid formulation of omega-3 fatty acids or corn oil. After a median of 42 months, there was no significant difference between the 2 randomized groups in the primary composite cardiovascular end point, but there was an increase in risk of developing AF in the omega-3 fatty acids group compared with the corn oil group. As in STRENGTH, there was a significant increase in risk of AF with omega-3 fatty acids compared with mineral oil. After a median of 5. 3 years, the incidence of AF was
7. 2 per 1000 person-years in those taking omega-3 fatty acids vs 6.

6 per 1000 person-years in those taking placebo. Considered together, the data from the 4 trials suggest, but do not prove, that there may be a dose-related risk of AF with omega-3 fatty acid intake. At a dose of 4. 0 g/d, there was a highly statistically significant increase in risk. With an intermediate dose of 1. 8 g/d, the increase in risk did not achieve statistical significance, and with a standard daily dose of 840 mg/d, there was no apparent increase in risk. Patients who choose to take omega-3 fatty acids, especially in high doses, should be informed of the risk of AF and followed up for the possible development of this common and potentially hazardous arrhythmia.

### Preventing AVF thrombosis: the rationale and design of the omega-3 fatty acids (fish oils) and aspirin in vascular access OUtcomes in REnal disease (FAVOURED) study [^113eSYor]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids appear to be well tolerated, even in high doses, with gastrointestinal complaints particularly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and non-specific discomfort being the most often reported. In studies looking at the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on bleeding time it has not been found to be significantly prolonged. In studies that have been done thus far in the CKD cohort, there have been no clear effects demonstrated in relation to platelet aggregation and bleeding times. There has only been one report of a serious bleeding event in a single patient in an uncontrolled study. Furthermore, it has been reported that administration of omega-3 fatty acids can protect the gastric mucosa against aspirin-induced injury, the postulated mechanism being that omega-3 fatty acids counteracts the effect of aspirin on the decrease in prostacyclin (combined effect of PGI2 and PGI3). This is supported by clinical data suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids decreases gastric erosions and ulcers caused by aspirin or alcohol. Thus the combination of aspirin and omega-3 fatty acids may be expected to be additive in terms of efficacy in vascular access thrombosis, but to have a lower risk of bleeding complications than the use of aspirin alone.

We have chosen an oral route of administration for both aspirin and omega-3 fatty acids in this study. The choice of 100 mg for aspirin is based on this dose having adequate anti-platelet aggregation properties and is the dose most commonly used in patients with cardiovascular disease. A 100 mg dose is readily available. The dose of omega-3 fatty acids (4 g daily) has been shown to be well tolerated and improve cardiovascular risk factors in patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The marine derived omega-3 fatty acids (commonly known as fish oils) capsules chosen (Omacor ©), are commercially available and provide the highest concentration of omega-3 fatty acids per gram of oil. The oral absorption of both agents is excellent and thus alternative routes of administration are not required.

The design of a factorial study is based on the hypothesis that aspirin and omega-3 fatty acids will both be effective therapies and that the combination of aspirin and omega-3 fatty acids will be additive, but not synergistic. In relation to safety concerns, although both aspirin and omega-3 fatty acids prolong bleeding time, the combination may be expected to be safer than when aspirin is used alone.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Assess TG levels carefully before initiating therapy. Identify other causes (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, medications) of high TG levels and manage as appropriate [see Indications and Usage (1)].
Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving omega‑3‑acid ethyl esters capsules and should continue this diet during treatment with omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules. In clinical studies, omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules were administered with meals.

The daily dose of omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules is 4 grams per day. The daily dose may be taken as a single 4 gram dose (4 capsules) or as two 2 gram doses (2 capsules given twice daily).

Patients should be advised to swallow omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules whole. Do not break open, crush, dissolve, or chew omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules.

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^111ScCn8]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

High-Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acid Treatment and Residual Cardiovascular Risk

Despite the success of LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-lowering therapies in reducing cardiovascular risk, individuals with well-controlled LDL still have residual cardiovascular risk associated in part with elevated triglycerides. The REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial) that tested an omega-3 fatty acid (n3-FA)-based therapy of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) demonstrated cardiovascular risk reduction in addition to the protection afforded by statins. REDUCE-IT demonstrated that a highly purified ethyl ester of EPA, icosapent ethyl, significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization in at-risk patients with triglycerides above ≈100 mg/dL despite being treated with statins. – First ischemic events fell by 25% (P = 0.00000001) and total (first and subsequent) ischemic events by 31% (P = 0.0000000004), with consistent benefits across multiple prespecified subgroups, including primary and secondary prevention. The prespecified subgroup of 3146 patients randomized in the United States demonstrated benefits at least as robust as the overall population, with a notable 30% lower rate of mortality (P = 0.004) in those randomized to icosapent ethyl. The EPA treatment used yielded consistent benefits across baseline levels of triglycerides as well, including in the ≈10% of participants with normal triglycerides.

The large relative and absolute risk reductions in several different types of end points from REDUCE-IT seemed to exceed that expected by the degree of triglyceride lowering, suggesting that other properties of EPA likely contribute to the benefits, as will be discussed – (Figure 1). Beyond the effect on lowering triglyceride levels, EPA has cell-membrane stabilizing properties that may explain, in part, the significant reductions seen in death from cardiovascular causes (20% reduction), sudden cardiac death (31% reduction), and cardiac arrest (48% reduction). Of note, the results of REDUCE-IT apply to a broad population of at-risk patients. The findings from REDUCE-IT contrast sharply with previous outcome trials that showed no cardiovascular benefit using EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) combinations or dietary supplements that may contain oxidized fatty acids and saturated fat. – Further trials with high-dose n3-FAs in various groups will provide additional insight into this question.

### Conditional recommendations for specific dietary ingredients as an approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain: evidence-based decision aid for health care providers, participants, and policy makers [^1116tfeW]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

Fish oil comes from various species, including mackerel, herring, tuna, halibut, salmon, cod liver, and whale and seal blubber. Thus, these types of fish are dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids, also known as n-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential dietary ingredients and include alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Fish oil supplements contain varying amounts of EPA and DHA (18–51% and 12–32%, respectively). Although ALA is mainly found in green vegetables, canola oil, and soybeans, EPA and DHA almost exclusively come from fish oil and other seafood. ALA, EPA, and DHA are types of omega-3 fatty acids but may serve different functional roles and should subsequently not be considered interchangeable. Although proprietary prescription fish oil is FDA-approved to lower levels of triglycerides, nonprescription formulations of fish oil are also used for other conditions including chronic fatigue syndrome, cognitive function/impairment, and MSK (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, muscle strength, muscle soreness, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, migraines) issues.

The authors relied upon evidence on PUFA for chronic pain presented in Prego-Dominguez et al.'s 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis. The majority of examined studies compared various combinations of PUFA with placebo or other comparators for pain reduction in rheumatoid arthritis patients, with doses ranging from 300 to 9,600 mg for anywhere from four to 48 weeks (Table 2; Supplementary Data: Summary Report).

Conditional recommendations were made (50% weak; 50% strong, in favor) for the use of PUFA supplementation for pain and related symptoms, incorporated into the daily diet at 1,200 mg/d, and not to exceed 2 g/d. Whereas the undesirable effects appear to be small to trivial at low doses, > 3 g/d is likely to increase the potential for adverse events (e.g. inhibition of platelet aggregation, risk of bleeding, and potentially hemorrhagic stroke at very high doses) (Supplementary Data: Summary Report).

Prenatal omega-3 fatty acids — dose, timing, and outcome have been reported. In a recent clinical trial, high-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation at 2.4 g/day to pregnant women, beginning at 24 week of gestation, resulted in a 30% reduction in relative risk of persistent wheeze or asthma at age 3 years, although the report notes the need to ensure no safety issues before use for asthma prevention.

### Comparison of pharmacokinetics of omega-3 fatty acid supplements in monoacylglycerol or ethyl ester in humans: a randomized controlled trial [^111FrgeJ]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to a low intake of n-3 FA, the Western diet is rich in n-6 fatty acids. This creates an imbalance in the n-6/n-3 ratio, which is associated with various diseases, such as cardiovascular and inflammatory, and some cancers. A simple and quick way to rebalance the n-6/n-3 ratio is to consume more n-3 FA in the form of supplements. The most commonly studied forms of n-3 FA are naturally occurring and reconstituted triglycerides (TG), ethyl ester (EE), and free fatty acids (FFA). Single dose studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics of n-3 FA esterified in different forms reported that the most bioavailable form of n-3 FA is when provided in FFA > TG > EE. However, FFA are highly susceptible to peroxidation and therefore less stable over time, which explains why n-3 FA are usually esterified in EE or TG. With the EE and TG forms, however, there are side effects since they require pancreatic lipases in the digestion process whereas FFA and monoacylglycerol (MAG) forms are considered as being in a predigested form. The most common reported side effects of EE and TG n-3 FA are gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, and gastric reflux. One potential solution is to provide n-3 FA in the MAG predigested form. A previous study reported that MAG n-3 FA can be efficiently absorbed in people with fat digestion issues. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether plasma concentration of MAG n-3 FA is higher than an EE form of n-3 FA in a healthy population. We hypothesized that over 24 h, higher n-3 FA plasma concentrations would be reached when EPA and DHA were provided esterified in MAG rather than in EE.

### Lipid SIG algorithms [^113Ms6cp]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Triglyceride management (off label in pediatrics) — for omega-3 fatty acids the recommended dose is 4g/day DHA/EPA. For fibrates, counsel about side effects, potential drug interactions, and contraindications; prefer fenofibrate initially due to fewer side effects, better tolerated, and only once daily dosing; and check baseline AST, ALT and again in 4 weeks to monitor on fibrate, stopping if AST, ALT > 3x ULN and considering restarting at lower dose once labs normalize or referring to a lipid specialist. Safety notes include side effects (muscle toxicity, hepatotoxicity; higher risk of muscle toxicity if on a fibrate and statin), drug interactions (coumarin anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, bile acid resins), and contraindications (severe renal dysfunction, acute liver disease, gall bladder disease, hypersensitivity to fibrate, nursing mothers); context notes that TG lowering medications in adults with diabetes have shown inconsistent results with improved CVD benefit.

### Effectiveness and tolerability of dietary supplementation with a combination of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants in the treatment of dry eye symptoms: results of a prospective study [^116NSwg2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

This study also confirms the tolerability and safety of the omega-3 dietary supplement. We studied the possible gastrointestinal adverse effects derived from a relative high DHA daily dose. No serious adverse events arose during the study. Digestive upset, particularly fish-tasting regurgitation was the most frequent side effect. In a study by Oleñik et al, digestive symptoms developed during the first month of treatment, and patients recovered immediately after stopping the medication. In our study, none of the participants discontinued the nutraceutical supplement because of adverse events.

The present results should be interpreted taking into account some limitations of the study, especially the open-label design; although the large number of participants is a strength of the study, as well as the fact that the data obtained is applicable to daily clinical practice. Next steps and future assessments should be aimed at the evaluation of the evolution of the objective clinical signs. The lack of control over dietary intake of the subjects was among the limitations of the study. Based on the three previous clinical trials (with controls, and placebo) the present study is aimed to assess the patients' level of satisfaction after the addition of the supplementation to the use of an artificial tear, but focussing our conclusions on a large sample of patients with OSD diagnostic.

### Triglyceride-lowering and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk reduction [^113ikXSk]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death globally. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) including eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid have been extensively studied as both dietary supplement and pharmaceutical agent for the prevention of ASCVD. Epidemiological and retrospective studies have long shown the inverse relationship of omega-3 PUFA consumption and ASCVD event but results of previous large randomized controlled trials have not consistently shown the same effect. Meta-analysis and a recent clinical trial using a high dose of eicosapentaenoic acid showed convincing protective effects of omega-3 PUFAs on ASCVD. Emerging evidence shows that both chronic inflammation and hypertriglyceridemia increase the risk of atherosclerosis. Amelioration of the inflammatory process and reduction of hypertriglyceridemia provide two mechanisms on the prevention and management of ASCVD, and agents with both of these effects are more potent and desirable. Omega-3 PUFAs exert anti-hypertriglyceridemia effect, ameliorate inflammation, and maintain the resolution of inflammation homeostasis pleiotropically through multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms. This review presents the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, the mechanisms of omega-3 PUFAs on the reduction of the atherosclerotic risk, and the current clinical utilities of omega-3 PUFAs on the prevention of ASCVD.
