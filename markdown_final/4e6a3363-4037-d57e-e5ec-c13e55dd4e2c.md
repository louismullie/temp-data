## Question

Which antibiotic should be prescribed for recurrent uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic should be prescribed for recurrent urinary tract infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical scenario and whether we are treating an acute episode or preventing recurrences. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and the need for culture-directed therapy. Next, I will review first-line antibiotic choices for acute cystitis and how local resistance and patient factors influence selection. After that, I should consider prophylaxis strategies and non-antibiotic alternatives. Finally, I will integrate special populations, stewardship principles, and a practical decision framework with monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame, because treatment differs for acute episodes versus prevention of recurrences. Recurrent UTI is typically defined as at least 2 culture-proven episodes in 6 months or 3 in 12 months, and management should distinguish treating an active acute cystitis episode from preventing future episodes, with culture confirmation guiding therapy whenever feasible [^78dc8cef] [^13fbadd9].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic prerequisites before discussing antibiotics. I should confirm that at least one episode is culture-proven to establish rUTI, and I need to obtain a urine culture prior to initiating antibiotics for acute episodes when clinically safe, because this improves targeting and reduces overtreatment and resistance; if empiric therapy is started, I should narrow based on culture results promptly [^13fbadd9] [^1f957e0a].

> For acute uncomplicated cystitis in women with rUTI, I need to check first-line agents and resistance thresholds. The AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline recommends nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin as first-line choices, selected according to local antibiograms and patient-specific factors; I should avoid TMP-SMX if local resistance exceeds about 20%, and I should preferentially avoid fluoroquinolones given resistance, cost, and safety concerns, reserving them for limited scenarios [^b679e209] [^753ac986] [^3d50b101].

> Hold on, I should verify durations and special caveats. Short-course therapy is effective: 5 days of nitrofurantoin or 3 days of TMP-SMX are standard, with nitrofurantoin favored when TMP-SMX resistance is high; fosfomycin can be used as a single 3-g dose, though some patients may need a second dose for persistent symptoms, and I should ensure renal function is adequate for nitrofurantoin use [^858e731e] [^3d50b101].

> I will now examine prophylaxis options for prevention, but I need to ensure we do not jump to conclusions about daily antibiotics. Continuous daily prophylaxis with low-dose nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, trimethoprim, cephalexin, or fosfomycin every 3 days reduces recurrences by roughly 70–90% while on therapy, though benefits wane after stopping; postcoital prophylaxis is effective for sex-associated rUTI and may be preferred to daily therapy in that phenotype [^51669b0f] [^51669b0f] [^e26359a3].

> But wait, what if we want to minimize antibiotic exposure? I should review non-antibiotic prophylaxis. Methenamine hippurate is non-inferior to daily antibiotics for preventing symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTIs in a high-quality randomized trial, with a small absolute difference of about 0.5 episodes per year; D-mannose has limited but supportive evidence and may be offered with counseling about weak data, and vaginal estrogen is beneficial in postmenopausal women with genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^01959980] [^2363b269] [^d24bcc96] [^6d78937f].

> Let me consider patient-initiated therapy, because this changes the calculus. In reliable, motivated patients with clear symptom recognition, self-start antibiotics at symptom onset can reduce time-to-treatment and healthcare utilization, but I should pair this with standing orders for pretreatment cultures and explicit safety-net instructions; importantly, intermittent self-treatment is associated with more infections per year than daily prophylaxis, so I need to ensure shared decision-making about trade-offs [^44570f13] [^6b8c14e8] [^51bfa2bd].

> I should double-check special populations and stewardship nuances. In older adults, I must avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is common and harmful to treat; unnecessary antibiotics drive resistance and adverse events without benefit, so I should anchor diagnosis to acute-onset dysuria or fever with compatible signs and avoid attributing nonspecific symptoms to UTI [^1f957e0a] [^553ce5ac]. In pregnancy, I need to avoid TMP-SMX near term and nitrofurantoin at term, and in renal impairment I must adjust agents and avoid nitrofurantoin if CrCl is low; in children, evidence for prophylaxis is mixed and should be individualized, with attention to VUR and bladder-bowel dysfunction [^c5cb81da] [^29467d3a] [^81acdbfa].

> Next, I should review resistance and stewardship, because this directly shapes empiric choices. Even brief antibiotic exposures increase the odds of carriage of resistant organisms for up to 12 months, so I should minimize unnecessary therapy, prioritize narrow-spectrum first-line agents, and use culture-directed therapy whenever possible; fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin generally have minimal impact on the fecal microbiome compared with TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones, supporting their selection when appropriate [^e797324b] [^1f957e0a].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against guidelines. First, confirm rUTI with at least one culture-proven episode and obtain a pretreatment culture for acute symptoms. Second, for acute cystitis, choose nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin based on local resistance and patient factors, treat for 3–5 days, and narrow to culture results. Third, for prevention, discuss continuous daily, postcoital, or non-antibiotic options such as methenamine or vaginal estrogen, aligning with patient preferences and recurrence phenotype. Fourth, embed patient-initiated therapy selectively with cultures and safety instructions. And fifth, reassess at 3–6 months to decide on continuation or de-escalation, avoiding treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria [^753ac986] [^9402591c] [^01959980] [^44570f13] [^1f957e0a].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and when to escalate. If symptoms persist beyond about 7 days or recur rapidly, I should repeat a urine culture and consider alternative diagnoses or resistant organisms; for oral-resistant pathogens, short-course parenteral therapy guided by culture is reasonable, and consultation with infectious diseases is prudent for multidrug-resistant organisms or complex scenarios [^573af149] [^7e641c1e] [^33b78eba].

> In summary, I need to ensure the antibiotic choice is context-specific: for acute episodes, nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin remain first-line depending on local resistance and patient factors. For prevention, continuous or postcoital prophylaxis with low-dose antibiotics reduces recurrences, but methenamine hippurate offers a non-antibiotic alternative with near-equivalent outcomes and less ecological harm. Throughout, culture-directed therapy, shared decision-making, and vigilant stewardship are essential to balance efficacy with resistance and safety [^b679e209] [^9402591c] [^01959980] [^1f957e0a].

---

For recurrent UTIs, **first-line antibiotics** are nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (if resistance is < 20%), or fosfomycin [^b679e209] [^753ac986], chosen based on local resistance and patient factors [^c5cb81da]. For prophylaxis, use **low-dose continuous or postcoital regimens** (nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or cephalexin) [^9402591c] [^51669b0f] for 6–12 months, reassessing at 3 months [^51669b0f]. Avoid fluoroquinolones unless no alternatives exist due to resistance and adverse effects [^3d50b101]. Non-antibiotic options (methenamine, D-mannose, vaginal estrogen) [^01959980] [^d24bcc96] are reasonable alternatives or adjuncts to reduce antibiotic exposure [^8477e00d].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and evaluation

Before prescribing antibiotics, **confirm recurrent UTI** with culture-proven episodes (≥ 2 in 6 months or ≥ 3 in 12 months) [^78dc8cef] [^13fbadd9]. Obtain urine cultures before treatment to guide therapy and detect resistance [^13fbadd9] [^1f957e0a]. Evaluate for anatomical or functional abnormalities, especially in complicated cases [^0ac1d230].

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy for acute episodes

For acute cystitis in women with rUTI, **use first-line agents** according to local resistance patterns:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and duration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Nitrofurantoin | 100 mg twice daily for 5 days | - First-line <br/> - Avoid if CrCl < 30 mL/min |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days | Use if resistance < 20% |
| Fosfomycin | 3 g single dose | - Option for low resistance <br/> - Repeat if symptoms persist |

---

Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) are **not first-line** due to resistance and adverse effects; reserve for multidrug-resistant organisms or intolerance to first-line agents [^3d50b101] [^c5cb81da].

---

## Antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs

Prophylaxis is indicated for frequent, bothersome recurrences despite behavioral measures. Options include **continuous daily prophylaxis** — nitrofurantoin 50 mg nightly, TMP-SMX ½ tablet nightly, or cephalexin 125–250 mg nightly for 6–12 months, with reassessment at 3 months [^51669b0f] [^9402591c] — or **postcoital prophylaxis** — a single dose after intercourse (e.g. nitrofurantoin 50–100 mg or TMP-SMX ½ tablet) for sex-associated rUTI [^51669b0f] [^e26359a3].

---

## Non-antibiotic alternatives

Non-antibiotic options can reduce antibiotic exposure and resistance:

- **Methenamine hippurate**: 1 g twice daily; non-inferior to daily antibiotics in RCTs [^01959980] [^2363b269].
- **D-mannose**: 2 g daily; modest benefit in some trials [^d24bcc96].
- **Vaginal estrogen**: for postmenopausal women with genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^6d78937f].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid TMP-SMX in the first trimester; nitrofurantoin is safe except near term.
- **Renal impairment**: Avoid nitrofurantoin if CrCl < 30 mL/min.
- **Allergy**: Tailor choices to documented allergies and prior reactions.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess prophylaxis at 3 months; discontinue if ineffective or adverse effects occur [^51669b0f]. Obtain repeat cultures if symptoms persist after therapy to guide management [^573af149]. Educate patients on symptom recognition, hygiene, and when to seek care [^89c3b649].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX (if resistance < 20%), or fosfomycin for acute episodes [^b679e209] [^753ac986].
- **Prophylaxis**: Continuous or postcoital low-dose antibiotics for 6–12 months, reassessed at 3 months [^51669b0f] [^9402591c].
- **Non-antibiotic options**: Methenamine, D-mannose, and vaginal estrogen as alternatives or adjuncts [^01959980] [^d24bcc96].
- **Avoid**: Fluoroquinolones unless no alternatives exist [^3d50b101].

---

Effective rUTI management balances **symptom control**, **prevention**, and **antibiotic stewardship**, with therapy individualized to patient factors and local resistance patterns [^1f957e0a].

### A review for clinical practice in the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women over age 65 [^646aa282]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a pervasive, costly, and dangerous cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can lead to further complications if they become recurrent or progress to urosepsis. Recurrent UTI is a particular concern among postmenopausal females because of increased risk factors and decreased estrogen levels, leading to changes in the urogenital epithelium and subsequently causing alterations in the urogenital microbiome. Prevention strategies for recurrent UTIs are often incorporated into patient-centered care plans, but finding the right management can be difficult for older women since many of the common treatment options have contraindications and adverse side effects. This review aims to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and special considerations for the treatment and prevention of recurrent UTIs in women over 65. Current prevention strategies include both antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. The antibiotic choice for older women presents a few unique challenges, including frequent allergy or intolerance of side effects, renal or liver dysfunction, and polypharmacy or drug interactions. Nonantibiotic options range from readily accessible drugstore remedies to experimental vaccines, which all are accompanied by certain advantages and disadvantages. Appropriate management plans can help to reduce symptoms and poor outcomes among older females. In addition, we hope future studies continue to investigate the proper dosing and routes for optimal management in this aging female population.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^bf151867]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Increasing antibiotic resistance limits antibiotic options for outpatient treatment of UTIs and renders antibiotic treatment less effective. As repeated UTIs are a major cause of antibiotic resistance, a better understanding of uropathogens responsible for recurrence is needed. Importantly, given that antibiotic therapy for UTI is empiric and uropathogens increasingly demonstrate nonsusceptibility, continuously updated data on susceptibility patterns are critical to guide appropriate antibiotic prescribing as well as to inform interventions to prevent UTI recurrence. As the degree of resistance to the most frequently prescribed antibiotics for UTI evolves over time and may vary by region, it is also important to continuously monitor the local prevalence of uropathogens and their susceptibility to guide appropriate antibiotic use.

### New paradigms in the management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^2719ebd4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) represent a large burden on the healthcare system. Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise.

Summary

The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goal of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^78dc8cef]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definitions and terminology state that a commonly used definition describes urinary tract infection (UTI) as an infection of the lower and/or upper genitourinary tract which is diagnosed based on the presence of a pathogen in the urinary tract and associated symptoms, with limited evidence to support any "gold standard" UTI definition for epidemiologic or clinical research; this statement endorses a clinically useful, culture-based definition for rUTI of at least 2 culture-proven episodes in 6 months, or at least 3 in 1 year, and distinguishes relapse as UTI symptoms with the same uropathogen within 2 weeks of completing appropriate antibiotic therapy versus recurrence beyond the initial 2 weeks or with a different uropathogen.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^4f15c1f3]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs), UTI diagnosis and management remains challenging for clinicians. Challenges with acute UTI management stem from vague presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, limitations in laboratory testing, and selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy in an era with increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens. Recurrent UTI management remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to UTI, when to assess a child with repeated infections for kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and limited prevention strategies. To help reduce these uncertainties, this review provides a comprehensive overview of UTI epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies that may help pediatricians overcome the challenges associated with acute and recurrent UTI management.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^7bfff2d4]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: a systematic review [^68885b72]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections worldwide, being experienced by one in three women at least once in their lifetime. Recurrent UTI is defined as more than three infections per year or more than two infections per 6 months, and it has a significant impact on quality of life, as highlighted by an international web-based survey of 1941 affected women. There is also a significant economic burden due to the costs of preventive strategies and sick leave. Most recurrent UTIs occur in otherwise healthy women who have no structural genitourinary tract abnormalities.

CPGs are defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare in specific clinical circumstances" and are developed to optimize and standardize care. The successful implementation of a CPG depends on rigorous development, a clear implementation strategy, and adequate dissemination. Multiple studies across different clinical areas have shown that variability exists in the quality of CPGs, indicating that there is considerable room for improvement, especially in rigour of development and applicability. This is important because diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty can ensue if CPGs differ in core recommendations because of these limitations.

Differences in clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations for the preventive treatment of recurrent UTI have been mentioned previously, but the authors of that report did not assess methodological quality. As a result, diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty might ensue. We could find not a systematic appraisal of the quality of CPGs for the prevention and diagnostics of recurrent UTI in women. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument is often used to assess the methodological quality of CPGs in other areas. We therefore aimed to assess the methodological quality of CPGs for recurrent UTI and to summarize recommendations to help clinical decision makers choose the correct CPG for treatment or diagnostics.

### Role of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infection management: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^866dceef]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections and recurrent urinary tract infections pose substantial burdens on patients and healthcare systems. Testing and treatment strategies are increasingly important in the age of antibiotic resistance and stewardship.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of urinary tract infection testing and treatment strategies with a focus on antibiotic resistance.

Study Design

We designed a decision tree to model the following 4 strategies for managing urinary tract infections: (1) empirical antibiotics first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics if symptoms persist; (2) urine culture first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics; (3) urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist; and (4) symptomatic treatment first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist. To model both patient- and society-level concerns, we built 3 versions of this model with different outcome measures: quality-adjusted life-years, symptom-free days, and antibiotic courses given. Societal cost of antibiotic resistance was modeled for each course of antibiotics given. The probability of urinary tract infection and the level of antibiotic resistance were modeled from 0% to 100%. We also extended the model to account for patients requiring catheterization for urine specimen collection.

Results

In our model, the antibiotic resistance rate was based either on the local antibiotic resistance patterns for patients presenting with sporadic urinary tract infections or on rate of resistance from prior urine cultures for patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. With the base case assumption of 20% antibiotic resistance, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy and maximized symptom-free days. However, empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was below 6%, whereas symptomatic treatment was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was above 80%. To minimize antibiotic use, symptomatic treatment first was always the best strategy followed by urine culture first. Sensitivity analyses with other input parameters did not affect the cost-effectiveness results. When we extended the model to include an office visit for catheterized urine specimens, empirical antibiotics became the most cost-effective option.

Conclusion

We developed models for urinary tract infection management strategies that can be interpreted for patients initially presenting with urinary tract infections or those with recurrent urinary tract infections. Our results suggest that, in most cases, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics is the most cost-effective strategy and maximizes symptom-free days. Empirical antibiotics first should only be considered if the expected antibiotic resistance is very low. If antibiotic resistance is expected to be very high, symptomatic treatment is the best strategy and minimizes antibiotic use.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^6b8c14e8]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Self-treatment with antibiotics for recurrent UTI — Self-treatment can be paired with standing physician orders for urine culture before and possibly after treatment, but compared with continuous prophylaxis it is associated with a higher rate of infection (2.2 UTI per year vs 0.2 UTI per year). Self-treatment is an option for women with the ability to reliably recognize UTI symptoms and start antibiotics, those not suitable for long-term prophylaxis, or those who do not wish to take long-term therapy, and patients should contact their clinician if symptoms progress or fail to resolve within 48 hours. Fluoroquinolones are not preferred agents for self-treatment regimens, and we recommend use of other agents whenever possible.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^81acdbfa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment is a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term (several months to 2 years) antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. This is the third update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2006, and 2011.

Objectives

To assess whether long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective than placebo/no treatment in preventing recurrence of UTI in children, and if so which antibiotic in clinical use was the most effective. We also assessed the harms of long-term antibiotic treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 30 July 2018 through contact with the Cochrane Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information for the initial and previous updates. A random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

In this update sixteen studies (2036 children randomised, 1977 analysed) were included. Seven studies (612 children) compared two or more types of antibiotics, six (1088 children) compared antibiotics with placebo or no treatment, one four-armed study compared circumcision with and without antibiotic treatment, one study compared dose of antibiotic, and one three-armed study compared two different antibiotics as well as no treatment. Of the sixteen included studies only one study was judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains, with the majority judged to be at unclear risk of bias due to very poorly reported methodology. The number of studies judged to be a low risk of bias was: selection bias (7); performance bias (4); detection bias (1); attrition bias (6); reporting bias (7); and other bias (2). The number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias was: selection bias (0); performance bias (5); detection bias (1); attrition bias (4); reporting bias (6); and other bias (1). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics lead to a modest decrease in the number of repeat symptomatic UTI in children; however the estimate from combining all studies was not certain and the confidence interval indicates low precision indicating that antibiotics may make little or no difference to risk of repeat infection (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98). When we combined only the data from studies with concealed treatment allocation, there was a similar reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children taking antibiotics (RR 0.68) and we have greater certainty in this estimate because of the more robust study designs, the confidence interval is smaller and it does not include the point of no effect (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The estimated reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI for children taking antibiotics was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12) however there was considerable uncertainty due to imprecision from fewer events in the smaller group of children with VUR. There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events, with one study having more events in the placebo group and a second study having more events in the antibiotics group. Three studies reported data for antibiotic resistance with the analysis estimating the risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic being almost 2.5 times greater in children on antibiotics than for children on placebo or no treatment (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). However the confidence interval is wide, showing imprecision and there may be little or no difference between the two groups. Eight studies involving 659 children compared one antibiotic with another but few studies compared the same combination for the same outcome so little data could be pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance data and analysis showed that treatment with nitrofurantoin may lead to a lower risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the treatment drug compared to children given trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole as their prophylactic treatment (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92).

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term antibiotics may reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children who have had one or more previous UTIs but the benefit may be small and must be considered together with the increased risk of microbial resistance.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^9b1102dd]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women (AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline) — scope and purpose: The guideline limits scope to recurrent episodes of localized (restricted to the lower urinary tract) cystitis in women and states that it does not apply to individuals with complicating factors at higher risk for development of UTI or decreased efficacy of therapy, or those with signs or symptoms of systemic bacteremia. Within this document, the term UTI refers to acute bacterial cystitis unless otherwise specified. The stated aims are to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs by reducing recurrence of UTI events.

### How can we improve investigation, prevention and treatment for recurrent urinary tract infections-ICI-RS 2018 [^93ffd0a3]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) is a chronic condition and has a significant impact on health-related quality of life. The commonly used definition for rUTI is greater than three episodes in a year or more than two in 6 months. Current diagnostic methods have been used worldwide for over five decades, despite well evidenced criticism. Enhanced culture techniques demonstrate that the microbiome of the bladder is far more complex than previously thought and begs a reappraisal of our current testing. Treatment of rUTI is based on a small number of antibiotic trials with some evidence showing a reduction in the number of positive cultures, but one must be cautious in interpreting the results and weigh against the risk of generation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Aim

The International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society think tank reviewed the literature with a view to improving investigation, prevention and treatment of rUTI.

Methods

A multidisciplinary team of experts were invited to present evidence regarding the current diagnostic methods, recent advances related to bladder biome mapping and current treatment strategies, including antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. Current guidelines regarding antibiotic stewardship and concerns regarding AMR were discussed.

Discussion

Outcome of the think tank discussions are summarised with a set of recommendations to inform future research. Particular consideration is given to bacterial survival in the bladder after treatment as well as defects in urothelial barrier function which may play a significant part in the failure to eradicate UTI.

### Treatment and prevention of recurrent lower urinary tract infections in women: a rapid review with practice recommendations [^d0f82e05]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recurrent lower urinary tract infections in women are a highly prevalent and burdensome condition for which best practice guidelines for treatment and prevention that minimize harm and optimize well-being are greatly needed. To inform development of practice recommendations, a rapid literature review of original research, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and practice guidelines was conducted.

Materials and Methods

PubMed®, Embase®, Opus, Scopus®, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Library and the U.S. National Guideline Clearinghouse electronic databases were searched from inception to September 22, 2017. Articles and practice guidelines were included if they were in English, were peer reviewed, included women, involved treatment or prevention strategies for recurrent urinary tract infection and reported an outcome related to recurrence rates of urinary tract infection. Critical appraisal of original studies was conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and of systematic reviews using the AMSTAR 2 tool.

Results

Of 1,582 citations identified 74 met our study inclusion criteria. These comprised 49 randomized controlled trials, 23 systematic reviews (16 with meta-analyses) and 2 practice guidelines. No study reported a multi-targeted treatment approach. There was a lack of high quality studies and systematic reviews evaluating prevention strategies for recurrent urinary tract infection.

Conclusions

We recommend an algorithmic approach to care that includes education on lifestyle and behavioral modifications, and addresses specific populations of women with antimicrobial based and nonantibiotic alternatives. This approach includes the use of vaginal estrogen with or without lactobacillus containing probiotics in postmenopausal women, low dose post-coital antibiotics for recurrent urinary tract infection associated with sexual activity in premenopausal women, low dose daily antibiotic prophylaxis in premenopausal women with infections unrelated to sexual activity, and methenamine hippurate and/or lactobacillus containing probiotics as nonantibiotic alternatives. Future research should involve consistent use of terminology, validated instruments to assess response to interventions and patient perspectives on care. Our treatment algorithm is based on the best available evidence, and fills a gap in the literature and practice regarding effective strategies to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in women.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in adult women — antibiotic choice for acute cystitis should incorporate patient and pathogen factors, with specific options and caveats: Antibiotic choice should take into account specific patient factors (allergies, renal function), complicating factors, and uropathogen sensitivity. For acute cystitis in women with rUTI, nitrofurantoin is a key first-line agent; fosfomycin is effective; clinician may need to request sensitivity testing; TMP-SMX can also be used if resistance is less than 20% in the community; and fluoroquinolones are not first-line treatment of acute cystitis without complicating factors.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — episode timing and management considerations indicate that episodes do not need to be in the immediate six months preceding presentation, and that recurrence burden should guide prophylaxis; expectant management may be less appropriate than active prophylaxis in an individual who has received more than three to four therapeutic courses of antibiotics in the past year. Patients with a long culture-proven history at lower-than-definition frequency (two episodes within six months within the previous year) may also be appropriate to include under the rUTI umbrella, and patients consistently presenting with one to two symptomatic infections per year for multiple years will likely benefit from a more proactive management strategy similar to that for rUTI.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — pre-initiation step, postcoital and continuous strategies, efficacy, and duration: both the European Association of Urology and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommend ensuring a negative urine culture before starting prophylactic antibiotics; postcoital prophylaxis should be offered to women who have UTIs temporarily related to sexual intercourse, and these women will take a single dose of an antimicrobial agent immediately after intercourse; postcoital therapy decreased recurrence rates compared with placebo (0.3 vs 3.6 patient-years, P = 0.001) and was equally as efficacious as continuous daily therapy; with continuous prophylaxis, a patient takes a single, daily antibiotic dose, and compared with placebo, continuous prophylaxis decreases recurrences by up to 95%; the duration of these regimens ranges from 6 months to at least 2 years, with regimens extended to 5 years in some reports; a Cochrane review in nonpregnant women found that antibiotics given continuously for 6 to 12 months were considerably more effective than placebo in preventing rUTI (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.08–0.28); several studies have found that 50% to 60% of women become reinfected within 3 months of discontinuing prophylaxis; this document supports reevaluation of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis at 3 months, and antibiotic prophylaxis is rarely continued beyond 6 months, although it may have to be restarted if UTIs recur.

### Chinese herbal medicine for treating recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^5dad6882]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that affects 40% to 50% of women. Between 20% and 30% of women who have had a UTI will experience a recurrence, and around 25% will develop ongoing recurrent episodes with implications for individual well-being and healthcare costs. Prophylactic antibiotics can prevent recurrent UTIs but there are growing concerns about microbial resistance, side effects from treatment and lack of long-term benefit. Consequently, alternative treatments are being investigated. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has a recorded history of treating UTI symptoms and more recent research suggests a potential role in the management of recurrent UTIs. This review aimed to evaluate CHM for recurrent UTI.

Objectives

This review assessed the benefits and harms of CHM for the treatment of recurrent UTIs in adult women, both as a stand-alone therapy and in conjunction with other pharmaceutical interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 7 May 2015 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator, using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched AMED, CINAHL and the Chinese language electronic databases Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM), China Network on Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP and Wan Fang Databases to July 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatments using CHM with either an inactive placebo or conventional biomedical treatment. RCTs comparing different CHM strategies and treatments were eligible for inclusion. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors. Where more than one publication of one study existed, these were grouped and the publication with the most complete data was used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes were only published in earlier versions these data were used. All meta-analyses were performed using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved a total of 542 women; of these, five recruited post-menopausal women (aged from 56 to 70 years) (422 women). We assessed all studies to be at high risk of bias. Meta-analyses comparing the overall effectiveness of treatments during acute phases of infection and rates of recurrence were conducted. Analysis of three studies involving 282 women that looked at CHM versus antibiotics suggested that CHM had a higher rate of effectiveness for acute UTI (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 33) and reduced recurrent UTI rates (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.82). Analysis of two studies involving 120 women that compared CHM plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone found the combined intervention had a higher rate of effectiveness for acute UTI (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.47) and resulted in lower rates of recurrent infection six months after the study (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.80). One study comparing different CHM treatments found Er Xian Tang was more effective in treating acute infection in post-menopausal women than San Jin Pian (80 women: RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.57). Analysis showed that active CHM treatments specifically formulated for recurrent UTI were more effective in reducing infection incidence than generic CHM treatments that were more commonly used for acute UTI (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.77). Only two studies undertook to report adverse events; neither reported the occurrence of any adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from seven small studies suggested that CHM as an independent intervention or in conjunction with antibiotics may be beneficial for treating recurrent UTIs during the acute phase of infection and may reduce the recurrent UTI incidence for at least six months post-treatment. CHM treatments specifically formulated for recurrent UTI may be more effective than herbal treatments designed to treat acute UTI. However, the small number and poor quality of the included studies meant that it was not possible to formulate robust conclusions on the use of CHM for recurrent UTI in women either alone or as an adjunct to antibiotics.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic prophylaxis evidence synthesis: the systematic review identified 28 trials evaluating antibiotics for prevention of rUTI, most were rated as medium to high risk of bias, and sample sizes ranged from 26 to 308 (total N = 2,758). These trials demonstrated that antibiotics perform better than placebo with consistent results across antibiotics, and the duration of preventive treatment ranged from 6 to 12 months. When comparing prophylactic antibiotic use to placebo or no antibiotics, antibiotics were associated with a decreased likelihood of experiencing ≥ 1 UTI recurrence (11 studies; RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.37; I² = 14%; absolute risk difference [ARD]: -46%, 95% CI: -56% to -37%). Because most relevant randomized controlled trials were published prior to 1995, results should be interpreted in light of current resistance patterns.

In women with rUTI, acute treatment can be initiated by a clinician or patient at symptom onset, and antibiotics are traditional first-line treatment of bacterial cystitis.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^4f4aa8ef]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our perceptions of recurrent UTI (rUTI) have evolved due to additional insights into rUTI pathophysiology, an appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobials ("collateral damage"), rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance, and better reporting of the natural history of localized cystitis and rUTI. This document seeks to guide the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotics, provide guidance on strategies for rUTI prevention, and improve outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs.

Materials and Methods

In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA Update Literature Review process, which identified 87 studies for full-text review published between June 1, 2021 and November 1, 2024. Of those 87 studies, 14 met inclusion criteria for review. The subsequent amendment is based on data released since the last review of this Guideline in 2021.

Results

The Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements based on an updated review to provide guidance on evaluation and management of rUTI in women. These updates are detailed herein.

Conclusions

This update provides several new insights, including expansion of non-antibiotic options for UTI prophylaxis, greater understanding of the value of a negative urinalysis in ruling out UTI, and a paradigm shift away from microbial detection to reliance on clinician judgement when weighing the individual risks and benefits of antibiosis. This Guideline will require further review as the diagnostic and treatment options in this space continue to evolve.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^1ec80859]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven years, 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms are systemic rather than localised in early childhood and consist of fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by E. coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to the unpleasant acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. However these medications may cause side effects and promote the development of resistant bacteria.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and side effects of long-term antibiotics given to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

A search of MEDLINE (1966 to Jan 2001), EMBASE (1988 to Jan 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for relevant randomised controlled trials without language restriction; reference lists of review articles; contact with content experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of two or more antibiotics and placebo with one or more antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. For each trial, information was collected on the methods of the trial, participants, interventions and outcomes. A random-effects model was used to estimate a summary relative risk (RR) and a summary risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI. Heterogeneity tests and subgroup analyses were carried out based on a priori hypothesis of plausible effect modification.

Main Results

There were three trials (n = 151) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied among the studies (10 weeks to 12 months). The method of allocation concealment in the three trials was inadequate, unclear and adequate. The overall rate of recurrent UTI in the placebo/no treatment group was 63% (48/76). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77; RD -46%, 95% CI -59% to -33%). No side effects were described in any of these three trials. There was one double-blinded trial (n = 120) with unclear allocation concealment that compared two different types of antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI. Nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) than patients receiving trimethoprim (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Most published studies to date have been poorly designed with biases known to overestimate the true treatment effect. Large, properly randomised, double blinded trials are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^01959980]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To test and compare the efficacy of methenamine hippurate for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections with the current standard prophylaxis of daily low dose antibiotics.

Design

Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial.

Setting

Eight centres in the UK, recruiting from June 2016 to June 2018.

Participants

Women aged ≥ 18 years with recurrent urinary tract infections, requiring prophylactic treatment.

Interventions

Random assignment (1:1, using permuted blocks of variable length via a web based system) to receive antibiotic prophylaxis or methenamine hippurate for 12 months. Treatment allocation was not masked and crossover between arms was allowed.

Main Outcome Measure

Absolute difference in incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic treated, urinary tract infections during treatment. A patient and public involvement group predefined the non-inferiority margin as one episode of urinary tract infection per person year. Analyses performed in a modified intention-to-treat population comprised all participants observed for at least six months.

Results

Participants were randomly assigned to antibiotic prophylaxis (n = 120) or methenamine hippurate (n = 120). The modified intention-to-treat analysis comprised 205 (85%) participants (antibiotics, n = 102 (85%); methenamine hippurate, n = 103 (86%)). Incidence of antibiotic treated urinary tract infections during the 12 month treatment period was 0.89 episodes per person year (95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.12) in the antibiotics group and 1.38 (1.05 to 1.72) in the methenamine hippurate group, with an absolute difference of 0.49 (90% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.84) confirming non-inferiority. Adverse reactions were reported by 34/142 (24%) in the antibiotic group and 35/127 (28%) in the methenamine group and most reactions were mild.

Conclusion

Non-antibiotic prophylactic treatment with methenamine hippurate might be appropriate for women with a history of recurrent episodes of urinary tract infections, informed by patient preferences and antibiotic stewardship initiatives, given the demonstration of non-inferiority to daily antibiotic prophylaxis seen in this trial.

### Antibiotics for treating lower urinary tract infection in children [^9509caf3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants and children. Lower UTI is the most commonly presenting and in the majority of cases can be easily treated with a course of antibiotic therapy with no further complications. A number of antimicrobials have been used to treat children with lower UTIs; however is it unclear what are the specific benefits and harms of such treatments.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the benefits and harms of antibiotics for treating lower UTI in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Renal Group's Specialised Register (April 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE OVID SP (from 1966), and EMBASE OVID SP (from 1988) without language restriction. Date of last search: May 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which antibiotic therapy was used to treat bacteriologically proven, symptomatic, lower UTI in children aged zero to 18 years in primary and community healthcare settings were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Sixteen RCTs, analysing 1,116 children were included. Conventional 10-day antibiotic treatment significantly increased the number of children free of persistent bacteriuria compared to single-dose therapy (6 studies, 228 children: RR 2.01, 95%CI 1.06 to 3.80). No heterogeneity was observed. Persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment was reported in 24% of children receiving single-dose therapy compared to 10% of children who were randomised to 10-day therapy. There were no significant differences between groups for persistent symptoms, recurrence following treatment, or re-infection following treatment. There was insufficient data to analyse the effect of antibiotics on renal parenchymal damage, compliance, development of resistant organisms or adverse events. Despite the inclusion of 16 RCTs, methodological weakness and small sample sizes made it difficult to conclude if any of the included antibiotics or regimens were superior to another.

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower UTI. This review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. This data adds to an existing Cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.

After initiating antimicrobial therapy for UTI, clinical cure is expected within three to seven days, and it is reasonable to repeat microbiological assessment if UTI symptoms persist beyond seven days. Although a second antibiotic can be given empirically, this should only be done after a urine sample is obtained to minimize unnecessary treatment when laboratory data is inconsistent with persistent infection.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) antimicrobial therapy and stewardship — use of new agents and prescribing strategies: "Promising new antimicrobials such as the first oral carbapenem, sulopenem, may also provide outpatient therapies for patients with high multidrug resistance or antibiotic-intolerant individuals at high risk of infection progression", yet "these agents should still be reserved for those with high multidrug resistance". For prescribing practices, "It may be reasonable to consider collaboration with infectious disease specialists before prescribing to reduce unnecessary prescribing". Regarding prevention, "Preliminary data suggests that continuous prophylaxis with low-dose antibiotics leads to lower rates of antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse events than intermittent treatment of symptomatic episodes", while "little is understood about the short- and long-term consequences of antibiotic use, particularly intermittent, high-dose use".

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^873ad7e8]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in women and are frequently defined as ≥ 2 episodes in the last 6 months or ≥ 3 episodes in the last 12 months. In a primary care setting, 53% of women above the age of 55 years and 36% of younger women report a recurrence within 1 year. Thus, management and prevention of recurrent UTI is of utmost significance. This review aims to highlight the latest research in prevention strategies and suggest a management pathway.

Methods

A search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases for the latest systematic reviews and high-quality randomized controlled trials. Special emphasis was placed on the remit "recurrent" and strongly adhered to. Furthermore, a Google search was conducted for current guidelines on the management of UTIs.

Results

Current prevention strategies include eliminating risk factors that increase the risk of acquiring recurrent UTI and continuous, post-coital and self-initiated antimicrobial prophylaxis. Other prospective preventative strategies, currently under trial, include use of vaccinations, D-mannose and lactobacillus (probiotics).

Conclusion

Although risk factors should be identified and addressed accordingly, individualized antibiotic prophylaxis remains the most effective method of management. Non-antibiotic prevention strategies such as cranberry, vitamin C and methenamine salts lack strong evidence to be introduced as routine management options and as alternatives to antibiotics. Based on current evidence and guidelines, a management pathway is recommended. Emerging therapies require further evaluation before they can be recommended.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^8f9c6ae6]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is defined as repeated UTI with a frequency of at least two episodes in the preceding six months or three episodes in the past year. Acute UTI is most often uncomplicated cystitis and occurs in 50–80% of women in the general population. About one in four women with one UTI episode will go on to develop frequent recurrences, representing a substantial global healthcare problem. An economic analysis from the US described UTI as accounting for more than 6.8 million consultations, 1.3 million emergency department visits, and 245 000 hospital admissions with an annual cost of more than US$2.4bn (£1.8bn; €2.1bn). National and international guidelines acknowledge the need for preventive strategies, and those from the UK, Europe, and US strongly recommend the use of daily, low dose antibiotics as the standard prophylactic treatment for recurrent UTI.

The urgent need for demonstration of effective non-antibiotic treatments is underlined by the UK antimicrobial resistance strategy, which comments that "we are heading rapidly towards a world in which our antibiotics no longer work" and recommends a "strong focus on infection prevention". One aim of this strategy is to reduce antimicrobial use in people by 15% before 2024; to achieve that, exploration of non-antibiotic preventive treatments in common conditions such as UTI is essential. Methenamine hippurate is one such non-antibiotic treatment, which is hydrolysed to formaldehyde in acidic environments such as the distal tubules of the kidney. Formaldehyde is bacteriocidal and works by denaturing bacterial proteins and nucleic acids.

Methenamine hippurate has been evaluated in previous Cochrane systematic reviews, which concluded that "methenamine hippurate may be effective for preventing UTI" but recognised the "need for further large well-conducted RCTs [randomised controlled trials] to clarify". This study aimed to determine whether methenamine hippurate was an effective alternative to the standard treatment of low dose antibiotics for prophylaxis in women with recurrent UTI in a routine clinical setting. We tested the null hypotheses that methenamine hippurate was inferior to daily antibiotics for the prevention of recurrent UTI in women.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^546d4847]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Our data continue to support evidence that UTIs are often diagnosed and treated in a manner inconsistent with guidelines meant to direct best clinical practices. Laboratory tests are frequently used in the absence of urinary symptoms demonstrating inappropriate testing. Over‐testing is contributing to the overtreatment of patients without UTI symptoms and often without microbiological evidence of infection. Given the potential harms of overtreatment such as antibiotic resistance, recurrent infections, and high healthcare costs, our study demonstrates the need for advances in adherence to and understanding of UTI diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines as well as improved diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^ffafec78]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) management — Given the presence of bacteria in a healthy urinary tract, the text emphasizes that concepts about when antibiotics are necessary must evolve, noting that symptomatic treatment and expectant management can be appropriate for some even when acute bacterial cystitis is confirmed. It urges re-evaluating the assumption that all symptomatic bacteriuria requires antibiotics and states that rUTI care should focus on symptom relief and prevention of complications rather than bacterial eradication.

### Antibiotics for recurrent urinary tract infections… [^50f1e4d7]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Side effects included vaginal and oral candidiasis and gastrointestinal symptoms. Eight trials with 513 women compared antibiotics; these trials were not pooled. Weekly prophylaxis with pefloxacin was more effective than monthly prophylaxis. The RR for microbiologic recurrence was 0.
31. There was no significant difference in rates of microbiologic recurrence with daily and postcoital ciprofloxacin. Primary Results. Compared with placebo, continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for six to 12 months reduced the rate of UTI during prophylaxis. After prophylaxis, two studies showed no difference between groups. The treated group had more adverse events.

One RCT compared postcoital and continuous daily ciprofloxacin and found no significant difference in rates of UTI, suggesting that postcoital treatment could be offered to woman who have UTI associated with sexual intercourse. Reviewers' Conclusions. There are many options for treating recurrent UTI. This review showed that prophylactic antibiotics are better than placebo in reducing the number of recurrences. The NNT to prevent one symptomatic recurrent UTI in one year was 2.
2. However, after prophylactic therapy was stopped, rates of recurrence were equal to those in women who did not receive prophylactic therapy. The reviewed studies showed that side effects with the antibiotics were common and included nausea, rash, and oral and vaginal candidiasis. The number needed to harm for any side effect was 13.
5. 1 Thus, if 14 women are treated with antibiotic prophylaxis for one year, seven will have one fewer recurrent UTI, and one will experience a side effect.

Schedules for management of recurrent UTI include daily, weekly, or monthly prophylaxis, postcoital prophylaxis, and acute self-treatment. 6 One study showed that sexually active young women who took postcoital ciprofloxacin had similar outcomes to women who took ciprofloxacin daily. Another study showed that weekly prophylaxis was better than monthly prophylaxis. No studies compared daily and weekly prophylaxis.

1. There are various antibiotics to consider in treating recurrent UTI. Antibiotics included in the review were fluoroquinolones, first-generation cephalosporins, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin. The review found that no antibiotic was superior.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^c8165024]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To test and compare the efficacy of methenamine hippurate for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections with the current standard prophylaxis of daily low dose antibiotics.

Design

Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial.

Setting

Eight centres in the UK, recruiting from June 2016 to June 2018.

Participants

Women aged ≥ 18 years with recurrent urinary tract infections, requiring prophylactic treatment.

Interventions

Random assignment (1:1, using permuted blocks of variable length via a web based system) to receive antibiotic prophylaxis or methenamine hippurate for 12 months. Treatment allocation was not masked and crossover between arms was allowed.

Main outcome measure

Absolute difference in incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic treated, urinary tract infections during treatment. A patient and public involvement group predefined the non-inferiority margin as one episode of urinary tract infection per person year. Analyses performed in a modified intention-to-treat population comprised all participants observed for at least six months.

Results

Participants were randomly assigned to antibiotic prophylaxis (n = 120) or methenamine hippurate (n = 120). The modified intention-to-treat analysis comprised 205 (85%) participants (antibiotics, n = 102 (85%); methenamine hippurate, n = 103 (86%)). Incidence of antibiotic treated urinary tract infections during the 12 month treatment period was 0.89 episodes per person year (95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.12) in the antibiotics group and 1.38 (1.05 to 1.72) in the methenamine hippurate group, with an absolute difference of 0.49 (90% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.84) confirming non-inferiority. Adverse reactions were reported by 34/142 (24%) in the antibiotic group and 35/127 (28%) in the methenamine group and most reactions were mild.

Conclusion

Non-antibiotic prophylactic treatment with methenamine hippurate might be appropriate for women with a history of recurrent episodes of urinary tract infections, informed by patient preferences and antibiotic stewardship initiatives, given the demonstration of non-inferiority to daily antibiotic prophylaxis seen in this trial.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^a0a5a82c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and harms of long-term antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

We searched without language restriction MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, reference lists of review articles and contacted content experts. Date of most recent search: January 2006

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. A random-effects model was used to estimate relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eight studies (618 children) were identified, five (406) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied from 10 weeks to 12 months. Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of repeat positive urine culture (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00; RD -30%, 95% CI -56% to -4%) No side effects were reported. One study reported that nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%). The other study found cefixime was more effective in preventing recurrent UTI than nitrofurantoin (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.10; RD -3%, 95% CI -17% to -12%). However, 62% of patients receiving cefixime experienced an adverse reaction during the first six months of treatment (18/29) while only 26% (8/31) of patients receiving nitrofurantoin reported an adverse reaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Large, properly randomised, double blinded studies are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^89c3b649]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — patient education and shared decision-making emphasizes framing care beyond empiric antibiotics. It is reasonable to consider an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of rUTI as one of shared decision-making, in which patients are educated about the inaccuracy of diagnostic testing, the benefits and potential risks of antimicrobial use, and alternatives to standard antibiotic treatment, and we suggest documentation of the education provided and informed consent discussion. Many patients and providers do not know that localized cystitis typically is self-limited and rarely progresses to more severe disease, which can help define goals of care around symptom amelioration, prevention of long-term complications, and more appropriate antibiotic use.

### Common questions about recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^6839a447]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women, including healthy women with normal genitourinary anatomy. Recurrent UTI is typically defined as three or more UTIs within 12 months, or two or more occurrences within six months. The same species that caused previous infections is typically responsible for recurrences. In premenopausal women, sexual intercourse three or more times per week, spermicide use, new or multiple sex partners, and having a UTI before 15 years of age are established risk factors. In postmenopausal women, risk is primarily increased by sequelae of lower estrogen levels. Episodes of recurrent UTI are typically characterized by dysuria and urinary frequency or hesitancy. Findings from the history or physical examination that suggest complicated infection or another disease process warrant additional evaluation. At least one symptomatic episode should be verified by urine culture to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Imaging is rarely warranted. Short courses of antibiotics are as effective as longer courses. Patient-initiated treatment lowers the cost of diagnosis, number of physician visits, and number of symptomatic days compared with physician-initiated treatment. It also reduces antibiotic exposure compared with antibiotic prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis effectively limits UTI recurrence but increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Cranberry products may reduce recurrent UTIs in premenopausal women, but are less effective than antibiotic prophylaxis, and data are conflicting. Optimal dosing is unknown. Postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis may benefit from topical estrogen therapy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® recurrent lower urinary tract infections in females [^0ac1d230]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, with an overall lifetime risk over > 50%. UTIs are considered recurrent when they follow complete clinical resolution of a previous UTI and are usually defined as at least three episodes of infection within the preceding 12 months. An uncomplicated UTI is classified as a UTI without structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and without relevant comorbidities. Complicated UTIs are those occurring in patients with underlying structural or medical problems. In women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, cystoscopy and imaging are not routinely used. In women suspected of having a recurrent complicated UTI, cystoscopy and imaging should be considered. CT urography or MR urography are usually appropriate for the evaluation of recurrent complicated lower urinary tract infections or for women who are nonresponders to conventional therapy, develop frequent reinfections or relapses, or have known underlying risk factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic resistance risk after antibiotic exposure is supported by a meta-analysis: "In 5 studies of urinary tract bacteria (14,348 participants), the pooled odds ratio for resistance was 2.5 (95% CI: 2.1 to 2.9) within 2 months of antibiotic treatment and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.2 to 1.5) within 12 months". The authors note persistence and population impact, as "The effect is greatest in the month immediately after treatment but may persist for up to 12 months", and "even transient use of antibiotics can affect the carriage of resistant organisms and impact the endemic level of resistance in the population".

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^08c4671e]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

This pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, open label, non-inferiority trial compared clinical effectiveness of low dose antibiotic prophylaxis, the current standard treatment for recurrent UTI prevention, with the urinary antiseptic methenamine hippurate. The ALTAR trial (alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women) recruited women from secondary care urology and urogynaecology centres in the UK from June 2016 and incorporated a 12 month treatment period followed by a six month follow-up period. Recruitment was completed in June 2018 and the final follow-up visit took place in January 2020. The study protocol has been published elsewhere.

Participants

Adult women aged 18 years and over with recurrent UTI who had decided, in conjunction with their responsible clinician, that prophylaxis was appropriate, were eligible for inclusion. Recurrent UTI was defined as at least three episodes of symptomatic UTI in the previous 12 months or at least two episodes in the past six months. We excluded women with correctable urinary tract abnormalities contributory to recurrent UTI (eg, urinary tract calculi) and those with neurogenic dysfunction of the lower urinary tract. Women already taking antibiotic prophylaxis or methenamine hippurate were allowed to take part, but a washout period of three months without preventive treatment was required before randomisation. All participants provided written informed consent.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive antibiotic prophylaxis or methenamine hippurate. Permuted blocks of variable length (2/4/6/8) were used, stratified by menopausal status (pre-menopausal v peri-menopausal/post-menopausal) and UTI frequency in the preceding year (< 4 v ≥ 4). Randomisation lists were generated by an individual not otherwise involved in the trial and administered centrally via a web based service. This pragmatic trial was designed to reflect contemporary practice, and there was no masking of participants, clinicians, or local research staff.

### Can we prevent recurrent UTIs without antibiotics, in both those who Do and Do not use catheters? ICI-RS 2024 [^9e5d8b8f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription. The widespread use of antibiotic treatments contributes to the global health problem of antimicrobial resistance development. To slow down the progression of antimicrobial resistance, it is essential that we explore nonantibiotic preventive treatments for this common condition. We aim to report discussions regarding nonantibiotic preventive strategies for recurrent urinary tract infections in both catheterized and non-catheterized patients that took place at the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society meeting in Bristol in 2024.

Methods

We undertook a think-tank session during this multidisciplinary meeting specifically designated for discussion regarding both established and emerging nonantibiotic treatments for UTI prevention in both catheterized and non-catheterized patients. This led to the generation of pertinent research questions, which hope to shape future UTI research.

Results

We describe the discussions that took place and document the important research questions that were proposed during the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society meeting in Bristol in 2024.

Conclusions

There is a range of established UTI preventative strategies for UTI prevention in both catheterized and non-catheterized patients. Emerging UTI prevention treatments have varying levels of evidence to support their use, and in many areas, further research is needed to establish their place in clinical pathways.

### Unnecessary antibiotics in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections [^f1307b3b]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over 50% of female patients experience at least one episode of uncomplicated UTI during their lifetime, and 20–30% will have recurrent episodes. Recurrent UTI, defined as at least two infections within 6 months or at least three within a year, affects female individuals of all ages but older women are disproportionately affected with the rate doubling after age 65.

Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, i.e. antibiotic use for a condition when it is not recommended based on best practices, is a well-known contributor to multi-drug antibiotic resistance, adverse events, and gut dysbiosis that increases risk of future UTIs. According to practice guidelines, antibiotics for UTI should be prescribed to female patients with recurrent UTI only when symptoms attributable to UTI (UTI-specific symptoms) are present and urine culture demonstrates the presence of an organism with pathogenic potential. This decision making is challenging in older female patients who have a high rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria, where bacteria with pathogenic potential are present in urine culture in the absence of UTI-specific symptoms, a common scenario for which antibiotics are not recommended. The rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria, already high at 15–20% in older women, increases to 30% in those with recurrent UTI. Additional challenges that clinicians face when prescribing antibiotics to older female patients include differentiating symptoms of UTI from other common co-existing conditions such as overactive bladder and genitourinary syndrome of menopause as well as pressure from patients and caregivers to prescribe antibiotics when only nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and memory changes are present and which should not be attributed to UTI. In these clinical scenarios, an antibiotic for UTI may be prescribed in the presence of documented negative urine culture, absent pyuria, or even without any urine tests. Most antibiotic stewardship programs have focused on hospitalized patients; however, the majority of antibiotics for UTI are prescribed in outpatient visits to physicians' office and emergency rooms. Consequently, there is a lack of data on the rate of unnecessary antibiotics and the clinical scenarios in which they are prescribed to older female patients with recurrent UTI in the ambulatory setting.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^753ac986]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).

### Children with recurrent urinary tract infections: who are they and why do we need better prevention options? [^29467d3a]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections in children, and those with congenital malformations of the urinary tract are at risk of recurrent UTIs (rUTIs), which can lead to renal scarring, chronic renal failure, reduced renal perfusion, and hypertension. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which is present in 30% to 40% of children with UTIs, has been associated with rUTI. Other risk factors include the absence of circumcision, bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD), and fecal retention.

The standard of care for children at risk of rUTIs includes antimicrobial prophylaxis, whose effectiveness in preventing rUTIs and renal scarring remains controversial. Prolonged antibiotics use can lead to adverse events, and some studies suggested that prophylaxis does not reduce renal scarring and may increase antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Moreover, UTIs are often treated empirically, with treatment adjusted once the uropathogen's susceptibility profile is available.

Interventions aimed at reducing the occurrence of rUTIs without the reliance on antibiotics are imperative, but the populations that would most benefit from this intervention remain uncertain. This study aimed to identify the pediatric population most susceptible to rUTIs in a urology clinic, evaluate antibiotic use and assess the risk of AMR.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^76ea8269]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Single-dose antibiotic therapy fell into disfavor when it was observed that women had a high risk of recurrence within six weeks of the initial treatment. 14, 15 The risk was attributed to the failure of single-dose antibiotics to eradicate gram-negative bacteria from the rectum, the source or reservoir for ascending uropathogens. Unlike single-dose antibiotic therapy, a three-day regimen reduces rectal carriage of gram-negative bacteria and is not associated with a high recurrence rate. Thus, three-day regimens appear to offer the optimal combination of convenience, low cost and an efficacy comparable to that of seven-day or longer regimens but with fewer side effects. On the basis of cost and efficacy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remains the antibiotic of choice in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in young women.

The use of fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTIs should be discouraged, except in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or trimethoprim, who have a high frequency of antibiotic resistance because of recent antibiotic treatment or who reside in an area in which significant resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been noted. Each of these regimens has been shown to decrease the morbidity of recurrent UTIs without a concomitant increase in antibiotic resistance. Long-term studies have shown antibiotic prophylaxis to be effective for up to five years with trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin, without the emergence of drug resistance. 3, 19 Unfortunately, antibiotic prophylaxis does not appear to alter the natural history of recurrences because 40 to 60 percent of these women reestablish their pattern or frequency of infections within six months of stopping prophylaxis.
19.

Enterococci are frequently encountered uropathogens in complicated UTIs. In areas in which vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium is prevalent, the investigational agent quinupristindalfopristin may be useful.
20. Symptomatic bacteriuria in a patient with an indwelling Foley catheter should be treated with antibiotics that cover potential nosocomial uropathogens. Patients with mild to moderate infections may be treated with one of the oral quinolones, usually for 10 to 14 days. Parenteral antibiotic therapy may be necessary in patients with severe infections or patients who are unable to tolerate oral medications.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^72f58a6d]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and clinical outcomes among older adults with recurrent urinary tract infection: cohort study [^353c3a53]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

clinical guidelines recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), but there is little evidence for their effectiveness in older adults.

Methods

this was a retrospective cohort study of health records from 19,696 adults aged ≥ 65 with recurrent UTIs. We used prescription records to ascertain ≥ 3 months' prophylaxis with trimethoprim, cefalexin or nitrofurantoin. We used random effects Cox recurrent event models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risks of clinical recurrence (primary outcome), acute antibiotic prescribing and hospitalisation.

Results

of 4,043 men and 15,653 women aged ≥ 65 with recurrent UTIs, 508 men (12.6%) and 2,229 women (14.2%) were prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis. In men, prophylaxis was associated with a reduced risk of clinical recurrence (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.45–0.54), acute antibiotic prescribing (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.51–0.57) and UTI-related hospitalisation (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.94). In women, prophylaxis was also associated with a reduced risk of clinical recurrence (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.55–0.59) and acute antibiotic prescribing (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.59–0.62), but estimates of the risk of UTI-related hospitalisation were inconsistent between our main analysis (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05–1.28) and sensitivity analysis (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.94).

Conclusions

antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with lower rates of UTI recurrence and acute antibiotic prescribing in older adults. To fully understand the benefits and harms of prophylaxis, further research should determine the frequency of antibiotic-related adverse events and the impact on antimicrobial resistance and quality of life.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1f957e0a]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic stewardship and culture-directed management emphasizes that culture-directed, not empiric, therapies are associated with fewer UTI-related hospitalizations and lower rates of intravenous antibiotic use, and that obtaining cultures for each symptomatic episode is associated with reduced rates of overtreatment and more appropriate antibiotic selection. The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, risk of continued rUTIs as well as progression to later pyelonephritis is enhanced by unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria without any demonstrable benefit, and collateral damage from antimicrobial therapy includes alterations of the normal gut microbiome and promotion of multidrug resistant organisms. Escherichia coli isolates continue to demonstrate high in vitro susceptibility to nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and mecillinam, with these agents having minimal effects on the normal fecal microbiota, whereas TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones promote increased rates of antimicrobial resistance. Continued intermittent courses of antibiotics in rUTI patients are associated with significant adverse events, particularly in older adults, and thus substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of an acute cystitis episode. In asymptomatic women with a history of rUTIs, a placebo-controlled trial found those treated for ASB were more likely to have additional symptomatic cystitis episodes in a year of follow-up than those randomized to placebo, and over two years of follow up, treatment aimed at eradicating residual bacteriuria was associated with a higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance, a higher incidence of pyelonephritis, and a poorer quality of life compared to non-treatment.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^edb6fcbe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^858e731e]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Short-course therapy for uncomplicated acute UTI — Three-day regimens of TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones have comparable effectiveness with 79%–100% and 85%–98% cure rates and are widely accepted when there are no complicating factors. These regimens are as effective for symptomatic relief as longer 5- to 10-day regimens and have improved compliance, decreased costs, and lower adverse reaction rates. The efficacy of 5 days of nitrofurantoin is comparable to 3 days of TMP-SMX, and five days of nitrofurantoin has better efficacy than a 3-day regimen.

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

### Latin American consensus on uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infection-2018 [^39915984]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

An estimated 20–30% of adult women who experience an initial urinary tract infection (UTI) will have recurrent infection. In these patients, prophylaxis may be considered to improve their quality of life and control overuse of antibiotics. Despite this need, there is currently no Latin American consensus on the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs. This consensus, signed by a panel of regional and international experts on UTI management, aims to address this need and is the first step toward a Latin American consensus on a number of urogynecological conditions. The panel agrees that antibiotics should be considered the primary treatment option for symptomatic UTI, taking into account local pathogen resistance patterns. Regarding prophylaxis, immunoactive therapy with the bacterial lysate OM-89 received a grade A recommendation and local estrogen in postmenopausal women grade B recommendation. Lower-grade recommendations include behavior modification and D-mannose; probiotics (Lactobacilli), cranberries, and hyaluronic acid (and derivatives) received limited recommendations; their use should be discussed with the patient. Though considered effective and receiving grade A recommendation, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered only following prophylaxis with effective non-antimicrobial measures that were not successful and chosen based on the frequency of sexual intercourse and local pathogen resistance patterns.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

### The role of nonantibiotic treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections [^6d253240]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize evidence on the efficacy of nonantibiotic treatments in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The need for antibiotic-free regimens seems to be imperative given the worldwide rates of resistance of uropathogens to available antibiotics.

Recent Findings

In the recently published literature, cranberry products and probiotics are the focus of research. They both seem to be effective in preventing recurrent UTIs compared with placebo, but their benefit becomes less clear when they are compared with antibiotics.

Summary

A number of nonantibiotic-containing alternatives are available for the prevention of recurrent UTIs. For the majority of these alternatives, contradictory results have been published. These can be, at least partially, explained by variation in doses administered and duration of treatment. Selection of patients more likely to benefit from these interventions seems to be a realistic approach from a clinical-practice perspective, as well a worthwhile focus for future research.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women: diagnosis and management [^0ef82271]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections, presenting as dysuria or irritative voiding symptoms, are most commonly caused by reinfection with the original bacterial isolate in young, otherwise healthy women with no anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. Frequency of sexual intercourse is the strongest predictor of recurrent urinary tract infections in patients presenting with recurrent dysuria. In those who have comorbid conditions or other predisposing factors, recurrent complicated urinary tract infections represent a risk for ascending infection or urosepsis. Escherichia coli is the most common organism in all patient groups, but Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus, and other organisms are more common in patients with certain risk factors for complicated urinary tract infections. A positive urine culture with greater than 102 colony-forming units per mL is the standard for diagnosing urinary tract infections in symptomatic patients, although culture is often unnecessary for diagnosing typical symptomatic infection. Women with recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections can be treated with continuous or postcoital prophylactic antibiotics; other treatment options include self-started antibiotics, cranberry products, and behavioral modification. Patients at risk of complicated urinary tract infections are best managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics initially, urine culture to guide subsequent therapy, and renal imaging studies if structural abnormalities are suspected.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^e1ad4b5e]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

The trial was powered to assess non-inferiority of the absolute difference in UTI incidence over the 12 month treatment period. The non-inferiority margin, defined after a series of patient focus group meetings, was a difference of one UTI episode per year. Two meta-analyses of antibiotic prophylaxis and methenamine hippuratequoted relative risks of UTI versus placebo of 0.15 and 0.24, respectively. With this information, and local audit suggesting that untreated participants had an average of 6.5 UTI episodes/year, we assumed an average incidence rate of 0.975 and 1.56 episodes/year in the antibiotic prophylaxis and methenamine hippurate groups, respectively, equating to an estimated difference of 0.6 episodes/year (in favour of antibiotics). Using a two sample t test, and assuming a difference of 0.6 episodes/year and a standard deviation of 0.9 (based on placebo groups from meta-analyses), we required 87 participants per group to be 90% sure that the lower limit of a one sided 95% confidence interval (equivalently 90% two sided) was above the non-inferiority limit. To account for an estimated 25% attrition rate over the course of the trial, the target sample size was 240.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^33b78eba]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — acute cystitis with cultures resistant to oral antibiotics: clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion). Many such infections will be caused by organisms producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and generally are susceptible only to carbapenems; before considering that these infections require intravenous antimicrobials, clinicians should consider fosfomycin susceptibility testing because many multidrug-resistant uropathogens, including ESBL-producing bacteria, retain susceptibility to fosfomycin and/or nitrofurantoin, and consultation with an infectious diseases specialist may be appropriate.

### Nitrofurantoin vs other prophylactic agents in reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in adult women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^430aec09]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical and financial burden from bladder infections is significant. Daily antibiotic use is the recommended strategy for recurrent urinary tract infection prevention. Increasing antibiotic resistance rates, however, require immediate identification of innovative alternative prophylactic therapies. This systematic review aims to provide guidance on gaps in evidence to guide future research.

Objective

The objective of this review was to provide current pooled estimates of randomized control trials comparing the effects of nitrofurantoin vs other agents in reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in adult, nonpregnant women and assess relative adverse side effects.

Data Sources

Data sources included the following: MEDLINE, Jan. 1, 1946, to Jan. 31, 2015; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and web sites of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse from 2000 to 2015. Randomized control trials of women with recurrent urinary tract infections comparing nitrofurantoin with any other treatment were included.

Study Design

A protocol for the study was developed a priori. Published guidance was followed for assessment of study quality. All meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models with Stats Direct Software. Dual review was used for all decisions and data abstraction.

Results

Twelve randomized control trials involving 1063 patients were included. One study that had a serious flaw was rated poor in quality, one study rated good, and the remainder fair. No significant differences in prophylactic antibiotic treatment with nitrofurantoin and norfloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, methamine hippurate, estriol, or cefaclor were found in clinical or microbiological cure in adult nonpregnant women with recurrent urinary tract infections (9 randomized control trials, 673 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–1.27; I², 65%; and 12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.26; I², 76%, respectively). Duration of prophylaxis also did not have a significant impact on outcomes. There was a statistically significant difference in overall adverse effects, with nitrofurantoin resulting in greater risk than other prophylactic treatments (10 randomized control trials, 948 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–3.50; I 2, 61%). Overall, the majority of nitrofurantoin adverse effects were gastrointestinal, with a significant difference for withdrawals (12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–3.56; I 2, 8%).

Conclusion

Nitrofurantoin had similar efficacy but a greater risk of adverse events than other prophylactic treatments. Balancing the risks of adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, with potential benefits of decreasing collateral ecological damage should be considered if selecting nitrofurantoin.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^2363b269]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This trial has demonstrated that the non-antibiotic preventive treatment for UTI (methenamine hippurate) is not inferior to the current guideline recommended standard (daily, low dose prophylactic antibiotics). This trial adds to the evidence base for the use of methenamine hippurate for prophylactic treatment in adult women with recurrent UTI. Although the methenamine hippurate group had a 55% higher rate of UTI episodes than the antibiotics group, the absolute difference was just 0.49 UTI episodes per year, which has limited clinical consequence.

The risks of long term prophylactic antibiotic treatment have been well recognised in a recent study, which identified the increased risk of antibiotic resistance development in elderly patients receiving this treatment. The authors also described an increased risk of antibiotic associated complications, including Clostridium difficile infection, and concluded that the risks of long term antibiotic prophylaxis might outweigh the benefits in older patients with UTI. Our results could support a change in practice in terms of preventive treatments for recurrent UTI and provide patients and clinicians with a credible alternative to daily antibiotics, giving them the confidence to pursue strategies that avoid long term antibiotic use. The observed numerical difference in clinically diagnosed UTI between the two trial arms, which favoured antibiotic prophylaxis, was small and did not exceed the predefined non-inferiority margin of one episode per person year. This finding was consistent across the modified intention-to-treat, strict intention-to-treat, per protocol, and modified per protocol (post hoc) analyses. The information provided by this trial will allow clinicians and patients to undertake a shared decision making process relating to UTI preventive treatments. The study showed a small numerical difference in UTI incidence between the daily antibiotics and methenamine hippurate groups, but the potential trade-off includes the avoidance of antibiotic consumption, which is closely associated with antimicrobial resistance development.

### Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics [^dffd6966]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

### Differences in the pattern of antibiotic prescription profile and recurrence rate for possible urinary tract infections in women with and without diabetes [^fe9da445]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetes is an increasingly important endocrine disease. Incidence of infections is increased in diabetic (type 1 and type 2) patients compared with control subjects, and the urinary tract is the most prevalent site of these infections. Furthermore, diabetic patients with a urinary tract infection (UTI) more often develop severe and rare complications, such as emphysematous cystitis and papillary necrosis. Studies addressing differences in UTI recurrence rates between diabetic patients and control subjects show contradictory results for uncomplicated lower and upper UTIs. Currently, there are no controlled clinical trials investigating the optimal antimicrobial treatment strategy in diabetic patients with UTIs. Current recommendations rely on the opinion of experts. It is generally recommended to treat UTIs in diabetic patients with antibiotics with high tissue penetration for 7–14 days. Importantly, we lack data on the clinical practice of how diabetic patients with a UTI are actually treated, to assess recurrence rates.

The aims of this study are to describe the treatments (duration and agents) for uncomplicated UTIs in women with and without diabetes in the Netherlands and to analyze recurrence rates of these UTIs within 30 days after the last treatment.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^caf7a445]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Urinary tract infection and neurogenic bladder [^34f0421e]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent, recurrent, and lifelong for patients with neurogenic bladder and present challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Patients often present without classic symptoms of UTI but with abdominal or back pain, increased spasticity, and urinary incontinence. Failure to recognize and treat infections can quickly lead to life-threatening autonomic dysreflexia or sepsis, whereas overtreatment contributes to antibiotic resistance, thus limiting future treatment options. Multiple prevention methods are used but evidence-based practices are few. Prevention and treatment of symptomatic UTI requires a multimodal approach that focuses on bladder management as well as accurate diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment.

### Lack of uniformity among United States recommendations for diagnosis and management of acute, uncomplicated cystitis [^f814ecab]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Acute, uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. Quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts to optimize cystitis management rely on clinicians managing patients in a manner recommended by experts and guidelines. However, it is unclear if recent recommendations for cystitis from experts and guidelines from US medical societies that provide recommendations are well aligned.

Methods

We examined recommendations and guidelines for acute, symptomatic cystitis in women published in US medical societies' journals from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016, within the fields of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, and infectious diseases.

Results

All recommendations endorsed the use of symptoms and urine dipstick to diagnose cystitis. Some societies did not recommend urine dipstick in patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), classic UTI symptoms, or a lack of underlying conditions or competing diagnoses. All endorsed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line agents. Some guidelines classified fluoroquinolones as second- or third-line, while others considered them first-line treatment for UTI. Avoiding use of amoxicillin and ampicillin, antibiotic agents with high prevalence of resistance in the US, was recommended by some societies.

Conclusions

US recommendations differed in their approach to the treatment of acute, uncomplicated cystitis. Lack of uniformity likely contributes to clinical management variance for patients with UTI and hampers quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts aimed at promoting optimal management. Our findings emphasize the need for more consistent recommendations for cystitis management.

### Long-term antibiotics for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f61e16f3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of long-term prophylactic antibiotics for recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in children through meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Methods

Electronic databases and reference lists of review articles were searched for relevant trials. Outcome measures were recurrence of symptomatic UTI, repeat positive urine culture, new or deteriorated renal scarring and adverse events during and after treatment.

Results

Eleven trials with 2046 patients were identified. Analysis suggested rates of recurrent symptomatic UTI were not significantly different between antibiotic (12.4%) and control groups (15.5%) (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05). Subsequent sensitivity and subgroup analyses according to patient vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) status, patient characteristics, history of UTI, site of UTI and duration of treatment also produced no significant effect. However, when trials were divided by study quality, only in trials with adequate allocation concealment was recurrent symptomatic UTI reduced by antibiotic prophylaxis. Prophylactic antibiotics reduced the risk of repeat positive urine culture (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.74). A subgroup analysis limited to patients without VUR showed similar results (0.52, 0.33 to 0.83), whereas patients with VUR showed a non-significant decrease (0.82, 0.61 to 1.09) in risk of repeat positive urine culture. Seven studies reported the rate of new or deteriorated renal scars and showed no significant difference (0.95, 0.51 to 1.78).

Conclusions

Evidence is lacking that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the incidence of recurrent childhood UTI. Since the reviewed studies had limitations in methodological design, large scale, high quality, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials are required.

### Unnecessary antibiotics in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections [^0d314335]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The most important finding of this study is that the rate of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in older female patients with recurrent UTI is high across specialties. The overall rate of unnecessary antibiotics across 454 episodes of antibiotic prescriptions in 175 older female patients with recurrent UTI was 41% ranging from 45% in primary care to 27% in ED/urgent care. The most common clinical scenario in which an unnecessary antibiotic was prescribed was absence of documented UTI-specific symptoms (60%) followed by asymptomatic bacteriuria (46%). Other clinical scenarios of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions included absence of pyuria (32%) and presence of documented negative urine culture (18%). In 11% of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, antibiotics were prescribed without any documented UTI-specific symptoms and without any testing. These findings suggest that a variety of clinician and patient related factors contribute to a high rate of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in older female patients with recurrent UTI.

The rate of unnecessary antibiotic in this study is comparable to that of other studies with reported rates of 40–50% in nonrecurrent UTI populations. The most common reason for the unnecessary antibiotic prescription in this study was absence of documented UTI-specific symptoms (60%) when either no UTI-specific symptom or only nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, mental changes (e.g. confusion, forgetfulness), and back pain were documented. Failure to document UTI-specific symptoms also contributed to the high rate of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Large prior studies and systematic reviews indicate that mental changes, back pain, and fatigue should not be ascribed to UTI in older adults. Specifically, antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults with mental changes is associated with a high rate of adverse events, including longer hospital stays, C. difficile infection, and mortality.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — intermittent self-administered TMP-SMX versus daily prophylactic TMP-SMX: In a medium risk of bias crossover trial (N = 38), intermittent self-administered TMP-SMX for acute symptoms was associated with increased risk of ≥ 1 UTI versus daily prophylactic TMP-SMX (68% versus 6.1%; RR: 11.16; 95% CI: 2.86 to 43.63) and was also associated with increased UTI frequency (2.2 versus 0.2 microbiologically confirmed episodes per patient-year; p < 0.001). Most UTI episodes in women on intermittent dosing resolved with single-dose TMP-SMX treatment, and the rest responded to 10- to 20-day courses of antibiotics, and there was no difference in risk of any adverse event (8.8% versus 15.2%; RR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.15 to 2.24).
