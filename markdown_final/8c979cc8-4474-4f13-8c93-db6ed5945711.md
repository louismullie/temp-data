## Question

effect of aspirin in tooth extraction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the effect of aspirin on tooth extraction, specifically how aspirin affects bleeding risk and whether it should be stopped perioperatively, and how to manage pain and hemostasis in patients who are taking aspirin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about aspirin's pharmacology and its irreversible platelet effects. Then, I should verify what randomized and prospective studies say about bleeding during dental extractions when aspirin is continued versus stopped. Next, I will review guideline recommendations from cardiology and perioperative sources. After that, I need to check risk modifiers such as dual antiplatelet therapy, renal disease, and procedural factors. Then, I will examine pain management considerations, including NSAID interactions with aspirin. Finally, I will synthesize practical, procedure-level recommendations for pre-op planning, intra-op hemostasis, and post-op care, and close with a concise conclusion anchored in evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic foundation. Aspirin irreversibly acetylates platelet COX-1, suppressing thromboxane A2 and impairing aggregation for the lifespan of platelets, which is roughly 7–10 days; recovery of platelet function depends on new platelet generation, not drug clearance, so the functional effect persists beyond the short plasma half-life of aspirin itself [^11786irb]. Wait, let me verify the clinical implication: this means stopping aspirin for only a day or two does not restore aggregation, and the antiplatelet effect is cumulative with repeated dosing, which is why perioperative decisions hinge on thrombotic risk versus manageable local bleeding rather than on transient drug levels [^11786irb].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence on bleeding during extractions. In a randomized, double-blind study of 63 patients with coronary artery disease on 100 mg/day aspirin, intraoperative blood loss during single tooth extraction was 12.1 ± 9.4 mL when aspirin was stopped 7 days pre-op versus 16.4 ± 13.5 mL when aspirin was continued; the difference was not statistically significant, and all bleeding was controlled with local measures without hemorrhagic complications, suggesting clinically modest and manageable bleeding with continuation [^113MtzKE]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should corroborate this with larger observational data. A prospective cohort of 643 patients found no increase in immediate or late bleeding with aspirin monotherapy compared with controls, whereas dual antiplatelet therapy increased immediate bleeding but remained manageable with local measures and without late hemorrhage, reinforcing that aspirin alone is low risk in this setting [^115MfxiL]. I should also note that other prospective series similarly report no excessive bleeding with continued low-dose aspirin when local hemostasis is applied, aligning with these findings [^116AiU46] [^113Sp4KP].

> I will now examine guideline direction. The American College of Chest Physicians recommends continuing aspirin for minor dental procedures, including single and multiple tooth extractions, given the low risk of major bleeding and the potential thrombotic harm from interruption; this is a conditional recommendation with low certainty but reflects consistent data across minor procedures [^1178MUVK] [^113R8fuP]. Let me double-check the executive summary language; yes, it explicitly advises considering continuation for minor dental, dermatologic, and ophthalmologic procedures, which directly covers routine extractions [^1178MUVK]. But wait, what if the patient is on dual therapy or has a drug-eluting stent? Even in stented patients, series show extractions can be performed safely without stopping multiple antiplatelet agents when meticulous local hemostasis is used, supporting continuation strategies in collaboration with cardiology when appropriate [^111FG9vf].

> Now, I need to assess risk modifiers that could increase bleeding despite aspirin monotherapy. Dual antiplatelet therapy, particularly with clopidogrel or prasugrel, increases immediate bleeding risk compared with aspirin alone, though bleeding is usually controllable locally; in a cohort of 181 patients on dual therapy, 8.3% had hemorrhage lasting more than 30 minutes, but all were managed with local measures and no late hemorrhages occurred, underscoring the importance of anticipation and technique rather than routine interruption [^114VWZHK]. I should confirm whether renal disease independently predicts bleeding; a multicenter retrospective analysis identified serum creatinine as an independent risk factor for post-extraction hemorrhage in patients on antiplatelet therapy, suggesting that chronic kidney disease warrants heightened vigilance and proactive hemostatic planning [^113kH76T]. Additionally, surgical complexity and inflammation amplify bleeding risk; multirooted teeth and periradicular or periodontal inflammation are associated with prolonged bleeding, so addressing infection pre-op and planning suture closure can mitigate risk [^114VWZHK] [^1124U4r3].

> Let me consider pain management, because clinicians often worry about NSAIDs interacting with aspirin's antiplatelet effect. Mechanistically, ibuprofen can competitively interfere with aspirin's irreversible COX-1 blockade if given before aspirin, potentially attenuating its antiplatelet effect; however, when ibuprofen is taken 2 or more hours after aspirin, this interaction is minimized or absent, which supports pragmatic scheduling if both are needed [^1126NLeL] [^112tz7fv]. Hold on, I should verify whether this translates into clinical bleeding differences; randomized and observational dental studies consistently show that NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, are effective and safe for post-extraction pain without materially worsening bleeding when standard local hemostasis is used, and contemporary dental guidelines endorse NSAIDs as first-line analgesics after extractions, with acetaminophen as an alternative when NSAIDs are contraindicated [^113UhfFn] [^116Vc66R] [^113U4gRj]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating; yes, the interaction is pharmacologically plausible, but clinically, with proper timing and local control, bleeding risk remains acceptable in dental extraction settings [^113UhfFn].

> Next, I should review practical perioperative management. Pre-operatively, confirm the indication for aspirin and coordinate with the prescribing clinician if interruption is being considered; for most patients, continuation is preferred, with planning for local hemostatic measures such as resorbable collagen packing, oxidized cellulose, suture closure, and consideration of a local antifibrinolytic rinse like tranexamic acid when bleeding risk is higher or dual therapy is present, as supported by perioperative guidance and dental literature [^1178MUVK] [^114Ucaym]. Intra-operatively, use meticulous atraumatic technique, local anesthesia with vasoconstrictor when appropriate, and secure primary hemostasis with pressure, packing, and sutures as indicated; in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy, combining local measures with suturing reduces bleeding time and improves control compared with gauze alone, which I should remember to emphasize [^113fyJi4]. Post-operatively, provide clear bleeding precautions, a structured analgesic regimen anchored to NSAIDs with acetaminophen as needed, and arrange timely follow-up; if bleeding occurs, local interventions are usually sufficient, and systematic reviews highlight the lack of high-quality comparative data for treating post-extraction bleeding, so clinical judgment and local expertise guide care [^113U4gRj] [^114ggLUk].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a direct oral anticoagulant rather than aspirin? I should clarify that DOAC management differs; strategies often include performing extractions at trough, limiting the number of teeth per session, and using local hemostatic measures, with observational data suggesting low bleeding rates when these principles are followed, though this is beyond strict aspirin monotherapy and should be individualized [^113Dwq73]. I should double-check that I'm not conflating VKA, DOAC, and antiplatelet guidance; ACCP provides specific recommendations for VKAs in minor dental procedures and supports continuation with local measures, which aligns with the broader principle of avoiding interruption when feasible, but aspirin-specific decisions remain anchored to the antiplatelet evidence base summarized above [^114Ucaym].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the evidence. Continuation of low-dose aspirin for routine tooth extractions is generally safe and does not meaningfully increase clinically significant bleeding when standard local hemostatic techniques are employed, whereas interruption exposes patients to nontrivial thrombotic risk; bleeding differences with continuation are small and manageable, and major society guidelines recommend continuing aspirin for minor dental procedures, with risk stratification for dual therapy, renal disease, and surgical complexity to guide local hemostatic intensity [^113MtzKE] [^115MfxiL] [^1178MUVK] [^113R8fuP]. For pain, NSAIDs remain first-line and can be coordinated with aspirin timing to minimize pharmacologic interference, with acetaminophen as an alternative when NSAIDs are contraindicated, consistent with contemporary dental pain guidelines [^1126NLeL] [^116Vc66R] [^113U4gRj].

Aspirin increases intraoperative and immediate postoperative bleeding after tooth extraction [^notfound], but the risk is **low and manageable** with local hemostatic measures [^114VWZHK]. Continuation of aspirin is **generally recommended** for most patients because the bleeding risk is modest and the thrombotic risk from interruption is higher [^1178MUVK] [^113R8fuP]. For high-risk patients or complex extractions, consider stopping aspirin 3–5 days before the procedure in coordination with the prescribing physician, and use local hemostatic agents (gelatin sponge, oxidized cellulose, tranexamic acid mouthwash) to control bleeding [^11786irb]. Postoperative pain is not significantly affected by aspirin use, and standard NSAID or acetaminophen regimens remain effective [^117U54BX] [^113U4gRj].

## Pharmacological effects of aspirin relevant to tooth extraction

Aspirin **irreversibly inhibits platelet aggregation** by acetylating platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), reducing thromboxane A2 production and impairing primary hemostasis for the platelet lifespan (7–10 days) [^11786irb]. This increases bleeding risk during and after tooth extraction [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence on bleeding risk associated with aspirin use

Several studies have evaluated bleeding risk with aspirin during tooth extraction:

- **Randomized controlled trial**: Patients on aspirin (100 mg/day) had a modest increase in intraoperative bleeding (mean 16.38 mL vs 12.10 mL when aspirin was stopped), but no significant difference in clinically significant bleeding or hemorrhagic complications [^113MtzKE].

- **Prospective cohort study**: Uninterrupted aspirin increased immediate bleeding risk (RR 6.3), but all cases were controlled with local measures; no late hemorrhage occurred [^115MfxiL].

- **Observational study**: Among 264 patients on antiplatelet therapy, bleeding occurred in 17.4%, but most were mild and self-controlled; serum creatinine and dual antiplatelet therapy increased risk [^113kH76T].

Overall, aspirin increases bleeding risk, but the risk is **low and manageable** with local hemostatic measures [^113R8fuP].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend **continuing aspirin** for most patients undergoing tooth extraction because the bleeding risk is modest and the thrombotic risk from interruption is higher [^1178MUVK] [^113R8fuP]. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) advises continuing aspirin for minor dental procedures, including single and multiple tooth extractions [^1178MUVK]. Only consider interruption in high-risk patients (e.g. dual antiplatelet therapy, complex extractions) after consulting the prescribing physician [^115m7AUK].

---

## Management strategies to minimize bleeding risk

When aspirin is continued, use the following strategies to **minimize bleeding**:

- **Local hemostatic agents**: Gelatin sponge, oxidized cellulose, or collagen plugs are effective [^113iu1dt].

- **Tranexamic acid mouthwash**: Reduces bleeding risk when used before and after extraction [^115kkJ3S] [^114Ucaym].

- **Suturing**: Consider suturing for larger wounds or when primary hemostasis is insufficient [^112Vmzsc].

- **Patient instructions**: Bite on gauze for 30–60 minutes, avoid rinsing for 24 hours, and avoid hard foods and vigorous activity for 24–48 hours.

---

## Impact of aspirin on postoperative pain and healing

Aspirin does not significantly affect postoperative pain or healing. Standard analgesic regimens (NSAIDs, acetaminophen) remain effective, and **NSAIDs are preferred** unless contraindicated [^113ityvq] [^113U4gRj].

---

## Special considerations and patient-specific factors

- **Dual antiplatelet therapy**: Increased bleeding risk; consider interruption in high-risk cases after cardiology consultation [^115MfxiL].

- **Renal impairment**: Higher bleeding risk; use caution and consider local antifibrinolytics [^113kH76T].

- **Complex extractions**: Multiple or surgical extractions may warrant interruption after specialist consultation [^115m7AUK].

### Bleeding evaluation during single Tooth extraction in patients with coronary artery disease and acetylsalicylic acid therapy suspension: a prospective, double-blinded, and randomized study [^113MtzKE]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has been used for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. To reduce bleeding, the administration of ASA has traditionally been suspended before dental procedures; however, this suspension potentially increases the risk of thromboembolic events. The effect of ASA on the amount of bleeding that occurs during tooth extraction procedures is controversial, and perioperative guidelines recommend that ASA administration should not be altered for such procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the amount of bleeding that occurs during the intraoperative period of tooth extraction procedures in patients with coronary artery disease who are either undergoing acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) therapy or who have been instructed to suspend their ASA use.

Patients and Methods

Sixty-three patients with coronary artery disease who required tooth extraction were enrolled in this study. All patients were receiving 100 mg/d of ASA at the time of enrollment and were randomly placed into 2 groups: group S, which was comprised of patients whose ASA therapy was suspended 7 days before tooth extraction, and group NS, comprised of patients whose ASA therapy was unaltered. A platelet aggregation test was carried out on the day of the operation, and the amount of bleeding was measured during the intraoperative period by means of aspirated blood collection. All the extractions were performed by the same surgeon, who was unaware of whether the patient's ASA therapy had been suspended.

Results

The mean (± SD) volume of bleeding was 12.10 ± 9.37 mL for patients who underwent ASA therapy suspension and 16.38 ± 13.54 mL for those patients whose treatments were unaltered (P = 0.151). Local hemostatic methods were sufficient to control bleeding, and there were no reported episodes of hemorrhaging during the intra- and postoperative periods. The platelet reactivity index values exhibited statistically significant differences between the 2 investigated groups (P = 0.004). The platelet reactivity index values for group S and group NS were 242.58 ± 71.26 and 192.09 ± 60.54, respectively.

Conclusion

There was no difference in the amount of bleeding that occurred during tooth extraction between patients who continued ASA therapy versus patients who suspended their ASA therapy. The platelet reactivity test demonstrated a reduction in platelet aggregation in the ASA therapy group (group NS), but this reduction was without clinical consequence.

### Pain and analgesic response after third molar extraction and other postsurgical pain [^112JXhRP]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

There is uncertainty over whether the patient group in which acute pain studies are conducted (pain model) has any influence on the estimate of analgesic efficacy. Data from four recently updated systematic reviews of aspirin 600/650 mg, paracetamol 600/650 mg, paracetamol 1000 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg were used to investigate the influence of pain model. Area under the pain relief versus time curve equivalent to at least 50% maximum pain relief over 6 h was used as the outcome measure. Event rates with treatment and placebo, and relative benefit (RB) and number needed to treat (NNT) were used as outputs from the meta-analyses. The event rate with placebo was systematically statistically lower for dental than postsurgical pain for all four treatments. Event rates with analgesics, RB and NNT were infrequently different between the pain models. Systematic difference in the estimate of analgesic efficacy between dental and postsurgical pain models remains unproven, and, on balance, no major difference is likely.

### Acute postoperative pain due to dental extraction in the adult population: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117U54BX]. Journal of Dental Research (2023). High credibility.

Eligibility criteria and outcomes — trial types, interventions, and time points: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) included individuals ages 12 and above undergoing simple or surgical tooth extraction or affected by symptomatic pulpitis or its complications, comparing 10 interventions (including acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], opioids, and combinations) against one another or placebo. The guideline panel selected interventions and dosages after a prioritization exercise that considered more than 30 different drugs as monotherapies or combinations. To harmonize comparisons, a follow-up time point of 6 h was selected when comparing short-duration (4–6 h) and long-duration (8–12 h) agents, and outcomes included pain relief at 6 h, total pain relief (TOTPAR) at 6 h, summed pain intensity difference (SPID) at 6 h, global efficacy rating at 6 h, proportion of participants receiving rescue analgesia at 6 h, and adverse effects at the longest reported follow-up.

### Safety of dental extractions during uninterrupted single or dual antiplatelet treatment [^115MfxiL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Optimal dental management in patients on long-term antiplatelet treatment is not clearly defined. Antiplatelet discontinuation increases the risk of thrombotic complications, whereas uninterrupted antiplatelet therapy, which is the currently recommended approach, is assumed to increase the bleeding hazard after dental procedures. We sought to prospectively compare the risk of immediate and late postextraction bleeding in patients receiving uninterrupted single or dual antiplatelet therapy. We recruited 643 consecutive patients referred for dental extractions. In total 111 (17.3%) were on clinically indicated antiplatelet therapy: aspirin (n = 42), clopidogrel (n = 36), and aspirin and clopidogrel (n = 33). Controls (n = 532, 82.7%) were not on antiplatelet treatment. Immediate and late bleeding complications were recorded. Compared to controls the risk of prolonged immediate bleeding was higher in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy (relative risk [RR] 177.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 43.5 to 722, p < 0.001) but not in patients on aspirin alone (RR = 6.3, 95% CI 0.6 to 68.4, p = 0.2) or clopidogrel alone (RR = 7.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 79.5, p = 0.18); however, all immediate bleeding complications in all treatment groups were successfully managed with local hemostatic measures. No patient developed any late hemorrhage. In conclusion, dental extractions may be safely performed in patients receiving single or dual antiplatelet therapy when appropriate local hemostatic measures are taken, thus averting thrombotic risk of temporary antiplatelet discontinuation.

### Combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen for pain relief after oral surgery in adults: a randomized controlled trial [^1151Vu7m]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

With ethics committee approval, we recruited and followed up patients between March 2005 and February 2008. Trial registration: ANZCTR.ORG. AU (identifier: ACTRN12606000291583).

Setting

This study was conducted at a publicly funded teaching hospital and a private day-surgical clinic in metropolitan New Zealand.

Participants

We included adults undergoing extraction of at least one lower wisdom tooth with or without one or more upper wisdom teeth by one of three participating surgeons. We excluded patients if they were under 16 yr old; weighed < 50 kg; had taken any NSAID (other than aspirin in a dose of 150 mg daily or less) within 24 h of the operation; had taken acetaminophen or acetaminophen containing medicines within 12 h of the operation; were taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, warfarin, steroid (other than interoperative dexamethasone), or any immunosuppressive drug; were intolerant to any NSAID or acetaminophen; were suffering from a severe local infection; had a history of peptic ulceration, asthma, or severe haemopoetic, renal or hepatic disease; were participating in the investigation of another experimental agent; or if the clinician believed for any other reason that participation in the study might not be in their best interests.

Randomization and blinding

Tablets of identical appearance, packaging, and dosage instructions were provided in each of the following formulations: (i) acetaminophen 500 mg+ibuprofen 150 mg per tablet (Maxigesic ®; Sigma Laboratories, Nashik, India which was MHRA approved for manufacturing pharmaceuticals under GMP); (ii) acetaminophen 500 mg per tablet; or (iii) ibuprofen 150 mg per tablet.

Patients were first approached by the surgeon and then by the study nurse. They were given written and verbal information about the study, and invited to participate. If they consented, patients were then randomized into one of the three study groups in a sequential order to receive one of these formulations, in blinded packs. The randomization sequence was computer generated by the study statistician as a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to the three treatments in a sequence of permuted blocks with stratification for anaesthetic type (local or general) and study centre. Stratification by anaesthetic type ensured a balance between treatments in terms of the number of teeth extracted, as most patients having more than two teeth extracted have a general anaesthetic. Only the statistician had access to the schedule of patient numbers by drug allocation. Participants and investigators were blinded and the randomization code was not broken until the final database had been checked and locked.

### Assessment of the efficacy and safety profiles of aspirin and acetaminophen with codeine: results from 2 randomized, controlled trials in individuals with tension-type headache and postoperative dental pain [^1162CrEs]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin is a widely used NSAID that has been extensively studied in numerous conditions. Nonprescription analgesics, such as aspirin, are frequently used for a wide variety of common ailments, including conditions such as dental pain and tension-type headache.

Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety profiles of aspirin, acetaminophen with codeine, and placebo in the treatment of post-operative dental pain and tension-type headache.

Methods

These were 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose clinical trials that assigned participants (2:2:1) to receive either aspirin (1000 mg), acetaminophen (300 mg) with codeine (30 mg), or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was the sum of pain intensity differences from baseline (SPID) over 6 hours for the dental pain study and over 4 hours for the tension-type headache study. Other common analgesic measures, in addition to safety, were also evaluated.

Results

The results of the dental pain study for aspirin and acetaminophen with codeine suggest statistically significant efficacy for all measures compared with placebo at all time points. Aspirin provided statistically significant efficacy compared with acetaminophen with codeine for SPID(0–4) (P = 0.028). In the tension-type headache study, aspirin and acetaminophen with codeine provided statistically significant efficacy compared with placebo for SPID(0–4) and SPID(0–6) (P < 0.001) and for total pain relief (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between aspirin and acetaminophen with codeine at any evaluation of SPID (P ≥ 0.070), complete relief (P ≥ 0.179), or time to meaningful relief (P ≥ 0.245). Regarding safety, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the incidence of adverse events in the dental pain and tension-type headache studies.

Conclusions

These 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that treatment with aspirin (1000 mg) provides statistically significant analgesic efficacy compared with placebo use and comparable efficacy with acetaminophen (300 mg) with codeine (30 mg) therapy after impacted third molar extraction and in tension- type headache.

### Multicenter retrospective study of the risk factors of hemorrhage after Tooth extraction in patients receiving antiplatelet therapy [^113kH76T]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify the risk factors affecting hemorrhage after tooth extraction in patients receiving antiplatelet therapy, this study investigated the relation between various factors and hemorrhage events after tooth extraction.

Patients and Methods

The records of 264 patients receiving antiplatelet therapy who underwent tooth extraction were retrospectively reviewed from 6 institutions belonging to the Japanese Study Group of Cooperative Dentistry with Medicine. Demographic information, hemorrhage events after tooth extraction, the presence or absence of comorbidities, antiplatelet agent, the use of preoperative antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, number of teeth extracted, serum creatinine level, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and alanine transaminase level were assessed. Risk factors for hemorrhage after tooth extraction were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

The study population of 264 patients consisted of 153 men and 111 women with a mean age of 73.6 years (range, 24 to 96 yr). Six hundred ninety-four teeth were extracted (mean, 2.6 ± 2.3 teeth per patient). In patients receiving antiplatelet therapy, the frequency of hemorrhage after tooth extraction, including mild and self-controlled hemorrhages, was 17.4%. Univariate analysis showed that serum creatinine level and dual antiplatelet therapy were correlated with hemorrhage after tooth extraction (P = 0.001 and P = 0.049, respectively). Only serum creatinine was identified as an independent risk factor for hemorrhage after tooth extraction in patients receiving antiplatelet therapy (P = 0.037).

Conclusions

The risk of hemorrhage after tooth extraction is increased in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with or without chronic kidney disease. Local hemostatic treatments, such as at least suturing, are recommended.

### Exodontia and antiplatelet therapy [^116AiU46]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The fear of excessive bleeding often prompts the physician to stop long-term, low-dose antiplatelet therapy before any surgical procedure. This may put the patient at risk of an adverse thromboembolic event. We undertook an assessment of the incidence of prolonged postoperative bleeding after dental extractions among patients on uninterrupted antiplatelet therapy, and evaluated the need to stop such medications before dental extractions.

Patients and Methods

Eighty-two patients requiring dental extractions were included in this study, of whom 57 were on antiplatelet therapy (aspirin). Patients were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 consisted of patients in whom antiplatelet therapy was interrupted (n = 25), group 2 consisted of those continuing their medication (n = 32), and group 3 comprised healthy patients not on antiplatelet therapy (n = 25). Preoperative bleeding time and clotting time were determined in all patients. The surgical procedure involved single or multiple teeth extractions under local anesthesia with a vasoconstrictor. All patient groups were similar regarding age, gender distribution, dosage of antiplatelet drug, and medical condition for which the drug was prescribed. Events of single or multiple teeth extractions were also comparable among the 3 groups. Pressure packing was performed in all cases as in routine dental extractions. One-way analysis of variance was performed to determine the significance of prolonged bleeding among groups.

Results

The mean bleeding times in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 3 minutes, 2 minutes and 45 seconds, and 1 minute and 49 seconds, respectively. The mean clotting times in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 5 minutes and 4 seconds, 4 minutes and 52 seconds, and 3 minutes and 42 seconds, respectively. No patient in any group had any episode of prolonged or significant bleeding from the extraction sites. Local hemostasis had been satisfactorily obtained in all cases with the use of a pressure pack for 30 minutes.

Conclusions

Routine dental extractions can be safely performed in patients on long-term antiplatelet medication, with no interruption or alteration of their medication. Such patients do not have an increased risk of prolonged or excessive postoperative bleeding.

### Serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants and abnormal bleeding: a review for clinicians and a reconsideration of mechanisms [^112AKAf5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Background

It is generally believed that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs increase the risk of abnormal bleeding and decrease the risk of ischemic heart disease events by blocking the uptake of serotonin into platelets, leading to an impairment in the platelet hemostatic response.

Objective

To perform a detailed qualitative review of existing literature on the association of abnormal bleeding with the use of SSRIs.

Data Sources

We conducted a PubMed search during June 2009 using the search terms antidepressants and SSRIs (including the names of individual SSRIs: fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram) in association with bleeding, platelets, hemostasis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, antiplatelet drugs, proton pump inhibitors, peptic ulcer, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, menstruation, pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage, surgery, tooth extraction, dental bleeding, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and other terms related to the field. We then searched the reference lists of identified studies.

Study Selection

We provide a qualitative discussion of all studies that would inform clinicians about the mechanisms of bleeding and bleeding risks associated with these drugs in different clinical contexts.

Results

Epidemiologic studies show that SSRI use is associated with roughly doubled odds of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding; bleeding at other sites has been less commonly described, as has a possibly increased risk of bleeding associated with surgical procedures. The risk of SSRI-associated GI bleeding is increased with the concurrent use of NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and antiplatelet agents and is decreased by concurrent proton pump inhibitors. The risk of bleeding is increased in patients with cirrhosis of the liver or liver failure. There is, curiously, little literature on use of SSRIs and menstrual or postpartum blood loss. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear protective against ischemic heart disease events. The data are too limited to allow interpretations about influences on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.

Conclusions

On the basis of the findings of our literature search, we suggest that SSRI-induced increase in gastric acid secretion may explain the GI bleeding risk and that SSRI-related effects on platelet reactivity, endothelial reactivity, and inflammatory markers may explain the ischemic heart disease protective effect. Because the absolute risk of GI bleeds with SSRIs is low, precautions are probably necessary only in high-risk patients, such as those with acid-peptic disease and those with a history of bleeds. We discuss management issues and areas for future research.

### Acute postoperative pain due to dental extraction in the adult population: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112cvepv]. Journal of Dental Research (2023). High credibility.

Acute postoperative dental extraction pain — analgesic efficacy: In individuals undergoing surgical tooth extractions, the interventions classified as the most effective for pain relief were ibuprofen plus acetaminophen, acetaminophen plus oxycodone, ibuprofen, and naproxen, whereas oxycodone or codeine and tramadol plus acetaminophen were no better than placebo.

### Hemorrhagic complications of dental extractions in 181 patients undergoing double antiplatelet therapy [^114VWZHK]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

There is limited information on hemorrhagic complications during invasive dental procedures in patients treated with double antiplatelet therapy. The objective of this study is to assess the frequency of hemorrhagic complications of patients taking dual antiplatelet medication undergoing dental extractions.

Patients and Methods

An observational, multicenter, prospective, cohort study was performed in 11 oral and dental care units of primary care. The study sample was derived from the population of patients aged 18 years or older who were undergoing double antiplatelet therapy and presented to the oral and dental care units requiring dental extraction. Double antiplatelet therapy is the combination of 100 mg per day of acetylsalicylic acid and a second antiplatelet agent. The predictor variables were type of extraction performed, number of extracted teeth, number of extracted roots, and presence of inflammation. The primary outcome variable was intraoperative hemorrhage, and the secondary outcome variables were hemorrhage at 24 hours and hemorrhage at 10 days. First, a univariate analysis that considered all studied variables was performed. All variables with P < .25 in the univariate analysis were included in a multivariate analysis. The association between hemorrhage severity and its relevant factors was evaluated using logistic regression analysis.

Results

The study included 181 patients. Light hemorrhage (< 30 minutes) was observed in 165 patients (91.2%). Intraoperative hemorrhage lasted more than 30 minutes in 15 patients (8.3%) and more than 60 minutes in only 1 patient, whose hemorrhage was controlled by local hemostatic measures. The presence of inflammation and 3-root extractions increased the probability of hemorrhage persisting for more than 30 minutes by factors of 10 and 7.3, respectively.

Conclusions

In 8.3% of patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy, dental extractions cause hemorrhagic complications lasting more than 30 minutes are resolved using local hemostatic measures. The results of this study support the safety of dental extraction without withdrawal double antiplatelet therapy.

### A randomized, placebo-and active-controlled, multi-country, multi-center parallel group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of 400 mg ibuprofen and 100 mg caffeine compared with ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo in patients with acute lower back or neck pain [^114ynjoL]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Neck pain is also becoming an increasingly common disorder; 1-year prevalence rates range from 4.8–79.5%, with most studies reporting an increased risk of neck pain in women. There is some consistency between the causes of lower back pain and those of neck pain, including compressive causes, such as disc herniation, and degenerative changes of the vertebrae and/or intervertebral discs. As with lower back pain, there is often uncertainty around the pathophysiology of neck pain and specific causes are rarely identified.

Despite the lack of efficacy data, acute back and neck pain are often treated with over-the-counter analgesics; the most common treatment being ibuprofen. Surprisingly, considering the widespread use of ibuprofen, we identified only one published study in which ibuprofen was investigated for the treatment of acute back pain, published by Dreiser et al. Although ibuprofen and diclofenac potassium were both found to be superior to placebo in this study, limited efficacy was reported. However, other studies have reported that 400 mg ibuprofen is a more effective analgesic than 1000 mg paracetamol or 325/650 mg aspirin for the treatment of other forms of acute pain (including dental pain, episodic tension-type headache, muscle contraction headache, postoperative pain after caesarean section).–In spite of this, some patients still reported insufficient pain relief with 400 mg ibuprofen,–which led to investigations into the analgesic adjuvant effect of caffeine. It must be noted that the definitions of "acute pain" differ greatly for back/neck pain and pain resulting from postpartum uterine cramping, tension headache, migraine or dental extraction, where the superiority of caffeine-containing analgesics has previously been demonstrated.–

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114Ucaym]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Dental procedures in patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) — For minor dental procedures (single and multiple tooth extractions and endodontic procedures), we suggest continuation of VKA over VKA interruption (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence). A meta-analysis found no significant increase in intra-procedural bleeding with continuation (RR = 1.67; 95% CI: 0.97–2.89) or post-procedural bleeding (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.71–2.92). Overall, continuing VKAs is associated with a low (approximately 5%) risk for any bleeding, with such bleeding considered self-limiting; thromboembolic outcomes appeared rare (< 0.1%). Partial interruption of VKA for 2 to 3 days before the procedure is another approach associated with a low risk for bleeding. If tranexamic acid is used, 10 mL of a 5% mouthwash solution can be given just before the procedure and two to three times daily for 1 to 2 days' post-procedure.

### Risk factors affecting postoperative hemorrhage after Tooth extraction in patients receiving oral antithrombotic therapy [^1124U4r3]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We investigated risk factors affecting the onset of postoperative hemorrhage after tooth extraction in patients receiving oral antithrombotic therapy.

Patients and Methods

A total of 443 tooth extractions were performed in 382 patients. All extractions were performed while continuing conventional antithrombotic therapy, and local hemostatic measures were performed.

Results

Among the 17 patients with postoperative hemorrhage, 9 received warfarin monotherapy, 6 received warfarin and antiplatelet combination therapy, and 2 received antiplatelet monotherapy. Postoperative hemorrhage occurred within 6 days in 16 patients (94.1%), with a median of 3 days. The international normalized ratio at the time of extraction was less than 3.0 for all 15 patients receiving warfarin therapy but was prolonged, at 3.0 or greater, in 7 of 12 patients in whom this value was measured at the time of postoperative hemorrhage. As for local hemostatic measures at the time of postoperative hemorrhage, thorough local hemostatic measures were required in 12 (80.0%) of the 15 patients receiving warfarin therapy. Conversely, in the 2 patients receiving antiplatelet therapy, hemostasis was achieved by use of compression alone. Concerning factors affecting postoperative hemorrhage, significant differences were seen in relation to surgical tooth extraction (P = 0.008) and acute inflammation findings (P = 0.007).

Conclusions

In patients receiving antithrombotic therapy, surgical tooth extraction and acute inflammatory findings were associated with a significantly increased incidence of postoperative hemorrhage. In more than 90% of cases, postoperative hemorrhage occurred within 6 days of extraction. Thorough local hemostatic measures are therefore required in patients receiving warfarin therapy.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic management of acute dental pain in children: a report from the American dental association science and research institute, the university of Pittsburgh school of dental medicine, and the center for integrative global oral health at the university of Pennsylvania [^1177XgRG]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Acute dental pain in children — guideline scope and pharmacologic recommendations — address the pharmacologic management of acute dental pain after 1 or more tooth extractions and the temporary management of toothache when definitive dental treatment not immediately available in children (< 12 years). The panel formulated 7 recommendations and 5 good practice statements. Nonopioid medications, specifically nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen alone or in combination with acetaminophen, are recommended for managing acute dental pain and the temporary management of toothache in children (conditional recommendation, very low certainty), with a small beneficial net balance favoring nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone or in combination with acetaminophen compared with not providing analgesic therapy. There is no available evidence regarding the effect of corticosteroids on acute pain after surgical tooth extractions in children, and according to the US Food and Drug Administration, the use of codeine and tramadol in children for managing acute pain is contraindicated.

### Does platelet-rich fibrin prevent hemorrhagic complications after dental extractions in patients using oral anticoagulant therapy? [^114KZXv9]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The number of anticoagulated patients requiring dental extractions and other minor dentoalveolar surgical procedures has increased significantly. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) prevents hemorrhagic complications after dental extractions in patients being treated with oral anticoagulants.

Methods

A 2-phase PROSPERO-registered systematic review of published within-subject controlled trials (CRD42020186678) was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Searches were conducted through Medline via PubMed, Web of Science, LILACS, Central Cochrane, Scopus, DOSS, and Google Scholar, until May 2020. The predictor variable was the study group (PRF vs use/non-use of other hemostatic agents). The main outcome of interest was the risk of bleeding after tooth extraction and the covariates were postoperative complications. Data analysis included synthesis of results, risk of bias (RoB) evaluation, meta-analysis (random effects; I²-based heterogeneity; 95% confidence), and certainty of evidence assessment.

Results

From a total of 216 articles, 3 articles (low-moderate RoB) were included for evaluation in this systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of 130 patients were involved. The outcomes of the meta-analysis showed that the use of PRF in extraction wounds did not reduce the risk of bleeding after extraction in anticoagulated patients (P = 0.330; I² = 99%). Furthermore, the use of PRF did not improve pain scores (P = 0.470; I² = 96%) or the risk of postoperative alveolitis (P = 0.4300; I² = 38%) in anticoagulated patients. The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low.

Conclusions

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that PRF does not prevent hemorrhagic complications after tooth extraction in patients using oral anticoagulant therapy.

### Safety of dental extractions in coronary drug-eluting stenting patients without stopping multiple antiplatelet agents [^111FG9vf]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of excessive bleeding prompts physicians to stop multiple antiplatelet agents before minor surgery, which puts coronary stenting patients at risk for adverse thrombotic events.

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that most dental extractions can be carried out safely without stopping multiple antiplatelet agents.

Methods

All dental extraction patients who had undergone coronary stenting and who were also on oral multiple antiplatelet agents therapy were enrolled. One hundred patients underwent dental procedures without stopping antiplatelet agents. All wounds were sutured and followed up at 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 month after the procedure. There were 2233 patients who had not taken oral antiplatelet agents from a health promotion center and had teeth extracted by the same method. After performing propensity-score matching for the entire population, a total of 100 matched pairs of patients were created. The primary outcome was a composite of excessive intraextraction blood loss, transfusion, and rehospitalization for bleeding, and the secondary outcome was a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, and stent thrombosis within 1 month after the procedure.

Results

There were 2 excessive intraextraction bleeding cases that continued at the extraction site for 4 and 5 hours, respectively, in the coronary stenting patients, and 1 excessive intraextraction bleeding case that continued for 3 hours in the control patients. There were no cases of transfusion, rehospitalization for bleeding, or major cardiovascular events for the 2 propensity-matched groups.

Conclusions

We found that most dental extractions in coronary stenting patients can be carried out safely without stopping multiple antiplatelet agents.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of acute dental pain: postoperative pain after 1 or more simple or surgical Tooth extractions in children [^111meJmJ]. ADA (2024). High credibility.

Acute postoperative dental pain after simple or surgical tooth extractions in children — initial management is organized around an NSAID-first pathway when not contraindicated, with first line options labeled as "Option 1: Ibuprofen (suspension, tablet)" or "Option 2: Naproxen (> 2 y) (suspension, tablet)" or "Option 3: Combination of NSAID… and acetaminophen… ", while the contraindicated branch specifies acetaminophen alone; when NSAIDs are contraindicated, "the guideline panel suggests the use of acetaminophen alone (conditional, very low certainty)", and if pain control with an NSAID alone is inadequate, the pathway prompts "Add acetaminophen to the NSAID (option 3)", consistent with "the guideline panel suggests the addition of acetaminophen (conditional, very low certainty)". The scope applies to "children… undergoing 1 or more simple or surgical tooth extractions".

### Prasugrel versus clopidogrel: a Comparative examination of local bleeding after dental extraction in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy [^113fyJi4]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To study the effects of various parameters on local hemostasis after dental extraction in patients receiving different combinations of medications who had previously confirmed effective dual inhibition of platelet aggregation.

Materials and Methods

A total of 129 patients were enrolled. They underwent acute or planned percutaneous coronary intervention and their stomatological examination disclosed teeth that could have acted as foci and thus had to be removed. All patients took acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg and clopidogrel or prasugrel. Lidocaine with or without epinephrine was used for local anesthesia, and a gauze swab or suture was applied to help hemostasis.

Results

Bleeding time was significantly longer by an average of 10 minutes (+21%) in patients taking prasugrel (P < .05) compared with those taking clopidogrel. Use of a suture resulted in a significantly shorter bleeding time after anesthesia with or without epinephrine (P < .05). A considerably longer bleeding time was observed when anesthesia with no epinephrine was combined with gauze. In smokers, the bleeding time was shorter by 15% on average.

Conclusion

This study is the first to analyze differences in bleeding times between clopidogrel and prasugrel treatments during dental extraction. In general, prasugrel is associated with a considerably longer bleeding time; nevertheless, dental extraction can be performed safely with either combination.

### Ibuprofen (Ibu) [^1126NLeL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Ibuprofenhas been shown to be comparable to indomethacin in controlling thesigns and symptoms of disease activity and to be associated with astatistically significant reduction of the milder gastrointestinal (see ADVERSE REACTIONS) and CNS side effects.

Ibuprofen may be used in combination with gold salts and/or corticosteroids.

Controlled studies have demonstrated that Ibuprofen is a more effective analgesic than propoxyphene for the relief of episiotomy pain, pain following dental extraction procedures, and for the relief ofthe symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea.

In patients with primary dysmenorrhea, Ibuprofen has been shown to reduce elevated levels of prostaglandin activity in the menstrualfluid and to reduce resting and active intrauterine pressure, as well asthe frequency of uterine contractions. The probable mechanism ofaction is to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis rather than simply to provide analgesia.

Pharmacodynamics

In a healthy volunteer study, ibuprofen 400 mg given once daily, administered 2 hours prior to immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) for 6 days, showed an interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin as measured by % serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) inhibition at 24 hours following the day-6 aspirin dose [53%]. An interaction was still observed, but minimized, when ibuprofen 400 mg given once-daily was administered as early as 8 hours prior to the immediate-release aspirin dose [90.7%]. However, there was no interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin when ibuprofen 400 mg, given once daily, was administered 2 hours after (but not concomitantly, 15 min, or 30 min after) the immediate-release aspirin dose [99.2%].

### Hemostatic management of Tooth extractions in patients on oral antithrombotic therapy [^113iu1dt]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

We examined hemostatic management for tooth extraction in patients maintained on oral antithrombotic therapy.

Patients and Methods

Subjects comprised 270 patients, with 134 receiving warfarin alone, 49 receiving warfarin with additional antiplatelet drugs, and the remaining 87 receiving antiplatelet drugs alone. In patients administered warfarin alone, international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.5 to 1.99 in 67 patients, 2.0 to 2.49 in 42, 2.5 to 2.99 in 21, and 3.0 to 3.7 in 4. A total of 513 teeth were extracted on 306 occasions. All teeth were extracted without reducing the usual antithrombotic therapy, and oxidized cellulose was applied and suturing was performed for local hemostasis.

Results

Postoperative hemorrhage occurred in 11 of 306 occasions of tooth extractions (3.6%). These involved 7 patients on warfarin monotherapy and 2 on combination therapy with warfarin and antiplatelet drugs, with INR between 1.50 and 2.49. Incidence of postoperative hemorrhage was unrelated to INR, and no significant differences were identified between warfarin monotherapy and combination therapy. The remaining 2 patients who experienced hemorrhage were administered antiplatelet drugs alone.

Conclusion

A sufficient hemostasis can be obtained in most cases of tooth extraction under anticoagulant therapy with warfarin (INR < 3.0) and antiplatelet drugs. Moreover, appropriate local hemostatic methods can be successful when postoperative hemorrhage occurs.

### Corticosteroids for managing acute pain subsequent to surgical extraction of mandibular third molars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116GA7oQ]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Corticosteroids for managing acute pain subsequent to surgical extraction of mandibular third molars — systematic review scope and methods: The authors assessed the effect of corticosteroids on acute postoperative pain in patients undergoing surgical tooth extractions of mandibular third molars and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching the Epistemonikos database, including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the US clinical trials registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) from inception until April 2023. Pairs of reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, then identified potentially eligible full texts; after duplicate data abstraction, random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Risk of bias was assessed using Version 2 of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and certainty of the evidence was determined using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach; forty randomized controlled trials proved eligible.

### Ibuprofen (Ibupak) [^112tz7fv]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ibuprofen tablets have been shown to be comparable to indomethacin in controlling the signs and symptoms of disease activity and to be associated with a statistically significant reduction of the milder gastrointestinal (see ADVERSE REACTIONS) and CNS side effects.

Ibuprofen tablets may be used in combination with gold salts and/or corticosteroids.

Controlled studies have demonstrated that ibuprofen tablets are more effective analgesic than propoxyphene for the relief of episiotomy pain, pain following dental extraction procedures, and for the relief of the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea.

In patients with primary dysmenorrhea, ibuprofen tablets have been shown to reduce elevated levels of prostaglandin activity in the menstrual fluid and to reduce resting and active intrauterine pressure, as well as the frequency of uterine contractions. The probable mechanism of action is to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis rather than simply to provide analgesia.

Pharmacodynamics

In a healthy volunteer study, ibuprofen 400 mg given once daily, administered 2 hours prior to immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) for 6 days, showed an interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin as measured by % serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) inhibition at 24 hours following the day-6 aspirin dose [53%]. An interaction was still observed, but minimized, when ibuprofen 400 mg given once-daily was administered as early as 8 hours prior to the immediate-release aspirin dose [90.7%]. However, there was no interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin when ibuprofen 400 mg, given once daily, was administered 2 hours after (but not concomitantly, 15 min, or 30 min after) the immediate-release aspirin dose [99.2%].

### Tooth removed-simple and surgical: adolescents, adults, and older ages [^112hL3Nx]. ADA (2024). High credibility.

Acute dental pain — initial temporary management when NSAIDs are contraindicated — begins by asking "Are NSAIDs contraindicated?"; if yes, first-line options are acetaminophen at full therapeutic dose (e.g., 1,000 mg) or one tablet of 325 mg acetaminophen PLUS one tablet of combination 325 mg acetaminophen with an opioid (e.g., 5–7.5 mg hydrocodone or 5 mg oxycodone), with the goal to provide immediate in-visit pain relief then use shared decision-making to define post-visit pain relief while waiting for definitive dental treatment or referral to a dentist.

### The use of a chitosan-derived hemostatic agent for postextraction bleeding control in patients on antiplatelet treatment [^116Ppgyv]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The current approach for tooth extraction in patients receiving antiplatelet treatment requires the use of local hemostatic agents without previous thromboembolic treatment interruption. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an extra-alveolar hemostatic agent, the HemCon Dental Dressing (HDD), in controlling postsurgical bleeding.

Materials and Methods

Routine, atraumatic tooth extractions were performed in a single session under local anesthesia without a vasoconstrictor and without interruption of antiplatelet therapy. All patients underwent extraction of 2 teeth in the same session, with each in a different dental hemi-arch, and the hemostatic method to be used was randomly chosen: in the test site, the HDD was applied, whereas in the control site, a common hemostatic sponge (CollaPlug, Zimmer Dental) was applied and stabilized in situ with a suture. For each surgery, 2 different times were measured: the time required for hemostatic agent application and the time required for hemostasis achievement. Postoperative pain and healing quality also were evaluated.

Results

Twenty outpatients were enrolled. The mean application time was considerably shorter in the test group than in the control group; the mean bleeding time in the control group was considerably shorter than in the test group; pain values were lower in the test group than in the control group, especially at suture removal; and postextraction socket healing was better in the test group than in the control group.

Conclusion

HDD seems to be a valid and safe alternative in treating postextraction sockets in outpatients under single-drug antiplatelet treatment in the absence of surgical wound lacerations.

### Interventions for treating post-extraction bleeding [^114ggLUk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Post-extraction bleeding (PEB) is a recognised, frequently encountered complication in dental practice, which is defined as bleeding that continues beyond 8 to 12 hours after dental extraction. The incidence of post-extraction bleeding varies from 0% to 26%. If post-extraction bleeding is not managed, complications can range from soft tissue haematomas to severe blood loss. Local causes of bleeding include soft tissue and bone bleeding. Systemic causes include platelet problems, coagulation disorders or excessive fibrinolysis, and inherited or acquired problems (medication induced). There is a wide array of techniques suggested for the treatment of post-extraction bleeding, which include interventions aimed at both local and systemic causes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for treating different types of post-extraction bleeding.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 22 March 2016); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 2); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 22 March 2016); CINAHL via EBSCO (1937 to 22 March 2016). Due to the ongoing Cochrane project to search EMBASE and add retrieved clinical trials to CENTRAL, we searched only the last 11 months of EMBASE via OVID (1 May 2015 to 22 March 2016). We placed no further restrictions on the language or date of publication. We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/default.aspx). We also checked the reference lists of excluded trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any intervention for treating PEB, with male or female participants of any age, regardless of type of teeth (anterior or posterior, mandibular or maxillary). Trials could compare one type of intervention with another, with placebo, or with no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three pairs of review authors independently screened search records. We obtained full papers for potentially relevant trials. If data had been extracted, we would have followed the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for the statistical analysis.

Main Results

We did not find any randomised controlled trial suitable for inclusion in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to identify any reports of randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of different interventions for the treatment of post-extraction bleeding. In view of the lack of reliable evidence on this topic, clinicians must use their clinical experience to determine the most appropriate means of treating this condition, depending on patient-related factors. There is a need for well designed and appropriately conducted clinical trials on this topic, which conform to the CONSORT statement (www.consort-statement.org/).

Most patients with coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease are on long-term antiplatelet therapy and dual therapy. Achieving a balance between ischemic and bleeding risk remains an important factor in managing patients on antiplatelet therapy. For most outpatient surgical procedures, maintenance and continuation of this therapy are recommended. Consultation with the patient's cardiologist, physician, and/or vascular surgeon is always recommended before interrupting or withholding this treatment modality.

Acute postoperative dental pain after simple or surgical tooth extractions in children — initial analgesic approach: For children undergoing 1 or more simple or surgical tooth extractions, the guideline panel suggests initiating pain management using ibuprofen or naproxen (> 2 years), alone or either in combination with acetaminophen, over acetaminophen alone (conditional, very low certainty). If pain control with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone is inadequate, the guideline panel suggests the addition of acetaminophen (conditional, very low certainty). When nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are contraindicated, the guideline panel suggests acetaminophen alone (conditional, very low certainty). Children are defined as patients younger than 12 years.

### Management of antithrombotic agents during surgery or other kinds of medical procedures with bleeding: the MARK study [^112gHwt6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Optimal protocols for the management of antithrombotic agents during surgery have yet to be established, despite the growing use of antithrombotic therapy to treat or prevent cardiovascular diseases in the aging Japanese population. Previous reports have found that continuation of antithrombotic agents could result in bleeding complications during the periprocedural period, although the frequency and severity of such complications vary according to the type of procedure. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 The severity of thromboembolic events (TEs) is high and prognosis is poor when patients discontinue antithrombotic agents 6, 7; however, the frequency of TEs is low except in cases of surgically iatrogenic TEs, such as in cardiac surgery. 8, 9, 10, 11 Balancing the risk of TEs with the risk of bleeding events is difficult. We previously reported that intra‐arterial catheter procedures could be performed safely in patients who continue antithrombotic agents. 12 Consensus has been reached on the management of antithrombotic agents in limited fields for procedures with low bleeding risk, such as tooth extraction, 13, 14 ophthalmic surgery, 9, 15 and endoscopic procedures, 16, 17 but such agreement remains lacking in most fields, especially for procedures with high bleeding risk. 18 In many cases requiring high bleeding risk procedures, we consider each case individually in terms of the management of antithrombotic agents by comparing the risk of TEs and the risk of bleeding events. Heparin bridging therapy has been attempted for patients who discontinued antithrombotic agents, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation. Randomized controlled trials and meta‐analyses have shown that heparin bridging therapy increases the risk of bleeding events without decreasing the risk of TEs compared with nonheparin bridging. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 However, that evidence was mainly based on the results of studies for low‐molecular‐weight heparin, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 whereas data for unfractionated heparin (UFH), which is commonly used for heparin bridging therapy in Japan, remain limited. 26, 27 In addition, although patients have generally been given various antithrombotic agents over the course of years, the effects of these agents on periprocedural complications have not been studied sufficiently. We undertook this prospective, multicenter, observational study to clarify the present conditions and issues regarding the MARK (Management of Antithrombotic Agents During Surgery or Other Kinds of Medical Procedures With Bleeding) study.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic management of acute dental pain in children: a report from the American dental association science and research institute, the university of Pittsburgh school of dental medicine, and the center for integrative global oral health at the university of Pennsylvania [^114u39QT]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Clinical questions and interventions — the panel prioritized 2 areas (tooth extractions [surgical, simple] and toothache) for children without immediate access to definitive dental treatment; definitive dental treatment included pulpectomy, nonsurgical root canal treatment, incision and drainage of abscess, and tooth extraction. The panel selected opioid and nonopioid analgesic medications (for example, NSAIDs and acetaminophen) administered orally regardless of the vehicle or as a suppository, and corticosteroids administered orally at any dose or frequency; analgesics and corticosteroids administered intravenously are out of scope. Outcomes included pain relief, pain intensity, global subjective efficacy rating, rescue analgesia, and reported adverse effects. Data collection considered the sum of pain relief scores and summed pain intensity difference at observational time points (for example, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours… 6 hours).

### The effect of platelet-altering medications on bleeding from minor oral surgery procedures [^113UhfFn]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was performed to assess the extent of bleeding from minor oral surgical procedures in patients taking platelet-altering medications. They were compared with patients who were not taking platelet-altering medicines to assess differences in extent of blood loss.

Materials and Methods

A prospective observational study design was used to quantitatively assess the amount and severity of bleeding encountered with dentoalveolar surgery in 2 groups. The experimental group consisted of people taking therapeutic doses of platelet-altering medications, and the control group was composed of patients who had not taken a platelet-altering medication for at least 10 days prior to surgery. Surgical blood loss was measured, and the groups were compared for statistically significant differences in blood loss.

Results

There was no difference in blood loss detected between the experimental or control groups. No bleeding complications were encountered.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that patients on aspirin and NSAIDs can safely undergo routine minor outpatient oral surgical procedures without modification of their platelet-altering medication.

### Antibiotics to prevent complications following Tooth extractions [^112HWQmf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The most frequent indications for tooth extractions are dental caries and periodontal infections, and these extractions are generally done by general dental practitioners. Antibiotics may be prescribed to patients undergoing extractions to prevent complications due to infection.

Objectives

To determine the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the development of infectious complications following tooth extractions.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 25 January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1948 to 25 January 2012), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 25 January 2012) and LILACS via BIREME (1982 to 25 January 2012). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing tooth extraction(s) for any indication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for the included studies and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for further details where these were unclear. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For continuous outcomes we used mean differences (MD) with 95% CI using random-effects models. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity. The quality of the body of evidence has been assessed using the GRADE tool.

Main Results

This review included 18 double-blind placebo-controlled trials with a total of 2456 participants. Five trials were assessed at unclear risk of bias, thirteen at high risk, and none at low risk of bias. Compared to placebo, antibiotics probably reduce the risk of infection in patients undergoing third molar extraction(s) by approximately 70% (RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.50) P < 0.0001, 1523 participants, moderate quality evidence) which means that 12 people (range 10–17) need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent one infection following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. There is evidence that antibiotics may reduce the risk of dry socket by 38% (RR 0.62 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.95) P = 0.03, 1429 participants, moderate quality evidence) which means that 38 people (range 24–250) need to take antibiotics to prevent one case of dry socket following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. There is also some evidence that patients who have prophylactic antibiotics may have less pain (MD -8.17 (95% CI -11.90 to -4.45) P < 0.0001, 372 participants, moderate quality evidence) overall 7 days after the extraction compared to those receiving placebo, which may be a direct result of the lower risk of infection. There is no evidence of a difference between antibiotics and placebo in the outcomes of fever (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.99), swelling (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.30) or trismus (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.71) 7 days after tooth extraction. Antibiotics are associated with an increase in generally mild and transient adverse effects compared to placebo (RR 1.98 (95% CI 1.10 to 3.59) P = 0.02) which means that for every 21 people (range 8–200) who receive antibiotics, an adverse effect is likely.

Authors' Conclusions

Although general dentists perform dental extractions because of severe dental caries or periodontal infection, there were no trials identified which evaluated the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in this group of patients in this setting. All of the trials included in this review included healthy patients undergoing extraction of impacted third molars, often performed by oral surgeons. There is evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of infection, dry socket and pain following third molar extraction and result in an increase in mild and transient adverse effects. It is unclear whether the evidence in this review is generalisable to those with concomitant illnesses or immunodeficiency, or those undergoing the extraction of teeth due to severe caries or periodontitis. However, patients at a higher risk of infection are more likely to benefit from prophylactic antibiotics, because infections in this group are likely to be more frequent, associated with complications and be more difficult to treat. Due to the increasing prevalence of bacteria which are resistant to treatment by currently available antibiotics, clinicians should consider carefully whether treating 12 healthy patients with antibiotics to prevent one infection is likely to do more harm than good.

3.2. Assessment of validity of available data

All included trials met the fundamental requirements for validity for acute pain analgesic assessment (randomised, double-blind, adequate initial PI, standard pain measurement methods, 4–6 hours of duration, oral drug administration, adequate outcome reporting, plus checking for reporting inconsistencies, errors, or duplication). Two main questions regarding their validity for inclusion in the NMA remained. These were the effects of small study size, and whether there had been any temporal change in studies over the 5 decades covering the studies.

3.2.1. Small study size

The impact of small study size was investigated by examination of placebo responses in the most clinically homogeneous data set, the 168 individual studies that involved third molar extraction (and omitting 3 pooled analyses). Figure 1 shows the distribution of the percentage with at least 50% maximum PR related to the number of patients in the placebo arm. Overall, the proportion obtaining this level of PR with placebo was 12%, but with small individual studies, values could vary between 0% and 70%.

Figure 1.
Distribution of the percentage with at least 50% maximum pain relief related to the number of patients given placebo (red line shows overall average of 12%, N = 7882). Size of symbol indicates the number of patients (inset scale).

This finding is not new, but underscores the dangers when making comparisons with small amounts of data. This degree of numerical heterogeneity despite substantial clinical homogeneity is explained by the random play of chance with small numbers of actual events.,

3.2.2. Temporal changes

Again, the most clinically homogeneous third molar extraction data set was used to assess the presence and/or impact of any temporal changes. Looking at all the placebo responses (171 trials, 7882 patients given placebo), there was a reduction from over 15% in studies performed before 1990 to around 7% to those performed since 2010 (Fig. 2).

Figure 2.
Response rate with placebo over time.

Data for analgesics were not as readily available, as many different drugs and doses had been used in these trials. There were, however, sufficient data for ibuprofen acid 400 mg to examine whether there was any temporal change to the effect size. Table 3 shows the NNT calculations for ibuprofen acid 400 mg compared with placebo using only the studies with the direct comparison. It can be seen that results were consistent, with no trend of change in effect size.

Analgesics for acute pediatric dental pain — characteristics of included studies show that the number of participants randomized ranged from 45 through 201, and mean (SD) age across studies ranged from 5.5 (1.9) years through 9.3 (2.3) years. In all trials, participants underwent simple tooth extractions, and in one-half of the trials, participants also underwent surgical tooth extractions. No studies reported on the effect of analgesics for the management of irreversible pulpitis.

### Paracetamol for pain relief after surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth [^113kVSuA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Paracetamol has been commonly used for the relief of postoperative pain following oral surgery. In this review we investigated the optimal dose of paracetamol and the optimal time for drug administration to provide pain relief, taking into account the side effects of different doses of the drug. This will inform dentists and their patients of the best strategy for pain relief after the surgical removal of wisdom teeth.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of paracetamol for pain relief after surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth, compared to placebo, at different doses and administered postoperatively.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register; the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group's Trials Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE and the Current Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching included several dental journals. We checked the bibliographies of relevant clinical trials and review articles for studies outside the handsearched journals. We wrote to authors of the identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs), to manufacturers of analgesic pharmaceuticals, we searched personal references in an attempt to identify unpublished or ongoing RCTs. No language restriction was applied. The last electronic search was conducted on 24th August 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, parallel group, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trials of paracetamol for acute pain, following third molar surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

All trials identified were scanned independently and in duplicate by two review authors, any disagreements were resolved by discussion, or if necessary a third review author was consulted. The proportion of patients with at least 50% pain relief was calculated for both paracetamol and placebo. The number of patients experiencing adverse events, and/or the total number of adverse events reported were analysed.

Main Results

Twenty-one trials met the inclusion criteria. A total of 2048 patients were initially enrolled in the trials (1148 received paracetamol, and 892 the placebo) and of these 1968 (96%) were included in the meta-analysis (1133 received paracetamol, and 835 the placebo). Paracetamol provided a statistically significant benefit when compared with placebo for pain relief and pain intensity at both 4 and 6 hours. Most studies were found to have moderate risk of bias, with poorly reported allocation concealment being the main problem. Risk ratio values for pain relief at 4 hours 2.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89 to 4.29), and at 6 hours 3.32 (95% CI 1.88 to 5.87). A statistically significant benefit was also found between up to 1000 mg and 1000 mg doses, the higher the dose giving greater benefit for each measure at both time points. There was no statistically significant difference between the number of patients who reported adverse events, overall this being 19% in the paracetamol group and 16% in the placebo group.

Authors' Conclusions

Paracetamol is a safe, effective drug for the treatment of postoperative pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic management of acute dental pain in adolescents, adults, and older adults: a report from the American dental association science and research institute, the university of Pittsburgh, and the university of Pennsylvania [^113U4gRj]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2024). High credibility.

Acute dental pain after surgical tooth extraction(s) — non‑opioid regimens and escalation: For adolescents, adults, and older adults undergoing surgical tooth extraction(s), the panel suggests initiating post‑operative pain management using a nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drug (NSAID) alone (e.g., 400 mg ibuprofen or 440 mg naproxen sodium) or in combination with acetaminophen (e.g., 500 mg) (Conditional, Low certainty). If NSAIDs alone are inadequate, the panel suggests adding 325 mg acetaminophen plus a combination of 325 mg acetaminophen with an opioid (e.g., 5–7.5 mg hydrocodone or 5 mg oxycodone) at the lowest effective dose, fewest tablets, and the shortest duration, which rarely exceeds three days (Conditional, Low certainty). If NSAIDs with acetaminophen are inadequate, the panel suggests replacing the initial regimen with an NSAID (e.g., 400 mg ibuprofen or 440 mg naproxen sodium) and 325 mg acetaminophen plus a combination of 325 mg acetaminophen with an opioid (e.g., 5–7.5 mg hydrocodone or 5 mg oxycodone) at the lowest effective dose, fewest tablets, and the shortest duration, which rarely exceeds three days (Conditional, Low certainty). If NSAIDs are contraindicated, the panel suggests acetaminophen alone at the full therapeutic dose (e.g., 1,000 mg) or 325 mg acetaminophen supplemented by a primary prescription of 325 mg acetaminophen with an opioid (e.g., 5–7.5 mg hydrocodone or 5 mg oxycodone) at the lowest effective dose, fewest tablets, and the shortest duration, which rarely exceeds three days (Conditional, Low certainty). The panel suggests against adding gabapentin, submucosal, or intra‑muscular corticosteroid(s) to standard analgesic therapy (Conditional, Very low certainty).

### Antifibrinolytic therapy for preventing oral bleeding in people on anticoagulants undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions [^115kkJ3S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals on continuous treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are at increased risk of bleeding complications during and after oral or dental procedures. Anticoagulant treatment is preferably continued at the same dose, since dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. The use of haemostatic measures during or after the procedure (or both) could enable continuation of the oral anticoagulant treatment.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents for preventing bleeding complications in people on oral anticoagulants undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Additional searches were performed using ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the CINAHL database of nursing and allied health services, the open access ProQuest dissertation database, papers and reports from the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) and abstract books from annual scientific conferences. Date of last search: 04 January 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in people on continuous treatment with VKAs or DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures using antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid (TXA) or epsilon aminocaproic acid) to prevent perioperative bleeding compared to no intervention or usual care with or without placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified articles. Full texts were obtained from potentially relevant abstracts and two authors independently assessed these for inclusion based of the selection criteria. A third author verified trial eligibility. Two authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments using standardized forms. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

No eligible trials in people on continuous treatment with DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures were identified. Three randomised trials and one quasi-randomised trial (follow-up in all was seven days) in people on continuous treatment with VKAs were included with a total of 253 participants (mean age 60 years). Two trials published in 1989 and 1993 compared the antifibrinolytic agent TXA with placebo in people using VKAs. Two other trials were published in 1999 and 2015 and compared TXA with gelatin sponge and sutures, and dry gauze compression, respectively. In all included trials, those who were treated with VKAs had international normalised ratio (INR) values within the therapeutic range and TXA was applied locally, not systemically. The two trials from 1989 and 1993 comparing TXA with placebo showed a statistically significant beneficial effect regarding the number of major postoperative bleeding episodes requiring intervention, with a pooled risk difference (RD) of -0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.36 to -0.14) (128 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). For the two trials that compared TXA with either gelatin sponge and sutures or with dry gauze compression, there was no difference between the TXA and the standard care group, RD 0.02 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.11) (125 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). The combined RD of all included trials was -0.13 (95% CI -0.30 to 0.05) (moderate-quality evidence). There were no side effects of antifibrinolytic therapy that required treatment withdrawal (128 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). Despite heterogeneity between trials with respect to the different haemostatic measures used in the control groups, the trials were comparable regarding design and baseline participant characteristics. Overall, we considered the risk of bias to be low in the trials comparing TXA with placebo and moderate in the trials comparing TXA with alternative haemostatic measures.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the results of this Cochrane Review, there seems to be a beneficial effect of locally applied TXA in preventing oral bleeding in people on continuous treatment with VKAs undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions. However, the small number of identified randomised controlled trials, the relatively small number of participants included in the trials and the differences in standard therapy and treatment regimens between trials, do not allow us to conclude definite efficacy of antifibrinolytic therapy in this population. We were unable to identify any eligible trials in people on continuous treatment with DOACs undergoing oral or dental procedures. Therefore, a beneficial effect of antifibrinolytic therapy can currently only be assumed based on data from the people using VKAs.

### Ibuprofen and / or paracetamol (acetaminophen) for pain relief after surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth [^113ityvq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Both paracetamol and ibuprofen are commonly used analgesics for the relief of pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth (third molars). In 2010, a novel analgesic (marketed as Nuromol) containing both paracetamol and ibuprofen in the same tablet was launched in the United Kingdom, this drug has shown promising results to date and we have chosen to also compare the combined drug with the single drugs using this model. In this review we investigated the optimal doses of both paracetamol and ibuprofen via comparison of both and via comparison with the novel combined drug. We have taken into account the side effect profile of the study drugs. This review will help oral surgeons to decide on which analgesic to prescribe following wisdom tooth removal.

Objectives

To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of paracetamol, ibuprofen and the novel combination of both in a single tablet for pain relief following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth, at different doses and administered postoperatively.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group'sTrials Register (to 20 May 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 4); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 20 May 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 20 May 2013) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (to 20 May 2013). We checked the bibliographies of relevant clinical trials and review articles for further studies. We wrote to authors of the identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and searched personal references in an attempt to identify unpublished or ongoing RCTs. No language restriction was applied to the searches of the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled double-blinded clinical trials were included. Cross-over studies were included provided there was a wash out period of at least 14 days. There had to be a direct comparison in the trial of two or more of the trial drugs at any dosage. All trials used the third molar pain model.

Data Collection and Analysis

All trials identified were scanned independently and in duplicate by two review authors, any disagreements were resolved by discussion, or if necessary a third review author was consulted. The proportion of patients with at least 50% pain relief (based on total pain relief (TOTPAR) and summed pain intensity difference (SPID) data) was calculated for all three drugs at both two and six hours postdosing and meta-analysed for comparison. The proportion of participants using rescue medication over both six and eight hours was also collated and compared. The number of patients experiencing adverse events or the total number of adverse events reported or both were analysed for comparison.

Main Results

Seven studies were included, they were all parallel-group studies, two studies were assessed as at low risk of bias and three at high risk of bias; two were considered to have unclear bias in their methodology. A total of 2241 participants were enrolled in these trials. Ibuprofen was found to be a superior analgesic to paracetamol at several doses with high quality evidence suggesting that ibuprofen 400 mg is superior to 1000 mg paracetamol based on pain relief (estimated from TOTPAR data) and the use of rescue medication meta-analyses. The risk ratio for at least 50% pain relief (based on TOTPAR) at six hours was 1.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 1.69; five trials) favouring 400 mg ibuprofen over 1000 mg paracetamol, and the risk ratio for not using rescue medication (also favouring ibuprofen) was 1.50 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.79; four trials). The combined drug showed promising results, with a risk ratio for at least 50% of the maximum pain relief over six hours of 1.77 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.39) (paracetamol 1000 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg) (one trial; moderate quality evidence), and risk ratio not using rescue medication 1.60 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.88) (two trials; moderate quality evidence). The information available regarding adverse events from the studies (including nausea, vomiting, headaches and dizziness) indicated that they were comparable between the treatment groups. However, we could not formally analyse the data as it was not possible to work out how many adverse events there were in total.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high quality evidence that ibuprofen is superior to paracetamol at doses of 200 mg to 512 mg and 600 mg to 1000 mg respectively based on pain relief and use of rescue medication data collected at six hours postoperatively. The majority of this evidence (five out of six trials) compared ibuprofen 400 mg with paracetamol 1000 mg, these are the most frequently prescribed doses in clinical practice. The novel combination drug is showing encouraging results based on the outcomes from two trials when compared to the single drugs.

### Hemostatic mouthwashes in anticoagulated patients undergoing dental extraction [^112DNj8S]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of local acting hemostatic agents in patients who are undergoing dental extraction(s) and are taking oral anticoagulants.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1966-July 2006), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-July 2006), and EMBASE (1966-July 2006) was conducted using the key terms anticoagulation, warfarin, hemostatic mouthwashes, epsilon aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, dental extraction, and oral surgery. Bibliographies of relevant papers were reviewed for additional references.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language literature, including abstracts, clinical trials, and review articles, were reviewed. Clinical trials were included if they evaluated hemostatic mouthwashes in patients receiving continued anticoagulation and undergoing dental extractions or various oral surgeries including dental extraction. Eight clinical trials met study selection criteria for evaluation of hemostatic mouthwashes in anticoagulated patients undergoing dental extraction. Eight studies evaluated tranexamic acid; one assessed epsilon aminocaproic acid. All studies were reviewed for efficacy and safety of hemostatic mouthwashes and intensity of continued anticoagulation therapy.

Data Synthesis

Eight small studies enrolled populations that varied in the indications for oral anticoagulation (OA), target INR ranges, and oral surgeries performed. Patients receiving uninterrupted OA and using hemostatic mouthwashes had no greater and, in some cases, lesser bleeding incidence compared with various other treatment groups (including interrupted OA, uninterrupted OA, autologous fibrin glue with uninterrupted OA, and reduced OA with heparin bridge). No severe adverse effects were reported. No studies assessed the risk of thromboembolism between the different treatment strategies.

Conclusions

Findings in recent studies indicate that dental extractions in anticoagulated patients can be performed without temporary discontinuation of oral anticoagulant therapy with the use of hemostatic mouthwashes to control localized bleeding. This practice should be more widely adopted due to minimized bleeding and thromboembolic risks.

### Postoperative bleeding after dentoalveolar surgery in patients with thrombocytopenia-are prophylactic platelet transfusions necessary? [^113dnPgV]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Exclusion criteria were other known coagulation deficiencies and anticoagulant medications that would affect primary hemostasis, secondary hemostasis, or fibrinolysis, (including NSAIDs). Patients with a PLT count taken more than 10 days prior to dentoalveolar surgery were also excluded. A patient was regarded as having been given a prophylactic PLT transfusion if it had been administered within 24 h of surgery.

Number of teeth extracted at each visit was recorded, as was the dental diagnosis that was set before any tooth extraction or other dentoalveolar surgery. Dental diagnoses were classified as periodontitis, symptomatic/asymptomatic apical periodontitis, symptomatic/asymptomatic pulpitis and/or fracture, pericoronitis, and other (biopsy and alveoloplasty). Data on type of dentoalveolar surgery were collected in two groups: (1) non-surgical or surgical removal of one tooth (including biopsy and alveoloplasty) and (2) non-surgical and/or surgical removal of ≥ two teeth. When multiple teeth were extracted at the same session, whether teeth were adjacent to each other was noted.

Use of local hemostatic treatment was recorded as a single use or as a combination of the following: resorbable sutures (Vicryl™, Ethicon Inc. Somerville, NJ, USA), resorbable products (Spongostan™ and Surgicel™, Ethicon Inc.; or Lyostypt®, Braun Medical Inc. Bethlehem, PA, USA), and local application of tranexamic acid 100 mg/ml (Cyklokapron®, Pfizer Inc. New York, NY, USA).

POB events were recorded and defined as difficulties achieving primary hemostasis perioperative or if the patient contacted an Orofacial Medicine Department, a Public Dental Service Emergency Clinic, or a Hematology Department within 48 h after surgery to report unexpected bleeding complications and was in need of a clinical intervention.

### Corticosteroids for managing acute pain subsequent to surgical extraction of mandibular third molars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162erNu]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Corticosteroids versus placebo after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars — effects on pain and complications: The evidence suggested that corticosteroids compared with a placebo provided a trivial reduction in pain intensity measured 6 hours (mean difference, 8.79 points lower; 95% CI, 14.8 to 2.77 points lower; low certainty) and 24 hours after surgical tooth extraction (mean difference, 8.89 points lower; 95% CI, 10.71 to 7.06 points lower; very low certainty). The authors found no important difference between corticosteroids and a placebo with regard to incidence of postoperative infection (risk difference, 0%; 95% CI, −1% to 1%; low certainty) and alveolar osteitis (risk difference, 0%; 95% CI, −3% to 4%; very low certainty). Low and very low certainty evidence suggests that there is a trivial difference regarding postoperative pain intensity and adverse effects of corticosteroids administered orally, submucosally, or intramuscularly compared with a placebo in patients undergoing third-molar extractions.

Systematic review — purpose and methods: The purpose of this systematic review (SR) was to determine the effect of corticosteroids administered orally, submucosally, or intramuscularly on pain after surgical tooth extraction, including impacted mandibular third-molar extractions. The article follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and included randomized controlled trials comparing corticosteroids versus placebo in adolescent, adult, or older adult participants undergoing surgical third-molar extraction with the need of a flap and osteotomy. Continuous outcomes were pain intensity at 6 hours, pain at 24 hours, total pain relief at 6 hours, and global efficacy rating at 6 hours; dichotomous outcomes included adverse effects such as postoperative surgical site infection, alveolar osteitis, mood alteration, and gastrointestinal adverse effect at any time. Studies were excluded if corticosteroids were administered intravenously or if they only reported outcomes related to inflammatory complications. The evidence search was performed in 2 steps, beginning with searches in the Epistemonikos database.

EFFECT OF LOCAL TRANEXAMIC ACID IN SOFT-TISSUE SURGERY

Literature Search Strategy and Study Selection

With assistance from a Medical Research Librarian, we searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, The Web of Science Core Collection, Google Scholar, andfrom inception through March 20, 2020, for studies comparing the effect of local administration of tranexamic acid in surgery to either placebo or standard of care. The full electronic search strategy is provided in the Appendix. (See Appendix, Supplemental Digital Content 1, which shows the search strategy systematic review from March 20, 2020,.) Search result and selection process are presented in Figure 2. Two authors (K. A. and R.F.) independently reviewed the retrieved results using the following inclusion criteria: (1) study population receiving local use of tranexamic acid in connection with a surgical procedure, (2) human studies, and (3) abstract or full-text article published. Orthopedic or cardiac studies and minor procedures, such as dental extractions or biopsies, were excluded. A full-text review of remaining publications was performed, and reference lists of relevant publications were screened. Randomized controlled trials were identified for final analyses for the systematic review. Other studies were included for the narrative review.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111cofxs]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Periprocedural bridging anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) — The BRIDGE trial randomized 1884 patients with AF or AFL to bridging anticoagulation before and after the procedure with dalteparin versus placebo, and no bridging was superior to bridging with respect to major bleeding and was noninferior with respect to thromboembolism, with the observed rate (0.4%) lower than anticipated (1.0%). Almost 90% of patients were undergoing low bleeding risk procedures. In PERIOP2, 79% had AF and patients were randomized to postoperative bridging with dalteparin or placebo until the INR was > 1.9; all patients received preoperative bridging, and bleeding and thromboembolism outcomes were similar. Additional studies reported dental extractions performed on uninterrupted warfarin without bridging and a large multicenter registry found no difference in thromboembolism but an increase in bleeding in bridged patients.

### Antifibrinolytic therapy for preventing oral bleeding in patients with haemophilia or von Willebrand disease undergoing minor oral surgery or dental extractions [^113yKv8e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Minor oral surgery or dental extractions (oral or dental procedures) are widely performed and can be complicated by hazardous oral bleeding, especially in people with an inherited bleeding disorder such as haemophilia or Von Willebrand disease (VWD). The amount and severity of singular bleedings depend on disease-related factors, such as the severity of the haemophilia, both local and systemic patient factors (such as periodontal inflammation, vasculopathy or platelet dysfunction) and intervention-related factors (such as the type and number of teeth extracted or the dimension of the wound surface). Similar to local haemostatic measures and suturing, antifibrinolytic therapy is a cheap, safe and potentially effective treatment to prevent bleeding complications in individuals with bleeding disorders undergoing oral or dental procedures. However, a systematic review of trials reporting outcomes after oral surgery or a dental procedure in people with an inherited bleeding disorder, with or without, the use of antifibrinolytic agents has not been performed to date. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.

Objectives

Primarily, we aim to assess the efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents to prevent bleeding complications in people with haemophilia or VWD undergoing oral or dental procedures. Secondary objectives are to assess if antifibrinolytic agents can replace or reduce the need for clotting factor concentrate therapy in people with haemophilia or VWD and to establish the effects of these agents on bleeding in oral or dental procedures for each of these patient populations.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), of MEDLINE and from handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We additionally searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cinahl and the Cochrane Library. Additional searches were performed in ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Date of last search of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 01 March 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in people with haemophilia or VWD undergoing oral or dental procedures using antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA)) to prevent perioperative bleeding compared to no intervention or usual care with or without placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified articles. Full texts were obtained for potentially relevant abstracts and two authors independently assessed these for inclusion based on the selection criteria. A third author verified trial eligibility. Two authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments using standardised forms.

Main Results

While there were no eligible trials in people with VWD identified, two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (total of 59 participants) in people with haemophilia undergoing dental extraction were included. One trial of tranexamic acid published in 1972 included 28 participants with mild, moderate or severe haemophilia A and B and one of EACA published in 1971 included 31 people with haemophilia with factor VIII or factor IX levels less than 15%. Overall, the two included trials showed a beneficial effect of tranexamic acid and EACA, administered systemically, in reducing the number of bleedings, the amount of blood loss and the need for therapeutic clotting factor concentrates. Regarding postoperative bleeding, the tranexamic acid trial showed a risk difference (RD) of -0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.93 to - 0.36) and the EACA trial a RD of -0.50 (95% CI 0.77 to -0.22). The combined RD of both trials was -0.57 (95% CI -0.76 to -0.37), with the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for this outcome is rated as moderate. Side effects occurred once and required stopping EACA (combined RD of -0.03 (95% CI -0.08 to 0.13). There was heterogeneity between the two trials regarding the proportion of people with severe haemophilia included, the concomitant standard therapy and fibrinolytic agent treatment regimens used. We cannot exclude that a selection bias has occurred in the EACA trial, but overall the risk of bias appeared to be low for both trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the discovery of a beneficial effect of systemically administered tranexamic acid and EACA in preventing postoperative bleeding in people with haemophilia undergoing dental extraction, the limited number of randomised controlled trials identified, in combination with the small sample sizes and heterogeneity regarding standard therapy and treatment regimens between the two trials, do not allow us to conclude definite efficacy of antifibrinolytic therapy in oral or dental procedures in people with haemophilia. No trials were identified in people with VWD.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^1163MBVW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

As a personal history of previous bleeding may be associated with a higher bleeding risk, further details should be sought to establish context. For example, prior procedural bleeding will be more relevant than a prior history of variceal bleed (as this is secondary to portal hypertension rather than hemostatic impairment as discussed above). Renal impairment is associated with higher post paracentesis bleeding but not specifically reported in relation to dental extractions. The use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are associated with increased risk of bleeding but are not relevant to this case.

Whilst INR and thrombocytopenia may indicate an increased bleeding risk in the absence of cirrhosis, as discussed above, neither have been consistently demonstrated to predict procedural bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. One series desribed a small observational cohort (n = 23 patients, 84 dental extractions over 35 procedures), including patients with platelet count > 30 000/µl (range 31–160) and INR < 3 (range 0.98–2.5). One postoperative bleed (2.9%) was observed despite a platelet count of < 50 000/µl in 34% of procedures and INR > 2 in 9%. All patients were managed with post procedural gauze compression.

Dental procedures should be performed in settings with access to local hemostatic measures including socket packing and suturing. Topical TXA (soaked gauze/mouthwash) are advocated by some but there is no specific evidence of reduced bleeding. All patients should be given general advice to minimize delayed bleeding and when to seek further dental /medical attention.

There are few studies investigating systemic therapy to reduce bleeding in dental extractions. A small study randomized patients with cirrhosis and platelet count 30–50 000/µl and/or INR 2–3, to either intranasal desmopressin vs FFP and/or platelet transfusion prior to dental extraction. Of 36 patients randomized and receiving the planned intervention, there was no significant difference in bleeding between groups (with a single bleed in the transfusion arm) but the study was underpowered to show a difference between treatments and should thus be interpreted cautiously. A further study investigating laboratory parameters in patients with cirrhosis who received DDAVP infusion found no effect on platelet adhesion, further questioning this approach.

### Estimates of benefits and harms of prophylactic use of aspirin in the general population [^117RXEuZ]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence supports an effect of aspirin in reducing cancer incidence and mortality. Our analyses show that prophylactic aspirin use for a minimum of 5 years at doses between 75 and 325 mg/day appears to have favourable benefit–harm profile; longer use is likely to have greater benefits. Further research is needed to determine the optimum dose and duration of use.

### Randomized, prospective trial comparing bridging therapy using low-molecular-weight heparin with maintenance of oral anticoagulation during extraction of teeth [^112Vmzsc]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate postoperative bleeding and thromboembolic complications during dental extractions in anticoagulated patients, using 2 different protocols.

Patients and Methods

In total, 214 anticoagulated patients in need of simple dental extractions were randomized into 2 groups. Group A consisted of 109 patients on continuous oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT), with a mean international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.45 ± 0.54. Local hemostasis in these patients was achieved with resorbable collagen sponges, without wound suturing. Group B consisted of 105 patients on bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (nadroparin-calcium), with a mean INR of 1.26 ± 0.11 on the day of the procedure. Neither local hemostatic agents nor suturing of the wound was used in these patients.

Results

Eight (7.34%) patients in group A and 5 (4.76%) patients in group B manifested postextractional bleeding, without statistical significance (chi(2), Yates' = 0.253, P > .05). All cases of hemorrhage were mild and easily controlled using local hemostatic measures. None of the participants in either group experienced thromboembolic complications.

Conclusions

In patients receiving OAT with an INR ≤ 4.0, simple dental extractions can be performed safely without interruption or modification of OAT, using local hemostatic measures. Suturing of the wound should be reserved for cases with a greater extent of surgical trauma, and when primary hemostasis is insufficient. There is no need for bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin in patients undergoing minor dentoalveolar procedures, although this approach can be used in patients with major oral surgical interventions.

### Dental extraction in the thrombocytopenic patient is safe and complications are easily managed [^117Wr9ZT]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To characterize bleeding risk and management of bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients undergoing dental extraction.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 68 patients with hematologic disease and concomitant thrombocytopenia undergoing dental extractions. The inclusion criterion was a platelet count of 100,000/μL or less at the time of consultation or extraction. Patients using anticoagulation therapy were excluded from the study. Predictors measured were age, gender, platelet count, platelet transfusion before or during surgery, local hemostatic measurements at the time of surgery (absorbable hemostat or antifibrinolytic rinse), number of teeth extracted, diagnosis, and extraction type. The primary outcome was postoperative bleeding requiring intervention. A secondary outcome was surgical site infection. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed and the P value was set at .05. No logistic regression was used based on the distribution of outcomes.

Results

Sixty-eight patients underwent extraction of 200 teeth. Five (7.4%) had postoperative bleeding that was always controlled with routine intervention. Mean platelet count was 44,647/μL. Bleeding was more frequent with lower platelet levels (P = 0.048). Thirty-two patients received platelet transfusion and 26 received local measures. Platelet transfusion and local hemostatic measures had no effect on bleeding outcomes.

Conclusion

Surgical and routine extractions are safe procedures in patients with thrombocytopenia, and postoperative bleeding is typically well handled with simple local measures. The benefits of pre- or intraoperative platelet transfusion are unclear in this population. Likewise, the benefit of prophylactic local hemostatic measures is unclear and should be based on the surgeon's discretion and experience.

### Comparison of the effects of warfarin and heparin on bleeding caused by dental extraction: a clinical study [^112TYSCM]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Replacement of warfarin with heparin for dental extractions in patients on long-term warfarin therapy is associated with wasted time, consumed labor, and increased treatment expenses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of dental extraction without altering the warfarin regimen in patients with an international normalized ratio from 1 to 4.

Patients and Methods

Forty patients who underwent tooth extraction were divided into 4 groups: continuation of warfarin without interruption (group 1), warfarin bridged with low-molecular-weight heparin (group 2), warfarin bridged with unfractionated heparin (group 3), and a control group of healthy individuals (group 4). Total amount of bleeding (milligrams) was measured for 20 minutes after tooth extraction. International normalized ratio values on the operative day and number of extra gauze swabs used for bleeding control in the first 48 hours were recorded for each patient. Results were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance, Fisher least-significant difference post hoc test, Pearson correlation, χ(2) test, and Student t test.

Results

Mean amounts of bleeding were 2,486 ± 1,408; 999 ± 425; 1,288 ± 982; and 1,736 ± 876 mg for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. There was no severe postoperative bleeding in any patient and the number of used extra gauze swabs did not differ significantly among groups.

Conclusion

With the aid of local hemostatic agents, dental extraction in patients receiving warfarin who have an international normalized ratio from 1 to 4 could be carried out without a significant risk of bleeding and without altering the anticoagulant regimen.

### Analgesics for the management of acute dental pain in the pediatric population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111b3CeE]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis methods for pediatric acute dental pain — objective, eligibility, and search strategy: The objective of this SR and meta-analysis was to assess the comparative effectiveness of analgesic treatments for the management of pain after dental extraction (simple and surgical tooth extraction) and irreversible pulpitis in the pediatric population (≤ 12 years). The review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness of any analgesic treatment against another analgesic or a placebo, except for treatments administered intravenously, in patients 12 years or younger undergoing simple or surgical tooth extraction or experiencing irreversible pulpitis; it included any outcome of effectiveness and safety and limited inclusion to peer-reviewed articles published in English. Methods followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist, were not registered, and used preestablished methodology from a guideline development plan. Searches were performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the US Clinical Trials registry from inception through November 2020 using a combination of key and free terms and a filter for RCTs. All decisions regarding the eligibility criteria were made by the panel of experts including dentists and dental surgeons with professional experience in the management of acute dental pain to create an updated clinical practice guideline for the management of acute dental pain in children.

Patients having a minor dental, dermatologic, or ophthalmologic procedure — antiplatelet continuation evidence and question: The PICO asks whether antiplatelet drugs should be continued vs stopping antiplatelet drugs 7 to 10 days before the procedure. For minor dental procedures, small (< 100 patients) randomized trials and cohort studies suggest no increase in major bleeding with ASA continuation. For minor skin procedures, prospective cohort studies totaling about 200 patients suggest a low (< 1%) risk for major bleeding with continuation of ASA. For phacoemulsification (cataract) surgery, prospective cohort studies have suggested a low (< 1%) incidence of major bleeding with perioperative ASA continuation. For eyelid surgery, one 42-patient randomized trial compared ASA continuation with no perioperative ASA use and reported no significant effect on bleeding or thromboembolic outcomes. For skin procedures, one meta-analysis of two randomized trials and 28 observational studies totaling > 14,000 patients found no significant increase in bleeding with perioperative ASA continuation.

### Caffeine as an analgesic adjuvant for acute pain in adults [^113v8akq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2012. Caffeine has been added to common analgesics such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin, in the belief that it enhances analgesic efficacy. Evidence to support this belief is limited and often based on invalid comparisons.

Objectives

To assess the relative efficacy of a single dose of an analgesic plus caffeine against the same dose of the analgesic alone, without restriction on the analgesic used or the pain condition studied. We also assessed serious adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 28 August 2014, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and also carried out Internet searches and contacted pharmaceutical companies known to have carried out trials that have not been published.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies that compared a single dose of analgesic plus caffeine with the same dose of the analgesic alone in the treatment of acute pain.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of studies, and extracted data. Any disagreements or uncertainties were settled by discussion with a third review author. We sought any validated measure of analgesic efficacy, but particularly the number of participants experiencing at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over four to six hours, participants reporting a global evaluation of treatment of very good or excellent, or headache relief after two hours. We pooled comparable data to look for a statistically significant difference, and calculated numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) with caffeine. We also looked for any numerical superiority associated with the addition of caffeine, and information about any serious adverse events.

Main Results

We identified no new studies with available results for this update. The earlier review included 20 studies (7238 participants) in valid comparisons, but because we used different outcomes for some headache studies, the number of participants in the analyses of the effects of caffeine is now 4262 when previously it was 5243. The studies were generally of good methodological quality, using standard designs and mostly standard scales of pain measurement, although many of those treating postoperative pain were small. Most studies used paracetamol or ibuprofen, with 100 mg to 130 mg caffeine, and the most common pain conditions studied were postoperative dental pain, postpartum pain, and headache. There was a small but statistically significant benefit with caffeine used at doses of 100 mg or more, which was not dependent on the pain condition or type of analgesic. About 5% to 10% more participants achieve a good level of pain relief (at least 50% of the maximum over four to six hours) with the addition of caffeine, giving a NNT of about 14 (high quality evidence). Most comparisons individually demonstrated numerical superiority with caffeine, but not statistical superiority. One serious adverse event was reported with caffeine, but was considered unrelated to any study medication. We know of the existence of around 25 additional studies with almost 12,500 participants for which data for analysis were not obtainable. The additional analgesic effect of caffeine remained statistically significant but clinically less important even if all the known missing data had no effect; the bulk of the unobtainable data are reported to have similar results as this review.

Authors' Conclusions

The addition of caffeine (≥ 100 mg) to a standard dose of commonly used analgesics provides a small but important increase in the proportion of participants who experience a good level of pain relief.

### Multivariate decoding of cerebral blood flow measures in a clinical model of on-going postsurgical pain [^115kd2fZ]. Human Brain Mapping (2015). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants

Twenty right‐handed, healthy, male volunteers aged 20–34 (mean age = 26.18 years) provided written, informed consent to participate in the study. Female participants were excluded due to possible variability induced by the phase of the menstrual cycle on postsurgical pain [Teepker et al. 2010]. All participants presented with bilateral recurrent pericoronitis and fulfilled NICE (2000) guidelines for extraction of lower‐jaw left and right third molars. The study was approved by King's College Hospital NHS Research ethics committee (07/H0808/115).

Experimental Design

Participants visited on six separate occasions (S1–S6); screening/familiarisation (S1), presurgical (S2), and postsurgical sessions (S3) for the first extraction, presurgical (S4) and postsurgical (S5) sessions for the second extraction, and a final follow‐up session (S6). A minimum ten day interval separated S3/S4 and S5/S6, assuring complete recovery from each surgery. The order of left and right tooth extraction was balanced and pseudorandomized across the group. The study design is illustrated in Figure 1 a. Patients' vitals were recorded before each session (i.e. pulse rate and blood pressure), in addition to an alcohol/drug‐screen and a psychometric assessment (the reader is directed to [Howard et al. 2011] for further detail on design and psychometry). Analgesic medication (1000 mg paracetamol and 400 mg ibuprofen) was available to participants immediately only following postsurgical scanning.

### Efficacy and safety of additional 200-mg dose of celecoxib in adult patients with postoperative pain following extraction of impacted third mandibular molar: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study in Japan [^1122QyKP]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although third mandibular molar extraction is a widely used and validated model of acute pain for evaluating analgesic efficacy, a large proportion of patients experience moderate or severe pain following this procedure and require analgesia. Current treatment options have been associated with safety concerns and alternative therapies are sought.

Objective

Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of an additional 200-mg dose of celecoxib, administered 5 to 12 hours after an initial 400-mg dose of the drug for the treatment of moderate or severe acute pain following extraction of an impacted third mandibular molar.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II study. Patients experiencing moderate or severe pain within 1 to 2 hours following extraction of an impacted third mandibular molar received an initial 400-mg dose of celecoxib. Patients requiring additional analgesia were subsequently randomized to receive either an additional 200-mg dose of celecoxib or placebo 5 to 12 hours after the initial dose. The study was designed and conducted by Pfizer Inc. for approval of celecoxib in Japan for the indication of acute pain. The primary end point was the patient's impression of efficacy (4-category global evaluation scale). Secondary efficacy end points included pain intensity on a 4-category pain intensity scale, pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), and the pain intensity difference (100-mm VAS). In an exploratory analysis, use of rescue medication was evaluated. Primary and secondary end points were analyzed using the full analysis set. Assessment of the safety profile included a physical examination, measurement of pulse rate and blood pressure, standard 12-lead ECG, and laboratory tests.

Results

A total of 69 patients (celecoxib, 42/64 [65.6%]; placebo, 27/58 [46.6%]) received the additional dose of study medication; all completed the study without the need for rescue medication. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the celecoxib 200 mg group (41/64 [64.1%]) compared with the placebo group (15/58 [25.9%]) rated the study medication as "good" or "excellent" ≥ 2 hours after the additional dose (P < 0.0001). Pain intensity (VAS) 2 hours after the additional dose was significantly higher in the placebo group than in the celecoxib 200 mg group (P = 0.0003). The reduction in pain intensity from baseline to 2 hours after the additional dose of study medication was also significantly greater in the celecoxib 200 mg group than in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). The incidence of treatment-related, all-cause adverse events was slightly lower in patients receiving celecoxib 200 mg (20.3%) compared with placebo (31.0%).

Conclusions

Overall, an additional 200-mg dose of celecoxib was well tolerated and efficacious in reducing the pain associated with extraction of an impacted third mandibular molar in the study population. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01062113.

### Evolution of clinical thinking and practice regarding aspirin: what has changed and why? [^112Q278A]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) is the original antiplatelet agent. Its routine use, long unquestioned for both primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease, is under increasing scrutiny as the risk:benefit balance for ASA becomes less clear and other disease- and risk-modifying approaches are validated. It can be viewed as a significant advance in evidence-based medicine that the use of an inexpensive, readily available, long-validated therapy is being questioned in large, rigorous trials. In this overview we present the important questions surrounding a more informed approach to ASA therapy: duration of therapy, assessment of net clinical benefit, and timing of start and stop strategies. We also consider potential explanations for "breakthrough" thrombosis when patients are on ASA therapy. Other manuscripts in this Supplement address the specifics of primary prevention, secondary prevention, triple oral antithrombotic therapy, and the future of ASA in cardiovascular medicine.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: management of individuals with bleeding or thrombotic disorders undergoing abortion [^1164tPcr]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin and antiplatelet therapy during abortion — continuation and consultation — are addressed. In general, aspirin therapy does not increase the level of severity of bleeding complications or perioperative mortality related to bleeding complications, and Clinical recommendations endorse continuation of aspirin in the setting of low-risk or dental procedures; we recommend that aspirin be continued during a first-trimester procedural abortion. Peri-operative management of individuals on combination antiplatelet therapy should be discussed in consultation with the pertinent specialist to determine if discontinuation is appropriate, and consultation with a hematologist is appropriate; consultation may be particularly appropriate for individuals at high risk for thrombophilia, those already on anticoagulation (particularly therapeutic levels), those who may have a coagulopathy, or individuals undergoing a more complex procedural abortion.

Data extraction

From each study included in the analysis, we extracted information about the antiplatelet treatment group, the control treatment group, the definition of each clinical outcome, the definition of smoking subgroups, the number of patients in each smoking category, and hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for each subgroup specific effect, or the information required to calculate these. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess whether studies were at low, high, or unclear risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, or reporting bias. Protocols and design and rationale papers associated with each study were consulted as needed when available. Two authors (JJG and KB) independently performed all data extraction in duplicate and discrepancies were discussed until agreement was met.

### Dental surgery and antiplatelet agents: bleed or die [^115HxpV6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In patients taking antiplatelet medications who are undergoing dental surgery, physicians and dentists must weigh the bleeding risks in continuing antiplatelet medications versus the thrombotic risks in interrupting antiplatelet medications. Bleeding complications requiring more than local measures for hemostasis are rare after dental surgery in patients taking antiplatelet medications. Conversely, the risk for thrombotic complications after interruption of antiplatelet therapy for dental procedures apparently is significant, although small. When a clinician is faced with a decision to continue or interrupt antiplatelet therapy for a dental surgical patient, the decision comes down to "bleed or die". That is, there is a remote chance that continuing antiplatelet therapy will result in a (nonfatal) bleeding problem requiring more than local measures for hemostasis versus a small but significant chance that interrupting antiplatelet therapy will result in a (possibly fatal) thromboembolic complication. The decision is simple: It is time to stop interrupting antiplatelet therapy for dental surgery.

### Minor oral surgery without stopping daily low-dose aspirin therapy: a study of 51 patients [^113Sp4KP]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The risk of excessive bleeding prompts physicians to stop low-dose long-term aspirin regimens before surgery, which puts the patient at risk from adverse thrombotic events. We hypothesize that most minor oral surgical procedures can be carried out safely without stopping low-dose aspirin.

Patients and Methods

All minor oral surgery patients at our hospital (Madan Dental Hospital, Ahmedabad, India) from May 2002 to May 2003, who were also on long-term low-dose aspirin therapy regimens (acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg to 100 mg/day), were included. Investigation of bleeding time and platelet count was performed. If within normal limits, aspirin was not stopped before surgery. Patients were operated under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis. All wounds were sutured and followed up at 24, 48, and 72 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks after the procedure.

Results

The study included 51 patients (32 males, 19 females), ranging in age from 45 to 70 years. Preoperative values were within normal limits for all patients. Aspirin was not stopped for a single patient. There was no excessive intraoperative bleeding in all cases except 1; there was no postoperative bleeding in all cases.

Conclusion

We conclude that most minor oral surgery procedures can be carried out safely without stopping long-term low-dose aspirin regimen.

### Direct oral anticoagulants and medical comorbidities in patients needing dental extractions: management of the risk of bleeding [^113Dwq73]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to measure the frequency of bleeding during and after tooth extraction in patients exposed to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and identify risk factors for prolonged or excessive bleeding.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective cohort study involved 100 patients who underwent tooth extractions according to the European Heart Rhythm Association protocol: continuation of DOAC therapy for extractions of up to 3 teeth in the same session performed at the (presumed) time of DOAC trough concentration. We respected an interval of at least 4 hours between extraction and last DOAC intake. The outcome of interest was incidence of mild, moderate, and severe bleeding during the intervention and in the 7-day follow-up period. Data analysis considered the presence of comorbidities as the primary predictor for bleeding; additional predictors were age, gender, type of comorbidity, indication for DOAC therapy, DOAC agent, and extraction of contiguous teeth.

Results

Of the patients, 64 had comorbidities (diabetes in 50%). The distributions of demographic, clinical, and dental variables were similar for patients with and without comorbidities. We observed 4 bleeding episodes (1 moderate episode 1 hour after the extraction and 3 mild episodes the day after the extraction) in the comorbidity group and none in the non-comorbidity group (4 of 64 vs 0 of 36, P = 0.29; overall bleeding rate, 4 of 100). The factor significantly triggering bleeding in patients with comorbidity was extractions of couples and triplets of multirooted teeth (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Tooth extractions in patients with comorbidities taking DOACs may be safely managed as long as they are performed at least 4 hours after the last DOAC intake and do not involve 2 or 3 contiguous premolars and molars.

### A drug holiday reduces the frequency and severity of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in a minipig model [^112a2Faf]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In this regard, it was expected to see a difference between the animals with tooth extractions under AR treatment with and without implementation of preventive measures. These findings are in line with well‐known clinical outcome results of tooth extractions under high‐dose oncological treatment with AR drugs with and without preventive measures. (23, 25, 26) Interestingly, we found remarkable differences between the groups with preventive measures, with or without implementation of a perioperative drug holiday. Given the long half‐life of ZOL in bone, no significant difference between these two groups was expected. Clinically, drug holiday results are controversial ranging from studies suggesting no influence, (38) limited benefits, (39) or stage‐specific effects. (40) However, it should be noted that none of the aforementioned studies specifically addressed the potential beneficial effect of a drug holiday prior to a tooth extraction. Although we saw an uneventful healing in the majority of cases with drug holiday, we found mucosal dehiscence in the first week after surgery in four of 10 of the cases treated without any drug holiday. These effects cannot be explained by the cumulative dose or the respective concentration of ZOL in bone because these were identical at the time of extraction. However, the concentration bound to the HA of bone might not be the key issue because we know this is completely inert. Two main explanations seem to be possible. First there might be a change in localized release and activation of ZOL depending on when, and maybe where, the ZOL was stored and bound. As the time between ZOL administration increases, it might be stored deeper, with recent doses being stored more superficially. On the other hand, there could also be a role of the ZOL that was administered on the day of surgery being still present in plasma. The extent of the drug holiday effect might also be attributed to the special circumstances in our model where the anesthesia for the tooth extraction surgery was also used to administer the ZOL for animal welfare. This suggests that BRONJ incidence might increase if the traumatic insult occurs soon after the BP administration. This would also offer a potential cause of spontaneous BRONJ, a mechanical insult such as poor fitting dentures, causing soft tissue damage and the healing is then impaired by concomitant BP administration. The comparable wound dehiscences in the animals that were treated with a mucoperiosteal flap indicates this is an effect PM, with the drug holiday leading to a further decrease in MRONJ incidence. This is in line with previous speculations regarding a potential soft tissue toxicity of nitrogen‐containing BPs, (41, 42, 43) which were not yet supported by in vivo data. This might highlight a so far underestimated effect of nitrogen‐containing BPs toward cells other then osteoclasts. Nowadays, it is well known from cell culture investigations that nitrogen‐containing BPs can have effects on very different cell types in addition to osteoclasts, including but not limited to osteoblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, mucosal cells, and immune‐regulating cells, (35, 43, 44, 45) in part likely due to its effects on epithelial growth factor receptors. (46) Impaired angiogenesis has also been detected in clinical samples. (47) The experimental data suggesting a potential role of soft‐tissue toxicity is in line with widespread clinical experience even though there is little robust data to support this idea. It is also well known from clinical experiences that mucosal healing following tooth extractions is often delayed in patients with AR treatment. (23, 25, 26) Therefore, there are recommendations for a delayed removal of stitches in those patients.

### Acute postoperative pain due to dental extraction in the adult population: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115ZLMhp]. Journal of Dental Research (2023). High credibility.

Background — acute postoperative dental pain and study objective: North America is amid an opioid crisis, which is a leading public health and safety concern, and over half a million dental patient visits between 2011 and 2015 are noted with 29% of prescribed opioids exceeding the recommended morphine equivalent for appropriate management of acute pain, and over half exceeding the recommended days of supply. The objective of this systematic review (SR) and network meta-analysis (NMA) was to assess the comparative effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for the management of acute pain when compared to simple and surgical tooth extraction, as well as pain associated with pulpitis or its complications.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on regenerative medicine treatment for chronic pain: a consensus report from a multispecialty working group [^116kkDxw]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on best available evidence, a conservative strategy is to hold all NSAIDs prior to scheduling a procedure involving injectable biologics. A safe strategy is to hold all pre-procedure NSAIDs based on four to five times its respective plasma half-life to ensure that it has appropriately been excreted. These medications should continue to be held post-procedure given the rapid acting nature of these agents, as even one dose can impact platelet aggregation and growth factor release. The duration of holding these medications post-procedure may vary, but we recommend a hold of at least 4–8 weeks, which generally corresponds to the peak effect of injectable agents.

Consensus Point 39. It is recommended that all NSAIDs, including aspirin, are held for four to five times their respective plasma half-lives (eg, seven days for aspirin) prior to scheduling a procedure involving injectable biologics. These medications should continue to be held post-procedurally given the rapid onset of these agents, as even one dose can impact platelet aggregation and growth factor release. We recommend a hold of at least four to eight weeks, which corresponds to the peak effect of injectable agents (Level II-2, Grade B).

Nutritional Supplements and Naturopathic Medications

Many chronic pain patients may take a variety of supplements thought to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential. These may include turmeric, fish oil and omega-3 supplements, vitamin E, and curcumin. While there is limited basic science evidence suggesting that herbal supplements may promote platelet aggregation, the broad concern regarding these supplements is the possibility for thrombocytopenia. While typically the procedure is contraindicated in patients who are thrombocytopenic, the theoretical concern is also a reduced post-procedure effectiveness; however, there is very limited clinical evidence to support the latter. Based on the best available evidence, we recommend that these agents be held for at least one week prior to procedure performance for this reason; however, they can be continued post-procedure due to lack of clinical evidence on the reduced effectiveness of injectable biologics in the presence of their use.

Consensus Point 40. Natural supplements and naturopathic agents should be held at least one week prior to a procedure involving injectable biologics. Due to limited evidence and variable half-lives among natural supplements and naturopathic agents, the time frame to resume these medications after the procedure is unclear and is per clinician discretion (Level II-3, Grade C).

### The pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^115mGq71]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. The article describes the antithrombotic effect of VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, the clinical applications of VKA therapy, and the optimal therapeutic range of VKAs, and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong, and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient's values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we suggest the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy with doses between 5 and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 2B). In the elderly and in other patient subgroups with an elevated bleeding risk, we suggest a starting dose at ≤ 5 mg (Grade 2C). We recommend basing subsequent doses after the initial two or three doses on the results of INR monitoring (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with INRs above the therapeutic range and for patients requiring invasive procedures. For example, in patients with mild to moderately elevated INRs without major bleeding, we suggest that when vitamin K is to be given it be administered orally rather than subcutaneously (Grade 1A). For the management of patients with a low risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before they undergo surgery (Grade 2C). For patients with a high risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before surgery, to allow the INR to return to normal, and beginning therapy with full-dose unfractionated heparin or full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin as the INR falls (Grade 2C). In patients undergoing dental procedures, we suggest the use of tranexamic acid mouthwash (Grade 2B) or epsilon amino caproic acid mouthwash without interrupting anticoagulant therapy (Grade 2B) if there is a concern for local bleeding. For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we suggest a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B]. In patients with recurrent thromboembolic events with a therapeutic INR or other additional risk factors, we suggest a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) [Grade 2C]. As models of anticoagulation monitoring and management, we recommend that clinicians incorporate patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, and follow-up, and good communication with patients concerning results and dosing decisions (Grade 1C+).

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^11786irb]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacologic aspects — NSAIDs and aspirin: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor of COX-1. Low-dose aspirin's antiplatelet effect lasts for 7–10 days. Pharmacokinetics from Table 5 show aspirin (oral low dose) time to maximum effect 0.5 hours, plasma half life 0.5 hours, time to 50% of platelet function recovery 3 days, hours to maximum plasma concentration level 0.5 hours, and drug bioavailability 60%; for NSAIDs, plasma half life ranges from 1 to 72 hours, time to 50% recovery 1 day, hours to maximum plasma concentration level About 0.5 hours, and drug bioavailability 50–95%. Perioperatively, the platelet effects of other NSAIDs are influenced by clearance and it takes approximately 5 half-lives for elimination, and according to available evidence aspirin (81 mg) discontinuation for 4 days prior to a procedure may be sufficient to avoid the development of thromboembolism; the major concern with stopping aspirin is the risk of thromboembolism. Large-scale evidence also shows that aspirin therapy (81 mg) for primary prevention of cardiovascular events demonstrates benefits, but with an increased risk of bleeding.

### Do antiplatelet drugs increase the risk of bleeding after dental implant surgery? A case-and-crossover study [^115khwyP]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cessation versus continuation of antiplatelet drugs in patients undergoing dental implant surgery is a controversial issue. The present study evaluated postoperative bleeding during and after dental implant surgery in patients taking aspirin (ASA) or clopidogrel.

Material and Methods

The present study is a case-and-crossover study. Patients who were using antiplatelet drugs and receiving 2 bilateral dental implants in the posterior region of the mandible were studied. During session 1, dental implants were placed without stopping the intake of antiplatelet drugs. During session 2, antiplatelet drugs were stopped for 5 days. In group 1, platelet activity was measured by an assay based on flow cytometry and represented the platelet reactivity index. In group 2, platelet function analysis was used to monitor the antiplatelet effect of ASA. Bleeding severity was assessed using a visual analog scale for 72 hours after dental implant placement during sessions 1 and 2. Use of antiplatelet drugs was the predictive factor of the study and bleeding severity and platelet function were the outcomes of the study.

Results

Twenty-two patients composed group 1 (clopidogrel 75 mg) and 20 composed group 2 (ASA 80 mg). In group 1, bleeding severity was 4.86 ± 0.77 during session 1 and 4.59 ± 0.66 during session 2. Data analysis showed no difference in bleeding severity between sessions 1 and 2 in group 1 (P = 0.72). In group 2, bleeding severity was 4.05 ± 0.94 during session 1 and 3.9 ± 0.85 during session 2. There was no difference in bleeding severity between sessions 1 and 2 in patients taking ASA (P = 0.19).

Conclusion

The results suggest that continuing the intake of antiplatelet drugs did not increase bleeding after placement of dental implants.
