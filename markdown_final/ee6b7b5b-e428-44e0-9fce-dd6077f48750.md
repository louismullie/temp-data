## Question

Tension headache prevention

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about preventive strategies for tension-type headache. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and when prevention is indicated. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for pharmacologic options, especially tricyclics, SSRIs/SNRIs, and other agents. Next, I will examine non-pharmacologic therapies such as exercise, psychological therapies, acupuncture, and physical therapy. After that, I need to check what major guidelines recommend and how to reconcile conflicting evidence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered algorithm and highlight uncertainties and nocebo considerations that affect adherence and interpretation of trials [^111rsGSY] [^116e96X4].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and thresholds for prevention. Tension-type headache is the most prevalent neurological disorder globally, with episodic forms defined by fewer than 15 headache days per month and chronic forms by 15 or more days per month; prevention is generally considered when headaches are frequent or disabling, or when acute medication use risks medication-overuse headache, so I need to ensure we are framing recommendations around frequent episodic and chronic TTH rather than infrequent episodic disease [^116gVnvK] [^11757Kak].

> I will now examine pharmacologic prevention, starting with tricyclic antidepressants, because multiple high-quality meta-analyses converge here. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit: pooled analyses show TCAs reduce headache frequency by roughly 4–6 headache days per month versus placebo in chronic TTH, with standardized mean differences around 0.9–1.0, indicating a large clinical effect; amitriptyline is consistently first-line, typically dosed 10–75 mg at bedtime, with benefits accruing over weeks to months and with more adverse effects than placebo or SSRIs but without higher dropout rates in aggregate [^117NeoiZ] [^112jWBjJ] [^114exB12] [^111Aqxb6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about SSRIs and SNRIs. I initially thought venlafaxine might be broadly effective for TTH prevention, but I should double-check the direct evidence; Cochrane reviews focused on TTH show SSRIs and venlafaxine are not superior to placebo or amitriptyline for reducing headache frequency over 8–12 weeks, though they may reduce analgesic use modestly and are generally better tolerated than TCAs, so they are not first-line for TTH prevention despite mechanistic plausibility [^111rG55D] [^112QWQ1w].

> Next, I should review other agents. Gabapentin has limited and low-quality evidence in chronic daily headache and is not a standard TTH preventive; tizanidine appears in some primary care guidance but lacks robust TTH-specific data; botulinum toxin has emerging meta-analytic signals of small-to-moderate improvements in some outcomes, yet major guidelines judge the evidence low quality and recommend against its use for chronic TTH prevention due to small benefit and potential harms, so I need to be cautious not to over-interpret positive trials here [^112d2W4D] [^113MFCr6] [^113tcxks] [^1122bux1].

> Let me consider non-pharmacologic options, starting with exercise. The VA/DoD guideline suggests aerobic exercise or progressive strength training for prevention of TTH with low-to-very low certainty but a favorable benefit–harm balance; I should confirm that this is framed as a weak recommendation and that heterogeneity and small effects are acknowledged, which it is, so exercise remains a reasonable, low-risk option integrated with pacing and lifestyle strategies [^112gbozD] [^114kzZSx] [^117CMm42] [^112pUgFQ].

> I need to check psychological and behavioral therapies next. EFNS supports EMG biofeedback, CBT, and relaxation training, and AAFP guidance incorporates these into management of frequent headaches; however, the VA/DoD 2023 guideline found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against CBT, mindfulness, or progressive muscle relaxation for prevention, so I should present these as reasonable options with moderate evidence and patient preference strongly guiding use, especially given low risk and potential benefits beyond headache reduction [^111jiVTZ] [^113GZL7G] [^115Af8b1] [^115Vdf9m].

> But wait, what about acupuncture. Cochrane reviews suggest acupuncture yields a modest benefit over sham and a larger benefit over routine care or no prophylaxis, yet the VA/DoD guideline concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against acupuncture for prevention; reconciling this, I should note that guideline panels often apply stricter certainty thresholds and consider cost, access, and heterogeneity, so acupuncture can be offered as a conditional option where available and acceptable, acknowledging low-to-moderate certainty and potential placebo components [^1165rNVf] [^114bVCd9] [^111jbsuB] [^114KD3hV].

> I should confirm the role of physical therapy. The VA/DoD guideline suggests physical therapy for TTH management, reflecting a weak recommendation with low certainty; manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, and postural training are typical components, and they can be paired with home programs and ergonomic counseling, aligning with a biopsychosocial approach to myofascial and cervical contributors [^112iV5gy] [^115Vdf9m].

> Next, I should review what major guidelines actually recommend to ensure alignment. The VA/DoD 2023 guideline suggests amitriptyline for chronic TTH prevention and recommends against botulinum toxin for this indication, while stating there is insufficient evidence to prefer one preventive medication over another overall; EFNS positions amitriptyline as first-line with mirtazapine and venlafaxine as second-line, and AAFP recommends offering prophylaxis for frequent TTH with amitriptyline as a key option, which coheres with the meta-analytic data despite heterogeneity [^111ZAqgg] [^113tcxks] [^113uXeMB] [^115v4UvK] [^1147PJoe].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, but I should verify each step against the evidence before finalizing. For patients with frequent episodic or chronic TTH, start with education on trigger management and medication overuse, initiate a paced aerobic or strength program, and consider a psychological therapy such as CBT or biofeedback if accessible; if inadequate control or patient preference, offer amitriptyline 10–25 mg at bedtime and titrate by 10–25 mg every 1–2 weeks toward 50–75 mg as tolerated, monitoring for anticholinergic effects, sedation, and cardiac risk in older adults or those with arrhythmia risk; if amitriptyline is ineffective or poorly tolerated, consider mirtazapine or venlafaxine as second-line despite weaker TTH-specific evidence, and consider acupuncture where available and acceptable; avoid botulinum toxin for TTH prevention given guideline recommendations and small net benefit; throughout, limit acute analgesics to fewer than 2 days per week to mitigate medication-overuse headache risk [^111Aqxb6] [^115v4UvK] [^113tcxks] [^114exB12].

> Hold on, I should verify uncertainties and adherence issues that could derail care. Many preventive trials are small, short, and heterogeneous, with substantial nocebo effects in placebo arms that inflate adverse event rates and dropout; this means shared decision-making, slow titration, and expectation management are essential, and I need to ensure we revisit efficacy after 8–12 weeks at a therapeutic dose before declaring failure [^112p1JGY] [^111rsGSY] [^116e96X4].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and consistent with the highest-quality evidence. Tricyclic antidepressants, particularly amitriptyline, have the most consistent and clinically meaningful benefit for chronic TTH prevention, exercise is a low-risk adjunct with weak but supportive guidance, SSRIs/SNRIs are not first-line for TTH prevention despite better tolerability, and botulinum toxin should not be used for TTH prevention outside of research settings; individualize choices to comorbidities, access, and patient preferences, and embed behavioral strategies to sustain gains and reduce analgesic overuse [^112jWBjJ] [^117NeoiZ] [^112gbozD] [^113tcxks].

---

Tension headache prevention centers on **amitriptyline as first-line** [^111ZAqgg] pharmacologic therapy for chronic or frequent episodic cases, with mirtazapine or venlafaxine as alternatives [^115v4UvK] [^116gVnvK]. Nonpharmacologic options include **CBT, relaxation/biofeedback, and regular aerobic or strength training** [^113GZL7G] [^117GkQxU] [^112pUgFQ]; acupuncture may be considered where available [^1165rNVf] [^114KD3hV]. Avoid **medication overuse** [^114xZ6wB] and limit acute analgesics to ≤ 2 days/week [^114exB12]; SSRIs are not recommended for prophylaxis [^114hZ3SW] [^111rG55D], and botulinum toxin is ineffective [^113tcxks] [^1122bux1]. Prevention is indicated for **frequent episodic or chronic TTH**, with treatment individualized to patient preference, comorbidities, and response [^11757Kak] [^116gVnvK].

---

## Pharmacologic prevention

### First-line pharmacologic therapy

Amitriptyline is the most effective and recommended first-line preventive for chronic or frequent episodic TTH, with typical doses of 10–75 mg at bedtime [^111ZAqgg] [^113ZsxNQ]. It reduces headache frequency, duration, and severity [^112jWBjJ] and is superior to SSRIs [^117NeoiZ].

---

### Second-line pharmacologic therapy

Mirtazapine and **venlafaxine** are reasonable alternatives when amitriptyline is ineffective or poorly tolerated [^115v4UvK] [^113ZsxNQ].

---

### Pharmacologic therapies not recommended

- **SSRIs**: Not recommended for TTH prophylaxis due to lack of efficacy [^111rG55D].
- **Botulinum toxin**: Ineffective for chronic TTH prevention [^113tcxks] [^1122bux1].
- **Gabapentin**: Limited evidence; not routinely recommended [^notfound].

---

## Nonpharmacologic prevention

### Psychological and behavioral therapies

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) reduces headache frequency, severity, and medication use [^112h2Gmo]. Relaxation training and biofeedback are effective and can be combined with CBT for added benefit [^117GkQxU] [^111jiVTZ].

---

### Physical therapy and exercise

Physical therapy — including manual therapy, posture training, and exercise — is recommended for TTH management [^112iV5gy] [^115Vdf9m]. Aerobic exercise or progressive strength training reduces headache frequency and severity [^112pUgFQ] [^114kzZSx].

---

### Acupuncture

Acupuncture may be considered, with moderate evidence of benefit over no treatment or sham, though evidence quality varies [^1165rNVf] [^114KD3hV].

---

## Lifestyle modifications and trigger management

- **Stress management**: Regular relaxation, mindfulness, and stress-reduction techniques are beneficial [^115w268B].
- **Sleep hygiene**: Regular sleep schedules and adequate sleep reduce headache frequency [^notfound].
- **Diet and hydration**: Regular meals, adequate hydration, and limiting caffeine and alcohol may help [^114Q8eEi].
- **Posture and ergonomics**: Ergonomic adjustments, especially for desk work, reduce muscle tension and headache frequency [^114exB12].

---

## Indications for preventive therapy

Preventive therapy is indicated for **frequent episodic TTH** (≥ 2 headaches/week) or **chronic TTH** (≥ 15 days/month for ≥ 3 months) [^11757Kak] [^116gVnvK]. It is also appropriate when acute treatments are ineffective, poorly tolerated, or contraindicated, or when medication overuse is present or likely [^116gVnvK] [^1159afeW].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

- **Comorbidities**: Depression, anxiety, insomnia, and cardiovascular disease influence medication choice [^notfound].
- **Age and gender**: Amitriptyline requires caution in older adults due to anticholinergic effects [^111Aqxb6].
- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making improves adherence and outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should assess **efficacy, tolerability, and adherence** [^notfound]. Use headache diaries to track frequency, severity, and medication use, and adjust therapy based on response and side effects [^11673Jbt].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Amitriptyline | First-line pharmacologic therapy | High |
| Mirtazapine, venlafaxine | Second-line pharmacologic therapy | Moderate |
| CBT, relaxation, biofeedback | Recommended nonpharmacologic therapy | High |
| Aerobic exercise, physical therapy | Recommended nonpharmacologic therapy | Moderate |
| Acupuncture | Considered optional | Moderate |
| SSRIs, botulinum toxin | Not recommended | High |

---

Amitriptyline is **first-line** for chronic or frequent episodic TTH, with mirtazapine or venlafaxine as alternatives; CBT, relaxation/biofeedback, and regular exercise are key nonpharmacologic options [^113ZsxNQ] [^113GZL7G] [^112pUgFQ]. Avoid medication overuse, tailor therapy to patient factors, and monitor with diaries and regular follow-up [^117JXXSi] [^111Ucmuv].

### Acupuncture for the prevention of tension-type headache [^1165rNVf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture is often used for prevention of tension-type headache but its effectiveness is still controversial. This is an update of our Cochrane review originally published in Issue 1, 2009 of The Cochrane Library.

Objectives

To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than 'sham' (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as other interventions in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic or chronic tension-type headache.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and AMED to 19 January 2016. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 10 February 2016 for ongoing and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials with a post-randomisation observation period of at least eight weeks, which compared the clinical effects of an acupuncture intervention with a control (treatment of acute headaches only or routine care), a sham acupuncture intervention or another prophylactic intervention in adults with episodic or chronic tension-type headache.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors checked eligibility; extracted information on participants, interventions, methods and results; and assessed study risk of bias and the quality of the acupuncture intervention. The main efficacy outcome measure was response (at least 50% reduction of headache frequency) after completion of treatment (three to four months after randomisation). To assess safety/acceptability we extracted the number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and the number of participants reporting adverse effects. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Main Results

Twelve trials (11 included in the previous version and one newly identified) with 2349 participants (median 56, range 10 to 1265) met the inclusion criteria. Acupuncture was compared with routine care or treatment of acute headaches only in two large trials (1265 and 207 participants), but they had quite different baseline headache frequency and management in the control groups. Neither trial was blinded but trial quality was otherwise high (low risk of bias). While effect size estimates of the two trials differed considerably, the proportion of participants experiencing at least 50% reduction of headache frequency was much higher in groups receiving acupuncture than in control groups (moderate quality evidence; trial 1: 302/629 (48%) versus 121/636 (19%); risk ratio (RR) 2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1 to 3.0; trial 2: 60/132 (45%) versus 3/75 (4%); RR 11; 95% CI 3.7 to 35). Long-term effects (beyond four months) were not investigated. Acupuncture was compared with sham acupuncture in seven trials of moderate to high quality (low risk of bias); five large studies provided data for one or more meta-analyses. Among participants receiving acupuncture, 205 of 391 (51%) had at least 50% reduction of headache frequency compared to 133 of 312 (43%) in the sham group after treatment (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.5; four trials; moderate quality evidence). Results six months after randomisation were similar. Withdrawals were low: 1 of 420 participants receiving acupuncture dropped out due to adverse effects and 0 of 343 receiving sham (six trials; low quality evidence). Three trials reported the number of participants reporting adverse effects: 29 of 174 (17%) with acupuncture versus 12 of 103 with sham (12%; odds ratio (OR) 1.3; 95% CI 0.60 to 2.7; low quality evidence). Acupuncture was compared with physiotherapy, massage or exercise in four trials of low to moderate quality (high risk of bias); study findings were inadequately reported. No trial found a significant superiority of acupuncture and for some outcomes the results slightly favoured the comparison therapy. None of these trials reported the number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects or the number of participants reporting adverse effects. Overall, the quality of the evidence assessed using GRADE was moderate or low, downgraded mainly due to a lack of blinding and variable effect sizes.

Authors' Conclusions

The available results suggest that acupuncture is effective for treating frequent episodic or chronic tension-type headaches, but further trials - particularly comparing acupuncture with other treatment options - are needed.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for the prevention of tension-type headache in adults [^111rG55D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane review published in 2005 on selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for preventing migraine and tension-type headache. The original review has been split in two parts and this review now only regards tension-type headache prevention. Another updated review covers migraine. Tension-type headache is the second most common disorder worldwide and has high social and economic relevance. As serotonin and other neurotransmitters may have a role in pain mechanisms, SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been evaluated for the prevention of tension-type headache.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs and SNRIs compared to placebo and other active interventions in the prevention of episodic and chronic tension-type headache in adults.

Search Methods

For the original review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2003, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2004), EMBASE (1994 to May 2003), and Headache Quarterly (1990 to 2003). For this update, we revised the original search strategy to reflect the broader type of intervention (SSRIs and SNRIs). We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10) on the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to November 2014), EMBASE (1980 to November 2014), and PsycINFO (1987 to November 2014). We also checked the reference lists of retrieved articles and searched trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with any type of control intervention in participants 18 years and older, of either sex, with tension-type headache.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data (headache frequency, index, intensity, and duration; use of symptomatic/analgesic medication; quality of life; and withdrawals) and assessed the risk of bias of trials. The primary outcome is tension-type headache frequency, measured by the number of headache attacks or the number of days with headache per evaluation period.

Main Results

The original review included six studies on tension-type headache. We now include eight studies with a total of 412 participants with chronic forms of tension-type headache. These studies evaluated five SSRIs (citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine) and one SNRI (venlafaxine). The two new studies included in this update are placebo controlled trials, one evaluated sertraline and one venlafaxine. Six studies, already included in the previous version of this review, compared SSRIs to other antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, sulpiride, mianserin). Most of the included studies had methodological and/or reporting shortcomings and lacked adequate power. Follow-up ranged between two and four months. Six studies explored the effect of SSRIs or SNRIs on tension-type headache frequency, the primary endpoint. At eight weeks of follow-up, we found no difference when compared to placebo (two studies, N = 127; mean difference (MD) -0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.95 to 2.03; I(2) = 0%) or amitriptyline (two studies, N = 152; MD 0.76, 95% CI -2.05 to 3.57; I(2) = 44%). When considering secondary outcomes, SSRIs reduce the symptomatic/analgesic medication use for acute headache attacks compared to placebo (two studies, N = 118; MD -1.87, 95% CI -2.09 to -1.65; I(2) = 0%). However, amitriptyline appeared to reduce the intake of analgesic more efficiently than SSRIs (MD 4.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 8.84; I(2) = 0%). The studies supporting these findings were considered at unclear risk of bias. We found no differences compared to placebo or other antidepressants in headache duration and intensity.SSRIs or SNRI were generally more tolerable than tricyclics. However, the two groups did not differ in terms of number of participants who withdrew due to adverse events or for other reasons (four studies, N = 257; odds ratio (OR) 1.04; 95% CI 0.41 to 2.60; I(2) = 25% and OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.38; I(2) = 0%). We did not find any study comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with pharmacological treatments other than antidepressants (e.g. botulinum toxin) or non-drug therapies (e.g. psycho-behavioural treatments, manual therapy, acupuncture).

Authors' Conclusions

Since the last version of this review, the new included studies have not added high quality evidence to support the use of SSRIs or venlafaxine (a SNRI) as preventive drugs for tension-type headache. Over two months of treatment, SSRIs or venlafaxine are no more effective than placebo or amitriptyline in reducing headache frequency in patients with chronic tension-type headache. SSRIs seem to be less effective than tricyclic antidepressants in terms of intake of analgesic medications. Tricyclic antidepressants are associated with more adverse events; however, this did not cause a greater number of withdrawals. No reliable information is available at longer follow-up. Our conclusion is that the use of SSRIs and venlafaxine for the prevention of chronic tension-type headache is not supported by evidence.

### Acupuncture for tension-type headache [^114bVCd9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture is often used for tension-type headache prophylaxis but its effectiveness is still controversial. This review (along with a companion review on 'Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis') represents an updated version of a Cochrane review originally published in Issue 1, 2001, of The Cochrane Library.

Objectives

To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than 'sham' (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as other interventions in reducing headache frequency in patients with episodic or chronic tension-type headache.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pain, Palliative & Supportive Care Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Trials Register were searched to January 2008.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials with a post-randomization observation period of at least 8 weeks that compared the clinical effects of an acupuncture intervention with a control (treatment of acute headaches only or routine care), a sham acupuncture intervention or another intervention in patients with episodic or chronic tension-type headache.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on patients, interventions, methods and results; and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. Outcomes extracted included response (at least 50% reduction of headache frequency; outcome of primary interest), headache days, pain intensity and analgesic use.

Main Results

Eleven trials with 2317 participants (median 62, range 10 to 1265) met the inclusion criteria. Two large trials compared acupuncture to treatment of acute headaches or routine care only. Both found statistically significant and clinically relevant short-term (up to 3 months) benefits of acupuncture over control for response, number of headache days and pain intensity. Long-term effects (beyond 3 months) were not investigated. Six trials compared acupuncture with a sham acupuncture intervention, and five of the six provided data for meta-analyses. Small but statistically significant benefits of acupuncture over sham were found for response as well as for several other outcomes. Three of the four trials comparing acupuncture with physiotherapy, massage or relaxation had important methodological or reporting shortcomings. Their findings are difficult to interpret, but collectively suggest slightly better results for some outcomes in the control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

In the previous version of this review, evidence in support of acupuncture for tension-type headache was considered insufficient. Now, with six additional trials, the authors conclude that acupuncture could be a valuable non-pharmacological tool in patients with frequent episodic or chronic tension-type headaches.

### Acupuncture for the prevention of episodic migraine [^115h31Pv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include controlled trials that investigated the preventative effect of acupuncture, in which allocation to treatment was explicitly randomised, regardless of allocation concealment and blinding, and in which participants were followed up for at least eight weeks after randomisation.

We will exclude trials that used a clearly inappropriate method of randomisation, for example, open alternation. For cross‐over randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we will only include data from the first phase.

Types of participants

We will include studies in which study participants have been diagnosed with episodic migraine, defined as having a headache for fewer than 15 days per month (Description of the condition). Of note, the word 'episodic' does not have to be mentioned in the study report explicitly to be eligible for inclusion.

We will include studies that focus on episodic migraine but include participants with additional tension‐type headache. We will include studies that include participants with headaches of various types (for example, some participants with migraine, some with tension‐type headache) only if findings for participants with migraine were available separately, or if more than 90% of participants suffered from migraine.

We are interested in studies where the duration of the condition is longer than one year in the majority (> 80%) of participants (Linde 2016). We will consider a study meeting this inclusion criterion if:

duration for longer than a year was an inclusion criterion of the study; or
the mean duration minus one standard deviation was longer than one year; or
the mean duration (standard deviation not reported) was longer than 10 years; or
other information was reported that made it highly likely that the criterion was met (e.g. study authors presented proportions with duration ranges).

Exclusion criteria

We will exclude studies that focused exclusively on people with chronic migraine or chronic daily headache (chronic daily headache is defined as headache on fewer than 15 days a month for more than three months), as well as studies in which, at baseline, more than half of participants had more than 15 days with migrainous headache per month. We will also exclude studies in which there was no information about the duration of headache complaints.

### Medical management of adult headache [^1159afeW]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

We review the therapies for primary headache disorders: migraine, chronic migraine, tension-type headache, and cluster headache. Recommendations follow the evidence-based treatments so far as is possible with expert opinion to give clinical guidance. Headache has 2 levels of care: acute treatments designed to stop a headache from progressing and alleviate all symptoms associated with the headache and preventive therapies for patients whose headache frequency is such that by itself produces significant disability and impact on quality of life, or where the frequency of use of acute medications, regardless of efficacy, poses risks in terms of overuse or adverse events.

### Treatment of chronic headache with antidepressants: a meta-analysis [^116Wf73u]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although antidepressants are often used for preventing chronic headache, their effectiveness is uncertain.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of English-language, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants as prophylaxis for chronic headache.

Results

Thirty-eight trials were included. Because some compared more than one drug with placebo, 44 study arms were combined using a random effects model. Twenty-five studies focused on migraines, 12 on tension headaches, and 1 on both. Nineteen used tricyclic antidepressants, 18 serotonin antagonists, and 7 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients receiving antidepressants were twice as likely to report headache improvement (rate ratio [RR]: 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6 to 2.4). Because 31% (95% CI: 23% to 40%) more treated patients improved than those receiving placebo, clinicians would need to treat 3.2 patients for 1 patient to improve. The average amount of improvement (standardized mean difference) was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.65 to 1.2), an effect considered large. Treated patients also consumed less analgesic medication (standardized mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI: -0.5 to -0.94). There were no differences in outcomes among the three classes of agents studied or by the type of headache (migraine vs. tension), quality score, length of treatment, or percentage of patients lost to follow-up. Assessment of depression across studies was insufficient to determine if the effects were independent of depression.

Conclusion

Antidepressants are effective in preventing chronic headaches. Whether this is independent of depression and whether there are differences in efficacy by class of agent needs further study.

### Tension-type headache [^116gVnvK]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent neurological disorder worldwide and is characterized by recurrent headaches of mild to moderate intensity, bilateral location, pressing or tightening quality, and no aggravation by routine physical activity. Diagnosis is based on headache history and the exclusion of alternative diagnoses, with clinical criteria provided by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition. Although the biological underpinnings remain unresolved, it seems likely that peripheral mechanisms are responsible for the genesis of pain in TTH, whereas central sensitization may be involved in transformation from episodic to chronic TTH. Pharmacological therapy is the mainstay of clinical management and can be divided into acute and preventive treatments. Simple analgesics have evidence-based effectiveness and are widely regarded as first-line medications for the acute treatment of TTH. Preventive treatment should be considered in individuals with frequent episodic and chronic TTH, and if simple analgesics are ineffective, poorly tolerated or contraindicated. Recommended preventive treatments include amitriptyline, venlafaxine and mirtazapine, as well as some selected non-pharmacological therapies. Despite the widespread prevalence and associated disability of TTH, little progress has been made since the early 2000s owing to a lack of attention and resource allocation by scientists, funding bodies and the pharmaceutical industry.

### Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants for the prevention of frequent episodic or chronic tension-type headache in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117NeoiZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tension-type headaches are a common source of pain and suffering. Our purpose was to assess the efficacy of tricyclic (TCA) and tetracyclic antidepressants in the prophylactic treatment of tension-type headache.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the ISI Web of Science, and clinical trial registries through 11 March 2017 for randomized controlled studies of TCA or tetracyclic antidepressants in the prevention of tension-type headache in adults. Data were pooled using a random effects approach.

Key Results

Among 22 randomized controlled trials, eight included a placebo comparison and 19 compared at least two active treatments. Eight studies compared TCAs to placebo, four compared TCAs to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and two trials compared TCAs to behavioral therapies. Two trials compared tetracyclics to placebo. Single trials compared TCAs to tetracyclics, buspirone, spinal manipulation, transcutaneous electrical stimulation, massage, and intra-oral orthotics. High-quality evidence suggests that TCAs were superior to placebo in reducing headache frequency (weighted mean differences (WMD): -4.8 headaches/month, 95% CI: -6.63 to -2.95) and number of analgesic medications consumed (WMD: -21.0 doses/month, 95% CI: -38.2 to -3.8). TCAs were more effective than SSRIs. Low-quality studies suggest that TCAs are superior to buspirone, but equivalent to behavioral therapy, spinal manipulation, intra-oral orthotics, and massage. Tetracyclics were no better than placebo for chronic tension-type headache.

Conclusions

Tricyclic antidepressants are modestly effective in reducing chronic tension-type headache and are superior to buspirone. In limited studies, tetracyclics appear to be ineffective in the prophylactic treatment of chronic tension-type headache.

### Aspirin for acute treatment of episodic tension-type headache in adults [^112J7txC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tension-type headache (TTH) affects about 1 person in 5 worldwide. It is divided into infrequent episodic TTH (fewer than one headache per month), frequent episodic TTH (two to 14 headache days per month), and chronic TTH (15 headache days per month or more). Aspirin is one of a number of analgesics suggested for acute treatment of episodic TTH.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of aspirin for acute treatment of episodic tension-type headache (TTH) in adults compared with placebo or any active comparator.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database from inception to September 2016, and also reference lists of relevant published studies and reviews. We sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching online clinical trial registers and manufacturers' websites.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (parallel-group or cross-over) using oral aspirin for symptomatic relief of an acute episode of TTH. Studies had to be prospective, with participants aged 18 years or over, and include at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. For various outcomes (predominantly those recommended by the International Headache Society (IHS)), we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNT), one additional harmful outcome (NNH), or to prevent one event (NNTp) for oral aspirin compared to placebo or an active intervention. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included five studies enrolling adults with frequent episodic TTH; 1812 participants took medication, of which 767 were included in comparisons of aspirin 1000 mg with placebo, and 405 in comparisons of aspirin 500 mg or 650 mg with placebo. Not all of these participants provided data for outcomes of interest in this review. Four studies specified using IHS diagnostic criteria; one predated commonly recognised criteria, but described comparable characteristics and excluded migraine. All participants treated headaches of at least moderate pain intensity. None of the included studies were at low risk of bias across all domains considered, although for most studies and domains this was likely to be due to inadequate reporting rather than poor methods. We judged one study to be at high risk of bias due to small size. There were no data for aspirin at any dose for the IHS preferred outcome of being pain free at two hours, or for being pain free at any other time, and only one study provided data equivalent to having no or mild pain at two hours (very low quality evidence). Use of rescue medication was lower with aspirin 1000 mg than with placebo (2 studies, 397 participants); 14% of participants used rescue medication with aspirin 1000 mg compared with 31% with placebo (NNTp 6.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1 to 12) (low quality evidence). Two studies (397 participants) reported a Patient Global Evaluation at the end of the study; we combined the top two categories for both studies to determine the number of participants who were 'satisfied' with treatment. Aspirin 1000 mg produced more satisfied participants (55%) than did placebo (37%) (NNT 5.7, 95% CI 3.7 to 12) (very low quality evidence). Adverse events were not different between aspirin 1000 mg and placebo (RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.5), or aspirin 500 mg or 650 mg and placebo (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.0) (low quality evidence). Studies reported no serious adverse events. The quality of the evidence using GRADE comparing aspirin doses between 500 mg and 1000 mg with placebo was low or very low. Evidence was downgraded because of the small number of studies and events, and because the most important measures of efficacy were not reported. There were insufficient data to compare aspirin with any active comparator (paracetamol alone, paracetamol plus codeine, peppermint oil, or metamizole) at any of the doses tested.

Authors' Conclusions

A single dose of aspirin between 500 mg and 1000 mg provided some benefit in terms of less frequent use of rescue medication and more participants satisfied with treatment compared with placebo in adults with frequent episodic TTH who have an acute headache of moderate or severe intensity. There was no difference between a single dose of aspirin and placebo for the number of people experiencing adverse events. The amount and quality of the evidence was very limited and should be interpreted with caution.

### EFNS guideline on the treatment of tension-type headache-report of an EFNS task force [^111jiVTZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most prevalent headache type and is causing a high degree of disability. Treatment of frequent TTH is often difficult.

Objectives

To give evidence-based or expert recommendations for the different treatment procedures in TTH based on a literature search and the consensus of an expert panel.

Methods

All available medical reference systems were screened for the range of clinical studies on TTH. The findings in these studies were evaluated according to the recommendations of the EFNS resulting in level A, B or C recommendations and good practice points.

Recommendations

Non-drug management should always be considered although the scientific basis is limited. Information, reassurance and identification of trigger factors may be rewarding. Electromyography (EMG) biofeedback has a documented effect in TTH, whilst cognitive-behavioural therapy and relaxation training most likely are effective. Physical therapy and acupuncture may be valuable options for patients with frequent TTH, but there is no robust scientific evidence for efficacy. Simple analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended for the treatment of episodic TTH. Combination analgesics containing caffeine are drugs of second choice. Triptans, muscle relaxants and opioids should not be used. It is crucial to avoid frequent and excessive use of analgesics to prevent the development of medication-overuse headache. The tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline is drug of first choice for the prophylactic treatment of chronic TTH. Mirtazapine and venlafaxine are drugs of second choice. The efficacy of the prophylactic drugs is often limited, and treatment may be hampered by side effects.

Tension-type headache

Tension-type headache accounts for 45–80% of headache diagnoses in the general population. It is generally less severe than migraine, and patients may seek only reassurance. Many can manage with simple analgesia. People with chronic tension-type headache can use preventative treatments, for example, amitriptyline or topiramate. There is also evidence for non-pharmacological approaches, including acupuncture.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Tn3K8]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Headaches are common and cause distress and disability. The prevalence of migraine headaches ranges between 8.4% and 18% worldwide. Tension-type headaches are even more common, occurring in 16–30% of people worldwide, with 3% having headaches for more than 180 days a year. Migraine headaches alone cost the United States $1bn (£0.64bn; €0.75bn) in medical costs and $13bn in lost productivity a year.

Tricyclic antidepressants were first shown to be effective in preventing headaches in 1964and have become a standard modality in headache prevention. Based on current standards for preventive treatment in the United States, 43% of males and 34% of females who are candidates for such treatment are not receiving it. This may result from insufficient understanding of the magnitude of beneficial effects, an overestimation of adverse effects, or the presumption that efficacy is only confined to migraine headaches. In a previous meta-analysis of antidepressants for headaches, we found that antidepressants were effective in preventing headaches, equally for tension-type headaches and migraine headaches. This meta-analysis was limited by the relatively small number of available studies at the time. To expand on our previous systematic review we assessed the efficacy and tolerability of tricyclics in reducing the headache burden among adults with migraine or tension-type headache. We also compared tricyclics with other treatment modalities to assess whether the efficacy of tricyclics varies by type of headache, dose, and duration of treatment.

### Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis [^113vc6DG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture is often used for migraine prophylaxis but its effectiveness is still controversial. This review (along with a companion review on 'Acupuncture for tension-type headache') represents an updated version of a Cochrane review originally published in Issue 1, 2001, of The Cochrane Library.

Objectives

To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than 'sham' (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as other interventions in reducing headache frequency in patients with migraine.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pain, Palliative & Supportive Care Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Trials Register were searched to January 2008.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials with a post-randomization observation period of at least 8 weeks that compared the clinical effects of an acupuncture intervention with a control (no prophylactic treatment or routine care only), a sham acupuncture intervention or another intervention in patients with migraine.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers checked eligibility; extracted information on patients, interventions, methods and results; and assessed risk of bias and quality of the acupuncture intervention. Outcomes extracted included response (outcome of primary interest), migraine attacks, migraine days, headache days and analgesic use. Pooled effect size estimates were calculated using a random-effects model.

Main Results

Twenty-two trials with 4419 participants (mean 201, median 42, range 27 to 1715) met the inclusion criteria. Six trials (including two large trials with 401 and 1715 patients) compared acupuncture to no prophylactic treatment or routine care only. After 3 to 4 months patients receiving acupuncture had higher response rates and fewer headaches. The only study with long-term follow up saw no evidence that effects dissipated up to 9 months after cessation of treatment. Fourteen trials compared a 'true' acupuncture intervention with a variety of sham interventions. Pooled analyses did not show a statistically significant superiority for true acupuncture for any outcome in any of the time windows, but the results of single trials varied considerably. Four trials compared acupuncture to proven prophylactic drug treatment. Overall in these trials acupuncture was associated with slightly better outcomes and fewer adverse effects than prophylactic drug treatment. Two small low-quality trials comparing acupuncture with relaxation (alone or in combination with massage) could not be interpreted reliably.

Authors' Conclusions

In the previous version of this review, evidence in support of acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis was considered promising but insufficient. Now, with 12 additional trials, there is consistent evidence that acupuncture provides additional benefit to treatment of acute migraine attacks only or to routine care. There is no evidence for an effect of 'true' acupuncture over sham interventions, though this is difficult to interpret, as exact point location could be of limited importance. Available studies suggest that acupuncture is at least as effective as, or possibly more effective than, prophylactic drug treatment, and has fewer adverse effects. Acupuncture should be considered a treatment option for patients willing to undergo this treatment.

Despite the tremendous socioeconomic impact of tension-type headache surprisingly little is known about the underlying pathophysiology and treatment.

### Tension-type headache: current research and clinical management [^113hEycj]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common form of headache, and chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) is one of the most neglected and difficult types of headache to treat. The pathogenesis of TTH is multifactorial and varies between forms and individuals. Peripheral mechanisms (myofascial nociception) and central mechanisms (sensitisation and inadequate endogenous pain control) are intermingled: the former predominate in infrequent and frequent TTH, whereas the latter predominate in CTTH. Acute therapy is effective for episodes of TTH, whereas preventive treatment — which is indicated for frequent and chronic TTH — is, on average, not effective. For most patients with CTTH, the combination of drug therapies and non-drug therapies (such as relaxation and stress management techniques or physical therapies) is recommended. There is clearly an urgent need to improve the management of patients who are disabled by headache. This Review summarises the present knowledge on TTH and discusses some of its more problematic features.

### Increasing the usefulness of acupuncture guideline recommendations [^114KD3hV]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Do guidelines make recommendations for all questions of clinical interest?

Patients and clinicians often encounter situations in which limited evidence is available to support the use of an intervention. Even when there is uncertainty, clinicians still prefer to have guidelines rather than relying on systematic reviews, as it saves time and effort. In a randomised controlled trial that presented 500 clinicians with a clinical scenario for which sparse evidence was available, 80% of participants preferred receiving a recommendation. However, 22% of the guidelines from conventional medicine organisations that included evidence on acupuncture with low or very low certainty refrained from making recommendations. For example, the 2021 US Department of Veterans Affairs guidelines on primary care management of headache mentioned acupuncture but did not make any relevant recommendation. By contrast, the UK guidelines (rightly in our view) made a conditional recommendation suggesting up to 10 sessions of acupuncture over 5–8 weeks for prevention of chronic tension type headache despite low certainty of evidence compared with no treatment.

A recent overview of reviewsfound low or very low certainty of evidence for moderate to large benefits from acupuncture in 50 diseases or conditions. Despite the substantial potential benefits documented, clinical guidelines disregarded acupuncture as an alternative in 15 of these diseases or conditions (table 1).

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for the prevention of migraine in adults [^117GAc8k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2005 on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for preventing migraine and tension-type headache. The original review has been split in two parts and this review now only regards migraine prevention. Another updated review is under development to cover tension-type headache. Migraine is a common disorder. The chronic forms are associated with disability and have a high economic impact. In view of discoveries about the role of serotonin and other neurotransmitters in pain mechanisms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been evaluated for the prevention of migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs and SNRIs compared to placebo and other active interventions in the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine in adults.

Search Methods

For the original review, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to January 2004), EMBASE (1994 to May 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2003, Issue 4), and Headache Quarterly (1990 to 2003). For this update, we applied a revised search strategy to reflect the broader type of intervention (SSRIs and SNRIs). We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2014), EMBASE (1980 to November 2014), and PsycINFO (1987 to November 2014). We also checked the reference lists of retrieved articles and searched trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with any type of control intervention in participants 18 years and older of either sex with migraine.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data (migraine frequency, index, intensity, and duration; use of symptomatic/analgesic medication; days off work; quality of life; mood improvement; cost-effectiveness; and adverse events) and assessed the risk of bias of trials. The primary outcome of this updated review is migraine frequency.

Main Results

The original review included eight studies on migraine. Overall, we now include 11 studies on five SSRIs and one SNRI with a total of 585 participants. Six studies were placebo-controlled, four compared a SSRI or SNRI to amitriptyline, and one was a head-to-head comparison (escitalopram versus venlafaxine). Most studies had methodological or reporting shortcomings (or both): all studies were at unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. Follow-up rarely extended beyond three months. The lack of adequate power of most of the studies is also a major concern. Few studies explored the effect of SSRIs or SNRIs on migraine frequency, the primary endpoint. Two studies with unclear reporting compared SSRIs and SNRIs to placebo, suggesting a lack of evidence for a difference. Two studies compared SSRIs or SNRIs versus amitriptyline and found no evidence for a difference in terms of migraine frequency (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.72 to 0.80; I(2) = 72%), or other secondary outcomes such as migraine intensity and duration.SSRIs or SNRIs were generally more tolerable than tricyclics. However, the two groups did not differ in terms of the number of participants who withdrew due to adverse advents or for other reasons (one study, odds ratio (OR) 0.39, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.50 and OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.34). We did not find studies comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with pharmacological treatments other than antidepressants (e.g. antiepileptics and anti-hypertensives).

Authors' Conclusions

Since the last version of this review, the new included studies have not added high quality evidence to support the use of SSRIs or venlafaxine as preventive drugs for migraine. There is no evidence to consider SSRIs or venlafaxine as more effective than placebo or amitriptyline in reducing migraine frequency, intensity, and duration over two to three months of treatment. No reliable information is available at longer-term follow-up. Our conclusion is that the use of SSRIs and SNRIs for migraine prophylaxis is not supported by evidence.

### Botulinum toxins in the treatment of migraine and tension-type headaches [^117HGqRQ]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxins are promising preventive treatments for patients with moderate to severe episodic and chronic migraine and chronic daily headache. The recommended indications for botulinum toxins as preventive therapy lend themselves to the following patient types: those who demonstrate a lack of improvement from preventive (prophylactic) pharmacotherapy; those who experience severe and intolerable adverse events from preventive medications; those who refuse to use daily medications; those who have contraindications to acute migraine therapy, and elderly patients with chronic migraine. Both open-label and double-blind placebo-controlled studies using fixed-site, "follow the pain". or a combination approach have demonstrated significant reduction in migraine frequency, severity, and duration, as well as decreased use of acute medications. The most prominent reductions have been noted in those with reportedly the most severe migraine headaches. Large, well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are recommended to further clarify optimum dosage and location of injection, reduce treatment frequency and duration, and address other primary headache disorders that may benefit from this therapy.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jWBjJ]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To evaluate the efficacy and relative adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of migraine, tension-type, and mixed headaches.

Design Meta-analysis.

Data sources Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Trials Registry, and PsycLIT.

Studies reviewed Randomised trials of adults receiving tricyclics as only treatment for a minimum of four weeks.

Data extraction Frequency of headaches (number of headache attacks for migraine and number of days with headache for tension-type headaches), intensity of headache, and headache index.

Results 37 studies met the inclusion criteria. Tricyclics significantly reduced the number of days with tension-type headache and number of headache attacks from migraine than placebo (average standardised mean difference −1.29, 95% confidence interval −2.18 to −0.39 and −0.70, −0.93 to −0.48) but not compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (−0.80, −2.63 to 0.02 and −0.20, −0.60 to 0.19). The effect of tricyclics increased with longer duration of treatment (β = −0.11, 95% confidence interval −0.63 to −0.15; P < 0.0005). Tricyclics were also more likely to reduce the intensity of headaches by at least 50% than either placebo (tension-type: relative risk 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.89; migraine: 1.80, 1.24 to 2.62) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (1.73, 1.34 to 2.22 and 1.72, 1.15 to 2.55). Tricyclics were more likely to cause adverse effects than placebo (1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 2.12) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (2.22, 1.52 to 3.32), including dry mouth (P < 0.0005 for both), drowsiness (P < 0.0005 for both), and weight gain (P < 0.001 for both), but did not increase dropout rates (placebo: 1.22, 0.83 to 1.80, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: 1.16, 0.81 to 2.97).

Conclusions Tricyclic antidepressants are effective in preventing migraine and tension-type headaches and are more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, although with greater adverse effects. The effectiveness of tricyclics seems to increase over time.

### Headache (chronic tension-type) [^112dc4yL]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) is a disorder that evolves from episodic tension-type headache, with daily or very frequent episodes of headache lasting minutes to days. It affects 4.1% of the general population in the United States, and is more prevalent in women (up to 65% of cases).

Methods and Objectives

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for chronic tension-type headache? What are the effects of non-drug treatments for chronic tension-type headache? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2005 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 38 systematic reviews, RCTs or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, amitriptyline, benzodiazepines, botulinum toxin, cognitive behavioural therapy, Indian head massage, mirtazapine, regular acute pain relief medication, relaxation and electromyographic biofeedback, serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, and tricyclic antidepressants (other than amitriptyline).

### The effectiveness of botulinum toxin for chronic tension-type headache prophylaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113MFCr6]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A systematic and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the evidence of the effects of botulinum toxin A on chronic tension-type headache.

Methods

Cochrane, Embase, Ovid, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Web-of-Science databases, and ClinicallTrials.gov registry were systematically searched for studies examining the effects of botulinum toxin A on tension-type headaches. The records were screened by two independent reviewers using pre-determined eligibility criteria. DerSimonian Liard random-effects meta-analyses were performed using the 'meta' package (5.2–0) in R (4.2.0). Risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Tool RoB 2 and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Clinical significance was determined using pre-defined minimal clinically important differences.

Results

Eleven controlled trials were included (390 botulinum toxin A, 297 controls). Botulinum toxin A was associated with significant improvements in standardized headache intensity (-0.502 standard deviations [-0.945, -0.058]), headache frequency (-2.830 days/month [-4.082, -1.578]), daily headache duration (-0.965 [-1.860, -0.069]) and the frequency of acute pain medication use (-2.200 days/month [-3.485, -0.915]) vs controls. Botulinum toxin A-associated improvements exceeded minimal clinically important differences for headache intensity, frequency, and acute pain medication use. A 79% (28%, 150%) greater response rate was observed for botulinum toxin A vs controls in improving chronic tension-type headache. Treatment of eight chronic tension-type headache patients was sufficient to elicit a therapeutic response in one patient.

Conclusions

Corroborating the current mechanistic evidence, our meta-analysis supports the utility of botulinum toxin A for managing chronic tension-type headaches. However, due to limitations in the quality of evidence, adequately-powered high-quality controlled trials examining the effects of Botulinum toxin A on chronic tension-type headache are warranted.

### Assessment and management of tension-type headaches [^1175YYUU]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Tension-type headache (TTH) is a bilateral, nonthrobbing, band-like headache considered the most common headache disorder and prevalent neurologic disorder worldwide. Despite the widespread prevalence of TTH, the pathophysiology remains elusive, with current research indicating a complex mix of physiologic, psychological, and environmental systems that contribute to the initiation and perpetuation of TTH. The mainstay treatment for acute episodes includes simple analgesics, while more chronic and frequent episodes require preventative therapy with lifestyle and behavioral modification, psychobehavioral treatments, integrative health, and pharmacologic therapy such as tricyclic agents or antidepressants.

### Tension-type headache [^111gAMXG]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Tension-type headache typically causes pain that radiates in a band-like fashion bilaterally from the forehead to the occiput. Pain often radiates to the neck muscles and is described as tightness, pressure, or dull ache. Migraine-type features (unilateral, throbbing pain, nausea, photophobia) are not present All patients with frequent or severe headaches need careful evaluation to exclude any occult serious condition that may be causing the headache. Neuroimaging is not needed in patients who have no worrisome findings on examination. Treatment of tension-type headache typically involves the use of over-the-counter analgesics. Use of pain relievers more than twice weekly places patients at risk for progression to chronic daily headache. Sedating antihistamines or antiemetics can potentiate the pain-relieving effects of standard analgesics. Analgesics combined with butalbital or opiates are often useful for tension-type pain but have an increased risk of causing chronic daily headache. Amitriptyline is the most widely researched prophylactic agent for frequent headaches. No large trials with rigorous methodologies have been conducted for most non-medication therapies. Among the commonly employed modalities are biofeedback, relaxation training, self-hypnosis, and cognitive therapy.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^113Z9CMo]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1.2. Other primary headaches

Recommendations:

1.1.2.1. Individuals satisfying criteria for chronic migraine or with a history of chronic migraine in the last 12 months should be excluded from pivotal efficacy trials for the acute treatment of migraine. In subsequent trials, exploration of the benefits of new acute treatments in subjects with chronic migraine is needed.

1.1.2.2. Subjects with other concomitant primary headache types (e.g. tension-type headache) are allowed if attacks are infrequent (i.e. present on an average of < 1 day/month and < 12 days/year) and can be differentiated from migraine based on the quality of pain and associated symptoms.

Comments:

Individuals with chronic migraine are excluded from the initial clinical trials of acute treatment because they may complicate analyses of efficacy in undifferentiated populations (refer to for guidance about trials evaluating preventive treatments in adults with chronic migraine). Subjects with migraine may have other primary headache types, including tension-type headache. Those experiencing primary headaches that cannot be distinguished from ICHD-defined migraine without aura should be excluded.

1.1.3. Secondary headaches

Recommendation:

Individuals with secondary headaches, including medication-overuse headache, should be excluded.

Comments:

Excessive use of acute medications for migraine does not necessarily lead to medication-overuse headache, and some individuals may fulfil IHS criteria for overuse of acute medications without suffering from a chronic pattern of headache. The secondary headache exclusion also applies to these subjects.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of pharmacological preventive treatment for persistent post-traumatic headache attributed to mild traumatic brain injury [^113mwgDU]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Persistent headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head is divided into two subtypes, one attributed to moderate or severe traumatic injury and another attributed to mild traumatic injury (i.e., concussion). The latter is much more prevalent, in part because more than 90% of cases with traumatic brain injury are classified as mild. The pathophysiology of persistent post-traumatic headache is poorly understood and the underlying mechanisms are likely multifactorial. There is currently no approved treatment specifically for persistent post-traumatic headache, and management strategies rely on medications used for migraine or tension-type headache. Therefore, high-quality trials are urgently needed to support clinical decision-making and optimize management strategies. International guidelines can facilitate appropriate trial design and ensure the acquisition of high-quality data evaluating the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of available and novel pharmacological therapies for the preventive treatment of persistent post-traumatic headache.

Methods

The development of this guideline was based on a literature review of available studies in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, along with a review of previously published guidelines for controlled trials of preventive treatment for episodic and chronic migraine. The identified literature was critically appraised, and due to the scarcity of scientific evidence, recommendations were primarily based on the consensus of experts in the field.

Objective

To provide guidelines for designing state-of-the-art controlled clinical trials aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of preventive treatments for persistent post-traumatic headache attributed to mild traumatic brain injury.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^111zkTx2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

Headache medicine and therapeutics evidence have been rapidly expanding and evolving since the 2020 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the management of headache. Therefore, the CPG was revised in 2023, earlier than the standard 5-year cycle. This article reviews the 2023 CPG recommendations relevant to primary care clinicians for treatment and prevention of migraine and tension-type headache (TTH).

Methods

Subject experts from the VA and the DoD developed 12 key questions, which guided a systematic search using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After reviewing evidence from 5 databases published between 6 March 2019 and 16 August 2022, the work group considered the strength and quality of the evidence, patient preferences, and benefits versus harms on critical outcomes before making consensus recommendations.

Recommendations

The revised CPG includes 52 recommendations on evaluation, pharmacotherapy, invasive interventions, and nonpharmacologic interventions for selected primary and secondary headache disorders. In addition to triptans and aspirin-acetaminophen-caffeine, newer calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors (gepants) are options for treatment of acute migraine. Medications to prevent episodic migraine (EM) include angiotensin-receptor blockers, lisinopril, magnesium, topiramate, valproate, memantine, the newer CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and atogepant. AbobotulinumtoxinA can be used for prevention of chronic migraine but not EM. Gabapentin is not recommended for prevention of EM. Ibuprofen (400 mg) and acetaminophen (1000 mg) can be used for treatment of TTH, and amitriptyline for prevention of chronic TTH. Physical therapy or aerobic exercise can be used in management of TTH and migraines.

### Determining the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the preventive treatment of menstrual migraine: a protocol for a PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis [^111aBhZ2]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

While creating this SR and meta-analysis protocol, we consult the globally recognized checklist of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P, uploaded in). Additionally, to promote research transparency, we have registered our protocol in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under registration number CRD42022367446.

Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility of the trials will be assessed using the validated 'PICOS' establishment for a SR and meta-analysis, which are shown below in further detail.

Study Designs

The eligible research type for our SR and meta-analysis will be limited to RCTs that aim to examine the effect of acupuncture therapy for MM, regardless of the publication language. Additionally, we will only include the results of the two groups prior to crossover in the meta-analysis for crossing over RCTs. Reviews, case series, non-RCTs, or other ineligible research types will not be taken into account.

Participants

Participants have a confirmed diagnosis of MM based on the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria or other standards that generally matched the IHS diagnostic criteria. Participants who have been given a diagnosis of tension-type headache, chronic migraine, cluster headache, other primary headaches, secondary headache brought about by otorhinolaryngological illnesses or intracranial pathological alterations will be disqualified from the study. There will be no limitations on participants' nationality, gender, or age.

Interventions in the Experimental Group

Acupuncture therapy must be used in the test group. Notably, acupuncture can be employed in the test group alone or in conjunction with other positive treatments that are the same as those used in the control arm. For our study, the definition of acupuncture therapy responds to acupuncture modalities involving skin penetrating, such as auricular acupuncture, warming-needle moxibustion, electroacupuncture (EA), manual acupuncture (MA) and so on. The clinical variability among the included studies will be reduced as a result of this prospective definition of acupuncture therapy. Studies using non-penetrating acupuncture methods, such as laser acupuncture and acupressure, are not permitted in such a situation.

Interventions in the Control Group

Active therapies, such as medication, counseling, physical therapy, and surgery, as recommended by guidelines.
Sham acupuncture and other placebo measures.
Blank control (no treatment).

Chronic tension-type headache — botulinum/neurotoxin injection for prevention is addressed with the directive, "We suggest against botulinum/neurotoxin injection for the prevention of chronic tension-type headache". Supporting evidence notes that "Both SRs showed no statistically significant difference in the critical outcomes of incidence of monthly headaches or change in headache and migraine days when the intervention was compared with placebo in patients experiencing chronic TTH", and one SR found only "a statistically significant but small effect size (SMD: -0.35) difference over placebo for headache episode intensity and no difference in AEs". The recommendation was "categorized as Reviewed, Not changed", with "The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence" stated as "very low", and the Work Group judged that "The potential harm of botulinum toxin (e.g. Botox), which included opportunity cost and a small AE profile, outweighed the benefits of the small potential for reducing the intensity of headache episodes".

Relieving Muscle Tension

Migraine attacks have been classically divided into prodromal, aura, headache, and postdromal phases. A retrospective study found that the symptom with the highest co-occurrence throughout all migraine phases was neck stiffness. Massage is a passive way of exercising muscles and relaxing the mind because it improves muscle endurance and flexibility. Therefore, it is beneficial to relieve muscle tension, anxiety, and depression caused by migraine. Studies have shown that massage can reduce muscle tension that leads to migraine by breaking down subcutaneous adhesions, preventing fibrosis, and improving blood and lymphatic circulation. Massage is a commonly used manual treatment in TCM. A systematic review of manual therapy for migraine showed that manual therapy may be as effective as modern drugs for the prevention of migraine. In addition, patients who received massage reported a 27–28% improvement in migraine frequency compared to baseline.

### Guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in tension-type headache: second edition [^115EaGzs]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

The Clinical Trials Subcommittee of the International Headache Society published its first edition of the guidelines on controlled trials of drugs in tension-type headache in 1995. These aimed 'to improve the quality of controlled clinical trials in tension-type headache', because 'good quality controlled trials are the only way to convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of a drug, and form the basis for international agreement on drug therapy'. The Committee published similar guidelines for clinical trials in migraine and cluster headache. Since 1995 several studies on the treatment of episodic and chronic tension-type headache have been published, providing new information on trial methodology for this disorder. Furthermore, the classification of the headaches, including tension-type headache, has been revised. These developments support the need for also revising the guidelines for drug treatments in tension-type headache. These Guidelines are intended to assist in the design of well-controlled clinical trials in tension-type headache.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Headache — preventive pharmacotherapy selection notes that comparative efficacy is either conflicting or shows no difference across preventive medications; in cluster headache, a network meta-analysis comparing verapamil and galcanezumab found no statistically significant difference in number of cluster headache episodes, and randomized controlled trials were limited by small sample size. The Work Group categorized this topic as Reviewed, New-added and stated its confidence in the evidence was very low, citing limitations including small sample size, conflicting critical outcomes, and inconsistent dosing between studies with subtherapeutic dosing. Management should be individualized, considering administration, monitoring, safety, and patient values and preferences to balance benefits versus risks and harms. Accordingly, the Work Group recommends: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific medication over another for the prevention of migraine headache, tension headache, or cluster headache.

### Risk factors for migraine disease progression: a narrative review for a patient-centered approach [^11673Jbt]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Suggesting the use of a diary to track the frequency, intensity, and nature of these risk factors will allow the patient and the clinician to monitor the progression of the disease over time, to quickly identify if the disease is progressing, or to discern if changes need to be made to the patient's treatment plan. Clinicians can also educate their patients on healthy lifestyle choices and how to implement change. One specific protective action with moderate evidence for individuals experiencing high numbers of MHDs (≥ 5 for moderate risk and ≥ 10 for high risk) is progressive muscle relaxation. A longitudinal study of this technique demonstrated a 41% reduction in the number of migraine attacks and a 43% reduction in migraine days.

Integrating non-pharmacologic approaches such as regular exercise, neuromodulation, biofeedback, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), relaxation therapies, mindfulness-based therapies, and acceptance and commitment therapy may also have the potential to prevent migraine progression through multiple means, including reducing headache days, reducing associated disability, possibly reducing acute medication overuse, and improving resilience, coping skills, and behavioral management strategies. Biobehavioral and neuromodulation therapies are listed in the American Headache Society consensus statement for acute (neuromodulation) and/or preventive (neuromodulation and behavioral therapies) treatment of migraine. For example, CBT, biofeedback, and relaxation training have been validated for prevention to improve measures of severity (including intensity, duration, and frequency) of migraine and tension-type attacks, as well as comorbid depression, anxiety, and HRQoL in a longitudinal randomized controlled trial. There are a variety of neuromodulation options for both acute and preventive treatment of migraine, such as remote electrical neuromodulation, noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation, external trigeminal nerve stimulation, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, and supraorbital transcutaneous stimulation, that have been established as safe and effective preventive therapies for migraine.

### Mechanisms of tension-type headache [^117HdawN]. Cephalalgia (2001). Low credibility.

Despite tension-type headache represents one of the most frequent and costly diseases in modern society only very little research on this disease has actually been carried out. In contrast to former belief tension-type headache is a separate entity that can and should be separated from migraine. No specific biochemical abnormalities have yet been identified but a reliable human model of tension-type headache has been developed by means of infusion of a NO-donor, glyceryl trinitrate. Myofascial factors and peripheral sensitization of nociceptors play an important role in the episodic form, and central sensitization has been demonstrated in the chronic form. As chronic tension-type headache usually evolves from the episodic form, prevention and reversal of this central sensitization may be an important target for future pathophysiological studies and drug development.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^111Aqxb6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Tension-type headache preventive therapy — We suggest amitriptyline for the prevention of chronic tension-type headache. (Weak for | Reviewed, Not changed) An SR of three RCTs examined amitriptyline (50 mg and 100 mg dosing) versus placebo in chronic TTH and found a reduction of monthly headache days after 4 weeks of 6.2 fewer days per month than placebo (95% CI: -8.1 to -4.2), with similar findings at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. Caution should be used in patients 65 years of age and older because of anticholinergic effects, and regardless of cardiac history, it is recommended that any patients at higher risk for cardiac arrhythmias consult with a cardiologist. Although the risk of overdose can occur with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), the rate of hospitalization is greater with TCAs because of a narrower therapeutic index; when more than 10 mg/kg of a TCA is ingested, mild to moderate poisoning occurs with severe anticholinergic effects, and when more than 15–20 mg/kg is ingested (> 1000mg, versus clinical dose of 10–20mg), the patient will present with the symptoms of severe poisoning, including coma, seizure, cardiac arrhythmias, and death; risk of serotonin syndrome is present when amitriptyline is combined with other serotonergic medications, and all antidepressants carry the boxed warning of increased risk of suicidality in children, adolescents, and young adults.

### Memantine for the prevention of primary headache disorders [^113LRnQu]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the current data evaluating the efficacy and safety of memantine for the prevention of primary headache disorders.

Data Sources

A literature search using MEDLINE (1966-July 2014) and EMBASE (1973-July 2014) was conducted using the search terms memantine, headache, migraine, glutamate, and NMDA. References of identified articles were reviewed for additional, relevant citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles dealing with the use of memantine for prevention of primary headache disorders were included.

Data Synthesis

Data from several retrospective reports and 2 prospective clinical trials suggest that memantine may be a useful treatment option for the prevention of primary headache disorders. The majority of available literature focuses specifically on chronic migraine prevention in refractory patients who had failed multiple previous prophylactic therapies. In these patients, 10 to 20 mg of memantine daily reduced the frequency and intensity of migraine headaches and was generally well tolerated, with few adverse events. Data regarding the efficacy of memantine for other primary headache disorders such as chronic tension type and cluster headaches are limited.

Conclusion

Although further studies evaluating the efficacy of memantine for prevention of primary headache disorders are warranted, memantine may be a reasonable option, used either as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, in the refractory chronic migraine prophylaxis setting.

### Lack of benefit for prophylactic drugs of tension-type headache in adults: a systematic review [^114nk5CP]. Family Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of prophylactic drugs for chronic tension-type headache (TTH) in adults.

Methods

We searched several databases from inception to August 2009. We selected randomized trials that reported the effects of prophylactic drugs in patients with TTH, with a pain measure (intensity, frequency, duration, improvement or index) as outcome measure. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the original reports. A data synthesis was carried out according to the type of medication.

Results

We included 44 trials (3399 patients), of which 15 (34.1%) were considered to be of low risk of bias. Main types of medications studied were antidepressants, muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines and vasodilator agents. Overall, antidepressants were no more effective than placebo, and there were no significant differences between different types of antidepressants. There was conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and vasodilator agents compared with placebo. Furthermore, there was limited evidence that propranolol had negative effects on depression in TTH patients, when compared with placebo or biofeedback. There was no evidence concerning the effectiveness of muscle relaxants alone or 5-HT receptor agonist compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Overall, antidepressants were no more effective on headache intensity or frequency and analgesic use than placebo. Propranolol seemed to have negative effects on depression in TTH patients when compared with placebo or biofeedback. No evidence was found for the use of muscle relaxants alone or 5-HT receptor agonist.

### Conservative treatments of children with episodic tension-type headache. A systematic review [^111FsbZp]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of conservative treatments in children with tension-type headaches (TTH).

Method

We searched Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library and performed reference checking. Two independent authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. Analysis was carried out according to type of intervention.

Results

In total we included 11 trials (427 TTH patients, age between 7–18 years) in this review. None of the studies were considered to be of high quality. Eight studies evaluated the effectiveness of relaxation training. Four studies included a waiting list or no treatment control group and in one study a placebo was used.

Conclusion

We found conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of relaxation therapy when compared with no treatment or other treatments, with Relative Risks varying from 1.4 (0.6–3.2) to 10.6 (1.6–71.3). With regard to all other interventions evaluated (such as biofeedback, cognitive therapy or flupirtin) no evidence is found for or against their effectiveness.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy for children with headaches: will an app Do the trick? [^116Cvsok]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Headaches are one of the most frequently reported health concerns among children, with 5% to 15% of youth suffering from migraine and 15% to 25% from tension-type headache. – Although the prevalence of frequent or severe headaches has been largely constant over the years, headache-related disability, particularly school absenteeism, has increased. Children with headaches also suffer from poor sleep quality, increased rates of anxiety and depression, and overall lower quality of life.

Pharmaceutical approaches for the prophylactic treatment of pediatric migraine and tension-type headache have traditionally been based on agents that are not headache-specific and have low efficacy in the pediatric age group, including amitriptyline, propranolol, and topiramate. More recent pharmacologic approaches such as CGRP inhibitors have not yet been approved in pediatric age groups. Nonpharmacologic therapies have shown similar effects to drug therapies for headache prevention; however, they are potentially more accessible and at times less expensive. Success of migraine therapy is influenced by a number of factors including anxiety surrounding headache events, and psychological comorbidities. Factors contributing to the efficacy of nonpharmacologic interventions include patient preference, poor tolerance or negative side effects from medications, inability to cope with stress or pain, and comorbid psychological conditions.

The prevalence of non-migrainous headache is 10–25% in childhood and adolescence. Although tension-type headache and migraine are the two most common types of headache in children and adolescents, most articles address migraine headache. The distinction of tension-type headache from migraine can be difficult; use of The International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria helps. However, these criteria might be too restrictive to differentiate tension-type headache from migraine without aura in children. The pathophysiology of tension-type headache is largely unknown. The smaller genetic effect on tension-type headache than on migraine suggests that the two disorders are distinct. However, many believe that tension-type headache and migraine represent the same pathophysiological spectrum. Some indications of effective treatment exist. For children with frequent headache, the antidepressant amitriptyline might be beneficial for prophylaxis, although no placebo-controlled studies have been done. Restricted studies have suggested the efficacy of psychological and cognitive behavioural approaches in the treatment of childhood tension-type headache.

### Supportive self-management program for people with chronic headaches and migraine: a randomized controlled trial and economic evaluation [^115Srviw]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The CHESS intervention in the absence of a clinical effect seems to generate additional QALYs and has a high probability of cost-effectiveness given UK cost-effectiveness thresholds. The EQ-5D-5L might be measuring nonspecific effects not captured by the HIT-6 or it might be that the early effect on headache-related disability has had a larger proportional effect in the area under the curve analysis.

The control intervention was more than just usual care; the results of the classification interview were fed back to participants and their GPs, which might have reduced any potential effect size from the CHESS intervention if people in the control group used medication more appropriately in light of our feedback. However, the absence of any differences over time in either group in the use of prophylactic medications make it unlikely that improved diagnosis in the control group affected our findings.

The trial found no evidence of any clinically relevant benefit from the CHESS intervention across multiple outcomes, at multiple time points, or in any sensitivity or subgroup analyses. It clearly demonstrates the intervention tested here is ineffective and not detrimental. This is surprising because the CHESS intervention targeted the key modifiable psychological variables known to be predictive of poor prognosis in chronic headache disorders, had a solid theoretical underpinning, intervention fidelity was high, and it was well regarded by participants and facilitators. Only 3/21 studies (N = 183) in a 2019 Cochrane review of psychological therapies for the prevention of migraine were predominately of people likely to have chronic migraine. Overall, these studies and our trial do not indicate that behavioral/educational interventions have any meaningful effect on clinical outcomes for people with chronic migraine. A search of trial registries (June 2022) identified 2 trials of behavioral interventions for chronic migraine in progress; a mindfulness intervention for chronic migraine, Identifier: NCT03671681, and a health education program for the prevention of chronic migraine NCT04788667.

In conclusion, our data effectively exclude the possibility that this short intervention is effective for the treatment of chronic migraine or chronic tension–type headache and episodic migraine. There remains a need to identify more effective treatments for people living with, the sometimes disabling, symptoms of chronic migraine or chronic tension–type headache and episodic migraine.

### Specific strength training compared with interdisciplinary counseling for girls with tension-type headache: a randomized controlled trial [^115kxToE]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Frequent episodic and chronic childhood tension-type headache (TTH) is a prevalent and debilitating situation for the child and family. After clarifying the diagnosis in an interdisciplinary setting, nonpharmacological treatments are usually the first choice of professionals and parents. Because many parents are reluctant to choose preventive medication for their child, patient education is an important aspect of pediatric headache team services. The focus is on empowering the family to incorporate a healthy lifestyle at home and at school to actively prevent the development or triggering of headache. The most basic lifestyle factors that a discussion (between nurse/physical therapist and parent) can contribute to are sufficiency of sleep, liquids, food, activity level, and how to handle psychosocial stressors.

For nonpharmacological behavioral treatments, patient education on relaxation therapy with or without electromyographic or thermal biofeedback has shown, over the last 20 years, substantial evidence in reducing headache frequency in both children and adults.–Passive acupunctural laser therapy has also shown positive effects in a controlled trial on headache frequency. Andrasik et alcompared preventive medication with amitriptyline and relaxation therapy for juvenile TTH and found clinical improvements from both interventions at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Relaxation therapy showed better compliance and acceptance by parents. Even though these effects are supported by evidence, use in practice is more limited than expected. A major limitation is that interventions such as relaxation therapy require approximately up to ten 1-hour sessions in which a trained expert teaches the child with the use of specialized equipment. As families are busy and society resources sparse, there is a need for educational approaches that are not only less costly but also more accessible and flexible, which is why internet-based self-help interventions are on the rise; other alternatives are warranted.

### Nocebo is the enemy, not placebo. A meta-analysis of reported side effects after placebo treatment in headaches [^111rsGSY]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

The aim was to determine the magnitude of the nocebo (adverse effects following placebo administration) in clinical trials for primary headache disorders. We reviewed randomized, placebo-controlled studies for migraine, tension-type headache (TTH), and cluster headache treatments published between 1998 and 2009. The frequency of nocebo was estimated by the percentage of placebo-treated patients reporting at least one adverse side effect. The dropout frequency was estimated by the percentage of placebo-treated patients who discontinued the treatment due to intolerance. In studies of symptomatic treatment for migraine, the nocebo and dropout frequencies were 18.45% and 0.33%, but rose to 42.78% and 4.75% in preventative treatment studies. In trials for prevention of TTH, nocebo and dropout frequencies were 23.99% and 5.44%. For symptomatic treatment of cluster headache, the nocebo frequency was 18.67%. Nocebo is prevalent in clinical trials for primary headaches, particularly in preventive treatment studies. Dropouts due to nocebo effect may confound the interpretation of many clinical trials.

### Nocebo in headache [^116e96X4]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article addresses nocebo in headache. Nocebo is the antipode of placebo and refers to adverse events a person manifests after receiving placebo.

Recent Findings

In randomized trials for migraine prevention meta-analyses revealed that eight out of 20 patients treated with placebo experienced any adverse event. More importantly, one out of 20 patients treated with placebo withdrew treatment because of adverse events. The adverse events in placebo groups mirrored the adverse events expected of the active medication studied, confirming that pretrial suggestions induce the adverse events in placebo-treated patients. Nocebo was higher in preventive treatments than in symptomatic ones. Among preventive migraine treatments botulin toxin A showed the lowest nocebo. Generally, the safer a drug was the less nocebo was induced. Nocebo was similar in trials for tension-type headache. To predict and prevent nocebo consequences a 4-item self-fulfilled questionnaire (Q-No) has been developed, with 72% specificity and 67% sensitivity.

Summary

Although nocebo remains largely unknown in the medical community, it limits adherence and treatment outcomes significantly in preventive treatments for migraine and tension-type headache. The Q-No questionnaire may help in predicting nocebo, whereas individualized strategies are needed to prevent nocebo consequences.

### Global, regional, and national burden of migraine and tension-type headache, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^115jyzNn]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) studies, headache has emerged as a major global public health concern. We aimed to use data from the GBD 2016 study to provide new estimates for prevalence and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for migraine and tension-type headache and to present the methods and results in an accessible way for clinicians and researchers of headache disorders.

Methods

Data were derived from population-based cross-sectional surveys on migraine and tension-type headache. Prevalence for each sex and 5-year age group interval (ie, age 5 years to ≥ 95 years) at different time points from 1990 and 2016 in all countries and GBD regions were estimated using a Bayesian meta-regression model. Disease burden measured in YLDs was calculated from prevalence and average time spent with headache multiplied by disability weights (a measure of the relative severity of the disabling consequence of a disease). The burden stemming from medication overuse headache, which was included in earlier iterations of GBD as a separate cause, was subsumed as a sequela of either migraine or tension-type headache. Because no deaths were assigned to headaches as the underlying cause, YLDs equate to disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We also analysed results on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility.

Findings

Almost three billion individuals were estimated to have a migraine or tension-type headache in 2016: 1·89 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1·71–2·10) with tension-type headache and 1·04 billion (95% UI 1·00–1·09) with migraine. However, because migraine had a much higher disability weight than tension-type headache, migraine caused 45·1 million (95% UI 29·0–62·8) and tension-type headache only 7·2 million (95% UI 4·6–10·5) YLDs globally in 2016. The headaches were most burdensome in women between ages 15 and 49 years, with migraine causing 20·3 million (95% UI 12·9–28·5) and tension-type headache 2·9 million (95% UI 1·8–4·2) YLDs in 2016, which was 11·2% of all YLDs in this age group and sex. Age-standardised DALYs for each headache type showed a small increase as SDI increased.

Interpretation

Although current estimates are based on limited data, our study shows that headache disorders, and migraine in particular, are important causes of disability worldwide, and deserve greater attention in health policy debates and research resource allocation. Future iterations of this study, based on sources from additional countries and with less methodological heterogeneity, should help to provide stronger evidence of the need for action.

### Headache cessation by an educational intervention in grammar schools: a cluster randomized trial [^114Q8eEi]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Headache is a common health problem in adolescents. There are a number of risk factors for headache in adolescents that are amenable to intervention. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of a low-level headache prevention programme in the classroom setting to prevent these risk factors.

Methods

In all, 1674 students in 8th-10th grade at 12 grammar schools in greater Munich, Germany, were cluster randomized into intervention and control groups. A standardized 60-min prevention lesson focusing on preventable risk factors for headache (physical inactivity, coffee consumption, alcohol consumption and smoking) and providing instructions on stress management and neck and shoulder muscle relaxation exercises was given in a classroom setting. Seven months later, students were reassessed. The main outcome parameter was headache cessation. Logistic regression models with random effects for cluster and adjustment for baseline risk factors were calculated.

Results

Nine hundred students (intervention group N = 450, control group N = 450) with headache at baseline and complete data for headache and confounders were included in the analysis. Headache cessation was observed in 9.78% of the control group compared with 16.22% in the intervention group (number needed to treat = 16). Accounting for cluster effects and confounders, the probability of headache cessation in the intervention group was 1.77 (95% confidence interval = [1.08; 2.90]) higher than in the control group. The effect was most pronounced in adolescents with tension-type headache: odds ratio = 2.11 (95% confidence interval = [1.15; 3.80]).

Conclusion

Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of a one-time, classroom-based headache prevention programme.

### Worldwide availability of medications for migraine and tension-type headache: a survey of the international headache society [^116VQxFx]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the differing global access to acute and preventive medications for migraine and tension-type headache.

Methods

A custom-built questionnaire created by members of the International Headache Society Juniors Group was sent to International Headache Society members worldwide, including a list of acute and preventive treatments for migraine and tension-type headache. This list was based on evidence-based medicine guidelines. For each treatment, participants were asked about availability, type of reimbursement and variability of access within their country.

Results

Eighty-four members completed the questionnaire providing data for 84 countries. The majority were neurologists (88%) and worked at an academic/university hospital (62%). Of participants, 36% were located in high-income economy countries and 13% were located in low-income economies. Common preventive treatments such as propranolol and topiramate were available in most countries (respectively in 99% and 92% of responding countries). Sumatriptan was available in most countries (95%), whereas other triptan availability was lower. Novel migraine treatments such as rimegepant and erenumab were only available in 14% and 46% of the assessed countries, respectively.

Conclusions

Availability of headache medications, ranging from simple analgesics to novel therapies migraine-specific drugs, varied greatly across the world. Actions are needed to improve effective drug availability in many countries to ensure an adequate management of people living with headache.

Recommendations for future research and clinical consideration emphasize gaps in high-quality evidence: "Although many preventive therapies reviewed herein are rated as Level C or U on the basis of the quality of evidence available, for some treatments extensive clinical experience supports a possible role in migraine prevention". Until stronger data are available, "practitioners are cautioned not to discount these agents because Class I prospective clinical studies are lacking", and "A case-by-case evaluation of these agents as treatment options is prudent". "Future directions should include validating these initial clinical observations in scientifically sound RCTs".

### Migraine prevention [^113SyCZq]. Practical Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Preventive medications reduce migraine frequency and severity, and improve migraine-specific quality of life. Recent evidence also suggests that these same medications enhance the patient's response to acute migraine therapies, and may also reduce the likelihood of developing chronic daily headache. However, many patients who should receive or be offered preventive treatment are not. Most patients can be successfully managed when patient and physician expectations are realistic and aligned, the selection of preventive medications is individualised, and the initiation and titration strategy is appropriate and carefully followed. Rational combinations of preventive medications may also be useful. This review provides an evidence and experience-based approach to the preventive treatment of migraine.

### Pacing as a treatment modality in migraine and tension-type headache [^1169yPuv]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the pacing literature; describe the use of pacing in a specialty headache clinic; and provide client feedback regarding the effectiveness of pacing in headache self-management.

Method

The evidence for this report was derived from a structured literature review, an established pacing intervention program for patients with headache, and patient self-report questionnaire.

Results

There are frequent references to pacing in the chronic pain and rheumatic disease literature, but no universal definition and, until recently, few outcome studies. References to pacing in the headache literature are limited. For a small sub-group of clients at a specialty headache clinic (n = 20), pacing principles taught by occupational therapists were reported to prevent increases in headache intensity (70%); decrease headache intensity (65%), and shorten the duration of a headache (40%). Additionally, 70% of respondents used pacing to prevent headache onset. Pacing was seen to contribute to increased quality of life, headache self-efficacy, function, and independence. There were a variety of opinions regarding the most helpful pacing components. The most frequently endorsed were identify and prioritize responsibilities; balance activity and rest; schedule regular rest breaks; and delegate or eliminate tasks.

Conclusions

Pacing appears to play an important role in headache self-management. More pacing research is required in both headache and chronic pain populations.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116BgcQ9]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Seven studies excluded patients with depression. Eleven studies reported the number of patients at trial entry meeting criteria for depression, ranging from 21% to 98%. The remaining studies did not measure or report on depression.

Dropout rates ranged from 0 to 52%. Four studies had less than 10% losses to follow-up, eight between 10% and 20%, nine between 20% and 30%, eight between 30% and 40%, and five more than 40%. Losses to follow-up could not be determined in three studies. Intention to treat analyses were done in only seven trials.

Quality ratings

Although quality varied among the studies, most had important limitations with design or reporting (table 2). Few studies reported the method of randomisation or allocation concealment. Although trials were often reported as double blind, blinding success was reported in only one trialand was often questionable, as treatment groups differed significantly in clinically recognisable adverse effects.

Headache outcomes

Tricyclics versus placebo

At baseline, participants with migraine averaged 4.7 headaches per month (95% confidence interval 4.3 to 5.1) and those with tension-type headaches 16.9 (15.8 to 18.0), with no difference between tricyclic and placebo groups (P = 0.46). Tricyclics were more effective than placebo in reducing the burden from both tension-type headaches (average standardised mean difference −0.99, 95% confidence interval −1.66 to −0.32; 11 arms, I² = 93.8%) and migraine headaches (−1.00, −1.52 to −0.48; 10 arms, I² = 89.4%, fig 2). Tricyclics were equally efficacious between the two headache types. The studies combined yielded an overall average standardised mean difference for tricyclics of −0.96 (95% confidence interval −1.39 to −0.53, I² = 90.1%). Therefore, regardless of the scale used to measure headaches, patients treated with a tricyclic experienced nearly 1 standard deviation of improvement, a clinically large effect. Efficacy did not differ among the different categories of tension-type headache (infrequent episodic v frequent episodic v chronic tension-type, P = 0.39).

### Nonpharmacologic treatment options in pediatric tension-type headache patients: a systematic review [^111cGEL4]. Journal of Child Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective: This systematic review aims to examine effects of nonpharmacologic treatment options for pediatric tension-type headache patients as well as evaluate current results from these treatment options. Background: Headache is a worldwide problem among both adults and children, with tension-type headache among the most common. Methods: Eighteen relevant studies were found using PubMed and evaluated in this review. These include therapy programs, biofeedback, alternative medicine, strength exercise, physical therapy, mindfulness therapy, and psychotherapy. Results: Several nonpharmacologic treatment methods showed improvement in pediatric headache patients, with few reported adverse effects. This suggests that nonpharmacologic treatment is safe for use and might have an effect in most cases. Conclusion: No single intervention has been proven superior to another, and some studies would need replication with a control group to confirm the findings. This study illustrates the variety of nonpharmacologic treatment options and the importance of future research on this topic.

### A bibliometric analysis of research trends of acupuncture therapy in the treatment of migraine from 2000 to 2020 [^115y7fsE]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Research Method

RCTs, multicenter, and double-blind studies are common research methods in acupuncture for migraine, providing high-quality clinical evidence. An RCT on acupuncture on migraine was published in JAMA Internal Medicine, with a high IF of 18.625. In this article, Zhao et al showed that the long-term reduction of migraine recurrence in the TA group was higher compared with the SA group and waiting-list control group. Besides, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted by Gottschling et al found active acupuncture benefits compared with placebo acupuncture for headache patients.

In acupuncture clinical research, it is difficult for researchers to conduct double-blind trials. Patient blinding can be achieved using sham acupuncture, but it is not easy to blind acupuncturist of manual treatments. Because the blinding of the observer and the analyst should be considered ideal for all studies. Although some attempts have been made using the novice and diagnostic blindness of acupuncturist, the quality of treatment may not be optimal and diagnosis may be irrelevant. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate double-blind trials in future studies. Single-blinded trials are therefore popular in acupuncture on migraine.

Effect of Acupuncture on Migraine

Studies report that approximately 25–38% of patients with migraine need preventive therapy. Acupuncture, as a method with no side effects, should be considered as a beneficial prophylactic treatment to reduce the frequency of migraine. Acute effect and long-term effect are the goals of acupuncture therapy on migraine, including pain relief and prevention of the frequency of migraine attacks in the future. Current research provides evidence for the potential role of acupuncture in the treatment and prophylaxis of migraine (acute migraine and TTH).

Acupuncture treatment, a supplementary therapy, can reduce pain in patients with migraine. However, there are some divergent views on the effects of acupuncture among TA, SA, and placebo groups. These differences may be attributed to acupuncture method, acupoint prescription, and type of migraine. Therefore, the effect of TA, SA, and placebo should be studied in future. In addition, The QoL of migraine patients is significantly decreased. The recurrent and severe pain in patients with migraine can aggravate psychological pressure such as tension and anxiety. Acupuncture can result in reduced Visual Analog Scale scores and days of the attack, and improve QoL in migraine patients.

### Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112p1JGY]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Sixthly, study quality was low in general. Few studies did an intention to treat analysis. This is particularly worrisome since some trials experienced up to 50% losses to follow-up. It is easy to imagine that patients who either had tremendous adverse effects or had lack of improvement would be particularly likely to drop out. We found no difference in effect estimates between those who did and did not do an intention to treat analysis, but our sample was relatively small.

Finally, heterogeneity in our results was considerable, particularly among people with tension-type headaches. Study duration explained some, but not all, of the variance. In addition, there was evidence of small study effects on our results, also known as publication bias. Tests to estimate the number of unpublished trials to calculate the number of unpublished trials necessary to obviate results and tests to "fill in" missing studies have been criticised for lack of underlying theory, poor performance in simulations, and a tendency to overestimate effects, particularly in the face of heterogeneity. Since small, negative trials are less likely to be published, such missing trials would generally decrease the efficacy estimate. It is important to keep in mind, however, two important potential sources of confounding. Firstly, the treatment effect is real. Effective treatments would also seem to have evidence of publication bias. Secondly, tests for publication bias tend to overestimate risk of bias in the face of heterogeneity. It is possible, indeed probable, that unpublished trials exist. The effect we report is therefore possibly an overestimation.

Despite these limitations, our meta-analysis shows the efficacy of tricyclics in people both with migraine headache and with tension-type headache. The benefit seems moderate to large in magnitude. Helpful studies would be those that determine whether particular subgroups of patients are more likely to respond to treatment with tricyclics, such as depressed patients or those with high use of analgesics. It would also be useful to better define more effective treatment regimens, in terms of target doses, treatment duration, or interaction with direct analgesics. Trials directly comparing treatment between tricyclics and other prophylactic regimens are needed.

### Tension-type headache… [^114exB12]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

In patients with chronic tension-type headache, the treatment goals are to initiate effective prophylactic treatment and to manage any residual headaches in a manner that prevents the frequent use of analgesics and the risk for progression to chronic daily headache syndrome. Patients with chronic tension-type headache should limit their use of analgesics to two times weekly to prevent the development of chronic daily headache. If the patient requires analgesic medication more frequently, adjunctive headache medications can be initiated. PROPHYLAXIS OF FREQUENT HEADACHES A wide variety of prophylactic agents have been researched in the management of chronic tension-type headache, and comprehensive reviews are available for interested readers. 19 Amitriptyline is the most researched of the prophylactic agents for chronic tension-type headache. It is typically used in doses of 10 to 75 mg, one to two hours before bedtime to minimize grogginess on awakening.

Double-blind randomized controlled studies confirm its use in patients with chronic tension-type headache. The most frequently used nonmedication treatments for headache are biofeedback, relaxation training, self-hypnosis, and cognitive therapy. One study 31 showed improvement in 39 percent of 94 patients with headache using relaxation training alone. Adding biofeedback increased the portion of patients experiencing improvement to 56 percent. 31 One small, long-term study 32 of relaxation and EMG biofeedback showed that improvement was maintained at five years' follow-up. Numerous small studies have investigated cognitive psychotherapy alone and in combination with other behavioral treatment for chronic tension-type headache. Among these trials, at least 50 percent of patients had reduced symptoms when treated with progressive relaxation, cognitive therapy, or a combination of the two.

33 This study 33 compared patients who self-administered treatments at home with patients receiving therapy in the office and noted a trend toward greater symptom reduction in patients receiving in-office treatment; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The use of traditional physical therapy for headache has been investigated in a randomized controlled trial. 36 Study participants received weekly sessions of education in proper posture and instruction in a home exercise program, and used ice packs, massage, and "passive mobilization" of the cervical facets. Both headache frequency and psychologic well-being improved significantly in the group receiving physical therapy at the end of six weeks and at the 12-month follow-up. 36.

### Headache (chronic tension type) [^111EmnoB]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

What are the effects of treatments. BENEFICIAL Amitriptyline One systematic review of small, brief randomized controlled trials has found that amitriptyline versus placebo reduces duration and frequency of chronic tension-type headache. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL. Cognitive Behavior Therapy One systematic review of three small RCTs and one subsequent RCT found limited evidence that cognitive behavior therapy reduced symptoms at six months compared with no treatment. UNKNOWN EFFECTIVENESS Acupuncture Two systematic reviews and one small RCT found insufficient evidence from heterogeneous RCTs that acupuncture was more effective than placebo in people with episodic or chronic tension-type headache. Many of the RCTs were of poor quality. Some of the RCTs may have lacked power to exclude a clinically important effect.

Benzodiazepines Two RCTs found insufficient evidence about the effects of benzodiazepines compared with placebo or other treatments. Benzodiazepines are commonly associated with adverse effects if taken regularly. Regular Acute Pain Relief Medication We found no RCTs. We found insufficient evidence from one nonsystematic review of observational studies about benefits of common analgesics in people with chronic tension-type headache. It found that sustained frequent use of some analgesics was associated with chronic headache and reduced effectiveness of prophylactic treatment. 1 Chronic tension-type headache is distinguished from chronic daily headache, which is simply a descriptive term for any headache type occurring for 15 days or more a month that may be caused by chronic tension-type headache as well as migraine or analgesic-associated headache.
