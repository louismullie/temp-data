## Question

Can dabrafenib and trametinib cause platelet clumps

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dabrafenib plus trametinib can cause platelet clumps, specifically EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia, and how to distinguish this from true thrombocytopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact definition of platelet clumping and the laboratory mechanisms that create spuriously low counts. Then, I should verify whether the FDA labels or published literature for dabrafenib and trametinib list platelet clumping or EDTA-related interference. Next, I will check whether thrombocytopenia occurs with dabrafenib/trametinib and, if so, whether that reflects true marrow suppression or peripheral destruction rather than an in vitro artefact. Finally, I will outline a practical approach to confirm suspected pseudothrombocytopenia and differentiate it from real thrombocytopenia on therapy, with attention to any edge cases that could confound interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate concepts: platelet clumps in this context refers to pseudothrombocytopenia, a spurious reduction in automated platelet count due to in vitro platelet aggregation, classically triggered by anticoagulant-dependent antibodies, most often with EDTA, but also seen with citrate and occasionally heparin. Confirmation requires a manual smear and repeat counts in alternative anticoagulants or collection methods to verify true counts and avoid unnecessary interventions [^116sochW] [^1176RXG6].

> Now, I should review the regulatory labels for signals of pseudothrombocytopenia. Wait, let me verify both FDA sources: the dabrafenib label carries boxed warnings for bleeding with the combination and details serious adverse events, but it does not mention platelet clumping or EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia. Likewise, the trametinib label warns about hemorrhage and VTE, but does not describe pseudothrombocytopenia as an adverse effect or a lab interference, and the combination is covered under the dabrafenib boxed warning without reference to clumping phenomena [^113SkG1v] [^116Bo3az].

> Hold on, I should double-check postmarketing sections and interaction language to ensure I'm not missing a rare lab interference signal. I need to check dabrafenib's postmarketing adverse reactions and trametinib's drug-interaction language; neither label documents platelet clumping, EDTA interference, or pseudothrombocytopenia among reported adverse events or lab test interferences, which makes a direct causal link to dabrafenib/trametinib unlikely based on regulatory data alone [^112YGzh6] [^112AjJg6].

> Next, I should review published clinical literature. Let me consider large randomized trials and contemporary series: pivotal trials and subsequent analyses of dabrafenib plus trametinib detail pyrexia, rash, gastrointestinal and cardiac effects, and grade 3–4 events, with thrombocytopenia listed as an uncommon toxicity, but do not report EDTA-mediated platelet clumping as an adverse event or lab phenomenon, and reports of D-dimer elevation and thrombotic microangiopathy are mechanistically distinct from pseudothrombocytopenia, supporting that any low platelet counts seen reflect true thrombocytopenia rather than an in vitro artefact [^112PDcQi] [^115fcDtA] [^112NXsLr].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could a different BRAF/MEK regimen be the source of confusion? I should confirm: crizanlizumab, a monoclonal antibody, has well-described EDTA-dependent platelet clumping interference, and inotersen can provoke antiplatelet antibodies with EDTA-related clumping. Neither dabrafenib nor trametinib share these mechanisms, which reinforces that platelet clumping is not an expected or reported effect of BRAF/MEK inhibition [^113thUQv] [^114vYVPi].

> Let me synthesize the evidence: based on FDA labeling and published clinical experience, dabrafenib plus trametinib are not associated with pseudothrombocytopenia or EDTA-related platelet clumping. However, true thrombocytopenia can occur and, when present, should be interpreted as a potential on-treatment adverse effect rather than a spurious count artifact, warranting evaluation for alternative causes or bleeding risk and appropriate management per oncology and hematology standards [^115fcDtA].

> I should confirm the practical approach if platelet clumps are suspected on a CBC from a patient on dabrafenib/trametinib. Let me verify the standard workup: examine a peripheral smear to document platelet aggregates, repeat the platelet count in a sodium citrate tube (and consider heparin or magnesium sulfate if citrate also clumps), and, if needed, collect a fresh sample and process promptly. These steps align with primary care and hematology guidance and help prevent misclassification of pseudothrombocytopenia as true thrombocytopenia, especially important when automated counters flag clumps [^1169QU2y] [^116sochW] [^1176RXG6].

> But wait, what if the low platelet count is real and related to therapy or disease? I need to ensure we do not jump to conclusions: in patients on dabrafenib/trametinib, thrombocytopenia — though uncommon — can reflect marrow suppression, immune-mediated destruction, consumption in thrombotic processes, or splenic sequestration. Management follows general oncology safety principles with dose interruption or reduction per adverse event severity, consideration of etiologies such as drug-induced thrombocytopenia, and transfusion thresholds based on bleeding risk and procedural needs rather than chasing pseudothrombocytopenia, consistent with safety summaries and clinical reviews of the combination [^112r8qsT] [^114dkMun] [^115fcDtA].

> Final take: I should confirm the bottom line clearly — no, dabrafenib and trametinib are not associated with platelet clumping or EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia in FDA labeling or the published literature. If clumps are seen on a CBC from a patient receiving this combination, treat it as likely pseudothrombocytopenia from unrelated factors and confirm with smear review and alternative anticoagulant counts, while separately evaluating for true thrombocytopenia using standard clinical algorithms when clinically indicated [^1169QU2y] [^116sochW].

---

The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib does not cause **platelet clumping** (pseudothrombocytopenia). Platelet clumping is a laboratory artifact typically due to **EDTA-dependent antiplatelet antibodies** [^116sochW] or **drug-induced antibodies**, not reported with dabrafenib/trametinib [^114vYVPi]. If clumping is suspected, confirm with a **peripheral smear** and repeat the count in **citrate or heparin tubes** [^1169QU2y]. The combination can cause **true thrombocytopenia** [^115fcDtA] and bleeding [^113SkG1v]; monitor platelets and manage clinically as indicated.

---

## Mechanism of platelet clumping (pseudothrombocytopenia)

Pseudothrombocytopenia is a spurious low platelet count from **in vitro aggregation**, most often due to **EDTA-dependent antibodies** that bind platelets at low calcium and cause clumping; citrate or heparin tubes, or a smear, resolve the artifact [^116sochW] [^1176RXG6]. Other drugs (e.g. glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors) can induce **antibodies** and clumping, but this is not a recognized effect of dabrafenib/trametinib [^1176RXG6].

---

## Evidence regarding platelet clumping with dabrafenib and trametinib

There is **no evidence** that dabrafenib or trametinib, alone or in combination, causes platelet clumping or pseudothrombocytopenia [^notfound]. Their labels and safety reviews list thrombocytopenia and bleeding, but not **clumping or EDTA-related artifacts** [^114vYVPi] [^113SkG1v]. In hairy cell leukemia, the combination improved **platelet counts** without reports of clumping [^115fxiYL].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Although clumping is not expected, **true thrombocytopenia** can occur with dabrafenib/trametinib; confirm suspected clumping with a **smear** and repeat testing in **citrate or heparin** [^1169QU2y]. If true thrombocytopenia is confirmed, manage per guidelines (monitor, dose modify, or interrupt) [^114dkMun] [^114x7XCP].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence type** | **Findings regarding platelet clumping** |
|-|-|
| FDA labels | No mention of platelet clumping or pseudothrombocytopenia [^notfound] |
| Clinical trials | No reports of platelet clumping or pseudothrombocytopenia |
| Clinical guidelines | No mention of platelet clumping as a known adverse effect [^notfound] |
| Clinical experience | No documented cases of platelet clumping attributed to dabrafenib and trametinib |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Dabrafenib and trametinib do not cause **platelet clumping**; if clumping is suspected, verify with a **smear** and repeat counts in **citrate or heparin** tubes [^1176RXG6]. Monitor for true thrombocytopenia and bleeding and manage clinically as indicated [^113SkG1v] [^116Bo3az].

### Sudden elevation of plasma D-dimer levels induced by the combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib: report of two cases [^112NXsLr]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib revolutionized the treatment for BRAF V600-mutated melanoma. Various adverse events have been reported for this treatment, most notably fever. Herein, we report two cases of novel an adverse event, namely sudden and significant elevation of plasma D-dimer level induced by this therapy. In the first case, the remarkable elevation of plasma D-dimer level up to 87.4 mg/dL was noted on day 11, and in the second case, the plasma D-dimer level reached 125.5 mg/dL on day 25. In both cases, D-dimer levels gradually decreased after the cessation of this therapy. Although the exact cause is not clear, we assume two possible hypotheses: the first is that the combination therapy may induce disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the second is that the therapy induced pathological condition of secondary thrombotic microangiopathies. Our cases suggest that this thrombotic adverse event should not be overlooked, and coagulation parameters need to be monitored during the course of this treatment.

### Edoxaban prevented adverse effects including pyrexia and elevation of D-dimer caused by the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in a patient with BRAF-mutant melanoma [^1154pCq7]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The combination of BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor is one of the first-line treatments for unresectable BRAF-mutant melanoma or as an adjuvant therapy. However, some patients who received the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib (CombiDT) or the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib (CombiEB) had adverse events (AEs) including pyrexia. We herein report a patient with BRAF-mutated melanoma who repeatedly developed elevated levels of D-dimer and pyrexia after CombiDT and CombiEB treatments. Moreover, concomitant edoxaban prevented these AEs, enabling the patient to continue receiving CombiEB.

Safety

All patients experienced ≥ 1 AEs, and 35 patients (63.6%) experienced a grade ≥ 3 event (supplemental Table 4). The most common grade ≥ 3 AEs were hyperglycemia (9.1%), pyrexia, neutropenia, and pneumonia (each 7.3%). The most common (≥ 5%) hematologic events of any grade were anemia (18.2%), neutropenia (10.9%), and thrombocytopenia (5.5%). Treatment-related AEs occurred in 52 patients (94.5%), most frequently pyrexia (58.2%), chills (47.3%), and hyperglycemia (40.0%; Table 4). AEs that led to dose reduction, dose interruption, or permanent discontinuation of either treatment were observed in 29 (52.7%), 38 (69.1%), and 12 (21.8%) patients, respectively (Table 4, supplemental Table 5, and supplemental Table 6). In 1 patient, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (grade 3 treatment-related serious AE) led to permanent discontinuation of the study treatment. The patient was transfused with packed red blood cells and treated with immunoglobulin IV and prednisone, following which the event resolved.

12.1

	Mechanism of Action

Trametinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activation and of MEK1 and MEK2 kinase activity. MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which promotes cellular proliferation. BRAF V600E mutations result in constitutive activation of the BRAF pathway which includes MEK1 and MEK2. Trametinib inhibits cell growth of various BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors in vitro and in vivo.

Trametinib and dabrafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Use of trametinib and dabrafenib in combination resulted in greater growth inhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor cell lines in vitro and prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor xenografts compared with either drug alone.

In the setting of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway re-activation has been identified as a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors [see Indications and Usage (1.7)].

12.2

	Pharmacodynamics

Administration of MEKINIST tablets 1 mg and 2 mg to patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma resulted in dose-dependent changes in tumor biomarkers, including inhibition of phosphorylated ERK, inhibition of Ki67 (a marker of cell proliferation), and increases in p27 (a marker of apoptosis).

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) prolongation potential of trametinib was assessed in a dedicated study in 32 patients who received placebo on Day 1 and MEKINIST tablets 2 mg once daily on Days 2–14 followed by MEKINIST tablets 3 mg on Day 15. No large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e., > 20 ms) were detected in the study.

A decrease from baseline in HR by 9 beats/min (90% CI: -11.4 to -6.1) and an increase from baseline in PR by 20 ms (90% CI: 13.0 to 27.4) relative to placebo was observed at two hours post-dose in the same study.

In clinical trials in patients who received MEKINIST with dabrafenib, QTc prolongation > 500 ms occurred in 0.8% of patients and QTc increased by > 60 ms from baseline in 3.8% of patients.

### Trametinib (Mekinist) [^116Bo3az]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trametinib PO (also known as Mekinist):
- **Bleeding**: use extreme caution in patients with risk factors for Bleeding events (e.g., intracranial bleeding and GI bleeding). Monitor patients who receive trametinib for signs or symptoms of bleeding. Interruption of therapy, a dose reduction, or permanent therapy discontinuation may be necessary in patients who develop grade 3 or 4 bleeding.
- **Cardiomyopathy, LV dysfunction**: use extreme caution with BRAF V600 mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib. Evaluate cardiac function prior to starting trametinib (e.g., echocardiogram). Interruption of therapy, a dose reduction, and/or permanent discontinuation may be necessary in patients who develop LV dysfunction.
- **DVT, PE**: use extreme caution in patients with a history of venous thromboembolic disease. Implement appropriate thromboprophylaxis measures and closely monitor patients for signs of DVT and PE during Trametinib treatment. Initiate prompt medical intervention, including anticoagulant therapy, for the management of DVT or PE. Seek immediate medical attention.
- **Gastrointestinal perforation, colitis**: use caution in patients with inflammation of the colon. Monitor patients for symptoms of colitis and promptly manage any gastrointestinal adverse effects during Trametinib treatment. Discontinue Trametinib and provide appropriate medical intervention, which may include corticosteroids or surgical intervention.
- **Hyperglycemia**: use caution in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. Monitor serum glucose levels at baseline and as clinically indicated during therapy. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic agents in these patients as necessary.
- **ILD, pneumonitis**: use extreme caution in patients with a history of pulmonary illness. Monitor patients regularly for signs and symptoms of ILD and pneumonitis during Trametinib treatment. Discontinue Trametinib and initiate appropriate medical intervention, which may include systemic corticosteroids, to manage ILD and pneumonitis.
- **Retinal detachment, central retinal vein occlusion**: use caution in patients with a history of vision problems. Ophthalmological exams should be performed periodically and promptly in patients who report vision problems. Interruption of therapy, a dose reduction, or permanent therapy discontinuation may be necessary for patients who develop retinal detachments and retinal vein occlusion.

Melanoma and targeted therapies

BRAF in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK) is constitutively activated by mutations in 40% of melanomas. The most common mutations are V600E and V600K, representing 73 and 19%, respectively. The growth of BRAF V600E-expressing melanoma can be inhibited directly by vemurafenibor dabrafenib (Table 4). Drug resistance, also called "bypass tracks", is increasingly relevant as targeted therapy emerges. Patients with BRAF mutations acquired resistance due to increased expression and phosphorylation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFβ) and N-Ras. The MEK inhibitor, trametinib, also suppresses BRAF V600E-expressing or V600K-expressing melanomas by targeting the BRAF downstream MAPK pathway (Table 4). Because drug monotherapies commonly result in resistance, combination treatment with a BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor has been prescribed to increase the patient's response rate and also lengthen their survival time. Especially, combination therapy as a first-line approach increased overall survival rates in a clinical trial. In patients with BRAF V600 mutations, a combination of cobimetinib (MEK inhibitor) and vemurafenib treatment showed median overall survival of 22.3 months, compared with 17.4 months by placebo and vemurafenib treatment.

Table 4
Targeted therapies in melanoma

Melanoma cells express the CTLA-4 and PD-1 immune receptor proteins that are normally expressed in T-cells. Because each of these two proteins can inhibit activation of T-cells and down-regulate the immune response, the abnormal expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1 in tumor cells is suggested as a molecular mechanism of immune evasion in tumors. Ipilimumab, a CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, was approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma (Table 4). The PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, nivolumab – and pembrolizumab, were also effective against metastatic melanoma (Table 4). Ipilimumab and nivolumab are also used in combination to treat melanoma.

### Critical analysis of thrombocytopenia associated with glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitors and potential role of zalunfiban, a novel small molecule glycoprotein inhibitor, in understanding the mechanism (s) [^1176RXG6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of GPI‐associated thrombocytopenia usually begins with the report of a low platelet count from of an automated cell counter, but sometimes it begins with the onset of hemorrhagic symptoms resulting in the ordering of an unscheduled platelet count. Because thrombocytopenia may occur rapidly and be asymptomatic, a platelet count should be performed 2 to 4 hours after the bolus dose of the GPI and 24 hours later. Low platelet counts should be confirmed with inspection of the blood smear. The presence of red blood cell schistocytes would suggest the possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or disseminated intravascular coagulation, whereas platelet clumps would indicate that the automated count is likely an underestimate, most likely due to platelet clumping induced by the standard blood cell count anticoagulant EDTA. Because the platelet aggregates may be mistaken for leukocytes by the automated counter, a reciprocal increase in white blood cells may be observed. This anticoagulant‐dependent platelet clumping phenomenon is termed pseudothrombocytopenia and the presumptive diagnosis is usually confirmed by finding a higher platelet count and loss of the platelet clumps upon repeating the platelet count with blood anticoagulated with citrate. Platelet clumping may also be present in citrated blood, and this may be more common with GPI‐associated pseudothrombocytopenia, and under these conditions, heparin or magnesium sulfate may be better anticoagulants.

### Dabrafenib and trametinib versus dabrafenib and placebo for val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma: a multicentre, double-blind, phase 3 randomised controlled trial [^112PDcQi]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Previously, a study of ours showed that the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib improves progression-free survival compared with dabrafenib and placebo in patients with BRAF Val600Lys/Glu mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. The study was continued to assess the secondary endpoint of overall survival, which we report in this Article.

Methods

We did this double-blind phase 3 study at 113 sites in 14 countries. We enrolled previously untreated patients with BRAF Val600Glu or Val600Lys mutation-positive unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma. Participants were computer-randomised (1:1) to receive a combination of dabrafenib (150 mg orally twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg orally once daily), or dabrafenib and placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and overall survival was a secondary endpoint. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01584648.

Findings

Between May 4, 2012, and Nov 30, 2012, we screened 947 patients for eligibility, of whom 423 were randomly assigned to receive dabrafenib and trametinib (n = 211) or dabrafenib only (n = 212). The final data cutoff was Jan 12, 2015, at which time 222 patients had died. Median overall survival was 25.1 months (95% CI 19.2-not reached) in the dabrafenib and trametinib group versus 18.7 months (15.2–23.7) in the dabrafenib only group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.55–0.92; p = 0.0107). Overall survival was 74% at 1 year and 51% at 2 years in the dabrafenib and trametinib group versus 68% and 42%, respectively, in the dabrafenib only group. Based on 301 events, median progression-free survival was 11.0 months (95% CI 8.0–13.9) in the dabrafenib and trametinib group and 8.8 months (5.9–9.3) in the dabrafenib only group (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53–0.84; p = 0.0004; unadjusted for multiple testing). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 181 (87%) of 209 patients in the dabrafenib and trametinib group and 189 (90%) of 211 patients in the dabrafenib only group; the most common was pyrexia (108 patients, 52%) in the dabrafenib and trametinib group, and hyperkeratosis (70 patients, 33%) in the dabrafenib only group. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 67 (32%) patients in the dabrafenib and trametinib group and 66 (31%) patients in the dabrafenib only group.

Interpretation

The improvement in overall survival establishes the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib as the standard targeted treatment for BRAF Val600 mutation-positive melanoma. Studies assessing dabrafenib and trametinib in combination with immunotherapies are ongoing.

Pharmacokinetics

Following repeat dosing of 150 mg dabrafenib b.i.d. and 2 mg trametinib q.d. in patients with BRAF V600E/K mutation‐positive advanced solid tumors, dabrafenib seemed to be rapidly absorbed with the median plasma Tmax of approximately 2 h. Plasma AUC0‐12 h on day 21 was lower than that after a single dose on day 1 (Fig. 2). Plasma trough concentrations of dabrafenib and its metabolites seemed to reach a steady state by week 3 (percent coefficient of variation [%CV] of 149% [dabrafenib], 82% [GSK2285403, hydroxylated form], 52% [GSK2298683, carboxylate form] and 84% [GSK2167542, demethylated form]). However, the variability in plasma trough concentrations of dabrafenib and its metabolites was large at week 8 and later (%CV of 184–591% [dabrafenib], 121–239% [hydroxylated form], 39–65% [carboxylate form] and 52–108% [demethylated form]) (Table 2). Trametinib seemed to be rapidly absorbed with the median plasma Tmax of approximately 1 h (Fig. 2). Plasma trough concentrations of trametinib seemed to reach steady state by week 3 (%CV of 26%) (Table 2).

### Assessing patient risk, benefit, and outcomes in drug development: a decade of dabrafenib and trametinib clinical trials [^113AS94t]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Dabrafenib and trametinib (D&T) received accelerated approval by the FDA in 2022 for the treatment of metastatic solid tumors harboring BRAF mutations. Our aim was to evaluate the risk/benefit profile of D&T in clinical trials. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant clinical trial publications involving D&T in adult malignancies. Trials utilizing D&T measuring responses with RECIST or other criteria were included. Data screening and extraction were performed in a masked, duplicate fashion, focusing on adverse events and primary end-points. Dabrafenib and trametinib were evaluated in many BRAF V600-mutated cancers. The median PFS across all trials was 4.5 months and the median OS was 11.5 months. However, 34% of trials did not report or reach their PFS end-point, and 54% did not report or obtain an OS value. Cumulative ORR remained consistent at around 30% throughout drug development, but the cumulative incidence of grade 3–5 AEs increased from 25% to 50% as off-label indications were studied. We found the studies that led to the accelerated approval of D&T's use in indications outside its original label to be deficient in reporting AE and outcomes. The accelerated approval filled a space needed for the treatment of other BRAF V600 malignancies that did not have a standard method of treatment. However, it is still imperative that clinical trial data be empirically driven and transparent. This encourages quality research which lays the foundation for clinical decision making that impacts patient quality of life and outcome.

### Dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with previously untreated BRAF-mutant metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: an open-label, phase 2 trial [^113dtouo]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

BRAF V600E mutation occurs in 1–2% of lung adenocarcinomas and acts as an oncogenic driver. Dabrafenib, alone or combined with trametinib, has shown substantial antitumour activity in patients with previously treated BRAF V600E -mutant metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to assess the activity and safety of dabrafenib plus trametinib treatment in previously untreated patients with BRAF V600E -mutant metastatic NSCLC.

Methods

In this phase 2, sequentially enrolled, multicohort, multicentre, non-randomised, open-label study, adults (≥ 18 years of age) with previously untreated metastatic BRAF V600E -mutant NSCLC were enrolled into cohort C from 19 centres in eight countries within North America, Europe, and Asia. Patients received oral dabrafenib 150 mg twice per day plus oral trametinib 2 mg once per day until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, consent withdrawal, or death. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response, defined as the percentage of patients who achieved a confirmed complete response or partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1. The primary and safety analyses were by intention to treat in the protocol-defined population (previously untreated patients). The study is ongoing, but no longer recruiting patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01336634.

Findings

Between April 16, 2014, and Dec 28, 2015, 36 patients were enrolled and treated with first-line dabrafenib plus trametinib. Median follow-up was 15.9 months (IQR 7.8–22.0) at the data cutoff (April 28, 2017). The proportion of patients with investigator-assessed confirmed overall response was 23 (64%, 95% CI 46–79), with two (6%) patients achieving a complete response and 21 (58%) a partial response. All patients had one or more adverse event of any grade, and 25 (69%) had one or more grade 3 or 4 event. The most common (occurring in more than two patients) grade 3 or 4 adverse events were pyrexia (four [11%]), alanine aminotransferase increase (four [11%]), hypertension (four [11%]), and vomiting (three [8%]). Serious adverse events occurring in more than two patients included alanine aminotransferase increase (five [14%]), pyrexia (four [11%]), aspartate aminotransferase increase (three [8%]), and ejection fraction decrease (three [8%]). One fatal serious adverse event deemed unrelated to study treatment was reported (cardiorespiratory arrest).

Interpretation

Dabrafenib plus trametinib represents a new therapy with clinically meaningful antitumour activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with previously untreated BRAF V600E -mutant NSCLC.

### Metastatic melanoma presenting with leucoerythroblastic blood film [^112mLVKB]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

A 58‐year‐old male patient presented with abdominal pain, fever and cutaneous bleeding. Routine laboratory tests showed anaemia (haemoglobin concentration: 91.8 g/L), thrombocytopenia (platelet count: 24 × 10 9 /L), haemolysis (haptoglobin: < 10 g/L, lactate dehydrogenase: 7380 U/L), evidence of fibrinolysis (D‐dimer: 4.1 mg/L, fibrinogen: 0.9 g/L) and acute kidney injury (glomerular filtration rate: 29 mL/min). A suspicion of thrombotic microangiopathy (PLASMIC score 5, intermediate risk) was promptly raised, and a peripheral blood film was performed to search for schistocytes. The blood film showed no evidence of schistocytes, but revealed a leucoerythroblastic reaction with reticulocytes, polychromatic erythroblasts (May–Grünwald–Giemsa staining, 60× objective; bottom left main panel) and coexistence of mature and immature granulocytes (top left). Reticulocytes were also readily detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy with immunostaining of the cytoskeletal protein non‐muscular myosin IIa showing typical aggregates (bottom left, inset). A review of patient's medical history revealed a previous diagnosis of malignant melanoma treated with surgery 2 years earlier, with subsequent development of axillary lymph node and lung metastases during treatment with checkpoint inhibitor therapy. At presentation, the patient was receiving a combination chemotherapy with dabrafenib and trametinib targeting the BRAF and MEK genes. Bone marrow metastasis from melanoma was suspected, and a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed. The aspiration revealed a diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow with large, vacuolated cells with large, open‐chromatin nuclei and prominent nucleoli (May–Grünwald–Giemsa staining, 60× objective; right main panel). A small proportion of these cells displayed melanin pigment (upper right, inset). The cells were CD45‐negative by flow cytometry, confirming their non‐haematopoietic origin. A computed tomography scan revealed multiple hepatic metastases. The patient was treated palliative and died few days later.

The reported case reaffirms the importance of peripheral blood morphology, which can uniquely guide the diagnostic workup even in the era of precision medicine.

### Dabrafenib versus dabrafenib + trametinib in-mutated radioactive iodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer: results of a randomized, phase 2, open-label multicenter trial [^111dGYRM]. Thyroid (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: Oncogenic BRAF mutations are commonly found in advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), and reports have shown efficacy of BRAF inhibitors in these tumors. We investigated the difference in response between dabrafenib monotherapy and dabrafenib + trametinib therapy in patients with BRAF-mutated radioactive iodine refractory DTC. Methods: In this open-label randomized phase 2 multicenter trial, patients aged ≥ 18 years with BRAF-mutated radioactive iodine refractory DTC with progressive disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 within 13 months before enrollment were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to receive dabrafenib alone or dabrafenib + trametinib. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by modified RECIST (minor response of -20% to -29%, partial and complete response) within the first 24 weeks of therapy. Trial Registration Number: NCT01723202. Results: A total of 53 patients were enrolled. The objective response rate (modified RECIST) was 42% (11/26 [95% confidence interval {CI} 23–63%]) with dabrafenib versus 48% (13/27 [CI 29–68%]) with dabrafenib + trametinib (p = 0.67). Objective response rate (RECIST 1.1) was 35% (9/26 [CI 17–56%]) with dabrafenib and 30% (8/27 [CI 14–51%]) with dabrafenib + trametinib. Most common treatment-related adverse events included skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (17/26, 65%), fever (13/26, 50%), hyperglycemia (12/26, 46%) with dabrafenib alone and fever (16/27, 59%), nausea, chills, fatigue (14/27, 52% each) with dabrafenib + trametinib. There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusions: Combination dabrafenib + trametinib was not superior in efficacy compared to dabrafenib monotherapy in patients with BRAF-mutated radioiodine refractory progressive DTC.

### Mechanistic and clinical overview cardiovascular toxicity of BRAF and MEK Inhibitors: state-of-the-art review [^113tEbXe]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

BRAF and MEK Inhibition In Cancer Therapy: A Primer

The most common BRAF mutation, V600E, reflects the substitution of valine to glutamine at codon 600 in exon 15, which results in constitutive activation of BRAF's kinase function. Since 2005, 3 BRAF inhibitors have been approved for use in patients with BRAF mutant melanoma — first, vemurafenib and, subsequently, dabrafenib and encorafenib. The use of these drugs as monotherapy brought a significant increase in progression-free and overall survival for patients with advanced melanoma. However, approximately 50% of patients developed acquired resistance, limiting the benefits of this intervention, even in patients whose disease was initially sensitive to the drugs. Subsequent efforts focused on the development of novel MEK inhibitors that now include trametinib, cobimetinib, and binimetinib. Three combinations of BRAF inhibitor/MEK inhibitor are approved for use (Table 1) in the treatment of advanced BRAF mutant melanoma. Combination therapy with BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor results in a reduced incidence of BRAF inhibitor–induced skin tumors, delays the emergence of resistance, and is associated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival when compared with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (Table 2).

Table 1
Summary of BRAF and MEK Inhibitors Commonly Used to Treat Melanoma

Table 2
Outcomes of Patients With Unresectable Stage III/IV Melanoma Treated With BRAF Inhibitor/MEK Inhibitor Versus BRAF Inhibitor Monotherapy

While immunotherapy with T cell checkpoint inhibitors, targeting PD(L)-1 alone or combined with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, remains first line treatment for patients with BRAF wild-type advanced (unresectable stage III or stage IV) cutaneous melanoma, treatment options for patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma include immunotherapy or combined BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor. There have been no clinical trials directly comparing the effectiveness of immunotherapy versus BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor in BRAF-mutant advanced melanoma; therefore, the best sequence of therapy in this patient group remains unknown. In practice, targeted therapy is generally offered as first line for patients with a high symptom and tumor burden, as treatment responses tend to be more rapid than those achieved using immunotherapy. Patients may ultimately receive both treatments. More recently, the combination of the anti-PD-L1monoclonal antibody, atezolizumab, with combined BRAF and MEK inhibition (vemurafenib + cobimetinib) significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib, plus placebo in patients with advanced unresectable BRAF mutation–positive cutaneous melanoma.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^116sochW]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Pseudothrombocytopenia

Pseudothrombocytopenia (PTCP) is characterized by spuriously low single platelet counts in blood samples collected in tubes containing an anticoagulant to prevent in vitro blood clotting, caused by time-dependent in vitro formation of platelet clumps during sample storage at room temperature (Figure 3). Although the condition is sometimes referred to as EDTA-PTCP because EDTA is the in vitro anticoagulant that most often causes PTCP, it is referred to simply as PTCP in this review, in order to avoid confusion potentially generated by the fact that, in a substantial percentage of cases, EDTA is not the only anticoagulant associated with platelet plug formation in vitro, as will be documented later in this review. Platelet counts in PTCP samples may vary widely, from severe thrombocytopenia to mild thrombocytopenia, both among different subjects, and when tested on different occasions in the same subject. The platelet count could be within the normal range in mild cases of platelet clumping, and in cases of concomitant thrombocytosis, which could be masked by PTCP. Although PTCP is an artefact without clinical relevance, failure to distinguish it from real thrombocytopenia may trigger unnecessary investigations and potentially dangerous treatments.

Epidemiology

The prevalence of PTCP in the general population is about 0.1% of all blood cell counts, with uncertain evidence of sex and age differences;, cases of familial PTCP have been reported. The frequency of PTCP within blood samples with pathologically low platelet counts collected from outpatients varies between 15.3% and 17%, representing the second most frequent cause of detected thrombocytopenia. The condition can be persistent or transient.

Assessments

In phase 1, the primary end‐point was to assess safety and tolerability as assessed by AE. Secondary end‐points were PK, confirmed/unconfirmed overall response rate (ORR), PFS, and duration of response (DOR) of dabrafenib and trametinib. In phase 2, the primary end‐point was to assess confirmed ORR. Secondary end‐points included PK, unconfirmed ORR, PFS, DOR, safety and tolerability.

Overall response rate was evaluated by lesion assessments (by RECIST v1.1) performed every 8 weeks. Confirmed ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per RECIST 1.1. The unconfirmed ORR was defined as the percentage of subjects who had an unconfirmed CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1. PFS was defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the earliest of death or progression. DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause among patients who achieved a confirmed response. Safety and tolerability were evaluated by routine physical examination findings, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, clinical monitoring and observations, and AE reporting.

### Unusual adverse events in a patient with BRAF-Mutated non-small cell lung cancer treated with BRAF / MEK inhibition [^113bRM2E]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). Medium credibility.

BRAF/MEK inhibition remains standard of care for treatment of BRAF-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although common adverse events (AEs) have been reported through clinical trials and ongoing clinical practice, only a handful of reports have detailed unusual adverse events associated with these medications. This report presents a patient with BRAF-mutated NSCLC treated with dabrafenib and trametinib who experienced 2 unusual AEs-Sweet syndrome and MEK-associated retinopathy-that responded to steroid treatment. The patient was able to continue BRAF/MEK inhibition through a coordinated multidisciplinary approach. This case highlights the importance for all clinicians to recognize unusual AEs associated with BRAF/MEK inhibition, particularly in the setting of expanded use for all BRAF V600E-mutated solid tumors.

### Dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with previously treated BRAF (V600E)-mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: an open-label, multicentre phase 2 trial [^113feqZo]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

BRAF mutations act as an oncogenic driver via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). BRAF inhibition has shown antitumour activity in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC. Dual MAPK pathway inhibition with BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC might improve efficacy over BRAF inhibitor monotherapy based on observations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma. We aimed to assess the antitumour activity and safety of dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC.

Methods

In this phase 2, multicentre, non-randomised, open-label study, we enrolled adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with pretreated metastatic stage IV BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC who had documented tumour progression after at least one previous platinum-based chemotherapy and had had no more than three previous systemic anticancer therapies. Patients with previous BRAF or MEK inhibitor treatment were ineligible. Patients with brain metastases were allowed to enrol only if the lesions were asymptomatic, untreated (or stable more than 3 weeks after local therapy if treated), and measured less than 1 cm. Enrolled patients received oral dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) plus oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) in continuous 21-day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, withdrawal of consent, or death. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response, which was assessed by intention to treat in the protocol-defined population (patients who received second-line or later treatment); safety was also assessed in this population and was assessed at least once every 3 weeks, with adverse events, laboratory values, and vital signs graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The study is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01336634.

Findings

Between Dec 20, 2013, and Jan 14, 2015, 59 patients from 30 centres in nine countries across North America, Europe, and Asia met eligibility criteria. Two patients who had previously been untreated due to protocol deviation were excluded; thus, 57 eligible patients were enrolled. 36 patients (63.2% [95% CI 49.3–75.6]) achieved an investigator-assessed overall response. Serious adverse events were reported in 32 (56%) of 57 patients and included pyrexia in nine (16%), anaemia in three (5%), confusional state in two (4%), decreased appetite in two (4%), haemoptysis in two (4%), hypercalcaemia in two (4%), nausea in two (4%), and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in two (4%). The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were neutropenia in five patients (9%), hyponatraemia in four (7%), and anaemia in three (5%). Four patients died during the study from fatal adverse events judged to be unrelated to treatment (one retroperitoneal haemorrhage, one subarachnoid haemorrhage, one respiratory distress, and one from disease progression that was more severe than typical progression, as assessed by the investigator).

Interpretation

Dabrafenib plus trametinib could represent a new targeted therapy with robust antitumour activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC.

Patients and Methods

Patient Selection

Eligible patients were adults with stage IV or unresectable stage III BRAF (V600E, V600K, V600R, or V600D)-mutant melanoma, measurable disease by RECIST 1.1, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, adequate baseline organ function [absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.2 × 10⁹/L, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, platelet count ≥ 100 × 10⁹/L, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio and partial thromboplastin time ≤ 1.3 × upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤ 1.5× ULN, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN, serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL], and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ lower limit of normal by ECHO. Patients with treated brain metastases were allowed if they had evidence of radiographic stability (3 weeks after gamma knife, and 2 months after whole-brain radiotherapy). Subjects were excluded if they had leptomeningeal disease or spinal cord compression. Any number and type of prior anticancer therapies were allowed except BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Patients with history of malignancy with a RAS mutation were ineligible. Patients receiving cytochrome P450 enzyme–inducing anticonvulsant drugs were ineligible. For full eligibility criteria, see Supplementary Data. The study was approved by the institutional review boards at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA), Rutgers University (New Brunswick, NJ), Washington University (St. Louis, MO), and Northwestern University (Evanston, IL), and was conducted in accordance with U.S. and international standards for Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Belmont Report. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to study entry.

Study endpoints

The primary objective of the phase I portion of the trial was the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) HCQ when administered with D+T in patients with advanced BRAFV600 -mutant melanoma. The primary objective of the phase II trial was to determine the proportion of patients achieving one-year progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives were to estimate the toxicity rates, response rate (RR), and overall survival (OS).

5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions/Antibody Formation

TEGSEDI can cause hypersensitivity reactions. In clinical studies, 6 of 161 (4%) TEGSEDI-treated patients stopped treatment because of a hypersensitivity reaction. Antibodies to TEGSEDI were present when the reactions occurred. These reactions generally occurred within 2 hours of administration of TEGSEDI and included headache, chest pain, hypertension, chills, flushing, dysphagia, palmar erythema, eosinophilia, involuntary choreaform movements, arthralgia, myalgia, and flu-like symptoms.

If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of TEGSEDI, and initiate appropriate therapy. Do not use in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reaction to TEGSEDI.

5.8 Uninterpretable Platelet Counts: Reaction between Antiplatelet Antibodies and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA)

In Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)], 23% of TEGSEDI-treated patients had at least 1 uninterpretable platelet count caused by platelet clumping, compared to 13% of patients on placebo. In 2 cases of severe thrombocytopenia with platelet count below 25 × 10⁹/L, one of which resulted in death, clumped platelet samples caused a delay in diagnosis and treatment. Both subjects had tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-platelet IgG antibodies detected shortly before, or at the time of the severe reduction in platelet count.

Although platelet clumping can have a variety of causes (e.g., incompletely mixed or inadequately anticoagulated samples), platelet clumping can be caused by a reaction between antiplatelet antibodies and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA). In Study 1, 7 of the 9 (78%) TEGSEDI-treated patients with treatment-emergent positive antiplatelet antibody testing had at least 1 clumped platelet sample.

If there is suspicion of EDTA-mediated platelet clumping, perform a repeat platelet count using a different anticoagulant (e.g., sodium citrate, heparin) in the blood collection tube. Recheck the platelet count as soon as possible if a platelet measurement is uninterpretable. Hold TEGSEDI dosing until an acceptable platelet count is confirmed with an interpretable blood sample.

Patients

Both studies enrolled patients with malignancies that had relapsed or were refractory to standard treatments. Other key inclusion criteria of relevance for patients with LCH (CDRB436A2102/dabrafenib monotherapy study; CTMT212X2101/dabrafenib plus trametinib arm of study) included ages from ≥ 12 months to < 18 years, BRAF V600–mutant tumors, Karnofsky/Lansky performance status ≥ 50%, and adequate bone marrow, renal, liver, and cardiac function (described in supplemental Table 1).

Key exclusion criteria of relevance for patients with LCH in both studies included previous treatment with RAF or MEK inhibitors, excluding sorafenib (expansion cohorts), prior or current malignancy apart from that under study, any investigational study treatment within the prior month, cardiovascular risk, and a history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection. For patients enrolled in the CDRB436A2102 (dabrafenib monotherapy) study, ≥ 3 weeks should have elapsed since prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy and ≥ 3 months since an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant. For patients enrolled in the CTMT212X2101 (dabrafenib plus trametinib) study, ≥ 3 weeks should have elapsed since prior chemotherapy, ≥ 4 weeks since prior radiation therapy to more than 25% of marrow-containing bones, ≥ 2 weeks since prior local palliative radiation therapy, ≥ 2 months since autologous transplant, and ≥ 6 months since prior allogeneic transplant. Previous treatment with an extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor was also not permitted; patients who had received prior BRAF inhibitor monotherapy could enroll if they had prior benefit, as determined by the investigator. In addition, patients receiving medications for left ventricular systolic dysfunction and patients with current liver or biliary disease (except for Gilbert syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, or liver metastases) were not enrolled. Patients with a history of or current retinal vein occlusion or a history of hepatic sinusoid obstructive syndrome (within 3 months), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis were also excluded.

### Adverse event management in patients withV600E-mutant non-small cell lung cancer treated with dabrafenib plus trametinib [^114Q1u5o]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Therapies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continue to become more sophisticated. Chemotherapeutics are giving way to newer approaches such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies for greater efficacy and improved outcomes. Dabrafenib plus trametinib combination therapy was first approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma harboring the BRAF V600-mutation in 2014. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the combination for patients with NSCLC with the same mutation based on an ≈ 65% response rate and median progression-free survival of 10–11 months. BRAF mutations are a high-frequency event in melanoma (≈ 50%), whereas the overall incidence in lung cancer is ≈ 2%, but similar in number, because of the high incidence of the disease. As a new approach in NSCLC treatment, dabrafenib plus trametinib has a unique toxicity profile that is likely unfamiliar to care providers in thoracic and general oncology who have not used the combination to treat patients with melanoma. Common adverse events such as pyrexia, fatigue, and nausea, as well as a range of less frequent cutaneous, ocular, and hemorrhagic events, can be observed during treatment with dabrafenib plus trametinib. Previous experience in metastatic melanoma revealed that these events can be effectively managed to improve patient quality of life and reduce unnecessary drug discontinuation. The aim of this review is to summarize treatment guidelines, along with key insights obtained from previous clinical-trial and real-world experience in patients with metastatic melanoma, to properly manage toxicities associated with dabrafenib plus trametinib for NSCLC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib has demonstrated substantial clinical activity in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, leading to U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. Although the combination has a manageable safety profile, many toxicities associated with the regimen may not be familiar to thoracic specialists or general oncologists. Extensive clinical experience with the combination in patients with metastatic melanoma has provided a wealth of strategies to identify and manage adverse events associated with dabrafenib plus trametinib. These can be used by medical oncologists to enhance early recognition of toxicities and facilitate effective management, thereby improving quality of treatment for patients.

### Dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with relapsed / refractory BRAF V600E mutation-positive hairy cell leukemia [^112qvWEY]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

It is important to acknowledge the difficulties in comparing indefinite treatment with dabrafenib plus trametinib with other therapies that have a shorter duration of treatment. With long-term treatment compared with short-course treatment, there was a higher discontinuation rate (22%) and higher rate of secondary malignancies, but these are expected when time of observation and treatment are prolonged. The advantages of long-term treatment and prolonged response must be balanced with need for treatment interruptions and dose modifications. The current study provides valuable clinical data with which decisions on durations of treatment can be applied to particular patients. However, the lack of data on incidence and frequency of recurrence of the same AE or distinct episodes of toxicity per patient is a limitation because a certain AE can occur multiple times in the same patient being treated for a median duration of > 3 years. Future studies may benefit from inclusion of disease-specific quality-of-life assessments, which were not included in this basket trial with multiple tumor types. The absence of a matched control group of patients in this study warrants further patient quality-of-life data/analysis to validate the findings. During the final analysis, there is an opportunity to assess the quality of life for all the cohorts included in the basket trial, the outcomes of which may be published in due course.

The combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib is ideal for patients with relapsed HCL who prefer an oral regimen with a high chance of CR, including MRD-free CR, including patients who cannot tolerate additional rituximab. Moreover, dabrafenib plus trametinib may be a reasonable combination in the current scenario with COVID-19 and/or concerns of poor COVID-19 vaccine immune response in patients receiving rituximab. On the other hand, dabrafenib plus trametinib could also be tested in combination with rituximab for a shorter duration of time to increase its MRD-free CR rate.

It is important to note that infections must not be overlooked in this patient population. The dabrafenib plus trametinib combination also holds promise to improve hematologic parameters without causing prolonged myelosuppression and immunosuppression, and can serve as a potential regimen for HCL patients with active infections. Like vemurafenib, dabrafenib plus trametinib could be tested in front line to delay definitive first-line chemotherapy of HCL when patients have cytopenias or infections that put them at excessive risk for chemotherapy.

### Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition versus BRAF inhibition alone in melanoma [^1118AcWC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition, as compared with BRAF inhibition alone, delays the emergence of resistance and reduces toxic effects in patients who have melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

Methods

In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 423 previously untreated patients who had unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation to receive a combination of dabrafenib (150 mg orally twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) or dabrafenib and placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, response rate, response duration, and safety. A preplanned interim overall survival analysis was conducted.

Results

The median progression-free survival was 9.3 months in the dabrafenib-trametinib group and 8.8 months in the dabrafenib-only group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the dabrafenib-trametinib group, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.99; P = 0.03). The overall response rate was 67% in the dabrafenib-trametinib group and 51% in the dabrafenib-only group (P = 0.002). At 6 months, the interim overall survival rate was 93% with dabrafenib-trametinib and 85% with dabrafenib alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.94; P = 0.02). However, a specified efficacy-stopping boundary (two-sided P = 0.00028) was not crossed. Rates of adverse events were similar in the two groups, although more dose modifications occurred in the dabrafenib-trametinib group. The rate of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma was lower in the dabrafenib-trametinib group than in the dabrafenib-only group (2% vs. 9%), whereas pyrexia occurred in more patients (51% vs. 28%) and was more often severe (grade 3, 6% vs. 2%) in the dabrafenib-trametinib group.

Conclusions

A combination of dabrafenib and trametinib, as compared with dabrafenib alone, improved the rate of progression-free survival in previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. (Funded by GlaxoSmithKline; Clinical Trials.gov number, NCT01584648.).

### Dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with relapsed / refractory BRAF V600E mutation-positive hairy cell leukemia [^115fxiYL]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast to BRAF V600 mutation–positive solid tumors, such as melanoma and colorectal cancer, for which mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors have been extensively studied, there is limited understanding about the mechanistic basis of resistance in HCL. Previous reports of vemurafenib in HCL noted persistent phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in BM leukemic cells at treatment end, indicating reactivation of the MAPK pathway as seen with BRAF inhibitors in other cancers. However, the lack of on-treatment ERK phosphorylation status of residual leukemic cells in this study is a major limitation, restricting us from understanding the contribution of MEK inhibitor in this treatment regimen. Whole-genome and deep-targeted sequencing of a patient with HCL before vemurafenib treatment and again at relapse implicated reactivation of MEK-ERK signaling as the likely mechanism of resistance; indeed, subsequent treatment with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib led to resolution of symptoms and platelet count recovery. The deep and durable responses seen in our study are consistent with the hypothesis that combined treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors may be less susceptible to resistance mechanisms.

In conclusion, dabrafenib plus trametinib demonstrated a high rate of durable responses in patients with relapsed/refractory BRAF V600E–mutated HCL with a manageable safety profile. Dabrafenib plus trametinib should be considered a meaningful, rituximab-free therapeutic option for patients with relapsed or refractory BRAF V600E–mutated HCL.

### Dabrafenib and trametinib, alone and in combination for BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma [^112huEyn]. Clinical Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

Dabrafenib and trametinib were approved for use as monotherapies in BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013, and most recently, their use in combination has received accelerated FDA approval. Both drugs target the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: dabrafenib selectively inhibits mutant BRAF that constitutively activates the pathway, and trametinib selectively inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 proteins activated by RAF kinases. The phase III study of dabrafenib in BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma reported rapid tumor regression in most patients and a 59% objective RECIST response rate. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were improved compared with dacarbazine. Toxicities were well tolerated and different from those reported for vemurafenib, the first FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor. Efficacy has been demonstrated in other BRAF-mutant genotypes. The phase III study of trametinib in BRAF inhibitor-naïve patients with BRAF(V600E) or BRAF(V600K) also showed benefit with a prolonged median PFS and OS compared with chemotherapy. Trametinib is ineffective in patients who have progressed on BRAF inhibitors. A phase II trial of combined dabrafenib and trametinib demonstrated higher response rates and longer median PFS than dabrafenib monotherapy, with less cutaneous toxicity. Here, we review the clinical development of both drugs as monotherapies and in combination, and discuss their role in the management of BRAF-mutant melanoma.

### Vortexing specimens to disaggregate platelet clumps in EDTA specimens [^112it6Na]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare platelet count results of specimens that yield platelet clump flags to platelet count results on these specimens after vortexing.

Method

Specimens that generated platelet count flags on Sysmex XN 3000 instruments were vortexed and rerun. Only data from specimens demonstrating elimination of platelet clump flags were used in this study. Pearson r analysis was performed on data.

Results

Comparison of complete blood count results (white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count) all yielded Pearson r scores > 0.9.

Conclusion

Additional patient comfort and safety concerns, as well as concerns over additional specimen collection and processing costs, may be avoided by vortexing and rerunning specimens flagged for platelet clumps when the platelet count is normal.

Figure 1.
Schematic review of cellular pathways targeted by oral antineoplastic agents in thyroid cancer.

Tyrosine kinase receptors including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor α (PDGFα), and RET can activate internal MAPK pathways which can lead to tumor proliferation; in a similar way, TRK and RET fusions can lead to tumorigenesis. The figure above highlights several multikinase inhibitors described in this article with their respective target receptors or fusions. In addition, dabrafenib and trametinib inhibit BRAF and MEK, respectively, from the MAPK pathway which has led to improvement in survival on BRAF-altered ATC cases.

Contrary to what was suggested in both articles by Pinard et aland Tahsen et al, this case implies that the hypersensitivity reaction can be class specific rather than drug specific. Even if few cases noting the successful use of dabrafenib after vemurafenib-induced SCAR have been reported, the reintroduction cannot be alleged as safe and should be considered with care. In practice we do not suggest the avoidance dabrafenib after vemurafenib SCARs, but we emphasize that this introduction should take place within a hospitalized setting.

Statistical analysis

The primary focus of phase 1 was to assess the safety and tolerability of dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy. In phase 1, the sample size was not driven by statistical considerations. The total number of patients depended on the number of dose levels needed. If only the combination of dabrafenib (150 mg b.i.d.) and trametinib (2 mg q.d.) was studied, the sample size of phase 1 was estimated to be six. In phase 2, the primary end‐point was confirmed ORR (based on the investigator's assessment). In phase 2, with a threshold ORR of 10% and an expected ORR of 70% (based on phase 3 studies with dacarbazine, vemurafenib and dabrafenib therapies), 13, 22 the sample size of six was estimated to provide 90% or more of power, given a one‐sided alpha error of less than 0.05. Patients who were not evaluable were treated as non‐responders, that is, they were included in the denominator when calculating the percentage. Exact 90% and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for this estimate, and the exact P ‐values for one‐sided binomial test were calculated to allow rejection of the null hypothesis, of which ORR is 10%. An independent central review (ICR) was performed to serve as a sensitivity analysis of tumor assessment. The ICR assessment was used to analyze confirmed ORR. Only the subset of patients who showed a CR or PR was included in the analysis of duration of response.

Progression‐free survival and duration of response were summarized descriptively using the Kaplan–Meier method. If a patient received subsequent anticancer treatment prior to the date of documented progression or death, PFS in the patient was to be censored at the last adequate assessment prior to the initiation of the subsequent therapy. Otherwise, if a patient did not have a documented date of progression or death, PFS in the patient was to be censored at the last adequate assessment. PK parameters were listed and summarized for phase 1. AE were coded using the ICH Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 19.0 and grouped by system organ class and preferred term. AE were graded by the investigator according to CTCAE v4.0 and were summarized by frequency and proportion of total patients, by system organ class and preferred term.

Background

Previous analysis of COMBI-d (NCT01584648) demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with combination dabrafenib and trametinib versus dabrafenib monotherapy in BRAF V600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma. This study was continued to assess 3-year landmark efficacy and safety after ≥ 36-month follow-up for all living patients.

Patients and Methods

This double-blind, phase 3 study enrolled previously untreated patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutant unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma. Patients were randomized to receive dabrafenib (150mg twice daily) plus trametinib (2mg once daily) or dabrafenib plus placebo. The primary endpoint was PFS; secondary endpoints were OS, overall response, duration of response, safety, and pharmacokinetics.

Results

Between 4 May and 30 November 2012, a total of 423 of 947 screened patients were randomly assigned to receive dabrafenib plus trametinib (n = 211) or dabrafenib monotherapy (n = 212). At data cut-off (15 February 2016), outcomes remained superior with the combination: 3-year PFS was 22% with dabrafenib plus trametinib versus 12% with monotherapy, and 3-year OS was 44% versus 32%, respectively. Twenty-five patients receiving monotherapy crossed over to combination therapy, with continued follow-up under the monotherapy arm (per intent-to-treat principle). Of combination-arm patients alive at 3 years, 58% remained on dabrafenib plus trametinib. Three-year OS with the combination reached 62% in the most favourable subgroup (normal lactate dehydrogenase and < 3 organ sites with metastasis) versus only 25% in the unfavourable subgroup (elevated lactate dehydrogenase). The dabrafenib plus trametinib safety profile was consistent with previous clinical trial observations, and no new safety signals were detected with long-term use.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate that durable (≥ 3 years) survival is achievable with dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma and support long-term first-line use of the combination in this setting.

Treatment plan and safety assessments

Patients were treated with a run-in of dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally daily (D+T) for one week. Patients then started HCQ in combination with D+T in week 2. One cycle was defined as 4 weeks of therapy to coincide with CT scanning performed every 8 weeks (two cycles). The starting phase I dose for HCQ was 400 mg orally twice daily. Three patients were treated at the starting dose and the dose was escalated by predetermined increments. Before accrual to the next dose level began, all patients in each cohort completed the first 4 weeks of combination treatment permitting toxicities to be evaluated. The following events were considered a DLT if they occurred in the first 4 weeks of combined D+T + HCQ therapy: grade 4 neutropenia with fever, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and any nonhematologic toxicity of grade 3 or higher that was at least possibly treatment-related and that was refractory to supportive measures. Treatment continued until disease progression, and continued treatment beyond progression was allowed when there was an isolated progression that could be locally treated. For full treatment protocol, see Supplementary Data. All subjects received echocardiograms at baseline and every 3 months, electrocardiograms (12-lead ECGs) at every visit, and comprehensive ophthalmologic exams at baseline and at the beginning of the following cycles (+/− one week): cycle 2, cycle 7, and every 6 months. Ophthalmologic exams included multimodal retinal imaging with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence with short-wavelength (SW), near-infrared (NIR) excitation lights, and visual fields using Humphrey Field Analyzer and a 10–2 protocol. This study utilized the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 for toxicity and adverse event reporting. Specific guidelines for dose modification for each of the three medications are detailed in Supplementary Data.

### Factors predictive of response, disease progression, and overall survival after dabrafenib and trametinib combination treatment: a pooled analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials [^115g4ZJr]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Dabrafenib plus trametinib treatment provides significant benefits over BRAF-inhibitor monotherapy in patients with BRAF V600E -mutant or BRAF V600K -mutant advanced melanoma; however, in many patients the disease progresses, leading to death. With many treatment options available, understanding clinical factors that predict long-term response and survival for treatments is important for optimisation of patient management. We aimed to identify clinical factors associated with long-term response and survival using pooled data from randomised trials of dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma.

Methods

We did a retrospective individual data analysis based on all published randomised trials that included treatment-naive patients with BRAF V600E -mutant or BRAF V600K -mutant metastatic melanoma who received the approved dose of dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily plus trametinib 2 mg once daily. Data were pooled from patients in the BRF113220 (part C; March 26, 2010, to Jan 15, 2015), COMBI-d (May 4, 2012, to Jan 12, 2015), and COMBI-v (June 4, 2012, to March 13, 2015) randomised trials. Patients with untreated brain metastases were not permitted to enrol in these trials. Baseline factors, identified a priori based on known melanoma clinical or prognostic characteristics, were analysed for association with progression-free survival and overall survival using univariate and multivariate analyses and assessed for hierarchical effect on outcomes using regression tree analyses. We also analysed factors identified after baseline, on treatment, and at progression, for associations with survival after progression. The trials included in this analysis are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: BRF113220, number NCT01072175; COMBI-d, number NCT01584648; COMBI-v, number NCT01597908.

Findings

617 patients were included in this analysis with a median follow-up of 20.0 months (range 0–48.0, IQR 10.1–24.8); 396 patients had progression events (ie, disease progression or death) and 290 patients had died. Median progression-free survival (11.1 months [95% CI 9.7–12.9]), median overall survival (25.6 months [23.1–34.3]), 1-year progression-free survival (48% [44–52]) and overall survival (74% [71–78]), and 2-year progression-free survival (30% [26–34]) and overall survival (53% [49–57]) were consistent with those in the individual trials. Patients with normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration and fewer than three organ sites containing metastases (n = 237) had the longest 1-year progression-free survival (68% [95% CI 62–74]) and overall survival (90% [87–94]) and 2-year progression-free survival (46% [40–54]) and overall survival (75% [70–81]), whereas patients with LDH concentration at least two times the upper limit of normal (n = 70) had the shortest 1-year progression-free survival (8% [3–19]) and overall survival (40% [29–55]) and 2-year progression-free survival (2% [0–13]) and overall survival (7% [3–19]). Of patients with disease progression (n = 379), survival after progression was longest in those with progression in baseline or new non-CNS lesions (n = 205; median 10.0 months [95% CI 7.9–12.0]) and shortest in those with new CNS lesions or concurrent progression in baseline and new lesions (n = 171; median 4.0 months [3.5–4.9]).

Interpretation

Several patient and clinical characteristics at and after baseline are associated with outcomes with dabrafenib plus trametinib, and durable benefit is possible with targeted treatment in defined patient subsets.

### Dabrafenib plus trametinib versus dabrafenib monotherapy in patients with metastatic BRAF V600E / K-mutant melanoma: long-term survival and safety analysis of a phase 3 study [^117YFeFg]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Previous analysis of COMBI-d (NCT01584648) demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with combination dabrafenib and trametinib versus dabrafenib monotherapy in BRAF V600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma. This study was continued to assess 3-year landmark efficacy and safety after ≥ 36-month follow-up for all living patients.

Patients and methods

This double-blind, phase 3 study enrolled previously untreated patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutant unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma. Patients were randomized to receive dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) plus trametinib (2 mg once daily) or dabrafenib plus placebo. The primary endpoint was PFS; secondary endpoints were OS, overall response, duration of response, safety, and pharmacokinetics.

Results

Between 4 May and 30 November 2012, a total of 423 of 947 screened patients were randomly assigned to receive dabrafenib plus trametinib (n = 211) or dabrafenib monotherapy (n = 212). At data cut-off (15 February 2016), outcomes remained superior with the combination: 3-year PFS was 22% with dabrafenib plus trametinib versus 12% with monotherapy, and 3-year OS was 44% versus 32%, respectively. Twenty-five patients receiving monotherapy crossed over to combination therapy, with continued follow-up under the monotherapy arm (per intent-to-treat principle). Of combination-arm patients alive at 3 years, 58% remained on dabrafenib plus trametinib. Three-year OS with the combination reached 62% in the most favourable subgroup (normal lactate dehydrogenase and < 3 organ sites with metastasis) versus only 25% in the unfavourable subgroup (elevated lactate dehydrogenase). The dabrafenib plus trametinib safety profile was consistent with previous clinical trial observations, and no new safety signals were detected with long-term use.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate that durable (≥ 3 years) survival is achievable with dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma and support long-term first-line use of the combination in this setting.

### Combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib for BRAF and MEK inhibitor pretreated patients with advanced BRAF-mutant melanoma: an open-label, single arm, dual-centre, phase 2 clinical trial [^115mizq4]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with BRAF V600 -mutant melanoma benefit from treatment with the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, but resistance and disease progression develops in most patients. Preclinical studies and case studies have indicated that acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition can be reversible. We aimed to assess the anti-tumour activity of rechallenge with BRAF plus MEK inhibition in a prospective clinical trial.

Methods

In this open-label, single arm, dual-centre, phase 2 academic study in Belgium, patients aged 18 years or older with BRAF V600 -mutant melanoma who had previously progressed on BRAF inhibitors (with or without MEK inhibitors) and were off-treatment for at least 12 weeks, were treated with dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice per day plus trametinib 2 mg orally once per day. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with investigator-assessed overall response at any time (defined as complete response or partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 confirmed on two occasions, at least 28 days after the first response was recorded). Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The study is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02296996.

Findings

Between April 5, 2014, and Feb 2, 2016, 25 patients were enrolled and initiated treatment in our study. A partial response was documented in eight (32%) of 25 patients (95% CI 15–54; six patients had progressed on previous treatment with dabrafenib plus trametinib and two patients had progressed on previous BRAF inhibitor monotherapy). Stable disease was noted in ten patients (40%; 95% CI 21–61). Rechallenge with dabrafenib plus trametinib was well tolerated. There were no unexpected or grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in two patients (8%; panniculitis [n = 1] and pyrexia [n = 1]). Serious adverse events which occurred on study were one patient with an Addison crisis triggered by grade 2 pyrexia symptoms that resolved after discontinuation of dabrafenib and trametinib. No patients died as a result of study treatment.

Interpretation

Rechallenge with dabrafenib plus trametinib showed anti-tumour activity in patients who had previously progressed on BRAF inhibitors and as such, rechallenge represents a potential new treatment option for these patients.

### Phase 1 / 2 study assessing the safety and efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy in Japanese patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced cutaneous melanoma [^112sJ7xv]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Following repeat dosing of dabrafenib, 150 mg b.i.d. and trametinib, 2 mg q.d. in patients with V600E or V600K mutation‐positive advanced solid cancer, dabrafenib seemed to be rapidly absorbed. It was observed that plasma AUC0‐12 h (day 21) of dabrafenib at repeat dosing was lower than that at AUC0‐inf (day 1), which may support the result that dabrafenib induces self‐induction of metabolism. The results observed in this study are consistent with the results that have been observed in global studies. 28 Similarly rapid absorption of trametinib was also noticed following repeated dosing of trametinib 2 mg q.d. and dabrafenib 150 mg b.i.d. Contrary to the results observed in dabrafenib, absorption plasma AUC0‐24 h of trametinib at repeat dosing was higher than that at single dose, which may be attributed to the fact that the half‐life of trametinib was long, that is, approximately 3.5 times the dose interval (24 h). Plasma concentrations of both dabrafenib and trametinib seemed to reach steady state by week 3, but the variability in plasma trough concentrations of dabrafenib and its metabolites was large at week 8 and later.

The total number of patients recruited in this study was relatively lower (n = 12) but the results of evaluation of the safety, efficacy and PK of dabrafenib (150 mg b.i.d.) and trametinib (2 mg q.d.) combination therapy differed little from the global clinical study results. In conclusion, the safety, efficacy and PK of this combination therapy in Japanese patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF mutation‐positive cutaneous malignant melanoma could be analogically inferred from the global clinical study results.

12.1

	Mechanism of Action

Dabrafenib is an inhibitor of some mutated forms of BRAF kinases with in vitro IC50values of 0.65, 0.5, and 1.84 nM for BRAF V600E, BRAF V600K, and BRAF V600D enzymes, respectively. Dabrafenib also inhibits wild-type BRAF and CRAF kinases with IC50values of 3.2 and 5.0 nM, respectively, and other kinases, such as SIK1, NEK11, and LIMK1 at higher concentrations. Some mutations in the BRAF gene, including those that result in BRAF V600E, can result in constitutively activated BRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Dabrafenib inhibits cell growth of various BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors in vitro and in vivo.

Dabrafenib and trametinib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Use of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination resulted in greater growth inhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor cell lines in vitro and prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor xenografts compared with either drug alone.

In the setting of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway re-activation has been identified as a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors [see Indications and Usage (1.8)].

	Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The potential effect of TAFINLAR on QT interval was assessed in a dedicated multiple-dose study in 32 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors. No large changes in the mean QT interval (i.e., > 20 ms) were detected with dabrafenib 300 mg administered twice daily (two times the recommended dosage).

In clinical trials, QTc (heart rate-corrected QT) prolongation to ≥ 500 ms occurred in 0.8% of 264 patients who received TAFINLAR with trametinib and in 1.5% of patients who received TAFINLAR as a single agent. The QTc was increased > 60 ms from baseline in 3.8% of patients who received TAFINLAR with trametinib and 3% of patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent.

### Design characteristics, risk of bias, and reporting of randomised controlled trials supporting approvals of cancer drugs by European medicines agency, 2014–16: cross sectional analysis [^1172GxQi]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Trametinib

We judged the pivotal trial of trametinib to be at high risk of bias. In trial BRF113220, there was potential evidence of unbalanced censoring. According to the European public assessment report, there were relatively large proportions of censored participants in both trial arms. The censoring method included censoring for extended loss to follow-up, new anticancer therapy, and excluding symptomatic progression. While 31% of participants who received dabrafenib 150 mg were censored, 11% were censored among participants receiving trametinib. In the absence of evidence that results were robust to the presence of potentially missing outcome data (we were unable to find the results of "eight sensitivity analyses planned to investigate the robustness of progression-free survival against these censoring rules"), we concluded that this trial was at high risk of bias due to missing outcome data. In addition, local investigators in trial BRF113220 were unblinded and therefore aware of the intervention received by study participants. Because the assessment of the progression free survival outcome could be influenced by knowledge of the intervention received, the trial was also at high risk of bias owing to measurement of the outcome. The authors reported local results as their main analysis, although the results from the blinded review committee were also available in the main body of the publication. Results obtained from blinded assessment were less pronounced (hazard ratio for progression free survival was 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.62, according to local assessment, compared with 0.55, 0.33 to 0.93).

Thirdly, the regulatory documents and scientific publications had limitations in their reporting. Some of these limitations followed a discernible pattern. For example, key design elements of randomised controlled trials such as sequence generation and allocation concealment were consistently reported in trial publications, their protocols, or appendices. In contrast, regulatory documents seldom specified randomisation methods; instead, regulators often discussed potential imbalances in baseline characteristics to gauge the success of randomisation. Other discrepancies among regulatory documents and publications were less predictable. While both sources typically showed the flow of participants, strategies to deal with missing outcome data and the sensitivity of findings to censoring rules and assumptions were only haphazardly reported. Moreover, neither source consistently reported major deviations from intended interventions.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^113ByHe8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Melanoma — BRAF V600–mutant metastatic disease first-line targeted therapy — BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations with dabrafenib/trametinib, vemurafenib/cobimetinib, or encorafenib/binimetinib are category 1 options based on phase 3 trials in the first-line setting. Although vemurafenib and dabrafenib are FDA approved as single agents, these agents are almost never given without concomitant MEK inhibition, and BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy has been shown to have superior response rate, PFS, and OS compared with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy. The NCCN Panel recommends BRAF inhibitor monotherapy only in those rare cases where combination therapy is contraindicated, and in such cases monotherapy remains a treatment option especially if the patient is not an appropriate candidate for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Dabrafenib/trametinib, vemurafenib/cobimetinib, and encorafenib/binimetinib are FDA approved for unresectable or distant metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations, and the NCCN Panel considers BRAF/MEK combinations (or single-agent BRAF inhibitor if combination is contraindicated) appropriate for any activating BRAF V600 mutation including V600E, V600K, V600R, and V600D. Although trametinib is FDA approved for single-agent use in BRAF V600E melanoma, trametinib monotherapy is no longer an NCCN-recommended option due to relatively poor efficacy compared with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy and BRAF/MEK combinations.

### Dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer: updated analysis from the phase II ROAR basket study [^111fMViB]. Annals of Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

The median duration of exposure to both dabrafenib and trametinib was 7.0 months (range, 1–63 months; Supplementary Table S2, available at). Permanent discontinuation of any study treatment due to AEs was reported in six patients (17%); AEs that led to discontinuation in > 1 patient were dyspnea and pleural effusion (2 patients each; Supplementary Table S3, available at). Four of six patients discontinued both dabrafenib and trametinib due to AEs at the same time; the remaining two patients discontinued trametinib before dabrafenib. Most AE-related discontinuations (5/6 patients) occurred early during treatment (~6 months or earlier; Supplementary Table S4, available at).

Dose reductions or interruptions of any study treatment due to AEs were reported in 17 (47%) and 18 (50%) patients, respectively. Pyrexia was the most common AE leading to both dose reduction [6 patients (17%)] and interruption [5 patients (14%); Supplementary Table S3, available at]. In total, 28 patients (78%) experienced ≥ 1 dose reduction of dabrafenib and 11 (31%) experienced ≥ 1 dose reduction of trametinib. The most common reason for dose reduction of dabrafenib was patient noncompliance (53%), while the most common reason for dose reduction of trametinib was AEs (63%). Similarly, 28 patients (78%) experienced ≥ 1 dose interruption of dabrafenib and 27 patients (75%) experienced ≥ 1 dose interruption of trametinib. Most dose interruptions of dabrafenib and trametinib were due to AEs (67% and 43%, respectively; Supplementary Table S3, available at). Overall, patients received close to the full daily doses of dabrafenib (300 mg) and trametinib (2 mg), with mean (standard deviation) daily doses of 252.7 (56.59) and 1.7 (0.35) mg, respectively (Supplementary Table S2, available at).

Methods

Patients

This study enrolled patients aged ≥ 18 years with histologically confirmed HCL according to the World Health Organization (2008)morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria who had experienced relapse following ≥ 2 prior lines of treatment or had refractory disease, defined as no response or disease progression in ≤ 1 year following first-line treatment with a purine analog. Enrolled patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 and adequate organ function (supplemental Table 1). Enrollment based on local assessment of BRAF V600E mutation status was permitted (central confirmation was not required to be enrolled), and bone marrow (BM) aspirate and blood samples were collected for retrospective assessment by using the bioMérieux THxID BRAF kit at a central reference laboratory (Hematogenex, Tinley Park, IL). All patients had leukemic cells in the peripheral blood (PB) or BM aspirate along with any of the following: symptomatic splenomegaly, hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L, or absolute neutrophil count < 1 × 10⁹/L. If any patient had an opportunistic infection, the infection had to be adequately managed, and the patient had to be clinically stable.

The study was sponsored and designed by GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation in collaboration with the investigators; dabrafenib and trametinib are assets of Novartis AG as of March 2, 2015. The study was approved by the institutional review board at each participating institution and was conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and ethical principles described in the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.

	Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been observed in the post-marketing setting when TAFINLAR was administered with trametinib. If HLH is suspected, interrupt treatment. If HLH is confirmed, discontinue treatment and initiate appropriate management of HLH.

5.12

	Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Dabrafenib was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses three times greater than the human exposure at the recommended adult clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception, since TAFINLAR can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment with TAFINLAR and for 2 weeks after the last dose [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

PFS (A) and OS (B) for patients included in the intent-to-treat population treated with dabrafenib plus trametinib.

A post hoc exploratory analysis conducted to assess the influence of baseline characteristics on the achievement of CR using univariate logistic regression models of CR against individual baseline variables suggested a slightly better probability of CR with higher baseline neutrophils (estimate, 1.1902; 95% CI, 0.0111–2.3692; p = 0.048) and lower baseline spleen size (estimate, −0.0184; 95% CI, −0.0371 to 0.0003; p = 0.054; supplemental Table 3). In addition, the relationship of prior splenectomy with achievement of CR was assessed. Of the 7 patients with prior splenectomy, 5 achieved CR, which did not provide strong evidence of the relationship between prior splenectomy and CR (2-sided Fisher exact test P = 1.0). However, given the post hoc nature of the analysis and multiple testing, the results should be interpreted with caution.

Median hemoglobin, platelet count, and absolute neutrophil count recovered to normal (as defined in supplemental Table 2) by week 8, week 4, and week 8, respectively (supplemental Figure 2). The median number of hairy cells as a percentage of circulating mononuclear cells decreased from 5.0% (range, 0.0%-95.0%) at baseline to 0.1% (range, 0.0%-7.4%) at week 12. Some patients who did not meet the criteria for a response did have significant clinical benefit, as evidenced by the recovery in their hematologic parameters.

### Combined BRAF (dabrafenib) and MEK inhibition (trametinib) in patients with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma experiencing progression with single-agent BRAF inhibitor [^115LSwDZ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Preclinical and early clinical studies have demonstrated that initial therapy with combined BRAF and MEK inhibition is more effective in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma than single-agent BRAF inhibitors. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib in patients who had received prior BRAF inhibitor treatment.

Patients and Methods

In this open-label phase I/II study, we evaluated the pharmacology, safety, and efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib. Here, we report patients treated with combination therapy after disease progression with BRAF inhibitor treatment administered before study enrollment (part B; n = 26) or after cross-over at progression with dabrafenib monotherapy (part C; n = 45).

Results

In parts B and C, confirmed objective response rates (ORR) were 15% (95% CI, 4% to 35%) and 13% (95% CI, 5% to 27%), respectively; an additional 50% and 44% experienced stable disease ≥ 8 weeks, respectively. In part C, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.6 months (95% CI, 2 to 4), and median overall survival was 11.8 months (95% CI, 8 to 25) from cross-over. Patients who previously received dabrafenib ≥ 6 months had superior outcomes with the combination compared with those treated < 6 months; median PFS was 3.9 (95% CI, 3 to 7) versus 1.8 months (95% CI, 2 to 4; hazard ratio, 0.49; p = 0.02), and ORR was 26% (95% CI, 10% to 48%) versus 0% (95% CI, 0% to 15%).

Conclusion

Dabrafenib plus trametinib has modest clinical efficacy in patients with BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma. This regimen may be a therapeutic strategy for patients who previously benefited from BRAF inhibitor monotherapy ≥ 6 months but demonstrates minimal efficacy after rapid progression with BRAF inhibitor therapy.

The developments of immune checkpoint modulation via cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 blockade, with ipilimumab, and targeting of BRAF(V600), with vemurafenib or dabrafenib, as well as MEK, with trametinib, have been paradigm changing both for melanoma clinical practice and for oncology therapeutic development. These advancements, however, reveal new clinical questions regarding combinations and optimal sequencing of these agents in patients with BRAF mutant disease. We review the development of these agents, putative biomarkers, and resistance mechanisms relevant to their use, and possibilities for sequencing and combining these agents.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^113Lj4wH]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Melanoma: Cutaneous — BRAF and MEK inhibitor safety — In phase III trials, the risk of toxicity (all grade, grade 3–5) was similar for BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy compared with single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy, and both regimens were associated with high rates of flu-like symptoms including pyrexia and chills, fatigue/asthenia, headache, musculoskeletal aches/pains, and gastrointestinal upset. BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy was associated with higher risk of pyrexia and diarrhea, whereas BRAF inhibitor monotherapy was associated with higher risk of musculoskeletal complaints. Hyperproliferative skin toxicities had notably higher prevalence with BRAF inhibitor monotherapies than with BRAF/MEK combinations, including hyperkeratosis, palmoplantar disorders, keratoacanthoma, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Due to better efficacy and a different toxicity profile, BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy is generally preferred over BRAF inhibitor monotherapy. Rare patients on combination therapy may experience toxicities thought to be attributable to MEK inhibitors (eg, deep venous thrombosis, retinal problems, concerns about immunosuppression), and discontinuation of the MEK inhibitor may be helpful. There are few data to inform selection among the combination options (dabrafenib/trametinib, vemurafenib/cobimetinib, encorafenib/binimetinib), as none have been directly compared. Grade 5 toxicities were rare (≤ 2% in phase III trials) in trials testing BRAF inhibitor monotherapy or BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapies; reported grade 5 adverse events (AEs) included cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events, infection-related events, and multi-organ failure, and it is not clear which were treatment related. Additional rare high-grade AEs of special interest include ocular AEs, QT prolongation, decreased ejection fraction, thrombotic events, and development of new primary malignancies. Across prospective trials, most AEs manifest within the first few months of therapy, although AEs continue to develop throughout treatment at a lower rate.

### Thrombocytopenia: evaluation and management [^1169QU2y]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a platelet count of less than 150 × 10³ per μL and can occur from decreased platelet production, increased destruction, splenic sequestration, or dilution or clumping. Patients with a platelet count greater than 50 × 103 per μL are generally asymptomatic. Patients with platelet counts between 20 and 50 × 10³ per μL may have mild skin manifestations such as petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis. Patients with platelet counts of less than 10 × 10³ per μL have a high risk of serious bleeding. Although thrombocytopenia is classically associated with bleeding, there are conditions in which bleeding and thrombosis can occur, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathies. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia in the absence of systemic illness most likely have immune thrombocytopenia or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In stable patients being evaluated as outpatients, the first step is to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia by collecting blood in a tube containing heparin or sodium citrate and repeating the platelet count. If thrombocytopenia is confirmed, the next step is to distinguish acute from chronic thrombocytopenia by obtaining or reviewing previous platelet counts. Patients with acute thrombocytopenia may require hospitalization. Common causes that require emergency hospitalization are heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathies, and the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Common nonemergency causes of thrombocytopenia include drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia, and hepatic disease. Transfusion of platelets is recommended when patients have active hemorrhage or when platelet counts are less than 10 × 10³ per μL, in addition to treatment (when possible) of underlying causative conditions. It is important to ensure adequate platelet counts to decrease bleeding risk before invasive procedures; this may also require a platelet transfusion. Patients with platelet counts of less than 50 × 10³ per μL should adhere to activity restrictions to avoid trauma-associated bleeding.

### COMPOSIT study: evaluating osimertinib combination with targeted therapies in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer [^116GiGCY]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Gefitinib and tepotinib also demonstrated antitumor activity in EGFRm NSCLC with MET overexpression or MET amplification with an impressive PFS of 16.6 months in patients with MET amplification in the INSIGHT study. In the phase Ib TATTON trial, which evaluated osimertinib and savolitinib in EGFR m NSCLC with MET amplification, the median PFS in patients previously treated with osimertinib was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.1–7.7), and the ORR was 33% (95% CI, 22–46). In the phase II SAVANNAH trail, in the subgroup with high MET amplification, the ORR was 49%, and the median PFS was 7.1 months.

For BRAF V600E mutation, PRs were only observed when osimertinib was combined with both dabrafenib and trametinib. No response was observed when either dabrafenib or trametinib was used alone, as previously described in the treatment of patients with cancers carrying the BRAF V600E mutation. The triple combination of osimertinib, dabrafenib, and trametinib showed encouraging efficacy in terms of ORR and PFS. Some case reports, presented similar results with this combination. In our study, some AEs (ie, fever grade 1, thrombocytopenia grade 4, pneumonitis grade 1) were reported with this triple combination, requiring a dose reduction. In a previous case report, 2 patients developed pneumonitis on TKI after exposure to the combination therapy, including a grade 5.

### Cutaneous melanoma: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^116Ha2Ei]. Annals of Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous melanoma, more specifically with respect to management of advanced/metastatic disease, first-line therapy, ESMO 2025 guidelines recommend to offer BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy (dabrafenib-trametinib, vemurafenib-cobimetinib, or binimetinib-encorafenib) as a first-line option in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma if anti-PD-1-based therapy is unavailable or patients are ineligible. (I, A) Consider offering BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy for 8–12 weeks followed by ipilimumab-nivolumab as another option, especially for patients with high LDH levels and/or liver metastases. (II, C) Consider offering encorafenib as monotherapy if the decision to treat with targeted therapy has been made but the patient cannot receive a MEK inhibitor due to cardiovascular comorbidities, a recent brain metastasis bleeding event, history of retinal detachment, or other ophthalmological contraindications.

### Adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib in stage III BRAF-Mutated melanoma [^115Jepf3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib plus the MEK inhibitor trametinib improved survival in patients with advanced melanoma with BRAF V600 mutations. We sought to determine whether adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib would improve outcomes in patients with resected, stage III melanoma with BRAF V600 mutations.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 870 patients with completely resected, stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations to receive oral dabrafenib at a dose of 150 mg twice daily plus trametinib at a dose of 2 mg once daily (combination therapy, 438 patients) or two matched placebo tablets (432 patients) for 12 months. The primary end point was relapse-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, freedom from relapse, and safety.

Results

At a median follow-up of 2.8 years, the estimated 3-year rate of relapse-free survival was 58% in the combination-therapy group and 39% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for relapse or death, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 to 0.58; P < 0.001). The 3-year overall survival rate was 86% in the combination-therapy group and 77% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.79; P = 0.0006), but this level of improvement did not cross the prespecified interim analysis boundary of P = 0.000019. Rates of distant metastasis-free survival and freedom from relapse were also higher in the combination-therapy group than in the placebo group. The safety profile of dabrafenib plus trametinib was consistent with that observed with the combination in patients with metastatic melanoma.

Conclusions

Adjuvant use of combination therapy with dabrafenib plus trametinib resulted in a significantly lower risk of recurrence in patients with stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations than the adjuvant use of placebo and was not associated with new toxic effects.

### Final results for adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib in stage III melanoma [^114ifpwV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study COMBI-AD was published by Georgina V Long and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cutaneous melanoma. In the COMBI-AD study, the trial question was: what is the role of adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with resected stage III melanoma? In the COMBI-AD study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the COMBI-AD study, the population was: 870 patients (482 female, 388 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with resected stage III melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation. The key exclusion criteria were mucosal or ocular melanoma; presence of unresectable in-transit metastases; distant metastatic disease; prior systemic anti-cancer treatment and radiotherapy for melanoma; cardiovascular risk; retinal vein occlusion or central serous retinopathy. In the COMBI-AD study, the interventions were: n = 438 dabrafenib plus trametinib (dabrafenib 150 mg BID plus trametinib 2 mg once daily) n = 432 placebo (two matching placebos). In the COMBI-AD study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median relapse-free survival (93.1 months vs. 16.6 months; HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.59 to 2.33). In the COMBI-AD study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in overall survival at 8 years (71% vs. 65%; HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.61) Significant increase in distant-metastasis-free survival at 10 years (63% vs. 48%; HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.27) No significant difference in melanoma-specific survival (77% vs. 74%; HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.69). In the COMBI-AD study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in incidence of primary or secondary cancer (3.98 events per 100 patient-years vs. 2.61 events per 100 patient-years). In the COMBI-AD study, the conclusion was: in patients with resected stage III melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation, dabrafenib plus trametinib was superior to placebo with respect to median relapse-free survival.
