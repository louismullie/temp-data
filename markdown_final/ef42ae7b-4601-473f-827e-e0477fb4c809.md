## Question

What did the ATLAS trial demonstrate about the efficacy of long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine compared with standard oral ART for maintaining HIV-1 suppression at 48 weeks?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the ATLAS trial demonstrated about the efficacy of long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine compared with standard oral ART for maintaining HIV-1 suppression at 48 weeks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and whether it was appropriate to answer this question. Then, I should verify the primary endpoint and the noninferiority margin. Next, I will extract the exact efficacy results and confirm the statistical interpretation. After that, I should review secondary outcomes and virologic failure details. Finally, I will consider safety, patient-reported outcomes, and how these results fit within the broader evidence base and guidelines, before stating a concise conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the study design so I don't jump to conclusions. ATLAS was a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial that enrolled adults with HIV-1 who had been virologically suppressed on standard oral ART for at least 6 months, and it compared switching to monthly intramuscular cabotegravir plus rilpivirine versus continuing the current oral regimen, with a 48-week primary endpoint analysis using the FDA Snapshot algorithm, which is exactly the right framework for assessing maintenance of suppression [^0889452e] [^f24d8bc7].

> I need to check the primary endpoint and margin. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48, and the prespecified noninferiority margin was 6 percentage points, which is a standard choice for maintenance-switch studies and allows a clinically meaningful but conservative inference of noninferiority if the upper bound of the 95% CI stays below that margin [^0889452e].

> Now, let me extract the exact efficacy results and double-check the numbers. In the intention-to-treat exposed analysis, 5 of 308 participants (1.6%) in the long-acting arm had HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48, compared with 3 of 308 (1.0%) in the oral therapy arm, yielding an adjusted treatment difference of 0.6 percentage points with a 95% CI of −1.2 to 2.5 percentage points, which meets the criterion for noninferiority because the upper bound is below 6 percentage points [^0889452e].

> Hold on, I should verify the secondary suppression endpoint too. The proportion with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 48 was 92.5% in the long-acting arm versus 95.5% in the oral arm, with an adjusted difference of −3.0 percentage points and a 95% CI of −6.7 to 0.7 percentage points, which also meets a prespecified noninferiority margin of −10 percentage points, reinforcing that suppression rates are clinically comparable between strategies [^0889452e].

> Next, I should review virologic failure details to ensure there isn't a hidden signal. Confirmed virologic failure, defined as two consecutive HIV-1 RNA measurements ≥ 200 copies/mL, occurred in 3 participants in the long-acting arm and 4 in the oral arm, indicating very low and similar failure rates across groups, which supports the noninferiority conclusion and suggests no excess risk with the injectable regimen at 48 weeks [^0889452e].

> I will now examine safety and tolerability, because efficacy alone isn't enough. Injection-site reactions were common in the long-acting arm, occurring in 75% of participants, but they were mostly mild or moderate and led to withdrawal in only 1% of cases, while serious adverse events were uncommon and balanced between arms, which aligns with the overall favorable tolerability profile seen in the trial [^0889452e].

> But wait, what about patient-reported outcomes and real-world applicability. Participants in ATLAS and the companion FLAIR study reported significantly greater treatment satisfaction and strong preference for long-acting therapy over daily oral regimens, which is clinically meaningful even if it doesn't change the virologic outcome, and it supports acceptability in routine care when noninferiority is established [^ab5d6193] [^b624cafc].

> Let me consider how this fits into the broader evidence base so I don't overgeneralize. These ATLAS results, alongside FLAIR, established the foundation for regulatory approval of monthly cabotegravir plus rilpivirine as a complete maintenance regimen, and subsequent data including ATLAS-2M extended the evidence to every-8-week dosing with sustained noninferiority and durability, which strengthens confidence in the long-acting strategy for appropriately selected, virologically suppressed adults [^c6fe9278] [^61ae8f67] [^f2737240].

> I should confirm guideline positioning to ensure clinical relevance. Current U.S. DHHS guidelines endorse long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine as an optimization option for people with HIV who are virologically suppressed, have no resistance to either agent, and are engaged in care, reflecting the noninferior efficacy and favorable patient-reported outcomes seen in ATLAS and related trials, while emphasizing careful selection and counseling about adherence to injection schedules [^047b846b] [^4b1099ab].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. The ATLAS trial demonstrated that switching from standard oral ART to monthly intramuscular cabotegravir plus rilpivirine was noninferior for maintaining HIV-1 suppression at 48 weeks, with 1.6% versus 1.0% having HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL and overlapping suppression rates around 92–96%, no excess confirmed virologic failure, manageable injection-site reactions, and high patient satisfaction, supporting long-acting therapy as a legitimate maintenance option for virologically suppressed adults [^0889452e].

The ATLAS trial showed that long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine (monthly injections) was **non-inferior to standard oral ART** for maintaining HIV-1 suppression at 48 weeks, with 1.6% vs 1.0% having HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL (adjusted difference 0.6%, 95% CI −1.2 to 2.5) [^0889452e]. Viral suppression < 50 copies/mL was achieved in 92.5% with long-acting therapy vs 95.5% with oral ART (adjusted difference −3.0%, 95% CI −6.7 to 0.7), meeting non-inferiority margins [^0889452e]. Confirmed virologic failure was rare and similar between arms (3 vs 4), and injection-site reactions were common but mostly mild; 75% reported injection-site pain, with 1% discontinuing for this reason [^0889452e]. These results support long-acting cabotegravir/rilpivirine as an effective, well-tolerated alternative to daily oral therapy for maintaining viral suppression [^0889452e].

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter, non-inferiority trial.
- **Population**: Adults with HIV-1 suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for ≥ 6 months on stable oral ART.
- **Intervention**: Switch to monthly intramuscular cabotegravir plus rilpivirine vs continue oral ART.
- **Primary endpoint**: Proportion with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks (FDA Snapshot) [^0889452e].
- **Non-inferiority margin**: 6% for ≥ 50 copies/mL; −10% for < 50 copies/mL [^0889452e].

---

## Primary efficacy outcomes

| **Endpoint** | **Long-acting cabotegravir + rilpivirine** | **Oral art** | **Adjusted difference (95% ci)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks | 1.6% (5/308) | 1.0% (3/308) | 0.6% (−1.2 to 2.5) |
| HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks | 92.5% (285/308) | 95.5% (294/308) | −3.0% (−6.7 to 0.7) |

---

Both endpoints met their **prespecified non-inferiority margins**, demonstrating comparable efficacy to oral ART [^0889452e].

---

## Virologic failure and resistance

Confirmed virologic failure (two consecutive HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL) occurred in 3 participants in the long-acting arm and 4 in the oral arm, with **no emergence of resistance** in the long-acting arm and minimal resistance in the oral arm, indicating a low and similar risk of virologic failure between groups [^0889452e].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Injection-site reactions**: Common (75%), mostly mild or moderate; 1% discontinued for this reason [^0889452e].
- **Serious adverse events**: Similar between arms (≤ 5%) [^0889452e].
- **Overall safety**: Comparable to oral ART, with no new safety signals [^0889452e].

---

## Patient-reported outcomes

Participants reported **greater treatment satisfaction and preference** for the long-acting regimen over oral therapy, highlighting improved quality of life and reduced treatment burden [^ab5d6193].

---

## Clinical implications

The ATLAS trial demonstrates that long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine is **non-inferior to standard oral ART** for maintaining HIV-1 suppression at 48 weeks, with a favorable safety profile and high patient satisfaction. This supports the use of long-acting injectable therapy as an effective alternative for patients seeking to reduce daily pill burden and improve adherence [^0889452e].

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosed every 2 months in adults with HIV-1 infection (ATLAS-2M), 48-week results: a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3b, non-inferiority study [^61ae8f67]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Phase 3 clinical studies showed non-inferiority of long-acting intramuscular cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosed every 4 weeks to oral antiretroviral therapy. Important phase 2 results of every 8 weeks dosing, and supportive modelling, underpin further evaluation of every 8 weeks dosing in this trial, which has the potential to offer greater convenience. Our objective was to compare the week 48 antiviral efficacy of cabotegravir plus rilpivirine long-acting dosed every 8 weeks with that of every 4 weeks dosing.

Methods

ATLAS-2M is an ongoing, randomised, multicentre (13 countries; Australia, Argentina, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the USA), open-label, phase 3b, non-inferiority study of cabotegravir plus rilpivirine long-acting maintenance therapy administered intramuscularly every 8 weeks (cabotegravir 600 mg plus rilpivirine 900 mg) or every 4 weeks (cabotegravir 400 mg plus rilpivirine 600 mg) to treatment-experienced adults living with HIV-1. Eligible newly recruited individuals must have received an uninterrupted first or second oral standard-of-care regimen for at least 6 months without virological failure and be aged 18 years or older. Eligible participants from the ATLAS trial, from both the oral standard-of-care and long-acting groups, must have completed the 52-week comparative phase with an ATLAS-2M screening plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive cabotegravir plus rilpivirine long-acting every 8 weeks or every 4 weeks. The randomisation schedule was generated by means of the GlaxoSmithKline validated randomisation software RANDALL NG. The primary endpoint at week 48 was HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies per mL (Snapshot, intention-to-treat exposed), with a non-inferiority margin of 4%. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03299049 and is ongoing.

Findings

Screening occurred between Oct 27, 2017, and May 31, 2018. Of 1149 individuals screened, 1045 participants were randomised to the every 8 weeks (n = 522) or every 4 weeks (n = 523) groups; 37% (n = 391) transitioned from every 4 weeks cabotegravir plus rilpivirine long-acting in ATLAS. Median participant age was 42 years (IQR 34–50); 27% (n = 280) female at birth; 73% (n = 763) white race. Cabotegravir plus rilpivirine long-acting every 8 weeks was non-inferior to dosing every 4 weeks (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies per mL; 2% vs 1%) with an adjusted treatment difference of 0·8 (95% CI -0·6–2·2). There were eight (2%, every 8 weeks group) and two (< 1%, every 4 weeks group) confirmed virological failures (two sequential measures ≥ 200 copies per mL). For the every 8 weeks group, five (63%) of eight had archived non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance-associated mutations to rilpivirine at baseline. The safety profile was similar between dosing groups, with 844 (81%) of 1045 participants having adverse events (excluding injection site reactions); no treatment-related deaths occurred.

Interpretation

The efficacy and safety profiles of dosing every 8 weeks and dosing every 4 weeks were similar. These results support the use of cabotegravir plus rilpivirine long-acting administered every 2 months as a therapeutic option for people living with HIV-1.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosed every 2 months in adults with human immunodeficiency virus 1 type 1 infection: 152-week results from ATLAS-2M, a randomized, open-label, phase 3b, noninferiority study [^f2737240]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cabotegravir (CAB) + rilpivirine (RPV) dosed intramuscularly monthly or every 2 months is a complete, long-acting (LA) regimen for the maintenance of HIV-1 virologic suppression. Here, we report the antiretroviral therapy as long acting suppression (ATLAS)-2M study week 152 results.

Methods

ATLAS-2M is a phase 3b, randomized, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of CAB+RPV LA every 8 weeks (Q8W) versus every 4 weeks (Q4W). Virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) individuals were randomized to receive CAB+RPV LA Q8W or Q4W. Endpoints included the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL and < 50 copies/mL, incidence of confirmed virologic failure (CVF; 2 consecutive measurements ≥ 200 copies/mL), safety, and tolerability.

Results

A total of 1045 participants received CAB+RPV LA (Q8W, n = 522; Q4W, n = 523). CAB+RPV LA Q8W demonstrated noninferior efficacy versus Q4W dosing, with 2.7% (n = 14) and 1.0% (n = 5) of participants having HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL, respectively, with adjusted treatment difference being 1.7% (95% CI: 0.1–3.3%), meeting the 4% noninferiority threshold. At week 152, 87% of participants maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (Q8W, 87% [n = 456]; Q4W, 86% [n = 449]). Overall, 12 (2.3%) participants in the Q8W arm and 2 (0.4%) in the Q4W arm had CVF. Eight and 10 participants with CVF had treatment-emergent, resistance-associated mutations to RPV and integrase inhibitors, respectively. Safety profiles were comparable, with no new safety signals observed since week 48.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate virologic suppression durability with CAB+RPV LA Q8W or Q4W for ∼3 years and confirm long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CAB+RPV LA as a complete regimen to maintain HIV-1 virologic suppression.

### Long-acting intramuscular cabotegravir and rilpivirine in adults with HIV-1 infection (LATTE-2): 96-week results of a randomised, open-label, phase 2b, non-inferiority trial [^28bf12a1]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Cabotegravir and rilpivirine are antiretroviral drugs in development as long-acting injectable formulations. The LATTE-2 study evaluated long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine for maintenance of HIV-1 viral suppression through 96 weeks.

Methods

In this randomised, phase 2b, open-label study, treatment-naive adults infected with HIV-1 initially received oral cabotegravir 30 mg plus abacavir-lamivudine 600–300 mg once daily. The objective of this study was to select an intramuscular dosing regimen based on a comparison of the antiviral activity, tolerability, and safety of the two intramuscular dosing regimens relative to oral cabotegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine. After a 20-week induction period on oral cabotegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine, patients with viral suppression (plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies per mL) were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to intramuscular long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine at 4-week intervals (long-acting cabotegravir 400 mg plus rilpivirine 600 mg; two 2 mL injections) or 8-week intervals (long-acting cabotegravir 600 mg plus rilpivirine 900 mg; two 3 mL injections) or continued oral cabotegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine. Randomisation was computer-generated with stratification by HIV-1 RNA (< 50 copies per mL, yes or no) during the first 12 weeks of the induction period. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with viral suppression at week 32 (as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm), protocol-defined virological failures, and safety events through 96 weeks. All randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug during the maintenance period were included in the primary efficacy and safety analyses. The primary analysis used a Bayesian approach to evaluate the hypothesis that the proportion with viral suppression for each long-acting regimen is not worse than the oral regimen proportion by more than 10% (denoted comparable) according to a prespecified decision rule (ie, posterior probability for comparability > 90%). Difference in proportions and associated 95% CIs were supportive to the primary analysis. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02120352.

Findings

Among 309 enrolled patients, 286 were randomly assigned to the maintenance period (115 to each of the 4-week and 8-week groups and 56 to the oral treatment group). This study is currently ongoing. At 32 weeks following randomisation, both long-acting regimens met primary criteria for comparability in viral suppression relative to the oral comparator group. Viral suppression was maintained at 32 weeks in 51 (91%) of 56 patients in the oral treatment group, 108 (94%) of 115 patients in the 4-week group (difference 2·8% [95% CI -5·8 to 11·5] vs oral treatment), and 109 (95%) of 115 patients in the 8-week group (difference 3·7% [-4·8 to 12·2] vs oral treatment). At week 96, viral suppression was maintained in 47 (84%) of 56 patients receiving oral treatment, 100 (87%) of 115 patients in the 4-week group, and 108 (94%) of 115 patients in the 8-week group. Three patients (1%) experienced protocol-defined virological failure (two in the 8-week group; one in the oral treatment group). Injection-site reactions were mild (3648 [84%] of 4360 injections) or moderate (673 [15%] of 4360 injections) in intensity and rarely resulted in discontinuation (two [< 1%] of 230 patients); injection-site pain was reported most frequently. Serious adverse events during maintenance were reported in 22 (10%) of 230 patients in the intramuscular groups (4-week and 8-week groups) and seven (13%) of 56 patients in the oral treatment group; none were drug related.

Interpretation

The two-drug combination of all-injectable, long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks was as effective as daily three-drug oral therapy at maintaining HIV-1 viral suppression through 96 weeks and was well accepted and tolerated.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine for maintenance of HIV-1 suppression [^ca868a04]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Simplified regimens for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection may increase patient satisfaction and facilitate adherence.

Methods

In this phase 3, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial involving patients who had had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 50 copies per milliliter for at least 6 months while taking standard oral antiretroviral therapy, we randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either continue their oral therapy or switch to monthly intramuscular injections of long-acting cabotegravir, an HIV-1 integrase strand-transfer inhibitor, and long-acting rilpivirine, a nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor. The primary end point was the percentage of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of 50 copies per milliliter or higher at week 48, determined with the use of the Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm.

Results

Treatment was initiated in 308 participants per group. At week 48, HIV-1 RNA levels of 50 copies per milliliter or higher were found in 5 participants (1.6%) receiving long-acting therapy and in 3 (1.0%) receiving oral therapy (adjusted difference, 0.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.2 to 2.5), a result that met the criterion for noninferiority for the primary end point (noninferiority margin, 6 percentage points). An HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48 was found in 92.5% of participants receiving long-acting therapy and in 95.5% of those receiving oral therapy (adjusted difference, -3.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -6.7 to 0.7), a result that met the criterion for noninferiority for this end point (noninferiority margin, -10 percentage points). Virologic failure was confirmed in 3 participants who received long-acting therapy and 4 participants who received oral therapy. Adverse events were more common in the long-acting-therapy group and included injection-site pain, which occurred in 231 recipients (75%) of long-acting therapy and was mild or moderate in most cases; 1% withdrew because of this event. Serious adverse events were reported in no more than 5% of participants in each group.

Conclusions

Monthly injections of long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine were noninferior to standard oral therapy for maintaining HIV-1 suppression. Injection-related adverse events were common but only infrequently led to medication withdrawal. (Funded by ViiV Healthcare and Janssen; ATLAS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02951052.).

### Cabotegravir plus rilpivirine, once a day, after induction with cabotegravir plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 infection (LATTE): a randomised, phase 2b, dose-ranging trial [^d151a257]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

In phase 1 trials, the HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor cabotegravir (GSK1265744) was well tolerated, both alone, and in combination with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor rilpivirine. We assessed cabotegravir plus rilpivirine, as a two-drug oral antiretroviral regimen, for the maintenance of viral suppression in antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected individuals.

Methods

In the phase 2b Long-Acting antireTroviral Treatment Enabling (LATTE) trial, a multicentre study done in Canada and the USA, antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected adults (aged ≥ 18 years) were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to oral cabotegravir 10 mg once a day, 30 mg once a day, 60 mg once a day, or oral efavirenz 600 mg once a day with dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for 24 weeks of induction. Patients who were virologically suppressed by week 24 received a two-drug maintenance regimen consisting of their randomly allocated cabotegravir dose plus oral rilpivirine 25 mg or continued efavirenz plus NRTIs for an additional 72 weeks. Patients and investigators were masked to doses of cabotegravir received for 96 weeks, but not to the assignment of cabotegravir or efavirenz. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with fewer than 50 copies per mL of HIV-1 RNA (US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm) at week 48. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01641809.

Findings

Of 243 patients randomly allocated and treated, 156 (86%) of 181 patients in the cabotegravir groups (52 [87%] of 60, 51 [85%] of 60, and 53 [87%] of 61 patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg groups, respectively) and 46 (74%) of 62 in the efavirenz group had fewer than 50 copies per mL of HIV-1 RNA after induction therapy. After patients in the cabotegravir groups were changed over from dual NRTIs to rilpivirine at week 24, 149 (82%; 95% CI 77–88) patients in the cabotegravir groups (48 [80%; 70–90], 48 [80%; 70–90], and 53 [87%; 78–95] patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg groups, respectively) versus 44 (71%; 60–82) in the efavirenz group were virologically suppressed at week 48, and 137 (76%; 69–82) receiving cabotegravir (41 [68%; 57–80], 45 [75%; 64–86], and 51 [84%; 74–93] patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg groups, respectively) versus 39 (63%; 51–75) in the efavirenz group were virologically suppressed at week 96. Treatment-related adverse events were reported by 93 (51%) cabotegravir-treated patients (28 [47%], 32 [53%], and 33 [54%] patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg groups, respectively) and 42 (68%) efavirenz-treated patients. Six (3%) patients in the cabotegravir groups (one [2%], one [2%], and four [7%] patients in the 10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg groups, respectively) withdrew because of treatment-emergent adverse events compared with nine (15%) in the efavirenz group.

Interpretation

Cabotegravir plus dual NRTI therapy had potent antiviral activity during the induction phase. As a two-drug maintenance therapy, cabotegravir plus rilpivirine provided antiviral activity similar to efavirenz plus dual NRTIs until the end of week 96. Combined efficacy and safety results lend support to our selection of oral cabotegravir 30 mg once a day for further assessment. LATTE precedes studies of the assessment of longacting injectable formulations of both drugs as a two-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine after oral induction for HIV-1 infection [^c307864f]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Long-acting injectable regimens may simplify therapy for patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.

Methods

We conducted a phase 3, randomized, open-label trial in which adults with HIV-1 infection who had not previously received antiretroviral therapy were given 20 weeks of daily oral induction therapy with dolutegravir-abacavir-lamivudine. Participants who had an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter after 16 weeks were randomly assigned (1:1) to continue the current oral therapy or switch to oral cabotegravir plus rilpivirine for 1 month followed by monthly injections of long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine. The primary end point was the percentage of participants who had an HIV-1 RNA level of 50 copies per milliliter or higher at week 48 (Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm).

Results

At week 48, an HIV-1 RNA level of 50 copies per milliliter or higher was found in 6 of 283 participants (2.1%) who received long-acting therapy and in 7 of 283 (2.5%) who received oral therapy (adjusted difference, -0.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.8 to 2.1), a result that met the criterion for noninferiority for the primary end point (margin, 6 percentage points). An HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48 was found in 93.6% who received long-acting therapy and in 93.3% who received oral therapy (adjusted difference, 0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -3.7 to 4.5), a result that met the criterion for noninferiority for this end point (margin, -10 percentage points). Of the participants who received long-acting therapy, 86% reported injection-site reactions (median duration, 3 days; mild or moderate severity, 99% of cases); 4 participants withdrew from the trial for injection-related reasons. Grade 3 or higher adverse events and events that met liver-related stopping criteria occurred in 11% and 2%, respectively, who received long-acting therapy and in 4% and 1% who received oral therapy. Treatment satisfaction increased after participants switched to long-acting therapy; 91% preferred long-acting therapy at week 48.

Conclusions

Therapy with long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine was noninferior to oral therapy with dolutegravir-abacavir-lamivudine with regard to maintaining HIV-1 suppression. Injection-site reactions were common. (Funded by ViiV Healthcare and Janssen; FLAIR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02938520.).

### Cabotegravir plus rilpivirine injection for virally suppressed persons with HIV-1 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^5f3b1bfd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of cabotegravir/rilpivirine long-acting formulation compared to oral standard of care at 48 and 52 weeks.

Method

We conducted an electronic search (2005–2024) across databases for articles comparing the safety and efficacy of long-acting cabotegravir/rilpivirine with oral triple ART regimens. We analyzed efficacy and safety (treatment discontinuation and adverse effects). We used proportions of participants maintaining viral suppression, experiencing adverse drug effects or discontinuing treatment due to trial regimen, risk ratios, and 95% confidence intervals for pooled estimates.

Findings

Five RCTs with 2215 participants were analyzed, with 1390 receiving cabotegravir/rilpivirine injections. The analysis found long-acting cabotegravir/rilpivirine as effective as oral ART for viral load suppression (RR [P = 0.23, 0.99 95% CI; 0.97–1.01], I² = 0%) up to 52 weeks. However, more adverse effects were reported with the oral treatment [RR 1.32 (95% CI; 1.12–1.54), I² = 56%]. Pooled reports showed a significant an increased risk of treatment withdrawal in the oral group, [RR 3.61 (95% CI; 0.87–14.98), I² = 53 IMPLICATION: Findings from this meta-analysis emphasised the efficacy and safety of Cabotegravir/rilpivirine long-acting formulation in providing long-term maintenance of viral load suppression in HIV-1 infection with a tolerable safety profile.

Abstract

Background

Cabotegravir (CAB) + rilpivirine (RPV) dosed intramuscularly monthly or every 2 months is a complete, long-acting (LA) regimen for the maintenance of HIV-1 virologic suppression. Here, we report the antiretroviral therapy as long acting suppression (ATLAS)-2M study week 152 results.

Methods

ATLAS-2M is a phase 3b, randomized, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of CAB+RPV LA every 8 weeks (Q8W) versus every 4 weeks (Q4W). Virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) individuals were randomized to receive CAB+RPV LA Q8W or Q4W. Endpoints included the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL and < 50 copies/mL, incidence of confirmed virologic failure (CVF; 2 consecutive measurements ≥ 200 copies/mL), safety, and tolerability.

Results

A total of 1045 participants received CAB+RPV LA (Q8W, n = 522; Q4W, n = 523). CAB+RPV LA Q8W demonstrated noninferior efficacy versus Q4W dosing, with 2.7% (n = 14) and 1.0% (n = 5) of participants having HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL, respectively, with adjusted treatment difference being 1.7% (95% CI: 0.1–3.3%), meeting the 4% noninferiority threshold. At week 152, 87% of participants maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (Q8W, 87% [n = 456]; Q4W, 86% [n = 449]). Overall, 12 (2.3%) participants in the Q8W arm and 2 (0.4%) in the Q4W arm had CVF. Eight and 10 participants with CVF had treatment-emergent, resistance-associated mutations to RPV and integrase inhibitors, respectively. Safety profiles were comparable, with no new safety signals observed since week 48.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate virologic suppression durability with CAB+RPV LA Q8W or Q4W for ∼3 years and confirm long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CAB+RPV LA as a complete regimen to maintain HIV-1 virologic suppression.

METHODS

Study Design

ATLAS-2M is a phase 3b randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group noninferiority study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CAB+RPV LA administered Q8W versus Q4W in virologically suppressed PWH. The full inclusion and exclusion criteria, study design, and procedures have been previously published. The full study protocol is available online.

The ATLAS-2M study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent. The study protocol, amendments, informed consent, and other information that required preapproval were reviewed and approved by a national, regional, or investigational center ethics committee or institutional review board.

Randomization

Full details of randomization have been published previously. Participants were randomly assigned (unblinded) 1:1 to receive CAB+RPV LA Q8W or Q4W. Randomization was stratified by previous CAB+RPV exposure (0 weeks, 1–24 weeks, > 24 weeks) to account for individuals who transitioned from the ATLAS study having received CAB+RPV LA.

Outcomes

The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA of 50 copies/mL or greater at week 48 using the US Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm, as previously published. Endpoints assessed at week 152 included the following: the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL and HIV-1 RNA of 50 copies/mL or greater, incidence of confirmed virologic failure (CVF; 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements ≥ 200 copies/mL), treatment-emergent genotypic and phenotypic resistance, incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), proportion of discontinuations due to AEs, CAB+RPV pharmacokinetics, and treatment satisfaction measured using the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status version (HIVTSQs).

Statistical Analysis

The efficacy analyses performed at week 152 included the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL and 50 copies/mL or greater, per the Snapshot algorithm at week 152, based on the intention-to-treat exposed (ITT-E) population and per-protocol population. The analysis method and stratification factors from the primary analyses were used, with modifications to include coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–related reasons for participants having no virologic data.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine for maintenance of HIV-1 suppression [^0889452e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study ATLAS (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) was published by Susan Swindells and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Human immunodeficiency virus infection. In the ATLAS (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) study, the trial question was: is the combination of long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine non-inferior to standard oral antiretroviral therapy for the maintenance of HIV-1 infection suppression? In the ATLAS (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ATLAS (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) study, the population was: 616 patients (203 female, 413 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL for at least 6 months while taking standard oral antiretroviral therapy. The key exclusion criteria were evidence of active HBV infection, previous virologic failure, interruption of the current antiretroviral regimen within 6 months before screening, or any interruption exceeding 1 month in duration. In the ATLAS (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) study, the interventions were: n = 308 long-acting therapy (a 3 mL intramuscular injection of 600 mg cabotegravir and 900 mg rilpivirine, followed by a 2 mL injection of a dose of 400 mg and 600 mg every 4 weeks through week 52) n = 308 oral therapy (continuation of the current antiretroviral regimen for 52 weeks). In the ATLAS (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 50 copies/ml at week 48 (1.6% vs. 1%; AD 0.6%, 95% CI -1.2 to 2.5). In the ATLAS (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in HIV-1 RNA level < 50 copies/ml at week 48 (92.5% vs. 95.5%; ARD -3, 95% CI -6.7 to 0.7). In the ATLAS (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. significant differences in at least one adverse event (95% vs. 71%), mild to moderate drug-related adverse events (29% vs. 3%). In the ATLAS (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) study, the conclusion was: in patients who had had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL for at least 6 months while taking standard oral antiretroviral therapy, long-acting therapy was noninferior to oral therapy with respect to HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 50 copies/ml at week 48.

### Week 96 extension results of a phase 3 study evaluating long-acting cabotegravir with rilpivirine for HIV-1 treatment [^6bf1b109]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

ATLAS (NCT02951052), a phase 3, multicenter, open-label study, demonstrated that switching to injectable cabotegravir (CAB) with rilpivirine (RPV) long-acting dosed every 4weeks was noninferior at week (W) 48 to continuing three-drug daily oral current antiretroviral therapy (CAR). Results from the W 96 analysis are presented.

Methods and Design

Participants completing W 52 of ATLAS were given the option to withdraw, transition to ATLAS-2M (NCT03299049), or enter an Extension Phase to continue long-acting therapy (Long-acting arm) or switch from CAR to long-acting therapy (Switch arm). Endpoints assessed at W 96 included proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50copies/ml, incidence of confirmed virologic failure (CVF; two consecutive HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200copies/ml), safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and patient-reported outcomes.

Results

Most participants completing the Maintenance Phase transitioned to ATLAS-2M (88%, n = 502/572). Overall, 52 participants were included in the W 96 analysis of ATLAS; of these, 100% (n = 23/23) and 97% (n = 28/29) in the Long-acting and Switch arms had plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50copies/ml at W 96, respectively. One participant had plasma HIV-1 RNA 50copies/ml or higher in the Switch arm (173 copies/ml). No participants met the CVF criterion during the Extension Phase. No new safety signals were identified. All Switch arm participants surveyed preferred long-acting therapy to their previous daily oral regimen (100%, n = 27/27).

Conclusion

In this subgroup of ATLAS, 98% (n = 51/52) of participants at the Extension Phase W 96 analysis maintained virologic suppression with long-acting therapy. Safety, efficacy, and participant preference results support the therapeutic potential of long-acting CAB+RPV treatment for virologically suppressed people living with HIV-1.

### Cabotegravir and rilpivirine for treatment of HIV infection in Africa: week 96 results from the phase 3b randomized, open-label, noninferiority CARES trial [^942c0e1c]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Evaluation of the durable efficacy and safety of long-acting injectable therapy for HIV is needed in African populations. In a multicenter, open-label phase 3b trial, 512 African adults with HIV-1, stable on first-line oral therapy, with screening plasma viral load (VL) < 50 copiesml -1 and without past virologic failure were randomized (1:1) to continue oral therapy or switch to cabotegravir (600mg) and rilpivirine (900mg) intramuscular injections every 8weeks (optional 4-week oral lead-in). VL was monitored every 24weeks. Here the primary outcome for our analysis up to 96 weeks was VL < 50 copiesml -1, using the Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm (noninferiority margin 10%) in the intention-to-treat exposed population. At 96weeks, 247/255 (97%) in the long-acting group and 250/257 (97%) in the oral therapy group had VL < 50 copiesml -1 (difference -0.4%; 95% confidence interval -3.1% to 2.0%), demonstrating noninferiority. Adverse events of severity grade ≥ 3 occurred in 41/255 (16%) in the long-acting group and in 22/257 (9%) in the oral therapy group, mostly considered unrelated to the study drug; only one treatment-related adverse event in the long-acting group led to a decision to discontinue treatment (injection-site abscess). Cabotegravir and rilpivirine long-acting therapy produced durable virologic suppression, met the prespecified noninferiority endpoint compared with oral therapy and demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Long-acting therapy may be considered for use in African treatment programs. PACTR registration: 202104874490818.

### Switch to long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine in virologically suppressed adults with HIV in Africa (CARES): week 48 results from a randomised, multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^ac545e97]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

Long-acting injectable cabotegravir and rilpivirine is licensed for individualised treatment of HIV-1 infection in resource-rich settings. Additional evidence is required to support use in African treatment programmes where demographic factors, viral subtypes, previous treatment, and delivery and monitoring approaches differ. The aim of this study was to determine whether switching to long-acting therapy with injections every 8 weeks is non-inferior to daily oral therapy in Africa.

Methods

CARES is a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial being conducted at eight sites in Uganda, Kenya, and South Africa. Participants with HIV viral load below 50 copies per mL on oral antiretroviral therapy and no history of virological failure were randomly assigned (1:1; web-based, permuted blocks) to receive cabotegravir (600 mg) and rilpivirine (900 mg) by intramuscular injection every 8 weeks, or to continue oral therapy. Viral load was monitored every 24 weeks. The primary outcome was week 48 viral load below 50 copies per mL, assessed with the Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm (non-inferiority margin 10 percentage points) in the intention-to-treat exposed population. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (202104874490818) and is ongoing up to 96 weeks.

Findings

Between Sept 1, 2021, and Aug 31, 2022, we enrolled 512 participants (295 [58%] female; 380 [74%] previous non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor exposure). Week 48 viral load was below 50 copies per mL in 246 (96%) of 255 participants in the long-acting therapy group and 250 (97%) of 257 in the oral therapy group (difference -0·8 percentage points; 95% CI -3·7 to 2·3), demonstrating non-inferiority (confirmed in per-protocol analysis). Two participants had virological failure in the long-acting therapy group, both with drug resistance; none had virological failure in the oral therapy group. Adverse events of grade 3 or greater severity occurred in 24 (9%) participants on long-acting therapy and ten (4%) on oral therapy; one participant discontinued long-acting therapy (for injection-site reaction).

Interpretation

Long-acting therapy had non-inferior efficacy compared with oral therapy, with a good safety profile, and can be considered for African treatment programmes.

### Week 96 extension results of a phase 3 study evaluating long-acting cabotegravir with rilpivirine for HIV-1 treatment [^fa1d71bc]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

ATLAS (NCT02951052), a phase 3, multicenter, open-label study, demonstrated that switching to injectable cabotegravir (CAB) with rilpivirine (RPV) long-acting dosed every 4 weeks was noninferior at week (W) 48 to continuing three-drug daily oral current antiretroviral therapy (CAR). Results from the W 96 analysis are presented.

Methods and design:

Participants completing W 52 of ATLAS were given the option to withdraw, transition to ATLAS-2M (NCT03299049), or enter an Extension Phase to continue long-acting therapy (Long-acting arm) or switch from CAR to long-acting therapy (Switch arm). Endpoints assessed at W 96 included proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml, incidence of confirmed virologic failure (CVF; two consecutive HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/ml), safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and patient-reported outcomes.

Results:

Most participants completing the Maintenance Phase transitioned to ATLAS-2M (88%, n = 502/572). Overall, 52 participants were included in the W 96 analysis of ATLAS; of these, 100% (n = 23/23) and 97% (n = 28/29) in the Long-acting and Switch arms had plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml at W 96, respectively. One participant had plasma HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/ml or higher in the Switch arm (173 copies/ml). No participants met the CVF criterion during the Extension Phase. No new safety signals were identified. All Switch arm participants surveyed preferred long-acting therapy to their previous daily oral regimen (100%, n = 27/27).

Conclusion:

In this subgroup of ATLAS, 98% (n = 51/52) of participants at the Extension Phase W 96 analysis maintained virologic suppression with long-acting therapy. Safety, efficacy, and participant preference results support the therapeutic potential of long-acting CAB+RPV treatment for virologically suppressed people living with HIV-1.

### Cabotegravir and rilpivirine (Cabenuva) [^8b95575c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary analysis was conducted after all participants completed their Week 48 visit or discontinued the trial prematurely.

At baseline, in FLAIR and ATLAS the median age was 34 years and 40 years, 22% and 32% were female, and 24% and 31% were non-White, respectively. In both studies, 7% had CD4+ cell count < 350 cells/mm3; these characteristics were similar between treatment arms. In ATLAS, participants received an NNRTI (50%), integrase inhibitor (33%), or protease inhibitor (17%) as their baseline third-agent class prior to randomization; this was similar between treatment arms. Participants with hepatitis B co-infection were excluded from the trial.

The primary endpoint of FLAIR and ATLAS was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at Week 48.

The primary endpoint and other Week 48 outcomes, including outcomes by key baseline factors, for FLAIR and ATLAS are shown in Tables 17 and 18.

Adjusted for study and randomization stratification factors, treatment difference of HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL for the pooled data was 0.2% with 95% CI (-1.4%, 1.7%).

Participants in both the FLAIR and ATLAS trials were virologically suppressed prior to Day 1 or at study entry, respectively, and no clinically relevant change from baseline in CD4+ cell counts was observed.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosed every 2 months in adults with human immunodeficiency virus 1 type 1 infection: 152-week results from ATLAS-2M, a randomized, open-label, phase 3b, noninferiority study [^84e89e2a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The noninferior efficacy of CAB+RPV LA Q8W dosing compared with Q4W dosing at week 152 of the phase 3b ATLAS-2M study confirms and extends the 48-week and 96-week results, demonstrating that CAB+RPV LA dosed Q8W is a durable and effective therapy for the maintenance of HIV-1 virologic suppression in PWH. At week 152, 2.7% of participants receiving CAB+RPV LA Q8W and 1.0% receiving Q4W had HIV-1 RNA of 50 copies/mL or greater. Overall, 87% of participants maintained virologic suppression after 152 weeks of LA therapy (Q8W or Q4W), supporting the durability of CAB+RPV LA over approximately 3 years. Virologic failure through week 152 occurred more frequently in the CAB+RPV LA Q8W arm (2%) than in the Q4W arm (< 1%). Similar rates have been reported in switch studies of dual oral therapy with DTG-RPV, with 1% of participants meeting the protocol-defined confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL and a confirmatory measurement of HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL) at week 148 of the SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 studies (Regimen Switch to Dolutegravir + Rilpivirine From Current Antiretroviral Regimen in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Infected and Virologically Suppressed Adults). Participant retention was high through week 152, with 87% (n = 452) of Q8W and 85% (n = 447) of Q4W participants remaining in the study, demonstrating that most participants receiving injectable therapy wanted to continue injections after approximately 3 years of CAB+RPV. These Q8W data have recently been replicated in the CARISEL study.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine for HIV-1 suppression: switch to 2-monthly dosing after 5 years of daily oral therapy [^6ed3cf03]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Long-acting formulations of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV) have demonstrated efficacy in Phase 3 studies. POLAR (NCT03639311) assessed antiviral activity and safety of CAB+RPV long-acting administered every 2months (Q2M) in adults living with HIV-1 who previously received daily oral CAB+RPV in LATTE (NCT01641809).

Design

A Phase 2b, multicenter, open-label, rollover study.

Methods

LATTE participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50copies/ml who completed at least 300weeks on study were eligible. Participants elected to switch to either CAB+RPV long-acting Q2M or daily oral dolutegravir/RPV for maintenance of virologic suppression. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50copies/ml at Month 12 (M12) per the Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm. The incidence of confirmed virologic failure (CVF, two consecutive HIV-1 RNA measurements greater than or equal to 200copies/ml), as well as safety, laboratory, and patient-reported outcomes (HIV Treatment Satisfaction and preference questionnaires) were also assessed.

Results

Of 97 participants enrolled, 90 chose to receive CAB+RPV long-acting and seven chose dolutegravir/RPV. At M12, no participant had HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50copies/ml or met the CVF criterion in either treatment group. No new safety signals were identified. Total treatment satisfaction was high at Baseline and remained stable through M12 across both treatment groups. Overall, 88% (n = 77/88) of long-acting arm participants preferred CAB+RPV long-acting to oral CAB+RPV.

Conclusion

CAB+RPV long-acting maintained virologic suppression in participants who had previously received daily oral CAB+RPV for at least 5years in LATTE, with a favorable safety profile. Most participants preferred CAB+RPV long-acting to their prior oral CAB+RPV regimen at M12.

### Exploring predictors of HIV-1 virologic failure to long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine: a multivariable analysis [^815fb350]. AIDS (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study population

Data from participants randomized to long-acting CAB+RPV Q4W or Q8W dosing within the Phase 3/3b FLAIR, ATLAS or ATLAS-2M (subset naive to CAB+RPV at entry) studies through Week 48 were pooled in a post-hoc analysis. FLAIR, ATLAS and ATLAS-2M are randomized, multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, noninferiority Phase 3/3b studies evaluating long-acting CAB+RPV dosed Q4W vs. continuing standard of care (SOC) oral therapy (FLAIR and ATLAS) or long-acting CAB+RPV dosed Q8W vs. Q4W (ATLAS-2M). These studies were designed similarly and conducted in similar timeframes, facilitating the meaningful pooling of the data. The full study designs and eligibility criteria have been published previously (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1, study designs). Participants were at least 18 years of age and virologically suppressed (plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml) without evidence of any major INSTI or NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) (except K103N). Baseline characteristics have been presented previously and were broadly similar across the studies. FLAIR participants were ART naive at study entry and underwent induction with a three-drug regimen for 20 weeks to achieve virologic suppression before initiating randomized therapy, while ATLAS and ATLAS-2M participants were ART experienced before study entry. ATLAS-2M included a proportion of participants (approximately half) who rolled over from the SOC or long-acting CAB+RPV Q4W arm of the ATLAS study. To obtain a consistent pooled study population with aligned pharmacokinetic parameters and time on therapy, participants in ATLAS-2M who rolled over from ATLAS with prior CAB+RPV exposure had only ATLAS data included in the current analysis. All studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study protocols were approved by the investigational review board.

### Exploring predictors of HIV-1 virologic failure to long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine: a multivariable analysis [^5b33c35a]. AIDS (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) consists of a combination of two or more oral agents from at least two drug classes, such as an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) as well as one or two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Cabotegravir (CAB), an INSTI, and rilpivirine (RPV), a non-NRTI (NNRTI), have been developed as the first long-acting, injectable, two-drug ART regimen administered intramuscularly monthly or every 2 months for the maintenance of virologic suppression in people living with HIV-1.

Long-acting CAB+RPV is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in virologically suppressed adults (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml), per positive results from three Phase 3/3b studies. The Phase 3 FLAIR (NCT02938520) and ATLAS (NCT02951052) studies demonstrated that long-acting CAB+RPV dosed every 4 weeks (Q4W) was noninferior to daily oral ART in maintaining virologic suppression in stably suppressed participants through 48 weeks; noninferiority was established within each study and in a pooled analysis. In addition, long-acting CAB+RPV dosed every 8 weeks (Q8W) demonstrated noninferior efficacy to Q4W dosing with a similar safety profile in the Phase 3b ATLAS-2M (NCT03299049) study. In the FLAIR, ATLAS and ATLAS-2M studies, confirmed virologic failure (CVF; two consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements ≥ 200 copies/ml) was rare, occurring in 1% (n = 17/1636) of participants in the long-acting CAB+RPV arms combined. Similar CVF rates were observed among participants who continued daily oral therapy in FLAIR and ATLAS, with three out of 283 (1.1%) and four out of 308 (1.3%) participants meeting the CVF criterion, respectively.

Efficacy

After 152 weeks of therapy, Q8W dosing of CAB+RPV LA continued to demonstrate similar antiviral activity compared with Q4W dosing (Table 1). At week 152, 14 (3%) participants in the Q8W arm and 5 (1%) in the Q4W arm had HIV-1 RNA of 50 copies/mL or greater. The adjusted treatment difference in proportions was 1.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]:.1–3.3%), meeting the prespecified 4% noninferiority threshold. At week 152, 87% (n = 456/522) of participants in the Q8W arm and 86% (n = 449/523) in the Q4W arm had HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies/mL. The adjusted treatment difference (Q8W – Q4W arm) in proportions was 1.5% (95% CI: −2.6% to 5.6%), meeting the prespecified −10% noninferiority threshold. Tests for homogeneity were not significantly different by prior CAB+RPV exposure strata (HIV-1 RNA: < 50 copies/mL [P = 0.441]; ≥ 50 copies/mL [P = 0.146]). No treatment differences between Q8W and Q4W dosing regimens for the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA of 50 copies/mL or greater and less than 50 copies/mL were observed within most of the demographic and baseline characteristic subgroups (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3).

CAB+RPV LA demonstrated high satisfaction levels in both treatment arms, with participants favoring the Q8W dosing regimen at all time points. This aligns with the high satisfaction and preference for CAB+RPV LA in patient-reported outcome analyses.

The observed CAB and RPV plasma concentrations were consistent with previous observations. Mean CAB and RPV concentrations were lower in participants receiving Q8W dosing compared with Q4W dosing. For both regimens, the concentrations were above the respective PA-IC 90 values, and virologic suppression was similar for both dosing regimens. For both regimens, RPV appeared to reach near steady state by week 96, and steady state was confirmed for CAB by week 48. This is consistent with the longer half-life for RPV (13–28 weeks) compared with CAB (5.6–11.5 weeks). CAB and RPV concentrations following Q4W dosing recapitulated those observed with Q4W dosing in FLAIR, and concentrations for Q8W dosing were consistent with those observed with Q8W dosing in LATTE-2 (long-acting intramuscular cabotegravir and rilpivirine in adults with HIV-1 infection) and ATLAS.

Variable RPV concentrations have been observed in real-world evidence studies and are potentially associated with therapeutic failure or toxicity; however, the majority of participants with CVF in the present study had RPV concentrations 3-fold greater than the PA-IC 90.

Limitations

The current study has several limitations. The lack of blinding may have caused participants to anticipate and report more AEs due to the administration of CAB+RPV LA. Due to the difference in dosing frequency, more frequent safety assessments were performed for the Q4W arm than the Q8W arm, which may have increased the number of AEs reported in the Q4W arm. A direct comparison with oral treatments was not possible due to the lack of an oral ART comparator arm. While a post hoc indirect analysis showed comparability of Q8W dosing with oral therapy, definitive conclusions cannot be made regarding adherence benefits with CAB+RPV LA versus oral ART from these data.

Conclusions

In summary, CAB+RPV LA dosed Q8W continued to be noninferior to Q4W therapy at 152 weeks. These long-term data demonstrate that CAB+RPV LA administered monthly or Q2M is an effective, durable, and well-tolerated treatment for the maintenance of HIV-1 virologic suppression.

Endpoints and assessments

The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the antiviral activity of CAB+RPV long-acting Q2M in suppressed HIV-1-infected ART-experienced participants. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies/ml at Month 12 as per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Snapshot algorithm. Secondary endpoints assessed at Month 12 included the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml at Month 12 as per the FDA Snapshot algorithm; the incidence of protocol-defined confirmed virologic failure (CVF; two consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements of ≥ 200 copies/ml); incidence of treatment-emergent genotypic and phenotypic resistance; absolute values and changes in CD4 + cell count over time; incidence and severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities; proportion of participants who discontinue treatment due to adverse events; change from Baseline in laboratory parameters over time; and treatment satisfaction, as measured by the 12-item HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status (HIVTSQs) and change (HIVTSQc) versions at Baseline, Month 6, and Month 12. HIVTSQ responses are rated on 6-point Likert scales, with the HIVTSQs total score ranging from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 66 (very satisfied), and the HIVTSQc total score ranging from –33 (much less satisfied now) to 33 (much more satisfied now). An exploratory endpoint evaluating participant preference for CAB+RPV long-acting compared with their prior daily oral CAB+RPV regimen was also included (single-item questionnaire) at Month 12. The pharmacokinetic profiles of CAB and RPV were not investigated in the study as they have been extensively characterized in previous Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of the daily oral regimen and the i.m. therapy given every 4 or 8 weeks.

Statistical analysis

No statistical hypotheses of treatment comparisons were tested within this study due to the nonrandomized nature of the study and the unbalanced number of participants between comparator arms. Consequently, all presented data are descriptive.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine for HIV-1 suppression: switch to 2-monthly dosing after 5 years of daily oral therapy [^0adfb007]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Owing to the small number of participants enrolled, the study was not adequately powered to draw statistical inferences from the results. Further, as participants could choose which maintenance regimen they received, POLAR was nonrandomized and, therefore, the numbers of participants differed greatly between comparator arms. As a result, comparisons between CAB+RPV long-acting and DTG/RPV cannot be drawn and any differences in results must be interpreted within this context. In addition, all participants had completed more than 300 weeks of oral CAB+RPV therapy prior to study entry and are therefore a highly selected population comprising participants with established efficacy with, and tolerability to, CAB+RPV. This caveat limits the generalizability of the findings to a wider population initiating CAB+RPV long-acting as a novel regimen. The small number of females (sex at birth) in the study should also be considered in the interpretation of the findings. The design of the study prevented blinding, which could influence the reporting of adverse events and patient-reported outcomes; however, this would not affect the efficacy findings, which were based on objective measurements of viral load.

Conclusion

Injectable CAB+RPV long-acting, administered Q2M, maintained high levels of virologic suppression in participants previously treated with oral CAB+RPV, with no participants having virologic nonresponse or meeting the CVF criterion through Month 12 of the POLAR study. The injectable CAB+RPV long-acting regimen was well tolerated and preferred over oral therapy by this treatment-experienced cohort, who had previously received daily oral CAB+RPV for at least 5 years in the LATTE study. Taken together, these results complement the results observed in larger Phase 3 studies evaluating the injectable regimen and support CAB+RPV long-acting as an efficacious and well-tolerated Q2M maintenance therapy for PWH.

Materials and methods

Study design and participants

POLAR is a Phase 2b, open-label, multicenter (Canada and the USA), nonrandomized rollover study assessing the efficacy and safety of i.m. CAB+RPV long-acting Q2M in ART-experienced adults living with HIV-1 who received once-daily oral CAB+RPV treatment in the Phase 2b LATTE study (Fig. 1 a). The full study protocol is available at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03639311. In brief, eligible participants were at least 18 years of age, virologically suppressed, and had completed at least 300 weeks of the LATTE study with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml at Week 300. If participants had plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies/ml at Week 300, a single repeat test to determine eligibility was allowed after consultation with the medical monitor. Participants from LATTE were excluded if they had two or more sequential plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies/ml or any plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 200 copies/ml in the last 6 months.

Methods

Study design and participants

ATLAS is a randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of intramuscular long-acting CAB+RPV Q4W for the maintenance of virologic suppression following a switch from CAR in ART-experienced adults living with HIV-1 (Fig. 1 a). The study design, along with the complete eligibility/exclusion criteria, has been published previously. The full study protocol is available at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02951052. In brief, eligible participants were at least 18 years old and ART-experienced, having received uninterrupted ART without a change in medication or virologic failure for at least 6 months before screening. Participants with virologic suppression were randomized (1: 1) to either continue CAR or switch to long-acting therapy Q4W (Long-acting arm; CAB 400 mg + RPV 600 mg, following an initial CAB 600 mg with RPV 900 mg loading dose) for the duration of the Maintenance Phase. Participants receiving long-acting therapy were given an oral lead-in of CAB 30 mg with RPV 25 mg for at least 4 weeks to assess safety and side effects before starting the intramuscular regimen.

The study included a Maintenance Phase (Day 1 until CAB+RPV long-acting is commercially available locally) and a Long-Term Follow-Up Phase (LTFU, 52 weeks) for participants who discontinued for any reason after receiving at least one dose of CAB long-acting and/or RPV long-acting. Participants entered the study on Day 1 and elected to transition from daily oral CAB+RPV to either i.m. CAB+RPV long-acting Q2M (long-acting arm; CAB long-acting 600 mg and RPV long-acting 900 mg) or daily oral single-tablet dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg/RPV 25 mg (DTG/RPV arm) for 12 months. To cover preplanned, short-term interruptions of long-acting dosing, investigators could provide daily oral CAB 30 mg and RPV 25 mg as an oral therapy following consultation with the medical monitor. Participants in the long-acting arm will continue to receive CAB+RPV long-acting Q2M until the regimen is approved and commercially available within the local sector (including through local public/government health sectors), the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, or the participant meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation. DTG/RPV tablets were provided via commercial routes. Any participant who received at least one dose of CAB long-acting and/or RPV long-acting and discontinued CAB+RPV long-acting for any reason entered a 52-week LTFU Phase and remained on an alternative suppressive ART regimen for at least 52 weeks after the last dose. The cut-off date for this analysis predates the COVID-19 2020 pandemic. POLAR was conducted in accordance with the principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki and with Good Clinical Practice. All participants provided written informed consent, and the protocol was approved by an institutional review board or ethics committee.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine for HIV-1 suppression: switch to 2-monthly dosing after 5 years of daily oral therapy [^c1af5eee]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

Long-acting formulations of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV) have demonstrated efficacy in Phase 3 studies. POLAR (NCT03639311) assessed antiviral activity and safety of CAB+RPV long-acting administered every 2 months (Q2M) in adults living with HIV-1 who previously received daily oral CAB+RPV in LATTE (NCT01641809).

Design:

A Phase 2b, multicenter, open-label, rollover study.

Methods:

LATTE participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml who completed at least 300 weeks on study were eligible. Participants elected to switch to either CAB+RPV long-acting Q2M or daily oral dolutegravir/RPV for maintenance of virologic suppression. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies/ml at Month 12 (M12) per the Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm. The incidence of confirmed virologic failure (CVF, two consecutive HIV-1 RNA measurements greater than or equal to 200 copies/ml), as well as safety, laboratory, and patient-reported outcomes (HIV Treatment Satisfaction and preference questionnaires) were also assessed.

Results:

Of 97 participants enrolled, 90 chose to receive CAB+RPV long-acting and seven chose dolutegravir/RPV. At M12, no participant had HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies/ml or met the CVF criterion in either treatment group. No new safety signals were identified. Total treatment satisfaction was high at Baseline and remained stable through M12 across both treatment groups. Overall, 88% (n = 77/88) of long-acting arm participants preferred CAB+RPV long-acting to oral CAB+RPV.

Conclusion:

CAB+RPV long-acting maintained virologic suppression in participants who had previously received daily oral CAB+RPV for at least 5 years in LATTE, with a favorable safety profile. Most participants preferred CAB+RPV long-acting to their prior oral CAB+RPV regimen at M12.

Efficacy

At W 96, long-acting CAB+RPV maintained virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml) in most participants across both treatment arms. In the Long-acting arm, comprising participants randomized to long-acting CAB+RPV at the beginning of the Maintenance Phase, 100% (n = 23/23) of participants included in the W 96 analysis maintained virologic suppression. In the Switch arm, constituting participants originally randomized to CAR at the beginning of the Maintenance Phase, 97% of participants (n = 28/29) included in the W 96 analysis maintained virologic suppression (Fig. 2); the participant with HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/ml or higher had a viral load of 173 copies/ml at the W 96 data analysis and was placed on atazanavir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir and entered Long-term follow-up. No participant in either treatment arm met the CVF criterion during the Extension Phase up to the 96-week timepoint. At W 96, the mean [standard deviation (SD)] CD4 + cell count change from Baseline in the long-acting arm and Extension Baseline (W 52) in the Switch arm was −5.7 (167.6) cells/μl (n = 23) and −33.6 (145.3) cells/μl (n = 29), respectively.

Every-2-Month Dosing Trial

The efficacy of CABENUVA dosed every 2 months has been evaluated in 1 Phase 3b randomized, multicenter, parallel-arm, open-label, non-inferiority trial:

Trial 207966 (ATLAS-2M [NCT03299049]), (n = 1,045): ART‑experienced, virologically suppressed participants with HIV-1, including 504 participants from the ATLAS trial (randomized to CAB plus RPV [n = 253] or CAR [n = 251]; prior exposure to cabotegravir plus rilpivirine [n = 391]), were randomized and received a cabotegravir plus rilpivirine regimen administered as injection doses of cabotegravir 400 mg plus rilpivirine 600 mg either monthly or cabotegravir 600 mg plus rilpivirine 900 mg every 2 months. Participants without prior exposure to cabotegravir plus rilpivirine initiated treatment with daily oral lead-in dosing with one 30-mg VOCABRIA (cabotegravir) tablet plus one 25-mg EDURANT (rilpivirine) tablet for at least 4 weeks followed by monthly or every-2-month injections with CABENUVA for an additional 44 weeks.

The primary analysis was conducted after all participants completed their Week 48 visit or discontinued the study prematurely.

At baseline, the median age was 42 years, 27% were female, 27% were non-White, and 6% had a CD4+ cell count < 350 cells per mm3; these characteristics were similar between the treatment arms. Participants received either an NNRTI (29%), an integrase inhibitor besides cabotegravir plus rilpivirine (26%), a protease inhibitor (7%), or cabotegravir plus rilpivirine (37%) as their baseline third-agent class prior to randomization.

The primary endpoint of ATLAS-2M was the proportion of participants with a plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at Week 48.

The primary endpoint and other Week 48 outcomes, including outcomes by key baseline factors, for ATLAS-2M are shown in Tables 19 and 20.

### Cabotegravir-rilpivirine: the first complete long-acting injectable regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection [^9b5aca50]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of cabotegravir (CAB) with rilpivirine (RPV) in the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar (2010 to January 2021) with the search terms cabotegravir and rilpivirine. Other resources included abstracts presented at recent conferences and the manufacturer's website and prescribing information.

Study Selection

All English-language articles of studies assessing the efficacy and safety of CAB with RPV were included.

Data Synthesis

The combination of CAB, a new integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and RPV, an established nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, is the first long-acting dual therapy approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have achieved viral suppression on a standard antiretroviral therapy (ART). This regimen demonstrated comparable maintenance of viral suppression evaluated up to 160 weeks, with low rates of virological failure. CAB and RPV are available as suspension given intramuscularly in 2 separate injections every 4 weeks. Common adverse effects include injection site reactions, pyrexia, fatigue, and headache. CAB and RPV are also available as tablets given orally for bridging therapy.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This long-acting dual therapy represents an attractive option with a high barrier to resistance for adults who have achieved viral suppression on standard ART and who prefer monthly injections over daily oral therapy.

Conclusions

CAB-RPV is the first complete long-acting injectable that provides a convenient way to maintain viral suppression with no negative effects on renal and bone health and few drug interactions.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine for HIV-1 suppression: switch to 2-monthly dosing after 5 years of daily oral therapy [^6a2edb36]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

Cabotegravir (CAB), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and rilpivirine (RPV), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, are two agents for which an approved complete monthly (Australia, USA, Canada, and EU) and every 2 month (Q2M; Australia, Canada, and EU) long-acting injectable dosing regimen has been developed. CAB+RPV long-acting is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in virologically suppressed adults (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml). Regulatory approval was based on several large clinical studies, including two pivotal randomized Phase 3 studies, ATLAS (NCT02951052) and FLAIR (NCT02938520), which demonstrated the noninferiority of intramuscular (i.m.) injections of CAB+RPV long-acting dosed every 4 weeks as a maintenance therapy compared with daily oral comparator regimens. A reduced dosing frequency for CAB+RPV long-acting of every 8 weeks was shown to be noninferior to every 4 week dosing in the Phase 3b ATLAS-2 M study (NCT03299049). The Phase 2b LATTE study (NCT01641809) preceded the ATLAS, FLAIR, and ATLAS-2 M long-acting clinical evaluations, investigating daily oral formulations of CAB+RPV compared with three-drug efavirenz-based ART for the maintenance of viral suppression. LATTE demonstrated the antiviral activity of the two-drug oral maintenance therapy CAB+RPV was comparable to efavirenz plus dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors at Week 96. POLAR (NCT03639311) is a Phase 2b rollover study assessing the antiviral activity and safety of CAB+RPV long-acting Q2M in ART-experienced participants who received once-daily oral CAB+RPV treatment for at least 5 years in the Phase 2b LATTE study. The Month 12 results from POLAR are presented here.

METHODS

Study Population

Data from participants without prior exposure to CAB + RPV who received CAB + RPV LA every 4 weeks (Q4W) or every 8 weeks (Q8W) dosing within the phase 3/3b FLAIR (NCT02938520), ATLAS (NCT02951052), and ATLAS-2M (NCT03299049) trials through week 48 were pooled in a post hoc analysis. Additionally, data beyond week 48 were summarized separately for FLAIR and ATLAS-2M participants (data beyond week 48 for the ATLAS study were not summarized as most participants transitioned to ATLAS-2M after week 48 during the extension phase of ATLAS).

FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M are randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, noninferiority phase 3/3b studies evaluating CAB + RPV LA dosed Q4W versus continuing daily oral therapy (FLAIR and ATLAS), or CAB + RPV LA dosed Q8W versus Q4W (ATLAS-2M). The full study designs and eligibility criteria have been published previously. All studies included a screening phase, a maintenance phase, and an extension phase. Enrolled participants were 18 years of age or older and virologically suppressed with a plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL prior to randomization without evidence of any major INSTI or NNRTI RAMs (except K103N). Baseline characteristics were generally similar across the 3 studies and across arms.

After completion of the Maintenance Phase, participants could choose to either withdraw, or, if eligible [HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml at W 48 (or upon retest by W 52), completion of at least W 52 of the ATLAS study, and plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml at ATLAS-2M screening], transition to the ATLAS-2M study (investigating long-acting CAB+RPV Q8W vs. long-acting CAB+RPV Q4W) or enter the Extension Phase of ATLAS. Participants were also given the option to transition to ATLAS-2M throughout the Extension Phase as their study site gained approval for ATLAS-2M. Participants entering the Extension Phase of ATLAS at W 52 either continued long-acting CAB+RPV Q4W [Long-acting arm; intention-to-treat exposed (ITT-E) population] or were switched from CAR to long-acting CAB+RPV Q4W (Switch arm; Switch population). Any participant who had confirmed virologic failure (CVF; two consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA levels ≥ 200 copies/ml) during the study discontinued and received oral ART. Any participant who received at least one dose of long-acting CAB+RPV in the study and discontinued for any reason entered long-term follow-up for 52 weeks. ATLAS was conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use and the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent. The study protocol, any amendments, the informed consent, and other information that required preapproval was reviewed and approved by a national, regional, or investigational center ethics committee or institutional review board.

Endpoints and assessments

The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA 50 copies/ml or higher at W 48 using the FDA Snapshot algorithm, and has been published previously. Endpoints assessed at W 96 for the ITT-E population [Day 1 to W 96] and Extension Switch population (W 52 to W 96) included: proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml, changes in immunologic parameters, incidence of CVF and treatment-emergent genotypic resistance, incidence and severity of adverse events and injection site reactions (ISRs), number of discontinuations because of adverse events, CAB and RPV pharmacokinetics, and patient-reported outcomes.

Study design and participants

FLAIR is a phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority study assessing the efficacy and safety of switching virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1 to CAB + RPV LA dosed Q4W vs. continuing daily oral therapy [abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (ABC/DTG/3TC)].

The design and eligibility criteria for the full study have been published previously; the full protocol is available online. Briefly, FLAIR participants were ART-naive at study entry and underwent induction with oral ABC/DTG/3TC (600/50/300 mg) daily for 20 weeks (for participants who were HLA-B✱5701 positive, DTG was taken with a non-abacavir nucleoside reverse transcriptase backbone chosen by the investigator); participants with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml (confirmed after 16 weeks of ABC/DTG/3TC) were then randomized to receive either CAB + RPV LA IM or continue daily oral ABC/DTG/3TC during the maintenance phase.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^41e7127c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine (LA CAB/RPV) — randomized trials used CAB and RPV for 4 weeks, followed by monthly injections of CAB and RPV (n = 283). After 96 weeks of randomized therapy, nine participants (3.2%) in each arm had HIV RNA > 50 copies/mL. Adverse events leading to withdrawal from the study were observed in only 14 (5%) participants in the LA CAB/RPV group and 4 (1%) in the oral standard care group. Injection site reactions were the most common adverse events, reported by 245 (88%) participants in the LA CAB/RPV, and lasted a median of 3 days. These studies demonstrated noninferiority of switching to monthly LA CAB/RPV compared to continuing oral ART, and in all studies, adults expressed a high degree of treatment satisfaction and preference for the LA CAB/RPV regimen. In a multivariate analysis of the adult LA CAB/RPV Phase 3 trials, presence of at least two baseline factors of RPV resistance–associated mutations, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, and body mass index > 30kg/m2 was associated with increased risk of virologic failure at 48 weeks. The FLAIR study was extended to include those remaining in the oral ARV arm after 120 weeks, and there were no differences between the lead-in group and the direct-to-injection group in terms of safety, tolerability, or efficacy through an additional 24 weeks on the study.

The proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL was 87% and 89% for the cabotegravir plus rilpivirine and the current antiretroviral regimen arms, respectively; adjusted treatment difference was -2.8% with 95% CI (-8.2%, 2.5%).

Optional Oral Lead-In: FLAIR Extension Phase

In the FLAIR study during the Extension Phase (Week 100 to Week 124), the efficacy of CABENUVA was evaluated in patients who switched (at Week 100) from their current antiretroviral regimen to CABENUVA, with and without an oral lead-in phase. A total of 121 participants chose to start the treatment with oral lead-in and 111 participants chose direct to injection. Participants were not randomized during the Extension Phase. At Week 124, the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL was 0.8% and 0.9% for the oral lead-in and direct to injection groups, respectively. The rates of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) were similar in both the oral lead-in (93%) and direct to injection (99%) groups.

Introduction

To sustain viral suppression, current guideline-recommended first-line treatments for HIV-1 mandate lifelong daily adherence to oral regimens. This can result in physiological, emotional, and logistical challenges for people with HIV (PWH). In addition, adherence to daily oral regimens can be easily disrupted by a number of factors including stigmatization concerns, pill burden, drug/food interactions, forgetfulness, depression, substance abuse, the fear of inadvertent disclosure, active lifestyles, and changes to daily routine. Studies of PWH across diverse demographics have revealed an interest in long-acting antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) for providing an alternative to reliance on daily oral medication. Such therapeutics have the potential to increase convenience and satisfaction by reducing dosing frequencies, helping to alleviate the multifaceted burden associated with daily oral ART.

Cabotegravir (CAB), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and rilpivirine (RPV), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, are two agents for which an approved monthly (United States, Canada, and EU) and every 2 months (EU) long-acting complete injectable dosing regimen has been developed. Long-acting CAB+RPV is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml). Regulatory approval of the monthly dosing regimen was based on two pivotal randomized phase 3 studies, ATLAS (NCT02951052) and FLAIR (NCT02938520). ATLAS and FLAIR demonstrated the noninferiority of intramuscular injections of long-acting CAB+RPV dosed every 4 weeks (Q4W) as a maintenance therapy vs. continuing current oral ART (CAR) in virologically suppressed PWH at W 48 at a 6% noninferiority margin [as per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Snapshot algorithm]. In addition, a pooled analysis of the ATLAS and FLAIR trials demonstrated noninferiority at a stricter margin of 4%. Both studies showed that the long-acting regimen was well tolerated over a 48-week period. Furthermore, participants reported greater levels of satisfaction and preference for the intramuscular therapy compared with their previous daily oral regimen. A reduced dosing frequency for long-acting CAB+RPV of every 8 weeks (Q8W) was shown to be noninferior to Q4W dosing in the ATLAS-2M study (NCT03299049) and was the basis of the approval of the every 2 months dosing regimen.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosed every 2 months in adults with human immunodeficiency virus 1 type 1 infection: 152-week results from ATLAS-2M, a randomized, open-label, phase 3b, noninferiority study [^4812c84a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

(See the Editorial Commentary by Llibre and Kuritzkes on pages 1655–7.)

Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have improved durable virologic suppression and significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, transforming HIV from a fatal condition to a manageable chronic disease. Although effective, current oral ART regimens require high levels of adherence to maintain virologic suppression. Treatment interruption is associated with rebound viremia, increased risk of transmission, and increased morbidity and mortality. In addition, daily oral ART regimens have several inherent challenges for some people with HIV (PWH), including fear of disclosure, stigmatization, anxiety related to staying adherent, and the daily reminder of HIV status. Therefore, patients and providers have expressed interest in long-acting (LA) ART treatments with reduced dosing frequencies.

Cabotegravir (CAB), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), and rilpivirine (RPV), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, have been developed for LA administration as intramuscular injections. CAB+RPV LA has been approved for monthly dosing and every-2-month (Q2M) dosing in Australia, Canada, the European Union, and the United States. Q2M dosing is commercially available in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Approval of monthly dosing was based on the ongoing phase 3 antiretroviral therapy as long acting suppression (ATLAS) (NCT02951052) and first long-acting injectable regimen (FLAIR) (NCT02938520) studies, which demonstrated CAB+RPV LA dosed every 4 weeks (Q4W) was noninferior to daily oral ART over 48 weeks, with continued high rates of virologic suppression through 96 weeks of treatment. Approval of Q2M dosing was based on the ongoing phase 3b ATLAS-2M (NCT03299049) study, which demonstrated CAB+RPV LA dosed every 8 weeks (Q8W) was noninferior to Q4W dosing over 48 and 96 weeks, with similar safety profiles. Additionally, most participants preferred Q8W dosing over Q4W dosing and oral ART.

Here, we report the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and patient-reported outcomes through 152 weeks of CAB+RPV LA treatment dosed Q8W and Q4W from the phase 3b ATLAS-2M study.

### Viral suppression rates at 48 weeks in people with HIV starting long-acting cabotegravir / rilpivirine with initial viremia [^02da75c3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-acting (LA) injectable cabotegravir (CAB)/rilpivirine (RPV; LA-CAB/RPV) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PWH) on oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) with stable viral suppression. However, LA-CAB/RPV may benefit PWH who are unable to attain viral suppression with oral ART, particularly those with psychosocial factors that affect oral ART adherence, such as housing instability, mental illness, substance use, and HIV-associated stigma. Clinical cohort data suggest that most PWH with baseline viremia can achieve HIV viral suppression when starting LA-CAB/RPV, though there are no published data on sustained suppression. In February 2024, ACTG LATITUDE A5359, a randomized trial of LA-CAB/RPV versus oral ART among PWH with adherence challenges who first attained viral suppression on oral ART, was stopped early due to the superior efficacy of LA-CAB/RPV in the interim analysis. Both the International AIDS Society–USA and the US Department of Health and Human Services recently changed guidelines to support use of LA-CAB/RPV for PWH with viremia who are unable to take oral ART consistently despite adherence support.

Our group previously reported outcomes from the LA-CAB/RPV program at Ward 86, demonstrating that ≥ 95% of PWH who initiated LA-CAB/RPV with initial viremia attained viral suppression within the first 8 months of therapy (median follow-up, 33 weeks; range, 10–83 weeks). In the current analysis, we sought to evaluate longer-term virologic outcomes after initiation of LA-CAB/RPV among PWH with HIV RNA levels ≥ 50 copies/mL at baseline.

### Virological failure after switch to long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine injectable therapy: an in-depth analysis [^f65fef51]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In December 2020, the first complete long-acting (LA) injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) combination consisting of the second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) cabotegravir (CAB) and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) rilpivirine (RPV) was approved by the European Medicines Agency for maintenance treatment in people with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This 2-drug ART regimen is now recommended in the treatment guidelines for people with HIV-1 (PWH) who are virologically suppressed on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure (VF) with, agents of the NNRTI and INSTI class, and no active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

The virological efficacy of LA CAB/RPV was assessed in multiple randomized clinical trials, showing noninferiority compared to daily oral INSTI-containing ART through 152 weeks and a low risk (1.2%) for confirmed VF, defined as 2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA measurements (viral loads [VLs]) > 200 copies/mL. So far, limited data from few real-world cohorts have been published, confirming high efficacy rates as observed in the trials. VF did also occur in these real-world cohorts, but the description and analyses of these cases are limited.

Although its occurrence is rare, VF during LA CAB/RPV merits further evaluation: It causes great uncertainty in both PWH and healthcare providers on the reasons behind the failure and can have significant impact on future treatment options due to the selection of resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), which is a rare event in the current era of oral second-generation INSTIs. Here, we present the clinical, virological, and pharmacokinetic analyses of 5 cases with VF on LA CAB/RPV therapy.

### Efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics by body mass index category in phase 3 / 3b long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine trials [^6c4ca434]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cabotegravir plus rilpivirine (CAB + RPV) is a guideline-recommended long-acting (LA) injectable regimen for the maintenance of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) virologic suppression. This post hoc analysis summarizes CAB + RPV LA results by baseline body mass index (BMI) category among phase 3/3b trial participants.

Methods

Data from CAB + RPV-naive participants receiving every 4 or 8 week dosing in FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M were pooled through week 48. Data beyond week 48 were summarized by study (FLAIR through week 96 and ATLAS-2M through week 152). HIV-1 RNA < 50 and ≥ 50copies/mL, confirmed virologic failure (CVF; 2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200copies/mL), safety and tolerability, and plasma CAB and RPV trough concentrations were evaluated by baseline BMI (< 30kg/m2, lower; ≥ 30kg/m2, higher).

Results

Among 1245 CAB + RPV LA participants, 213 (17%) had a baseline BMI ≥ 30kg/m2. At week 48, 92% versus 93% of participants with lower versus higher BMI had HIV-1 RNA < 50copies/mL, respectively. Including data beyond week 48, 18 participants had CVF; those in the higher BMI group (n = 8) all had at least 1 other baseline factor associated with CVF (archived RPV resistance-associated mutations or HIV-1 subtype A6/A1). Safety and pharmacokinetic profiles were comparable between BMI categories.

Conclusions

CAB + RPV LA was efficacious and well tolerated, regardless of baseline BMI category.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dolutegravir-rilpivirine for the maintenance of virological suppression in adults with HIV-1: phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 studies [^2fefc6d4]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lifelong HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) has prompted an interest in two-drug regimens to minimise cumulative drug exposure and toxicities. The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of dolutegravir and rilpivirine suggest potential compatibility and effectiveness as a two-drug regimen. We aimed to investigate this two-drug regimen in a phase 3 study.

Methods

We identically designed SWORD-1 and SWORD-2, which were open-label, parallel-group, multicentre, phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority studies in 12 countries evaluating efficacy and safety of once-daily dolutegravir 50 mg plus rilpivirine 25 mg versus current ART regimen (CAR). We included participants aged 18 years or older who were on first or second ART with stable plasma HIV-1 RNA (viral load < 50 copies per mL) for 6 months or longer at screening. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) with stratification by third-agent class, age, and planned participation in a bone mineral density substudy. The primary endpoint was proportion of participants with viral load lower than 50 copies per mL at week 48 among those individuals who received one or more doses of study medication. Investigators monitored adverse events to assess safety. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02429791 (SWORD-1) and NCT02422797 (SWORD-2).

Findings

We screened for participants from April 14, 2015, to Oct 15, 2015, for SWORD-1 and from April 21, 2015, to Sept 25, 2015, for SWORD-2. We randomly assigned 516 participants to dolutegravir-rilpivirine and 512 to continue with CAR. At week 48 (last patient visit was Nov 22, 2016), in the pooled analysis of the intention-to-treat population, 95% of participants had viral loads lower than 50 copies per mL in each group (486 of 513 in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group vs 485 of 511 in the CAR group), with an adjusted treatment difference of -0·2% (95% CI -3·0 to 2·5) and showed non-inferiority with a predefined margin of -8%. 395 (77%) of 513 participants in the dolutegravir-rilpivirine group and 364 (71%) of 511 participants in the CAR group reported adverse events. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (49 [10%] for dolutegravir-rilpivirine vs 50 [10%] for CAR) and headache (41 [8%] vs 23 [5%]). More participants taking dolutegravir-rilpivirine (17 [3%]) reported adverse events leading to withdrawal than did participants taking CAR (three [< 1%]).

Interpretation

Dolutegravir-rilpivirine was non-inferior to CAR over 48 weeks in participants with HIV suppression and showed a safety profile consistent with its components. Results support the use of this two-drug regimen to maintain HIV suppression.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosed every 2 months in adults with human immunodeficiency virus 1 type 1 infection: 152-week results from ATLAS-2M, a randomized, open-label, phase 3b, noninferiority study [^645e4de3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

The median CAB and RPV pre-dose concentrations for both dosing regimens are shown in Supplementary Figure 5. At week 152, geometric mean CAB pre-dose concentrations ranged from 1.45 μg/mL to 1.98 μg/mL for the Q8W arm and 2.75 μg/mL to 2.83 μg/mL for the Q4W arm across the 3 previous CAB+RPV exposure strata and were comparable to the week 48 and week 96 results. Geometric mean RPV pre-dose concentrations at week 152 ranged from 95.7 ng/mL to 105 ng/mL for the Q8W arm and 132 ng/mL to 153 ng/mL for the Q4W arm across the 3 previous CAB+RPV exposure strata. Geometric mean RPV pre-dose concentration in participants in the Q8W arm increased from 65.4 ng/mL at week 48 to 95.7 ng/mL at week 152 for participants with no prior exposure, and from 77.6 ng/mL at week 48 to 105 ng/mL at week 152 for participants with 1–24 weeks of previous exposure. These findings are consistent with the 28-week half-life of RPV LA, resulting in ongoing accumulation beyond the first year of treatment. In participants with more than 24 weeks of prior exposure, apparent steady state for RPV was achieved by week 48, with little further accumulation at week 152.

Plasma drug concentrations for participants with CVF (Supplementary Table 1) were generally in the first quartile of the overall study geometric mean values, but above the protein-adjusted concentration required for 90% inhibition (PA-IC 90) values for both agents.

Plasma CAB and RPV concentrations were available for 95 participants (Q8W, n = 48/522 [9%]; Q4W, n = 47/523 [9%]) who stopped injectable therapy and entered the long-term follow-up phase, with concentrations shown in Supplementary Table 2. Notably, the geometric mean value remained above the PA-IC 90 value 6 months after the last injection for CAB and 12 months for RPV.

Treatment Satisfaction

In participants without prior CAB+RPV exposure, HIVTSQs mean scores markedly increased from baseline to week 152 for both treatment arms, and significantly favored Q8W dosing at all 3 time points (Supplementary Figure 6).

Abstract

Background

Cabotegravir plus rilpivirine (CAB + RPV) is a guideline-recommended long-acting (LA) injectable regimen for the maintenance of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) virologic suppression. This post hoc analysis summarizes CAB + RPV LA results by baseline body mass index (BMI) category among phase 3/3b trial participants.

Methods

Data from CAB + RPV-naive participants receiving every 4 or 8 week dosing in FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M were pooled through week 48. Data beyond week 48 were summarized by study (FLAIR through week 96 and ATLAS-2M through week 152). HIV-1 RNA < 50 and ≥ 50 copies/mL, confirmed virologic failure (CVF; 2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL), safety and tolerability, and plasma CAB and RPV trough concentrations were evaluated by baseline BMI (< 30 kg/m 2, lower; ≥ 30 kg/m 2, higher).

Results

Among 1245 CAB + RPV LA participants, 213 (17%) had a baseline BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2. At week 48, 92% versus 93% of participants with lower versus higher BMI had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, respectively. Including data beyond week 48, 18 participants had CVF; those in the higher BMI group (n = 8) all had at least 1 other baseline factor associated with CVF (archived RPV resistance-associated mutations or HIV-1 subtype A6/A1). Safety and pharmacokinetic profiles were comparable between BMI categories.

Conclusions

CAB + RPV LA was efficacious and well tolerated, regardless of baseline BMI category.

### Subcutaneous injections of cabotegravir plus rilpivirine long-acting in virally suppressed adults with HIV-1 [^4d6f8d3b]. AIDS (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the development of the first antiretroviral agents, HIV treatment options have advanced to highly efficacious regimens that can effectively maintain virologic suppression and prevent disease progression. These advances have led to a shift in treatment focus to emphasize convenience, tolerability, and overall acceptability of HIV therapy. This is seen with contemporary antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, which have progressed from multiple oral ARTs to once-daily fixed-dose oral regimens comprising two to four drugs in combination, and more recently with the development of long-acting ART (LA ART), exemplified by cabotegravir plus rilpivirine (CAB + RPV).

CAB + RPV LA administered monthly or every 2 months via intramuscular ventrogluteal (recommended injection site) or dorsogluteal injections is the first and only complete long-acting regimen approved and recommended for the maintenance of HIV-1 virologic suppression. CAB + RPV LA has demonstrated noninferior efficacy and strong patient preference in comparison to daily oral therapy.

CAB and RPV pharmacokinetics data following intramuscular gluteal injections have been reported previously for both CAB LA and RPV LA administered in combination, and separately in people with and without HIV-1 infection and have been further characterized with population pharmacokinetic analyses. Both antiretrovirals exhibit absorption-limited (flip-flop) kinetics following long-acting intramuscular injections, with mean terminal half-life ranging from 5.6 to 11.5 weeks for CAB LA and 13–28 weeks for RPV LA. Across the phase 2/3/3b studies, CAB + RPV LA dosed every 4 weeks (Q4W) or every 8 weeks in people with HIV-1 (PWH) demonstrated median plasma CAB LA and RPV LA intramuscular trough concentrations that remained well above (approximately > 8-fold for CAB and > 3-fold for RPV) their respective protein-adjusted 90% inhibitory concentration (PA-IC 90: CAB, 0.166 μg/ml; RPV, 12.0 ng/ml) throughout assessment periods up to 152 weeks.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosed every 2 months in adults with human immunodeficiency virus 1 type 1 infection: 152-week results from ATLAS-2M, a randomized, open-label, phase 3b, noninferiority study [^4d1569af]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The study ATLAS-2M (152-week results) was published by Edgar T Overton and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Clin Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Human immunodeficiency virus infection. In the ATLAS-2M (152-week results) study, the trial question was: is administration of cabotegravir plus rilpivirine every 8 weeks noninferior to administration every 4 weeks in adults with HIV-1 infection? In the ATLAS-2M (152-week results) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ATLAS-2M (152-week results) study, the population was: 1045 patients (280 female, 765 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with HIV-1 infection. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; moderate to severe hepatic impairment; preexisting physical or mental condition; high risk for seizures. In the ATLAS-2M (152-week results) study, the interventions were: n = 522 every 8 weeks dosing (cabotegravir 600 mg plus rilpivirine 900 mg administered IM every 8 weeks) n = 523 every 4 weeks dosing (cabotegravir 400 mg plus rilpivirine 600 mg administered IM every 4 weeks). In the ATLAS-2M (152-week results) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 152 (2.7% vs. 1%; AD 1.7%, 95% CI 0.1 to 3.3). In the ATLAS-2M (152-week results) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 152 (87.4% vs. 85.9%; AD 1.5%, 95% CI -2.6 to 5.6) No significant difference in the rate of test for homogeneity by strata for HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at > 24 weeks (91.3% vs. 89.1%; AD -2.2%, 95% CI -5.6 to 10). In the ATLAS-2M (152-week results) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the ATLAS-2M (152-week results) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with HIV-1 infection, every 8 weeks dosing was noninferior to every 4 weeks dosing with respect to HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 152.

Long-acting antiretroviral therapy (ART) — current availability and investigational regimens: As of October 2024, only 1 long-acting injectable ART regimen (long-acting cabotegravir plus long-acting rilpivirine) is available either once monthly or every other month. Other strategies include a once-weekly combination of islatravir and lenacapavir; in a follow-up phase 2b investigation at a lower (2 mg) weekly dose of islatravir, the combination maintained a high rate of viral suppression at 48 weeks with no effect on lymphocyte count and results similar to BIC/TAF/FTC. Exploratory studies of long-acting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to maintain HIV RNA suppression after switching off oral therapy have been conducted, and the combination of the 2 bNAbs with lenacapavir is an every-6-months regimen now being tested in a phase 2b trial.

### The LATITUDE study: long-acting therapy to improve treatment… [^f20c7c95]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Study Overview This study compared the efficacy, safety, and durability of two different strategies to treat participants with a history of sub-optimal adherence and control of their HIV infection: long-acting antiretroviral therapy with rilpivirine LA and cabotegravir LA versus all-oral standard of care. Arm A: A combination of oral RPV + oral CAB for 4 weeks followed by the LA ART Phase, consisting of a two-drug regimen using RPV-LA + CAB-LA Q4 weeks until the end of Step 2. The option to initiate LA ART at the Step 2 Randomization visit without oral RPV + oral CAB was at the discretion of the site investigator of Record and participant. Arm A participants continued on RPV-LA + CAB-LA Q4 weeks for 52 weeks until the end of Step 3.

Arm B participants who achieved virologic suppression at Step 2, week 48, or HIV-1 RNA of 201–399 copies/mL at Step 2, week 48, followed by HIV-1 RNA. If RPV-LA + CAB-LA became available before a participant finished Step 3, and the participant chose to continue RPV-LA + CAB-LA as part of their clinical care, their follow-up in the study ended at the completion of Step 3. If for some reason the participant chose not to continue LA ART at the end of Step 3 or if LA ART was not available, the participant registered to Step 4 and was followed on locally sourced oral ARV for 52 weeks.

Cabotegravir (CAB), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), plus rilpivirine (RPV), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), is the first complete long-acting (LA), injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen approved and recommended by treatment guidelines. CAB + RPV LA is administered intramuscularly monthly or every 2 months by a healthcare professional for the maintenance of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) virologic suppression.

CAB + RPV LA demonstrated noninferior efficacy and was well tolerated across phase 3/3b trials (FLAIR; ATLAS; ATLAS-2M). Confirmed virologic failure (CVF; 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements ≥ 200 copies/mL) occurred in ∼1% (n = 19/1651) of participants in phase 3/3b clinical trials through week 48 of CAB + RPV therapy, with only 4 additional cases after week 48. Successful implementation and high rates of virologic suppression were also demonstrated in clinic-based implementation studies (CARISEL and CUSTOMIZE). Notably, CVF rates in these studies were numerically lower.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosed every 2 months in adults with human immunodeficiency virus 1 type 1 infection: 152-week results from ATLAS-2M, a randomized, open-label, phase 3b, noninferiority study [^142f7795]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Of the 14 participants with CVF, 6 (43%) had 2 or more of the baseline factors associated with increased risk of CVF with this regimen (pro-viral RPV RAMs, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m 2). One of the 2 participants with CVF since week 96 had an associated baseline factor (HIV-1 subtype A6/A1). All participants with CVF through 152 weeks received injections within 7 days of the scheduled visit. Overall, 13 of 14 (93%) participants with CVF achieved virologic re-suppression on subsequent oral ART regimens (protease inhibitor-based regimen [71%, n = 10/14] or dolutegravir [DTG]-based regimen [21%, n = 3/14]); the participant who did not re-suppress was nonadherent to the subsequent oral therapy, as reported previously.

Safety

CAB+RPV LA was well tolerated, with similar AE profiles between arms (Table 2). Drug-related AEs (per investigator assessment) were common and comparable across arms (Q8W, n = 427 [82%]; Q4W, n = 427 [82%]). This finding is largely attributable to injection-site reactions (ISRs), which represent 64% (n = 545/854) of all participants with drug-related AEs. Excluding ISRs, 27% (n = 142) of participants in the Q8W arm and 32% (n = 167) in the Q4W arm experienced a drug-related AE. The most commonly occurring AEs and drug-related AEs, excluding ISRs, are listed in Table 2. Most AEs were grade 1 or 2 (n = 848/1011 [84%]). A total of 23 (4%) participants in the Q8W arm and 25 (5%) participants in the Q4W arm had AEs leading to withdrawal. Of these participants, 5 withdrew from the Q8W arm and 6 withdrew from the Q4W arm after week 96. No drug-related serious AEs (SAEs) were reported after week 96. Since the week 96 analyses, 4 deaths occurred, as detailed in Table 2; none were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drugs. No additional safety signals were identified since the week 48 analysis.

Study Design

ATLAS and FLAIR (Fig. 1) are ongoing, phase 3, randomized, open-label, parallel-group studies comparing the efficacy and safety of monthly intramuscular (IM) CAB+RPV LA (400 mg CAB+600 mg RPV) vs. continuation of an oral cART regimen — the current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) group — consisting of either a pre-existing stable daily oral therapy of at least 6 months' prior duration (ATLAS) or a defined oral induction treatment comprising a single-tablet coformulation of dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine (FLAIR). Participant recruitment and study designs have been fully described in the primary clinical manuscripts.

Most injection visits occurred within the 7-day window (Q8W, n = 9509/9809 [97%]; Q4W, n = 18 829/19 321 [97%]) (Supplementary Figure 1). Overall, 44 (< 1%) injection visits in the Q8W group and 98 (< 1%) injection visits in the Q4W group were missed (outside the ± 7-day window with oral therapy), and participants were administered CAB+RPV oral therapy (Q8W, n = 37/9809 [< 1%]; Q4W, n = 90/19 321 [< 1%]) or an alternative oral ART regimen (Q8W, n = 7/9809 [< 1%]; Q4W, n = 8/19 321 [< 1%]) until resuming injectable therapy. Most interruptions occurred after week 96 (Q8W, n = 31/37 [84%]; Q4W, n = 65/90 [72%]). In total, 38 (< 1%) injection visits in the Q8W group and 69 (< 1%) injection visits in the Q4W group were missed due to COVID-19 infection or clinic disruption. One injection visit (Q8W; week 112) was missed without oral coverage (COVID-19 related); this participant resumed CAB+RPV LA at week 128 and maintained virologic suppression.

### Week 96 extension results of a phase 3 study evaluating long-acting cabotegravir with rilpivirine for HIV-1 treatment [^b0bf874e]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

One limitation of the current analysis is participant attrition throughout the Extension Phase, primarily because of the decision of study participants to move from ATLAS to the ATLAS-2M study after 48 weeks. As a result, the residual sample restricted the ability to perform statistical analyses and should be taken into consideration whenever interpreting the reported data. Several other studies with larger populations are ongoing to confirm the longer term efficacy and safety of long-acting CAB+RPV. Additionally, because of the nature of injectable therapies, ATLAS is conducted as an open-label trial. Thus, some patient-reported results may be subject to bias. Finally, conclusions on treatment satisfaction are limited to patients who are willing to consider injectable therapy, reflecting the enrolled trial population, and, therefore, cannot be generalized to all PWH.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^3a11a8de]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Long-acting injectable cabotegravir and rilpivirine in virologically suppressed adolescents — long-acting injectable (LAI) antiretroviral (ARV) medications may be considered a treatment simplification approach for some virologically suppressed adolescents. The co-packaged, two-drug injectable regimen is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in children weighing ≥ 35 kg and aged ≥ 12 years, with viral suppression (defined as < 50 copies/mL), on a stable ARV regimen, without a history of treatment failure, and without known or suspected drug resistance to either drug. In IMPAACT 2017, at 24 and 48 weeks of follow-up, injections of LA CAB/RPV every 2 months maintained viral suppression, showed acceptable pharmacokinetics (PK), and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in 144 adolescents; participating youth and their caregivers reported high acceptability of LA CAB/RPV and a strong preference for LAI ART over daily oral ART. A single U.S. site reported 25 adolescents and young adults receiving CAB and RPV, 7 of whom experienced viremia particularly while on bimonthly injections, which resolved for most participants with change to monthly injections; no drug resistance emerged among those with viremia, and three individuals experienced postinjection cytokine release syndrome that self-resolved.

### Viral suppression rates at 48 weeks in people with HIV starting long-acting cabotegravir / rilpivirine with initial viremia [^d5090e4d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

We previously demonstrated at the Ward 86 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinic in San Francisco that long-acting (LA) cabotegravir (CAB)/rilpivirine (RPV) (LA-CAB/RPV) can rapidly lead to viral suppression in people with HIV (PWH) with viremia due to adherence challenges. We now evaluate the durability of viral suppression in this population.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of PWH who started LA-CAB/RPV with viremia (HIV RNA viral load ≥ 50 copies/mL) before December 2022. Our primary outcome was viral suppression (viral load < 50 copies/mL) with LA-CAB/RPV persistence (not discontinued or late by > 14 days) at 48 weeks, using the viral load closest to 48 ± 8 weeks. We also describe viral failure, defined as a < 2-log decline in viral load at 4 weeks or a viral load ≥ 200 copies/mL after initial viral suppression with emergent CAB- or RPV-associated resistance mutations; overall 48-week viral suppression including those switched to alternative antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Results

Fifty-nine PWH initiated LA-CAB/RPV with viremia and were included in the analysis; 49% had a CD4 cell count < 200/µL, and the median baseline viral load was 42 900 copies/mL (quarter 1–quarter 3, 5272–139 038). At 48 weeks, 47 PWH met the primary outcome of viral suppression with LA-CAB/RPV persistence (80% [95% confidence interval, 67%–89%]). Five had viral failure with resistance (3 with RPV-associated and 2 with CAB- and RPV-associated mutations), and 1 was lost to follow-up. At week 48, 2 of those with viral failure were suppressed on alternative regimens (lenacapavir + bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine and CAB + lenacapavir). The overall viral suppression at week 48 with either LA-CAB/RPV or alternative ART was 92% (54 of 59).

Conclusions

In PWH initiating LA-CAB/RPV with initial viremia, 48-week viral suppression (< 50 copies/mL) was seen in 92%. LA ART can be an important tool for improving viral suppression among patients who face adherence challenges to oral ART.

RESULTS

Participants

In total, 1245 randomized participants (Q8W, n = 327; Q4W, n = 918) with a median baseline BMI of 25.1 kg/m 2 (range, 15.30–54.02 kg/m 2) were included in the week 48 analysis; 1032 (83%) had a baseline BMI < 30 kg/m 2 and 213 (17%) had a baseline BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2. Overall, 22% (n = 47 of 213) of participants in the higher BMI group had a baseline BMI of 35– < 40 kg/m 2, and 12% (n = 25 of 213) had a baseline BMI of ≥ 40 kg/m 2. Median age was comparable across BMI categories and dosing regimens; however, there was a lower proportion of female (sex at birth) participants and black or African American participants in the lower BMI group versus the higher BMI group (Table 1). For data beyond week 48, 283 participants (86%, n = 243 of 283, in the lower BMI group; 14%, n = 40 of 283, in the higher BMI group) from FLAIR and 1045 participants (80%, n = 834 of 1045, in the lower BMI group; 20%, n = 211 of 1045, in the higher BMI group) from ATLAS-2M were included in the analysis.

Baseline Characteristics for Pooled CAB + RPV LA Participants Across the ATLAS, FLAIR, and ATLAS-2M Clinical Trials Through Week 48

Data Through Week 48

Efficacy

Viral suppression was high and comparable across BMI categories at week 48 (Table 2). Within the lower BMI group, 94% and 93% of participants in the Q8W and Q4W dosing regimen had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 48, respectively. In the higher BMI group, 92% of participants across both dosing regimens had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 48. Overall, 10 (1%) versus 11 (5%) participants had HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL in the lower and higher BMI groups, respectively. A higher proportion of participants had no virologic data at week 48 in the lower BMI group versus the higher BMI group, driven by a higher number of discontinuations related to AEs and other reasons.

### Long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosed every 2 months in adults with human immunodeficiency virus 1 type 1 infection: 152-week results from ATLAS-2M, a randomized, open-label, phase 3b, noninferiority study [^050831b2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Multivariable analyses of phase 3 studies, including ATLAS-2M, identified 3 baseline factors associated with increased risk of CVF when present in combination of 2 or more factors (pro-viral RPV RAMs, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, and/or BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) during the first year of CAB+RPV initiation. Dosing regimen (Q8W vs Q4W) was not identified as a significant risk factor. Although 6 of 14 (43%) participants with CVF had 2 or more of these associated factors at baseline, only 1 of the 2 participants with CVF since week 96 had an associated baseline factor (HIV-1 subtype A6/A1). Expanded multivariable analyses of predictors of CVF are ongoing.

CAB+RPV LA was well tolerated, with a comparable safety profile between the treatment arms. Specifically, the proportions of participants reporting SAEs, AEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal were similar for Q8W and Q4W dosing, consistent with previous analyses. No new safety signals were identified since the week 48 analysis. The number of ISRs experienced across both treatment arms was similar and consistent with previous analyses from ATLAS, FLAIR, and ATLAS-2M, with most ISRs being mild to moderate and short lived, with few discontinuations. The frequency of ISRs at each visit decreased over the first 48 weeks and remained consistent thereafter, as demonstrated in the FLAIR 96-week analysis. The median weight change at week 152 increased since the week 96 analysis but remained similar to that reported in a pooled analysis of clinical trials for other INSTIs.

### Efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics by body mass index category in phase 3 / 3b long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine trials [^558fdd38]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

FLAIR participants were ART naive at study entry and underwent an induction phase with daily oral dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine for 20 weeks (participants who were HLA-B✱5701-positive received a non-abacavir regimen) to achieve virologic suppression, while ATLAS and ATLAS-2M participants were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) on their current oral regimen at study entry. Most participants who received CAB + RPV LA in the ATLAS study rolled over to the ATLAS-2M study after week 48 (n = 391). ATLAS-2M data from participants who had rolled over from ATLAS with prior exposure to CAB + RPV were excluded to align duration of exposure and PK parameters in the 48-week pooled study population. Beyond week 48, data were summarized separately for FLAIR (week 96) and ATLAS-2M (week 152) as different time points were being evaluated; for ATLAS-2M, all participants (including those who entered the study with prior CAB + RPV exposure) were included in the summary. ATLAS data beyond week 48 were not summarized as most participants had transitioned to ATLAS-2M after week 48.

All 3 studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study protocols, any amendments, informed consent, and other information that required preapproval were reviewed and approved by a national, regional, or investigational center ethics committee or institutional review board.

End Points and Assessment

End points assessed by baseline BMI category were the proportion of participants with a plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL and ≥ 50 copies/mL by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Snapshot algorithm (weeks 48, 96, and 152), the incidence of CVF (2 consecutive measurements of plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL; baseline through week 152), adverse events (AEs; baseline through week 152) including injection site reactions (ISRs; week 4 through week 152), and CAB and RPV plasma trough concentrations (C trough; week 4 through week 96; including analysis of CAB concentrations by needle length for participants with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2, week 4 through week 48). Analysis of RPV concentration by needle length was not conducted as previous analyses have indicated that BMI has no impact on RPV LA absorption. PK plasma samples were analyzed for CAB and RPV concentrations using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry methods.

People with HIV who are unable to achieve viral suppression due to poor adherence to oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who do not have resistance to cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV) — panel guidance and use context: Based on very limited data, the Panel recommends the use of long-acting cabotegravir/rilpivirine (LA CAB/RPV) on a case-by-case basis in select individuals with persistent virologic failure despite intensive adherence support on oral ART, who have no evidence of resistance to RPV or CAB, and with shared decision-making (CIII). Long-term clinical efficacy data are limited for people with viremia, and the regimen is only approved for people who are virologically suppressed for at least 3 months. No large, published randomized controlled trial has demonstrated the efficacy of a complete regimen of any integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) plus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), including LA CAB/RPV, in people with viremia. Two possible approaches are described: if achieving viral suppression with oral ART is possible with intensive adherence support prior to any switch, switching to LA CAB/RPV after viral suppression can serve as a goal to incentivize adherence; if achieving viral suppression with oral ART is not possible despite intensive adherence support, switching to LA CAB/RPV without viral suppression may be an option in certain circumstances.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^9849c72b]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Long-acting injectable cabotegravir with rilpivirine (LA CAB/RPV) — The long-acting injectable combination of CAB plus RPV has not been studied in ART-naive participants; in FLAIR and LATTE-2, ART-naive participants were first treated with 20 weeks of DTG/ABC/3TC or oral CAB+ABC/3TC, and those who achieved virologic suppression were randomized to receive LA CAB/RPV every month or to continue oral daily ART. The Panel does not recommend the LA CAB/RPV as initial therapy for people with HIV because of the lack of data supporting the efficacy of this combination in people who are ART-naive (AIII), and people desiring to use LA CAB/RPV early in their treatment history should first attain viral suppression on a recommended regimen before transitioning to LA CAB/RPV.

14.1	Clinical Trials in Adults

Monthly Dosing Trials

The efficacy of CABENUVA has been evaluated in 2 Phase 3 randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel-arm, open-label, non-inferiority trials:

Trial 201584 (FLAIR [NCT02938520]), (n = 629): antiretroviral treatment (ART)‑naive participants with HIV-1 received a dolutegravir INSTI-containing regimen for 20 weeks (either dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine or dolutegravir plus 2 other NRTIs if participants were HLA‑B*5701 positive). Participants who were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, n = 566) were then randomized (1:1) to receive either a cabotegravir plus rilpivirine regimen or remain on the current antiretroviral regimen. Participants randomized to receive cabotegravir plus rilpivirine initiated treatment with daily oral lead-in dosing with one 30-mg VOCABRIA (cabotegravir) tablet plus one 25-mg EDURANT (rilpivirine) tablet for at least 4 weeks followed by monthly injections with CABENUVA for an additional 44 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].
Trial 201585 (ATLAS [NCT02951052]), (n = 616): ART-experienced, virologically-suppressed (for at least 6 months; median prior treatment duration was 4.3 years) participants (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) with HIV-1 were randomized and received either a cabotegravir plus rilpivirine regimen or remained on their current antiretroviral regimen. Participants randomized to receive cabotegravir plus rilpivirine initiated treatment with daily oral lead-in dosing with one 30-mg VOCABRIA (cabotegravir) tablet plus one 25-mg EDURANT (rilpivirine) tablet for at least 4 weeks followed by monthly injections with CABENUVA for an additional 44 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

5.6	Long-Acting Properties and Potential Associated Risks with CABENUVA

Residual concentrations of both cabotegravir and rilpivirine may remain in the systemic circulation of patients for prolonged periods (up to 12 months or longer). It is important to carefully select patients who agree to the required monthly or every-2-month injection dosing schedule because non-adherence to monthly or every-2-month injections or missed doses could lead to loss of virologic response and development of resistance [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7.4)].

To minimize the potential risk of developing viral resistance, it is essential to initiate an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than 1 month after the final injections of CABENUVA when dosed monthly and no later than 2 months after the final injections of CABENUVA when dosed every 2 months. If virologic failure is suspected, switch the patient to an alternative regimen as soon as possible.

### Patient-reported outcomes in ATLAS and FLAIR participants on long-acting regimens of cabotegravir and rilpivirine over 48 weeks [^ab5d6193]. AIDS and Behavior (2020). Medium credibility.

The phase 3 ATLAS and FLAIR studies demonstrated that maintenance with Long-Acting (LA) intramuscular cabotegravir and rilpivirine is non-inferior in efficacy to current antiretroviral (CAR) oral therapy. Both studies utilized Patient-Reported Outcome instruments to measure treatment satisfaction (HIVTSQ) and acceptance (ACCEPT general domain), health status (SF-12), injection tolerability/acceptance (PIN), and treatment preference. In pooled analyses, LA-treated patients (n = 591) demonstrated greater mean improvements from baseline than the CAR group (n = 591) in treatment satisfaction (Week 44, + 3.9 vs. +0.5 HIVTSQs-points; p < 0.001) and acceptance (Week 48, +8.8 vs. +2.0 ACCEPT-points; p < 0.001). The acceptability of injection site reactions (PIN) significantly improved from week 5 (2.10 points) to week 48 (1.62 points; p < 0.001). In both studies, ≥ 97% of LA group participants with recorded data preferred LA treatment compared with prior oral therapy. These results further support the potential of a monthly injectable option for people living with HIV seeking an alternative to daily oral treatment.

### Long-acting injectable HIV therapy outcomes among persons with HIV who have adherence challenges to oral antiretroviral therapy [^29f773c2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Long-acting injectable cabotegravir/rilpivirine (LAI-CAB/RPV) may improve outcomes among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH) with adherence difficulties to oral therapy. In this real-world observational study, over 85% of PWH remained on therapy and virally suppressed 48 weeks after initiating LAI-CAB/RPV. Providers should consider LAI therapy among PWH with adherence difficulties.

### Efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics by body mass index category in phase 3 / 3b long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine trials [^b771a2f6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) consists of a combination of ≥ 2 agents from at least 2 drug classes. Cabotegravir (CAB), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), plus rilpivirine (RPV), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), is the first complete long-acting (LA) ART regimen, administered monthly (Q1M) or every 2 months (Q2M) via intramuscular injection, recommended by treatment guidelines for the maintenance of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) virologic suppression. LA injectable regimens have the potential to address some of the psychosocial stressors associated with daily oral ART that are experienced by some people with HIV (PWH). Treatment guidelines recognize this potential, including the US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, which state that PWH who are interested in nonoral ART options due to concerns surrounding privacy, stigma, or convenience have demonstrated greater satisfaction with CAB + RPV LA than continued oral therapy.

CAB + RPV LA has demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety with a low rate (approximately 1%) of confirmed virologic failure (CVF) in phase 3/3b clinical trials (FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M). Additionally, numerically lower CVF rates (0%–0.5%) have been reported in the phase 3/3b CARISEL (Q2M) and CUSTOMIZE (Q1M) implementation studies, the Q2M CARLOS real-world study, and the Q2M SOLAR head-to-head trial versus bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. While few (0%–1%) participants experienced CVF in these studies, consideration of baseline factors can guide clinicians in patient identification and help minimize CVF risk. The presence of ≥ 2 baseline factors (of the following 3: preexisting RPV resistance-associated mutations [RAMs], HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, and/or body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m 2) was associated with an increased risk of CVF on LA therapy in a post hoc analysis of the FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M studies up to 152 weeks. In this analysis, the CVF rate was very low for participants with no or 1 baseline factor; more specifically, participants with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 as their only factor had a CVF rate of 0.5% — similar to those with no factors (0.4%).

### Week 96 extension results of a phase 3 study evaluating long-acting cabotegravir with rilpivirine for HIV-1 treatment [^cf3190c7]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

The pharmacokinetic profile of Switch arm participants during the Extension Phase was consistent with Long-acting arm participants during the Maintenance Phase through W 48 and participants receiving long-acting CAB+RPV in the first 48 weeks of FLAIR. The longer term pharmacokinetic profile of Long-acting arm participants suggested an achievement of steady state for CAB after ∼44 weeks. For RPV, concentrations appear to plateau in the second year, with only limited further accumulation of RPV in the second year of injections. This is consistent with the half-life of RPV and has been observed in other longer term studies evaluating long-acting CAB+RPV.

Most participants, regardless of the treatment they received during the ATLAS study (Long-acting CAB+RPV Q4W or CAR), elected to transition to ATLAS-2M (investigating Long-acting CAB+RPV Q8W vs. Q4W) after completing the Maintenance Phase. Such willingness to switch to, or continue, intramuscular long-acting CAB+RPV treatment suggests a strong preference for long-acting therapy over oral standard of care. This is further supported by data collected at the W 96 analysis, at which all Switch arm participants responding to the treatment satisfaction questionnaire (100%, n = 27/27) indicated a preference for long-acting CAB+RPV therapy over their previous daily oral regimen. High participant preference for, and satisfaction with, longer term long-acting therapy over 96 weeks of treatment has been reported in other studies investigating long-acting CAB+RPV, such as the phase 3 FLAIR study and the phase 2b LATTE-2 study.

Whilst long-acting CAB+RPV treatment could be beneficial to those with adherence issues with oral ARTs, this needs to be specifically examined in such populations. Further clarity in this regard will be provided by the ongoing LATITUDE study (NCT03635788), which is currently investigating intramuscular long-acting CAB+RPV in a population with historic suboptimal adherence.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^45be3022]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Long-acting intramuscular rilpivirine (RPV) with cabotegravir (CAB) — indication, dosing schedule, and pediatric data: A long-acting IM RPV formulation has been approved for coadministration with IM CAB as a complete antiretroviral regimen for children and adolescents aged ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 35 kg and adults with HIV RNA levels < 50 copies/mL on a stable ARV regimen, with no history of treatment failure, and no known or suspected resistance to CAB or RPV. Adult trials evaluated monthly or every-other-month IM injections following an initial oral lead-in daily for 4 weeks, demonstrating noninferior efficacy and good participant satisfaction and tolerability through 96 weeks. In virally suppressed participants, switching to dual long-acting IM CAB and RPV every 4 to 8 weeks provided similar safety and efficacy to monthly injections through 48 weeks, and an extension showed the initial oral lead-in can be optional. In adolescents, IMPAACT 2017 (MOCHA) is evaluating IM CAB and RPV in those weighing ≥ 35 kg, has reported acceptable PKs and safety for the single IM products administered monthly with good acceptability, but has not completed evaluation of the dual injectable regimen long-term and clinical experience remains limited.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Population

Data from participants who received CAB + RPV LA dosed Q4W and/or Q8W in FLAIR, ATLAS, or ATLAS-2M were pooled in post hoc analyses. Data cutoffs were through week 124 for FLAIR, week 96 for ATLAS, and week 152 for ATLAS-2M. This analysis includes participants initially randomized to CAB + RPV LA and participants who switched to CAB + RPV LA during extension phases of the studies.

FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M are randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, phase 3/3b studies. FLAIR and ATLAS evaluated CAB + RPV LA dosed Q4W versus continuing daily oral therapy and ATLAS-2M evaluated CAB + RPV LA dosed Q8W versus Q4W. The full study designs and eligibility criteria have been published elsewhere. Participants were ≥ 18 years of age and virologically suppressed (plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) at randomization. Historical genotypic evidence of any major INSTI or NNRTI RAMs, excluding K103N in plasma, was exclusionary per the 2015 (FLAIR and ATLAS) and 2019 (ATLAS-2M) International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) guidelines (Supplementary Table 1). Both FLAIR and ATLAS had an extension phase in which participants randomized to the daily oral therapy comparator arm could switch to CAB + RPV LA Q4W or, for ATLAS only, could transition to either Q4W or Q8W dosing in ATLAS-2M. Thus, in ATLAS-2M, approximately half of participants rolled over from the daily oral therapy or CAB + RPV LA Q4W arms of the ATLAS study. Baseline characteristics were broadly similar across the studies.

All studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study protocols were approved by an investigational review board.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^6f08b3f5]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Long-acting cabotegravir/rilpivirine (LA CAB/RPV) regimen use — Long-acting (LA) cabotegravir (CAB)/rilpivirine (RPV) is currently approved as a complete antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for individuals engaged in care who have good adherence to an oral regimen, sustained undetectable HIV RNA levels for > 3 months, no known or suspected resistance to either drug, and no active HBV infection. To date, no large or randomized clinical trials have been published using any INSTI plus NNRTI, including LA CAB/RPV, as a complete regimen for people without viral suppression. A few small observational studies have shown that people with viremia despite intensive efforts on oral ART, without resistance to CAB or RPV, can achieve viral suppression with LA CAB/RPV when intensive supportive services are available. If considering LA CAB/RPV in this population, it is important to note that data are limited, and this is not an approved indication of the regimen, and if the regimen is used in people with inconsistent adherence and virologic failure, there is a high likelihood of developing acquired resistance to CAB and/or RPV, which might limit future treatment options.

### Potential impact and cost-effectiveness of long-acting injectable lenacapavir plus cabotegravir as HIV treatment in Africa [^d1ff9ec7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

HIV incidence in Africa has declined in recent years but remains substantial, particularly in southern Africa. A major reason for the decline is the success of providing oral antiretroviral drugs for people with HIV (PWH), as treatment as prevention is a powerful strategy to reduce HIV incidence. In people with drug sensitive virus who are adherent to daily pill taking these drugs lead to viral suppression, eliminating onward HIV sexual transmission risk. However, for various individual, contextual, and health service-related reasons, not everybody is able to adhere to daily pill taking. In such cases, a regimen consisting of two long-acting injectable drugs may be a suitable alternative –. This has the advantage of removing the need for daily pill taking, although it may involve more frequent clinic visits. While currently long-acting treatment is not available in most African settings, a dual long-acting drug regimen of the integrase inhibitor cabotegravir plus the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor(NNRTI) rilpivirine has been approved for use in some high income countries and has recently been shown to be non-inferior to oral therapy at 48 weeks among virologically suppressed individuals in a trial in Uganda, Kenya and South Africa –. Despite this trial conducted in Africa, cost and accessibility of long-acting cabotegravir/rilpivirine has so far limited its availability.

Patient-reported outcomes

At W 96, HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status version (HIVTSQs) total treatment satisfaction scores for Long-acting arm participants remained high and were comparable with W 24 and W 44, with numerical improvements from Baseline observed across all timepoints [mean HIVTSQs total score (SD): Baseline (n = 302), 55.25 (9.14); W 24 (n = 290), 61.80 (6.65); W 44 (n = 282), 61.80 (5.31); W 96 (n = 27), 61.33 (8.06)]. Numerical improvements in total treatment satisfaction at W 96 were also observed for participants in the Switch arm [mean HIVTSQs total score (SD): Extension Baseline (n = 174), 54.66 (10.72); W 96 (n = 35), 59.20 (12.77)].

At W 96, 100% (n = 27/27) of participants in the Switch arm who responded to the treatment satisfaction questionnaire selected long-acting CAB+RPV as their preferred regimen compared with the daily oral treatment that they had received during the Maintenance Phase.

### Impact of switching to long-acting injectable cabotegravir plus rilpivirine on rectal HIV-1 RNA shedding and implications for transmission risk [^fb87d036]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The long-acting (LA) cabotegravir (CAB) plus rilpivirine (RPV) regimen represents an innovative antiretroviral option for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Phase 3 trials have shown high virological control rates with monthly or bimonthly intramuscular administration, demonstrating noninferiority to daily oral 3-drug regimens. Viral suppression is critical for health and preventing transmission, but the "HIV undetectable equals untransmittable" principle is primarily based on oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) studies. Whether this assumption can be extrapolated to intramuscular LA ART remains to be confirmed.

Data on HIV-1 RNA dynamics in transmission-associated anatomical sites for parenteral CAB plus RPV are scarce. The only study involving the rectal compartment examined participants receiving monthly intramuscular ART with CAB plus RPV. The once-monthly schedule is not available in Europe and the United Kingdom, where only the bimonthly regimen is marketed. Compared to monthly dosing, the bimonthly schedule has been associated with higher virologic failure rates and breakthrough infections in HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Given the increased rectal viral shedding seen with daily oral ART and monthly LA CAB plus RPV, evaluating bimonthly efficacy in this compartment is crucial for transmission risk assessment.

Low CAB and RPV concentrations correlate with virological failure. PrEP studies have explored pharmacokinetics in transmission-relevant sites, typically after a single intramuscular dose, but pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the rectum under a bimonthly regimen remain unknown. The impact of oral lead-in CAB and RPV on rectal HIV-1 RNA dynamics also warrants investigation.

Our goal was to assess the effects of long-acting ART on HIV-1 dynamics within the rectal compartment. We prospectively analyzed HIV-1 RNA levels and RPV concentrations in paired plasma and rectal fluid samples from a cohort of virologically suppressed people with HIV (PWH) transitioning from standard oral ART to bimonthly intramuscular CAB and RPV, with or without an oral lead-in phase. By analyzing sequential paired plasma and rectal fluid samples, the study sought to characterize viral dynamics across treatment phases, recognizing that differences in sampling frequency between the oral and intramuscular phases preclude direct aggregated comparisons. We also investigated factors associated with rectal HIV-1 RNA shedding. As a secondary objective, we compared HIV-1 RNA dynamics in the rectal compartment during the intramuscular phase between individuals who received the oral lead-in and those who did not.

### Cabotegravir and rilpivirine (Cabenuva) [^a10e92c9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

At baseline, in cohort 1 (n = 55), the median age of participants was 15.0 years, the median weight was 50.0 kg (range: 37.4, 98.5), 47% were female, 76% were Black/African American, 16% were Asian, 7% were White; and no participant had a CD4+ cell count < 350 cells per mm3. At baseline, median CD4+ cell count was 725 cells per mm3(range: 397 to 1808).

The primary objectives at Week 16, which were to confirm the use of the adult dose through the evaluation of safety and pharmacokinetics in virologically suppressed adolescents with HIV-1, were met enabling the progression of participants to cohort 2 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Cohort 2

Cohort 2 enrolled eligible participants who had completed cohort 1 as well as eligible participants who had not been previously enrolled in the study. Cohort 2 participants (n = 144) discontinued their background antiretroviral therapy and received one 30-mg cabotegravir tablet plus one 25-mg rilpivirine tablet daily for at least 4 weeks followed by every-2-month cabotegravir injections (Months 1 and 2: 600-mg injection, then 600-mg injection once every 2 months) and rilpivirine injections (Months 1 and 2: 900-mg injection, then 900-mg injection once every 2 months).

### High virologic suppression and favorable profiles of two-drug antiretroviral regimens in Africa: a systematic review of current evidence [^8804c04d]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

HIV remains a major public health challenge, with Africa bearing over two-thirds of the global burden. While three-drug antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the standard of care, emerging evidence suggests that two-drug regimens (2DRs) may offer comparable efficacy with reduced toxicity and cost. However, data on their use in African populations are limited. This systematic review assessed outcomes of 2DRs compared to other ART regimens among adults in Africa, following PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and African Journals Online was conducted for English-language studies published from 2015 onwards. Eligible studies included adult HIV patients in Africa comparing 2DRs with other ART regimens, reporting outcomes such as viral suppression, drug resistance, adherence, safety, and toxicity. Five randomized, open-label phase III trials were included, all conducted across multiple countries with African sites. Four (80%) were non-inferiority trials involving virologically suppressed or ART-naïve adults. Regimens included dolutegravir-based (40%) and long-acting injectable cabotegravir+rilpivirine (CAB+RPV) (60%). Virological suppression (< 50 copies/mL) was achieved in 80% of studies over 24-144weeks, with stable or improved CD4+ counts in 60%. Injection-site reactions occurred in 40% of trials; adverse effects with dolutegravir ranged from 6 to 20%, while CAB+RPV showed high adherence (97–98%) but injection-site reactions (75–86%). Non-inferiority was confirmed in 60% of studies, with strong patient preference for injectables reported in 40%. Limitations included short follow-up, lack of blinding (80%), and potential selection bias (40%). Two-drug ART regimens appear effective and well-tolerated in African settings, warranting further high-quality, long-term studies.

### Phase 1 evaluation of VH4524184, a third-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor with an enhanced resistance profile [^4be96e36]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Advancements in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have substantially increased life expectancy and improved the health of persons with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This is due to development of newer antiretroviral classes like integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), a cornerstone of HIV-1 treatment for over 15 years. Once-daily oral regimens containing the second-generation INSTIs dolutegravir or bictegravir are recommended as initial therapy by international guidelines for most persons with HIV-1 because of their high efficacy and barrier to resistance, good safety and tolerability profile, low pill burden, and low potential for drug–drug interactions. Dolutegravir use is widespread, with 24 million people having access to the generic formulation in 128 low- and middle-income countries.

Lifelong ART adherence is the most important determinant for achieving and maintaining virologic suppression and preventing treatment-emergent resistance; however, psychological challenges such as perceiving daily ART as a constant reminder of HIV-1, fear of inadvertently sharing HIV-1 status, and stigma are common adherence barriers. Long-acting ART has helped address some barriers, offering improved convenience by extending dosing intervals from daily to monthly or longer. Cabotegravir, a second-generation INSTI, plus rilpivirine is the first complete long-acting regimen administered via injection every month or every 2 months approved for use in persons with HIV-1 who are virologically suppressed. In the phase 3b SOLAR study, switching to long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine was associated with greater improvements in treatment satisfaction compared with continuing daily oral ART, and 90% of participants reported preferring long-acting therapy. In the real-world observational BEYOND study, adults with HIV-1 in the United States who switched to long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine reported improved treatment satisfaction after 12 months, and the proportion reporting fear of inadvertent sharing of HIV-1 status, adherence anxiety, feeling reminded of HIV-1, and feeling stigmatized by HIV-1 treatment decreased from baseline to month 12, suggesting that long-acting regimens may help address psychological adherence barriers. Despite significant progress in the response to the HIV-1 epidemic, many countries are falling short of their 2030 Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS goals, demanding new approaches like long-acting regimens.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^4b1099ab]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Long-acting antiretroviral therapy — The combination of injectable cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV) is an optimization option for people with HIV who demonstrate retention in HIV care and who are virologically suppressed on oral therapy, and current U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for LA CAB/RPV is limited to individuals with expected good adherence and an ability to achieve virologic suppression on oral therapy prior to starting long-acting ART. Limited data from a small, ongoing observational study found that LA CAB/RPV leads to high levels of viral suppression in people with HIV who have struggled with adherence to oral ART and those who are viremic at treatment initiation, including people who use stimulants; however, it is not known if similar responses can be seen in clinics without comparable adherence support. Missing LA CAB/RPV doses or a delay in receiving scheduled injections may result in emergence of HIV drug resistance. When contemplating the use of LA CAB/RPV in people with HIV and substance use disorders, providers should discuss adherence with their patients during multiple, nonjudgmental evaluations.

14.3	Clinical Trial in Adolescents for Treatment of HIV-1 Infection

Trial 208580 (MOCHA, [NCT03497676])

The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral and injectable cabotegravir and oral and injectable rilpivirine were assessed in an ongoing Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label, non‑comparative study, MOCHA (IMPAACT 2017), in virologically suppressed adolescents with HIV-1 aged 12 to younger than 18 years and weighing ≥ 35 kg [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The primary objective at Week 24 was to confirm the safety of injectable cabotegravir plus injectable rilpivirine in virologically suppressed adolescents with HIV-1. Antiviral activity was assessed as a secondary objective. A total of 144 adolescent participants with HIV-1 received oral cabotegravir in combination with oral rilpivirine as an oral lead-in.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^70e17b1d]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Optimizing antiretroviral therapy (ARV) in viral suppression — principles, drivers, and eligible switch populations: The fundamental principle of ARV regimen optimization is to maintain viral suppression without jeopardizing future treatment options, and adverse events, drug–drug or drug–food interactions, pill burden, pregnancy, cost, stigma, inconvenience from taking oral medications, or the desire to simplify a regimen may prompt regimen optimization. It is critical to review a person's full ARV history, including virologic responses, past ARV-associated toxicities and intolerances, and cumulative resistance test results before selecting a new ARV regimen (AI). People with HIV who have no history of drug-resistance mutations or virologic failure can likely switch to any regimen that has been shown to be highly effective in people who are ARV-naive (AI) or to NRTI-sparing options extensively researched in switch studies, such as dolutegravir (DTG) plus rilpivirine (RPV) (AI) or long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine (LA CAB/RPV) (AI).

### Phase 2 trial of long-acting cabotegravir and VRC07-523LS for viral suppression in adults with HIV-1: ACTG A5357 [^dd8b8427]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-acting regimens are needed to expand antiretroviral therapy (ART) options for people with HIV-1 (PWH). Combining broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) with long-acting small-molecule antiretrovirals may offer an alternative to daily oral therapy.

Methods

We conducted a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial at AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) sites across the U.S. Eligible adults had HIV-1 virologically suppressed on ART for ≥ 2 years, CD4 ≥ 350 cells/mm³, and susceptibility to VRC07-523LS (IC50 ≤ 0.25 µg/mL; inhibition > 98%). Participants completed an oral cabotegravir (CAB) lead-in (Step 1), then received intravenous VRC07-523LS (40 mg/kg every 8 weeks) plus intramuscular CAB-LA (every 4 weeks) for 48 weeks (Step 2), followed by a return to standard ART (Step 3). Primary outcomes were treatment-related grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs), treatment discontinuation, and confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL by week 44. Virologic efficacy was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.

Results

Seventy-four participants were enrolled (median age 54; 26% female; 51% White non-Hispanic). Twelve (17%) experienced a primary safety event: 11 (15%) had grade ≥ 3 Aes, primarily transient infusion reactions, and one discontinued due to a grade 1 infusion event. The cumulative probability of virologic failure by week 44 was 7% (95% CI, 3%-16%). One participant developed the R263K integrase resistance mutation.

Conclusions

The VRC07-523LS plus CAB-LA regimen maintained viral suppression in 93% of participants, with only transient infusion reactions observed; however, instances of virologic breakthrough suggest that future studies should focus on optimizing efficacy outcomes. These results support continued investigation of bNAb-based long-acting ART combinations.
