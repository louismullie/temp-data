## Question

could elevated c3 & c4 be related to fibromyaligia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether elevated complement C3 and C4 levels are related to fibromyalgia, and specifically whether such elevations support a diagnosis or pathophysiologic link to fibromyalgia symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology and diagnostic framework of fibromyalgia. Then, I should verify what the best available evidence says about blood biomarkers in fibromyalgia and whether C3/C4 have been implicated. Next, I will review how complement behaves in immune-mediated diseases and what elevated versus decreased complement levels generally mean. After that, I should check guideline-recommended testing in fibromyalgia to see if C3/C4 are advised. Finally, I will consider alternative explanations for elevated C3/C4 and synthesize a clinical conclusion with practical next steps [^111FmLVG] [^112dUPwt] [^1163eApC] [^112S4ReB].

> Let me first confirm the fibromyalgia construct so I don't anchor on an immunologic biomarker prematurely; fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain with central sensitization, autonomic and neuroendocrine dysregulation, and overlapping functional symptoms rather than organ-specific inflammation, and complement components are not part of the established pathophysiology or diagnostic framework [^111FmLVG] [^112dUPwt] [^117LpcPB].

> Next, I should review the biomarker literature; wait, let me verify the most comprehensive synthesis — this systematic review and meta-analysis of 54 studies found higher IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, CRP, and BDNF in fibromyalgia but did not identify C3 or C4 as relevant biomarkers, and explicitly concluded that these blood measures are not specific biomarkers for fibromyalgia, which argues against using C3/C4 for diagnosis or disease linkage [^114H3p9t].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about complement before I check its typical clinical behavior; in immune complex–mediated diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, complement levels are classically decreased due to consumption, not elevated, and standard clinical interpretation of C3/C4 relies on understanding pathway activation and consumption dynamics rather than treating them as generic inflammation markers [^114Rhusm] [^1163eApC] [^114ZGW1Y] [^112S4ReB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, are there adjacent pain-fatigue syndromes where complement fragments are altered that might confuse this? Studies in chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis show inconsistent changes in C4a in response to exercise — one reported a post-exertional rise while another did not — underscoring that even in related conditions, complement split-product signals are inconsistent and do not translate into a diagnostic role for total C3/C4 in fibromyalgia [^117CUYre] [^114M52A1].

> I should double-check guideline recommendations to ensure I'm not overlooking any endorsed testing; fibromyalgia diagnostic guidance emphasizes a clinical diagnosis with limited screening labs to exclude mimics — CBC, ESR or CRP, CK, and TSH — and does not include C3 or C4 for diagnosis or monitoring, which further supports that complement levels are not part of standard fibromyalgia workup [^117YGGQD] [^113RTssR] [^112gGNRz] [^1148MUVn].

> But wait, what if C3/C4 are elevated on a lab panel; what might that actually reflect? I need to ensure we consider common confounders: elevations in C3 and C4 often track with adiposity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk, and their levels are influenced by genetics and acute-phase responses, so an elevated C3/C4 pattern is more plausibly cardiometabolic or inflammatory risk–related than a signal of fibromyalgia biology per se [^113UcX2U] [^113wZFpd] [^111TAYyS] [^113ZSQr9].

> I will now examine emerging immunology in fibromyalgia to see if complement is indirectly implicated; recent lines of investigation focus on pain-sensitizing IgG autoantibodies and translational trial design, but even these research priorities do not point to complement components as validated biomarkers or therapeutic targets in fibromyalgia at this time, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret complement data in this context [^117TCReh] [^115kcu1n] [^114DVpFo] [^114HCeWg].

> Let me reconsider any potential mistake in my initial framing; I initially wondered if "elevated complement" could indicate autoimmune inflammation tied to fibromyalgia symptoms, but I should confirm that in classical immune complex diseases complement is usually low from consumption, and in fibromyalgia, the best evidence does not implicate complement elevation as diagnostic or mechanistic, correcting that initial assumption [^114Rhusm] [^114H3p9t] [^111FmLVG].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly: No, elevated C3 and C4 are not related to fibromyalgia as diagnostic or pathophysiologic markers, and current evidence does not support a relationship between elevated complement C3/C4 and fibromyalgia; rather, fibromyalgia is a clinical diagnosis with central sensitization biology, and complement components are neither established biomarkers nor part of guideline-recommended testing [^114H3p9t] [^111FmLVG] [^112dUPwt] [^117YGGQD].

> Clinically, if C3/C4 are elevated, I need to check for more likely explanations such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, chronic inflammatory burden, or genetic variation, while managing fibromyalgia per guidelines and reserving complement testing for contexts where autoimmune disease is suspected — in which case low, not high, complement would raise concern for immune complex–mediated activity [^113wZFpd] [^113UcX2U] [^111TAYyS] [^1148MUVn] [^114Rhusm].

---

No, elevated C3 and C4 are not characteristic of fibromyalgia and are **not used in its diagnosis or management** [^117YGGQD] [^112dUPwt]. These complement proteins are acute-phase reactants that rise with inflammation, infection, or metabolic syndrome — not with the central sensitization underlying fibromyalgia [^112S4ReB] [^113wZFpd]. If C3/C4 are elevated in a patient with fibromyalgia, **evaluate for coexisting inflammatory or metabolic conditions** — such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, or autoimmune disease [^1163eApC] [^111TAYyS]. Elevated C3/C4 levels are nonspecific and **should not be interpreted as evidence of fibromyalgia** [^114H3p9t].

---

## Pathophysiology of fibromyalgia

Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive symptoms, with central sensitization as the core mechanism [^112dUPwt] [^111FmLVG]. This mechanism involves abnormal pain processing, altered neurotransmitters, and neuroendocrine/autonomic dysregulation [^117LpcPB]. Although low-grade inflammation and immune dysregulation have been proposed, there is **no consistent evidence of systemic inflammation or complement activation** in fibromyalgia.

---

## Complement system and its clinical significance

The complement system is a key innate immune cascade [^114ZGW1Y], and C3 and C4 are central components and acute-phase reactants that increase with inflammation, infection, and metabolic syndrome [^111TAYyS]. Elevated C3/C4 are **nonspecific markers** of systemic inflammation and not disease-specific [^1163eApC].

---

## Evidence regarding complement levels in fibromyalgia

There is **no consistent evidence** that fibromyalgia is associated with elevated C3 or C4. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 54 studies found no complement abnormalities in fibromyalgia, and complement markers are not included in diagnostic or management guidelines. The 2012 Canadian guidelines recommend only limited initial labs (CBC, ESR, CRP, CK, TSH) to exclude other conditions — not complement testing [^117YGGQD] [^113RTssR].

---

## Clinical interpretation of elevated C3 and C4 in fibromyalgia patients

Elevated C3/C4 in a patient with fibromyalgia should **prompt evaluation for coexisting inflammatory or metabolic conditions**, such as:

- **Obesity and metabolic syndrome**: Strongly associated with higher C3/C4 and cardiometabolic risk [^113UcX2U] [^113wZFpd].

- **Autoimmune or inflammatory diseases**: RA, SLE, and other autoimmune diseases can elevate complement levels [^1163eApC].

- **Infections**: Acute or chronic infections can raise complement levels [^112S4ReB].

Elevated C3/C4 are nonspecific and **should not be interpreted as evidence of fibromyalgia** [^1163eApC].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a clinical diagnosis based on chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive symptoms, and recommend limited labs to exclude other conditions [^1148MUVn] [^117YGGQD]. Complement testing is **not recommended** for diagnosis or management of fibromyalgia [^113RTssR].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical marker** | **Association with fibromyalgia** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| C3 and C4 | No consistent association | - Nonspecific markers of inflammation <br/> - Elevated levels suggest coexisting inflammatory or metabolic conditions |
| ESR/CRP | No specific association; used to exclude inflammatory disease | - Useful to rule out alternative diagnoses <br/> - Typically normal or only mildly elevated in fibromyalgia |

---

Elevated C3 and C4 are **not characteristic of fibromyalgia** and are not used in its diagnosis or management [^117YGGQD]. If elevated, assess for coexisting inflammatory or metabolic disease [^111TAYyS].

### Relationships of complement components C3 and C4 and their genetics to cardiometabolic risk in healthy, non-Hispanic white adolescents [^113UcX2U]. Pediatric Research (2020). Low credibility.

Complement promotes inflammatory and immune responses and may affect cardiometabolic risk. This study was designed to investigate the effect of complement components C3 and C4 on cardiometabolic risk in healthy non-Hispanic white adolescents.

- **Methods**: Body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, waist circumference, and percent body fat were assessed in 75 adolescents. Arterial stiffness was assessed using arterial tomography, and endothelial function was evaluated using reactive hyperemia. Fasting lipids, inflammatory markers, and complement levels were measured, and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed. A single C3 polymorphism and C4 gene copy number variations were assessed.

- **Results**: C3 plasma levels increased with measures of obesity. Endothelial function worsened with increased C3 and C4 levels. Triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein increased, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and insulin sensitivity decreased with increasing C3 levels, but the relationships were lost when body habitus was included in the model. C4 was negatively related to HDL and positively to inflammatory markers. Subjects with at least one C3F allele had an increased BMI and fat mass index. HDL was significantly related to C4L, C4S, C4A, and C4B gene copy number variation.

- **Conclusions**: C3 levels increase with increasing body mass, and increased C4 levels and copy number are associated with increased cardiometabolic risk in healthy adolescents.

### Potential role of blood biomarkers in patients with fibromyalgia: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^114H3p9t]. Pain (2022). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex chronic pain condition. Its symptoms are nonspecific, and at the time of writing, no objective test exists to confirm FM diagnosis. Potential objective measures include the circulating levels of blood biomarkers. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to review studies assessing blood biomarkers' levels in patients with FM compared with healthy controls.

We systematically searched the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Fifty-four studies reporting the levels of biomarkers in blood in patients with FM were included. Data were extracted, and the methodological quality was assessed independently by two authors. The methodological quality of nine studies (17%) was low. The results of most studies were not directly comparable given differences in methods and investigated target immune mediators. Thus, data from 40 studies only were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model.

The meta-analysis showed that patients with FM had significantly lower levels of interleukin-1 β and higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon gamma, C-reactive protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor compared with healthy controls. Nevertheless, this systematic literature review and meta-analysis could not support the notion that these blood biomarkers are specific biomarkers of FM. Our literature review, however, revealed that these same individual biomarkers may have the potential role of identifying underlying pathologies or other conditions that often coexist with FM.

Future research is needed to evaluate the potential clinical value of these biomarkers.

### Complement regulators and inhibitory proteins [^114ZGW1Y]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

The complement system is important for cellular integrity and tissue homeostasis. Complement activation mediates the removal of microorganisms and the clearance of modified self-cells, such as apoptotic cells. Complement regulators control the spontaneously activated complement cascade, and any disturbances in this delicate balance can result in damage to tissues and in autoimmune disease. Therefore, insights into the mechanisms of complement regulation are crucial for understanding disease pathology and for enabling the development of diagnostic tools and therapies for complement-associated diseases.

### Complement activation in a model of chronic fatigue syndrome [^117CUYre]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

A need exists to identify biological markers in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The objective of this study was to use an exercise and/or allergen challenge to induce the symptoms of CFS and to identify a biological marker that correlates with these symptoms.

- **Methods**: Patients with CFS (n = 32) and age-matched normal control patients (n = 29) exercised for 20 minutes on a stationary bike at 70% of their predicted maximum workload (Watts). Patients from each group with positive skin test results were also challenged with intranasally administered relevant allergens. Symptoms were recorded for 2 weeks before and 1 week after each challenge using three different instruments. Blood samples were taken before, and 0, 1, 6, and 24 hours after challenges. Levels of complement split products, cell-associated cytokines, and eosinophilic cationic protein were measured. Mean pre-exercise and post-exercise symptom scores were evaluated for each group.

- **Results**: The exercise challenge induced significant increases of the complement split product C4a, but not C3a or C5a, at 6 hours after exercise only in the CFS group (P < 0.01), regardless of allergy status. Mean symptom scores were significantly increased after exercise through the use of a daily diary (P < 0.03) and a weekly diary (P < 0.01) for the CFS group only. Mean scores for the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory categories "reduced activity" and "mental fatigue" were significantly increased in the CFS group only (P < 0.04 and P < 0.02, respectively).

Exercise challenge may be a valuable tool in the development of diagnostic criteria and tests.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^115kcu1n]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

There was a high level of stakeholder agreement that the recent Aab findings should be repeated by independent researchers and research laboratories. Stakeholders acknowledged that the findings already incorporate some degree of replication from two independent laboratories and two distinct patient cohorts.

Stakeholders considered characterization of Aab targets as a key relevant objective for Aab research going forward, with a high consensus level. There was also a good level of agreement that for each identified Aab target, the antibody pathogenicity should be investigated. It was noted that specific Aab associated with a disease can sometimes be without a clear pathogenetic role.

Stakeholders considered it important to research if and how Aab can cause central phenomena that characterize FMS and to further investigate Aab binding in the central nervous system (CNS). Stakeholders acknowledge that no evidence for CNS binding has been identified, but advised that this may not exclude binding at lower intensities or to distinct, small regions.

- **Immunology**: There was strong agreement that immune parameters should be assessed during FMS flares versus non-flare periods; the dominant antibody subclasses and their titres should be studied. It was thought possible that key parameters such as antibody levels or plasmablast populations may differ during flare times. This is also a method to facilitate generation of antibodies in vitro, from patient B cells. Stakeholders also agreed that the mechanisms underpinning the production of non-inflammatory Aab should be investigated.

Question 2: Which statement is TRUE for both SSLR and serum sickness?
A. Arthralgia is a common symptom
B. Complement levels are typically decreased
C. Immune complex formation is present
D. Most common triggers are antibiotics
E. Multisystem involvement is typical

- **Answers**:

	- A. Arthralgia is a common symptom – Correct. Arthralgia and edema of the feet and hands are commonly seen in both serum sickness and SSLR. Fever, urticarial-like rash, and pruritus are also typical of both conditions.

	- B. Complement levels are typically decreased – Incorrect. In SSLR, complement levels are typically normal or slightly elevated as complement can be an acute phase reactant. In contrast, immune complex deposition in serum sickness activates the complement system resulting in complement consumption, commonly demonstrated as low C3 and C4.

	- C. Immune complex formation is present – Incorrect. Serum sickness is the classic type III immune-complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction which results in extravascular immune complex deposition. In contrast, SSLR lacks the formation of immune complexes and is thought to occur via hypersensitivity to drug metabolites, although the pathogenesis is not entirely understood.

	- D. Most common triggers are antibiotics – Incorrect. The most common offending agents for SSLR are antibiotics; historically, cefaclor and subsequently penicillins, cephalosporins, and sulfonamides have been reported. In one study of 83 patients, 82.7% of cases were attributed to amoxicillin as seen in this case. Other medications include bupropion, fluoxetine, and thiouracil.

### C5 nephritic factors drive the biological phenotype of C3 glomerulopathies [^116CCANd]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

C3 glomerulopathies, which include dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis, are associated with genetic and acquired dysregulation of the C3 convertase alternative pathway of complement. The potential role of the activation of the C5 convertase has not been studied extensively. Here, we analyzed IgG samples from patients with C3 glomerulopathies to identify circulating autoantibodies that stabilize the C3 alternative pathway (C3 nephritic factors) as well as C5 convertases (C5 nephritic factors), thus preventing decay of these enzyme complexes.

Rare variants in alternative pathway genes were found in 28 of 120 tested patients. C3 and C5 nephritic factors were found in 76 of 101 (75%) and 29 of 59 (49%) of the patients, respectively. Therefore, we compared the results of the assays for the C3 and C5 nephritic factors' functional activity: 29% were positive for C3 nephritic factors alone, 39% were positive for both C3 and C5 nephritic factors, and 10% were positive for C5 nephritic factors alone.

We found that the addition of properdin-enhanced stabilization of C3 convertase in the presence of IgG doubly positive for both nephritic factors, while it did not modify the stabilization mediated by IgG solely positive for C3 nephritic factors. Both C3 and C5 nephritic factors correlated with C3 consumption, while only C5 nephritic factors correlated with sC5b9 levels. C5 nephritic factors-positive patients were more likely to have C3 glomerulonephritis than dense deposit disease. Thus, dysregulation of the C5 convertase contributes to C3 glomerulopathies inter-disease differences.

### Unravelling the nature of postexertional malaise in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of elastase, complement C4a and interleukin-1beta [^114M52A1]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The study investigates how vigorous exercise triggers postexertional malaise in individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which is a common symptom occurring in up to 95% of ME/CFS patients. The research aimed to examine whether different types of exercise lead to changes in health status and levels of circulating elastase activity, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and complement C4a.

- **Design**: Comparative experimental design conducted at a university setting.

- **Subjects**: The study involved 22 women diagnosed with ME/CFS and a control group of 22 healthy, sedentary women.

- **Interventions**: Participants engaged in two exercise sessions: a submaximal exercise on day 8 and a self-paced, physiologically limited exercise on day 16. Blood samples, actigraphy, and health status assessments were conducted before and after each exercise session.

- **Results**: Both exercise types triggered postexertional malaise in participants with ME/CFS. However, neither form of exercise affected elastase activity, IL-1beta, or complement C4a split product levels in either ME/CFS patients or healthy controls (P > 0.05). Nonetheless, postexercise complement C4a level emerged as a significant biomarker for postexertional malaise in ME/CFS patients.

- **Conclusions**: Submaximal and self-paced, physiologically limited exercises trigger postexertional malaise in individuals with ME/CFS but do not alter the acute circulating levels of IL-1beta, complement C4a split product, or elastase activity. Further research into immune response alterations in ME/CFS is warranted.

### 2012 Canadian guidelines for the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia syndrome: Executive summary [^112gGNRz]. Pain Research & Management (2013). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for fibromyalgia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend considering the use of the 2012 ACR diagnostic criteria for FM at initial assessment to validate a clinical diagnosis of FM, with the understanding that symptoms vary over time.

### Cytokines play an aetiopathogenetic role in fibromyalgia: a hypothesis and pilot study [^11252in8]. Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

To measure soluble factors possibly involved in fibromyalgia (FM), this study compared the profiles of patients with recent onset syndrome to those with chronic FM. The study examined the production of cytokines, cytokine-related molecules, and a CXC chemokine, interleukin (IL)-8. Fifty-six FM patients, including 23 with symptoms lasting two years, were compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Cytokines and cytokine-related molecules were measured in sera and in supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) incubated with and without lectins and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).

- **Results**: No differences were found between fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) patients and controls when measuring IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-10, serum IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). However, levels of IL-1R antibody (IL-1Ra) and IL-8 were significantly higher in sera, and IL-1Ra and IL-6 were significantly higher in both stimulated and unstimulated FM PBMC compared to controls. Serum IL-6 levels were comparable to those in controls but were elevated in supernatants of in vitro-activated PBMC from patients with symptoms lasting more than two years. In the presence of PMA, additional increases in IL-1Ra, IL-8, and IL-6 over control values were observed.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with FM, increases over time were found in serum levels and/or PBMC-stimulated activity of soluble factors whose release is stimulated by substance P. As IL-8 promotes sympathetic pain and IL-6 induces hyperalgesia, fatigue, and depression, it is hypothesized that they may play a role in the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia.

### C4 nephritic factors in C3 glomerulopathy: A case series [^115VgEfU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) defines a group of rare complement-mediated kidney diseases with a shared underlying pathophysiology: dysregulation of complement in the fluid phase and glomerular microenvironment. Dysregulation can be driven by autoantibodies to C3 and C5 convertases.

- **Study design**: Case series.

- **Setting and participants**: 168 patients with C3G (dense deposit disease, 68; C3 glomerulonephritis, 100) selected from our C3G biobank.

- **Outcomes**: Patient-purified immunoglobulin Gs were tested for C4 nephritic factors (C4NeFs). These autoantibodies recognize C4b2a, the C3 convertase of the classical pathway of complement.

- **Measurements**: C4NeFs were detected using a modified hemolytic assay.

- **Results**: C4NeFs were identified in 5 patients, 4 of whom had C3 glomerulonephritis. C4NeFs were associated with dysregulation of C3 and C5 convertases, and they appear to stabilize these convertases in a dose-dependent manner. C4NeFs also appear to protect C4b2a from decay mediated by soluble CR1 and C4 binding protein. The stabilizing activity of the autoantibodies was further demonstrated by using heat treatment to inactivate complement. C4NeFs were not detected in 150 patients with another complement-mediated kidney disease, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. They were also absent in 300 apparently healthy controls.

- **Limitations**: In addition to C4NeFs, 2 patients had positive findings for other autoantibodies: one patient also had autoantibodies to factor H; the other patient also had autoantibodies to C3bBb (C3NeFs).

- **Conclusions**: The finding of C4NeFs in a small percentage of patients with C3G emphasizes the need for further research into the role of these autoantibodies in the disease pathogenesis.

### Complement system activation: bridging physiology, pathophysiology, and therapy [^112S4ReB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The complement system is a set of over 50 proteins that constitutes an essential part of the innate immune system. Complement system activation involves an organized proteolytic cascade. Overactivation of complement system activation is the main pathogenic mechanism of several diseases and contributes to the manifestations of many other conditions. This review describes the normal complement system and the role of complement dysregulation in critical illnesses, notably sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Complement activation is involved in the immune system response to pathogens but, when excessive, can contribute to tissue damage, runaway inflammation, and capillary leakage syndrome. Complement overactivation may play a key role in severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

- **Diseases mainly caused by complement overactivation**: Two diseases whose manifestations are mainly caused by complement overactivation, namely atypical hemolytic and uremic syndrome (aHUS) and myasthenia gravis, are discussed. A diagnostic algorithm for aHUS is provided. Early complement-inhibiting therapy has been proven effective. When renal transplantation is required, complement-inhibiting drugs can be used prophylactically to prevent aHUS recurrence. Similarly, acetylcholine-receptor autoantibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis involves complement system overactivation and responds to complement inhibition.

- **Main complement inhibitors**: The two main complement inhibitors used in routine care at the time of writing are eculizumab and ravulizumab. The main adverse event is Neisseria infection, which is rare and preventable but can be fatal.

### Complement in disease: A defence system turning offensive [^113ZsWSU]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Although the complement system is primarily perceived as a host defence system, a more versatile, yet potentially harmful side of this innate immune pathway as an inflammatory mediator also exists. The activities that define the ability of the complement system to control microbial threats and eliminate cellular debris — such as sensing molecular danger patterns, generating immediate effectors, and extensively coordinating with other defence pathways — can quickly turn complement from a defence system to an aggressor that drives immune and inflammatory diseases. These host-offensive actions become more pronounced with age and are exacerbated by a variety of genetic factors and autoimmune responses. Complement can also be activated inappropriately, for example, in response to biomaterials or transplants.

A wealth of research over the past two decades has led to an increasingly finely tuned understanding of complement activation, identified tipping points between physiological and pathological behaviour, and revealed avenues for therapeutic intervention. This review summarizes our view of the key activating, regulatory, and effector mechanisms of the complement system, highlighting important crosstalk connections, and, with an emphasis on kidney disease and transplantation, discusses the involvement of complement in clinical conditions and promising therapeutic approaches.

### Pathophysiologic mechanisms of fibromyalgia and its related disorders [^117LpcPB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

This article reviews findings regarding the pathophysiologic abnormalities that contribute to the enhanced pain responses of individuals with fibromyalgia, as well as the relationships between fibromyalgia and commonly co-occurring disorders. Risk factors for fibromyalgia or enhanced pain responses include genetic and family influences, environmental triggers, and abnormal neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system function. These risk factors are also associated with several disorders that frequently co-occur with fibromyalgia, such as major depressive disorder, migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome. Indeed, fibromyalgia and these co-occurring conditions may be part of a group of affective spectrum disorders that share important common, and perhaps heritable, causal factors.

Recent research strongly suggests that alterations in central processing of sensory input also contribute to the cardinal symptoms of fibromyalgia, including persistent widespread pain and enhanced pain sensitivity. Exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors, as well as altered autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine responses, may contribute to alterations in pain perception or pain inhibition. Understanding the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and co-occurring disorders may help clinicians provide the most appropriate treatment to their patients.

### Complement activation profiles predict clinical outcomes in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease [^113cfYSH]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Associations between CFs and demographic and clinical characteristics**: The univariable analysis, shown in eTable 2, examines the association between serum and CSF levels of complement factors (CFs) and clinical features in the whole cohort. Age at sampling was positively associated with serum levels of Ba, C4, C5, and CSF levels of all factors except SC5b9, C3, C4, C5, as well as the C4a/C4 and C5a/C5 ratios. Male patients exhibited higher CSF levels of all CFs except C3, C4, C5, and the C4a/C4 ratio compared to female patients. Serum levels of only three CFs (Bb, C3a, and C4) were elevated in samples collected at acute onset or relapse compared to remission. In terms of clinical presentation, CSF levels of C3a, C4a, and the C3a/C3 ratio showed elevated levels in the SC topography compared to ON. Serum levels of C3, C4, and C5, along with CSF levels of all CFs except C3, C5, and the C4a/C4 ratio, were associated with EDSS at onset (all positively except C4 in CSF). Administration of acute treatment within one month before sampling positively influenced serum levels of C3 and C4, and CSF levels of Ba, Bb, C3a, Factor H, C1q, and the C3/C3a ratio.

- **Serum levels of complement activation products discriminate MOGAD from AQP4-NMOSD and MS**: As illustrated in Figure 1, serum levels of CFs Ba, Bb, C3a, C4a, C5a, SC5b9, C3, and C4 were significantly increased in MOGAD compared to patients with MS. Conversely, Factor I and the C3a/C3 and C4a/C4 ratios decreased in MOGAD compared to patients with MS (p < 0.01). Comparisons between patients with MOGAD and AQP4-NMOSD indicated significantly higher serum levels of C3a, C4a, and the C3a/C3 ratio.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^117HdFMU]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Two members of the working group self-selected out to avoid potential perceived bias (one funder and one pharmaceutical industry representative). The cohort consisted of 27 members, out of which 22 responded, resulting in a response rate of 81.5%. As 81.5% was the highest achievable percentage of agreement for the total cohort, the consensus for each recommendation was categorized based on percentage agreement of the total cohort: high consensus (> 72%), medium (62%–71%), low (51–61%), and less than 51% was deemed to have no consensus. Six recommendations achieved high consensus, whereas 15 had a medium level of consensus.

- **Research recommendations with high or medium stakeholder agreement fell into the following five thematic groups**:
	- Facets of FMS (category 1, n = 5)
	- Aab research (category 2, n = 5)
	- Immunology (category 3, n = 4)
	- Small fibre neuropathy (category 4, n = 2)
	- Clinical interventions and trial design (categories 4 and 5, n = 5)

### Recent insights into C3 glomerulopathy [^1158DFbB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

The complement system comprises over 30 proteins either circulating in plasma and other body fluids or localized to cell membranes. It plays a physiological role in innate immunity and inflammation, leading to the elimination of microbial pathogens, as well as apoptotic host cells and cellular debris. Complement activation occurs via proteolytic cleavage in three pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways (Figure 1). Whereas the activation of the classical pathway usually requires immunoglobulin, alternative pathway (AP) activation occurs spontaneously at a low level in the circulation due to hydrolysis of the internal thioester bond of the C3 molecule, a process known as 'C3 tickover'.
C3 activation generates fragments C3a and C3b, the latter binding complement factor B (Cfb) to form the AP C3 convertase (C3bBb) that amplifies C3 activation in a positive feedback mechanism. The C3b amplification loop, also known as the amplification loop of the complement pathways, is a powerful means through which millions of C3b molecules are generated following the initial activation of C3. The binding of additional C3b molecules to the AP C3 convertase generates a C5 convertase that activates C5, yielding fragments C5a and C5b. C5b initiates terminal pathway activation, resulting in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9). Fragments C3a and C5a, generated through C3 and C5 proteolysis, respectively, are anaphylatoxins.

- **Figure 1**: Complement activation pathways and C3 amplification.

The AP is inhibited by several regulatory proteins present both in the circulation.

### Plasma C4 level was associated with mortality, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications in hemodialysis patients [^111TAYyS]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

In the complement cascades, C4 contributes to the formation of C3 convertase in the classical and lectin pathways. Circulating C4 and C3 mainly derive from hepatocytes and are also related to adipose tissue variables, being involved in the development of visceral adiposity. In healthy individuals, the polymorphism of C4 genes, including the variation of the gene copy number, the gene size, and the C4 isotypes (C4A and C4B), largely determines the plasma levels and functions of C4.

Elevated levels of plasma C4, as well as C3, are reported as strong inflammatory indicators of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, thrombotic diseases, and allergic diseases. During the pathological process, C4 and C4a may play pivotal roles in chronic inflammation and tissue injury, rather than in defending against pathogens and cleaning immune complexes and cells. Elevated systemic C4 and C3 levels are probably correlated with metabolic syndrome, which is proven to raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and all-cause mortality among the general population.

Although our study confirmed the critical impact of plasma C4, plasma C3 levels weren't measured in the analyses. As mentioned, in studies reporting the correlation between C3 and prognosis, plasma C4 levels were not measured. Further investigations are needed to determine the relationship between C3 and C4, and their predictive value for prognosis in patients with maintenance HD.

### Complement regulators in human disease: Lessons from modern genetics [^116KKM8p]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

First identified in human serum in the late 19th century as a 'complement' to antibodies in mediating bacterial lysis, the complement system emerged more than a billion years ago, probably as the first humoral immune system. The contemporary complement system consists of nearly 60 proteins in three activation pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin) and a terminal cytolytic pathway common to all. Modern molecular biology and genetics have not only led to further elucidation of the structure of complement system components but have also revealed function-altering rare variants and common polymorphisms, particularly in regulators of the alternative pathway, that predispose to human disease by creating 'hyperinflammatory complement phenotypes'. To treat these 'complementopathies', a monoclonal antibody against the initiator of the membrane attack complex, C5, has received approval for use. Additional therapeutic reagents are on the horizon.

### Complement system biomarkers in first episode psychosis [^117JpeBP]. Schizophrenia Research (2019). Low credibility.

The complement system is a major effector of innate immunity and an adjuvant of adaptive immunity. It comprises around 30 plasma and cell-surface proteins that interact with one another to induce a series of inflammatory responses involved in defense against infection. Complement is activated via three initiating pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin), all of which converge on a common effector pathway with the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC).

Complement acts through production of:

- **Opsonins**: C3b, iC3b, increasing the ability of macrophages and neutrophils to phagocytose.
- **Anaphylatoxins**: C3a, C5a, inducing local and systemic inflammatory responses, increasing the permeability of blood vessels, and attracting neutrophils.
- **Direct killing of organisms**: By formation of the MAC, which disrupts the phospholipid bilayer of a target cell.

Complement system function is regulated (accelerated or inhibited) by complement regulatory proteins present in fluid-phase or membrane-bound forms.

Dysregulation of the complement system in schizophrenia has been noted in a few small studies, notably increased activation of the classical complement pathway and decreased complement hemolytic activity, indicative of consumption. However, data regarding complement changes are inconsistent, with one study reporting increased plasma levels of C3 and C4, while another described decreased levels of these proteins. This lack of consensus, together with a growing evidence base indicating that complement is involved in brain development, underscores the need for further research into the role of complement in schizophrenia.

### Complement and its breakdown products in SLE [^1173HvmK]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

The complement system has important protective functions in both the innate and the adaptive immune systems but can also, when inappropriately activated, cause tissue damage. Complement deficiency predisposes to infection and to the development of autoimmune diseases, especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Complement is involved in the pathogenesis of SLE, illustrating its dual role. This review discusses various aspects of this dualism. It provides an overview of activation pathways and activation products, describes autoimmunity against complement, and explores the potential of complement regulation in future therapeutics.

### Genome-wide association study for serum complement C3 and C4 levels in healthy Chinese subjects [^1153spzN]. PLoS Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

The complement system is recognized as a pivotal part of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. It has three well-known physiological activities, including host defense against infection, bridging the interface between innate and adaptive immunity, and disposal of waste immune complexes or apoptotic cells. There are approximately 30 serum complement proteins, which can be activated by classical, alternative, and lectin pathways. Among these complement members, C3 and C4 are involved in nearly all physiological activities and activated pathways, exerting their powerful roles as host defense proteins. Their abnormal expression, particularly complement deficiency and dysfunction, is associated with the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. C4 deficiency has also been reported to be associated with SLE, immune complex glomerulonephritis, and viral infections, regardless of ethnic background.

Both serum C3 and C4 levels are heritable traits, even in individuals without immune diseases such as SLE. Recent reports showed that the heritability for serum C3 and C4 is 39.6% and 45.4%, respectively, based on a Bayesian variance components model. Therefore, it is important to identify the genetic loci that influence the serum levels of C3 and C4. In this study, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify novel loci associated with the serum levels of C3 and C4 in a healthy Chinese male population of 3,495 subjects.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^114HCeWg]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Although not specific to Aab research, stakeholders considered the design of clinical trials. One consideration was that side effect profiles for any immunological drug trials addressing Aab mechanisms would differ from currently used drugs, and trial designs would need to address this.

There was high consensus that primary endpoints for interventional trials in FMS should reflect patients' multi-dimensional experiences. These often include symptoms such as cold sensitivity, pressure sensitivity, emotional distress, and fatigue, rather than solely focusing on perceived pain intensity. Stakeholders discussed how this consensus could best be reconciled with traditional recommendations of using pain intensity as the primary outcome for pain-condition trials. A discussion within the worldwide research community was suggested as important.

It was agreed that FMS interventional trial designs should generally be co-created both with patients and interdisciplinary professionals.

Stakeholders agreed that research into decision making by people with FMS about their participation in interventional trials would be important. The aim would be to employ methods that truly empower patients in their decision making, particularly in the context of drugs which can have serious adverse effects.

"Placebo-dread" may affect trial recruitment and outcomes in FMS trials, where patients fear that reporting a good improvement in their symptoms may later be interpreted as being "all in their head" if randomized to placebo. This may be particularly important in investigator-led trials.

### Intravenously applied IgG stimulates complement attenuation in a complement-dependent autoimmune disease at the amplifying C3 convertase level [^112HB7B3]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Intravenously applied normal human immunoglobulin G (IgG) exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Systemic inflammation can originate from an overreactive amplification loop of the complement system. In blood, C3b2-containing complexes maintain complement amplification more effectively than the extremely short-lived C3b. Therefore, in patients with the complement-dependent autoimmune disease, dermatomyositis, we investigated whether intravenously applied normal human IgG (IVIG) stimulated in vivo inactivation of these complexes. During IVIG treatment, clinically effective in 6 of 8 patients, the concentration of C3b2-containing complexes dropped to 37% ± 14% (n = 6) of the pretreatment level when 0.5 g IgG/kg body weight was infused, increasing marginally and in parallel to factor Bb thereafter until full-dose IgG was infused. By day 14 following infusion of 2 g IgG/kg body weight, the concentration of C3b2-containing complexes was 66% ± 19%. The plasma concentration of C3 remained constant in myopathic patients or increased by 15% to 20% in amyopathic patients. In contrast, IVIG infusion was associated with a consumption of up to 40% of plasma C4 at day 1 to 2 after completion of IVIG infusion. Thus, IVIG had an immediate and long-lasting attenuating effect on complement amplification in vivo despite inducing classical complement pathway activation.

### Efficacy and safety of atacicept in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: Results of a twenty-four-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, phase IIb study [^1142pfhL]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Levels of biomarkers**: In patients with low levels of serum complement C3 (n = 101) or C4 (n = 56) at baseline, atacicept at either dosage led to a steady increase in serum C3 or C4 levels, respectively, from week 4 until week 24, while in the placebo group, the levels remained similar to baseline throughout the treatment period. At week 24, the median percentage increase in the serum C3 levels compared with baseline (treatment day 1) was 5.3% with atacicept 75 mg and 22.1% with atacicept 150 mg versus 1.5% with placebo. The median percentage increase in the serum C4 level was 64.5% with atacicept 75 mg and 128.6% with atacicept 150 mg. In patients with a low C3 and/or C4 level at baseline (n = 109), a normalized C3 and C4 level at week 24 was achieved in 52.6% and 30.6% taking atacicept 150 mg and 75 mg, respectively, versus 17.1% taking placebo.

- **Changes in serum biomarkers over time**: The median percentage change from baseline over 24 weeks is shown for serum complement C3 levels (C3‐low patients), serum complement C4 levels (C4‐low patients), anti-double‐stranded DNA antibody levels (anti‐dsDNA antibody–positive patients), and serum IgG levels.

In patients with anti‐dsDNA antibodies at baseline (n = 147), both atacicept dosages reduced anti‐dsDNA antibody levels over time. At week 24, the median percentage change versus baseline was –23.6% with atacicept 75 mg and –28.2% with atacicept 150 mg. Anti‐dsDNA antibody levels increased by a median of 16.0% with placebo treatment.

### Peripheral immune markers and antipsychotic non-response in psychosis [^112dtj4c]. Schizophrenia Research (2021). Low credibility.

The role of the complement system, a component of the immune response, in the pathophysiology of treatment-resistant schizophrenia is largely unknown. While serum levels of C3 and C4 are increased in drug-free patients with established schizophrenia, serum levels of C3 are decreased in medicated patients with established schizophrenia. This suggests a possible effect of antipsychotic treatment on these markers. Moreover, abnormal peripheral levels of complement proteins such as C1, C1q, C2, C3, C4, and the terminal complement complex (TCC) have been reported in patients with schizophrenia or first-episode psychosis.

Research focusing on the association between complement markers and the severity of symptoms has reported a positive association between serum levels of C3 and C4 and two items from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) negative symptom scale. These items refer to active social avoidance and deficient attention, but there were no associations between complement markers and PANSS positive symptoms. Our recent paper, in a small sample of patients with first-episode psychosis, showed increased C4 levels in patients with worse clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up when compared with those showing an improvement and overall better treatment response.

Some studies on established schizophrenia have also suggested that abnormal levels of peripheral cytokines may be linked to the severity of negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. Increased levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-3, and IL-18 have been associated with more severe PANSS negative symptoms.

### Understanding the role of the complement system in insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^114KJXxr]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

The complement system has been associated with the etiopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are prevalent among patients with RA. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between a comprehensive evaluation of the complement system and IR, as well as MetS, in patients with RA.

A total of 339 nondiabetic patients with RA were recruited. Functional assays of the three complement pathways were assessed. Additionally, serum levels of the following individual components of the complement system were measured: C1q (classical); lectin (lectin); C2, C4, and C4b (classical lectin); factor D and properdin (alternative); C3 and C3a (common); C5, C5a, and C9 (terminal); as well as the factor I and C1 inhibitor regulators. IR and β cell function indices were calculated using the homeostatic model assessment. Criteria for MetS were applied. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between the complement system and IR in patients with RA.

Many elements of the upstream and common complement pathways, but not the functional tests of the three routes, correlated positively with higher levels of IR and β cell function. However, after multivariable adjustment for factors associated with IR, these relationships were lost. Conversely, the presence of MetS in patients with RA maintained a relationship with higher levels of C1q, C4, C3, properdin, and factor I after adjusting for confounders.

There is a positive correlation between the complement system and insulin resistance in patients with RA. However, further investigation is needed to fully understand these interactions.

### Complement classical pathway components are all important in clearance of apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells [^116kkFCK]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Inherited deficiencies in components of the classical complement pathway are strong disease susceptibility factors for the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with a hierarchy among deficiency states; the strongest association is with C1q deficiency. We investigated the relative importance of the different complement pathways regarding the clearance of apoptotic cells.

Phagocytosis of labeled apoptotic Jurkat cells by monocyte-derived macrophages in the presence of sera from individuals with complement deficiencies was studied, as well as C3 deposition on apoptotic cells using flow cytometry. Sera from individuals deficient in C1q, C4, C2, or C3 all showed decreased phagocytosis. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and the alternative pathway did not influence phagocytosis. Notably, the components of the complement classical pathway, including C1q, were equally important in the clearance of apoptotic cells.

This indicates that deposition of C3 fragments is of major significance; we therefore studied C3 deposition on apoptotic cells. Experiments with MBL-deficient serum depleted of C1q or factor D confirmed the predominance of the classical pathway. At low dilution, sera deficient in C1q, C4, or C2 supported C3 fragment deposition, demonstrating alternative pathway activation.

In conclusion, we have found that complement-mediated opsonization and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, particularly those undergoing secondary necrosis, are dependent mainly upon an intact classical pathway. The alternative pathway is less important but may play a role in some conditions.

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia [^1148MUVn]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia has a distinct pathophysiology involving the central amplification of peripheral sensory signals. Core symptoms include chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Most patients with fibromyalgia experience muscle pain and tenderness, forgetfulness or problems concentrating, and significant functional limitations. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed using an updated set of clinical criteria that no longer rely on tender point examination; however, laboratory testing may rule out other disorders that commonly present with fatigue, such as anemia and thyroid disease. Patients with fibromyalgia should be evaluated for comorbid functional pain syndromes and mood disorders.

Management of fibromyalgia should include patient education, symptom relief, and regular aerobic physical activity. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and muscle relaxants have the strongest evidence of benefit for improving pain, fatigue, sleep symptoms, and quality of life. Multiple complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been used but have limited evidence of effectiveness. Opioids should be used to relieve pain in carefully selected patients only if alternative therapies are ineffective.

### Narrative review: The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia [^112dUPwt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Primary fibromyalgia is a common yet poorly understood syndrome characterized by diffuse chronic pain accompanied by other somatic symptoms, including poor sleep, fatigue, and stiffness, in the absence of disease. Fibromyalgia does not have a distinct cause or pathology. Nevertheless, in the past decade, the study of chronic pain has yielded new insights into the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and related chronic pain disorders. Accruing evidence shows that patients with fibromyalgia experience pain differently from the general population because of dysfunctional pain processing in the central nervous system. Aberrant pain processing, which can result in chronic pain and associated symptoms, may be the result of several interplaying mechanisms, including central sensitization, blunting of inhibitory pain pathways, alterations in neurotransmitters, and psychiatric comorbid conditions. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms currently thought to be partly responsible for the chronic diffuse pain typical of fibromyalgia.

### Fibromyalgia pain: Do we know the source [^114oSMjr]? Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain condition of unknown origin. Multiple abnormalities have been described, including peripheral tissue and central nervous system changes. The relation of these mechanisms, however, is likely bidirectional. FMS pain clearly depends on peripheral nociceptive input as well as abnormal central pain processing. This review focuses on the role of peripheral nociceptive input for pain in FMS.

- **Recent findings**: There is strong evidence for abnormal central pain processing in FMS. Sensitized spinal cord neurons in the dorsal horn are responsible for augmented pain processing of nociceptive signals from the periphery. In addition, glial activation, possibly by cytokines and excitatory amino acids, may play a role in the initiation and perpetuation of this sensitized state.

- **Summary**: Nociceptive input clearly plays an important role in FMS. Acute or repetitive tissue injury has been associated with FMS pain. Cytokines related to such injuries may be responsible for long-term activation of spinal cord glia and dorsal horn neurons, thus resulting in central sensitization. A better understanding of these important neuro-immune interactions may provide relevant insights into future effective therapies.

### Data-independent LC-MS/MS analysis of ME/CFS plasma reveals a dysregulated coagulation system, endothelial dysfunction, downregulation of complement machinery [^115u41jx]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Results**: The demographics of the participant groups are contained within Table 1, along with the symptom severity score averages of the ME/CFS population. A portion of the ME/CFS cohort presents with symptoms and comorbidities that are intimately associated with ME/CFS, specifically gastrointestinal issues (6/15 participants), orthostatic symptoms (5/15 participants), and fibromyalgia (3/15 participants). Proteomics data from the analysis of control (n = 10) and ME/CFS (n = 15) PPP using Skyline is represented in Table 2, and the total ion chromatogram (TIC) is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 2 is a representation of the quality plots for all proteins/peptides across the three m/z ranges, obtained from MSstatsShiny.

Our experiment indicates that 24 proteins are significantly increased in the ME/CFS group compared to the controls, and 21 proteins are significantly downregulated. However, only a select few hold strong statistical significance. These will be presented and discussed, while the other identified protein data can be perused in Supplementary Material 1. In some cases, only a limited number of peptides from a protein are significant, which may reflect regulated peptides or be related to the number of ions entering the mass spectrometer at a given time point. The transitions for proteins detected by a single peptide are contained within Supplementary Material 2.

### Testing the activity of complement convertases in serum/plasma for diagnosis of C4NeF-mediated C3 glomerulonephritis [^116ZVSbV]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

The complement system, an essential component of innate immunity, may be activated by three distinct pathways: classical, lectin, and alternative. The classical and lectin pathways are triggered by specific stimuli, such as antibodies on cell surfaces or pathogen-associated sugar moieties. In contrast, the alternative pathway maintains constant low-level activity, with further propagation contingent on the absence of endogenous complement inhibitors. Complement convertases, crucial elements in the cascade, are tightly regulated by these inhibitors. In the absence of regulation, convertases facilitate the production of opsonins and anaphylatoxins, and they initiate membrane attack complex formation to lyse target cells.

Under normal physiological conditions, convertase activity peaks rapidly after pathway initiation — within seconds or minutes, depending on complement availability — and declines subsequently due to spontaneous decay, inhibitor action, and C3b and C4b proteolysis by factor I. Various methods of complement activation correlate with the risk of autoinflammatory diseases resulting from inappropriate or uncontrolled complement attacks. Loss of regulation within the alternative pathway alone can trigger pathological events. For the classical and lectin pathways, analogous conditions require a pathway-specific stimulus on self cells. Notably, mutations in alternative pathway components are well-recognized causes of pathological manifestations.

### Relationship of selective complement markers with schizophrenia [^116W9oMF]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2022). Low credibility.

Immune system dysregulation may be involved in schizophrenia, but biomarker studies have thus far reported inconsistent findings. The relationship of plasma levels of complement markers C3 and C4 with schizophrenia, sociodemographic, and clinico-psychological factors were studied in 183 patients and 212 controls. C3 and C4 levels were significantly higher in the patients and in subjects with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.05). Schizophrenia, BMI, and CRP were significant predictors for C3 and C4 levels in multivariate analyses (p < 0.001). In conclusion, complements C3 and C4 are potential peripheral biomarkers in schizophrenia.

### Genome-wide association study for serum complement C3 and C4 levels in healthy Chinese subjects [^112Xukvp]. PLoS Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Complement C3 and C4 play key roles in the main physiological activities of the complement system, and their deficiencies or overexpression are associated with many clinical infectious or immunity diseases. A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed for serum levels of C3 and C4. The first stage was conducted in 1,999 healthy Chinese men, and the second stage was performed in an additional 1,496 subjects.

We identified two SNPs, rs3753394 in the CFH gene and rs3745567 in the C3 gene, that are significantly associated with serum C3 levels at a genome-wide significance level (P = 7.33×10⁻¹¹ and P = 1.83×10⁻⁹, respectively). For C4, one large genomic region on chromosome 6p21.3 is significantly associated with serum C4 levels. Two SNPs (rs1052693 and rs11575839) were located in the MHC class I area that includes HLA-A, HLA-C, and HLA-B genes. Two SNPs (rs2075799 and rs2857009) were located 5′ and 3′ of the C4 gene. The other four SNPs, rs2071278, rs3763317, rs9276606, and rs241428, were located in the MHC class II region, which includes HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB, and HLA-DQB genes. The combined P-values for those eight SNPs ranged from 3.19×10⁻²² to 5.62×10⁻⁹⁷.

HBsAg-positive subjects have significantly lower C3 and C4 protein concentrations compared with HBsAg-negative subjects (P < 0.05). Our study is the first GWAS report that shows genetic components influence the levels of complement C3 and C4. Our significant findings provide novel insights into their related autoimmune, infectious diseases, and molecular mechanisms.

### Shedding light on the role of complement C4 activation in cancer [^114aHcs7]. Human Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Complement C4 is a key component in the activation of classical and lectin complement pathways, which are observed in both animal tumor models and cancer patients. While its role in autoimmune disorders has been extensively studied, the functions of complement C4 and its activation in cancer have received inadequate consideration. Recent studies have detected C4 activation in animal tumor models and cancer patients, with its fragment C4d found in cancer tissues and lymph nodes. Elevated C4d levels could be a useful biomarker for detecting various cancers.

This review aims to summarize recent developments on the role of complement C4 activation in promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby supporting tumor progression and metastasis; C4d as a biomarker; and its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy. We also conduct a critical evaluation of methods used to measure complement C4 and its activation products, highlighting possible pitfalls and areas for improvement in existing research.

### Autoimmune screening panel in patients with multiple sclerosis: A Vienna multiple sclerosis database study [^111DGgGo]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The most common findings were abnormal levels of complement C3c or C4. This, however, is not particularly surprising, as previous studies have already established a link between increased complement factor activity and MS pathology as well as disease activity and/or progression. As such, a derangement of complement levels could be interpreted as a mechanism compatible with MS pathophysiology and would therefore not constitute a viable screening parameter to allow excluding or differentiating other autoimmune disorders. This is particularly evident in this study's findings, because among 31 patients with abnormal complement concentrations, only one was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease (SS).

Among antibody screening results in our cohort, ANA was most commonly positive. Again, these results were to be expected, as the seroprevalence of ANA varies significantly but is consistently high in both healthy individuals as well as in patients with nonrheumatic disorders, with positive results reported in 26.7%–63.5% of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). In contrast, in our study, only 11.4% of pwMS tested positive for ANA, a rate that rather approximates the seroprevalence observed in the general "healthy" population. Due to a lack of specificity and sensitivity, the Canadian Rheumatology Association specifically advised against using ANA testing as a general screening tool for patients who do not exhibit specific signs or symptoms indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or another connective tissue disease (CTD). Additionally, Becker et al. reported that although ANA titers were frequently elevated among various screening panel parameters.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^114DVpFo]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Recent findings of pain-sensitizing IgG autoantibodies (Aab) in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) have opened a new field of research, with questions extending across a wide range of areas. In this focused research priority setting exercise, stakeholders from diverse professional backgrounds and regions, including funders, relatives, and patients with FMS, agreed on a set of research recommendations. These proposed research areas might be pursued by interested researchers and funders worldwide.

Stakeholders concurred that confirming Aab's contribution to the cause of FMS would be a transformative finding for this field. It would also represent a revolutionary advance that should dispel the stigma often perceived by patients due to a lack of understanding.

Ensuring that research is focused on improving FMS management and is translatable to a clinical context will be critical to enhancing the quality of life for this historically under-managed patient cohort.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^117TCReh]. Pain Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is the most common chronic widespread pain condition in rheumatology. Until recently, no clear pathophysiological mechanism for fibromyalgia had been established, resulting in management challenges. Recent research has indicated that serum immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) may play a role in FMS. We undertook a research prioritization exercise to identify the most pertinent research approaches that may lead to clinically implementable outputs.

- **Methods**: Research priority setting was conducted in five phases: situation analysis, design, expert group consultation, interim recommendations, and consultation and revision. A dialogue model was used and an international multi-stakeholder expert group was invited. Clinical, patient, industry, funder, and scientific expertise was represented throughout. Recommendation consensus was determined via a voluntary closed eSurvey. Reporting guidelines for the priority setting of health research were employed to support implementation and maximize impact.

- **Results**: Arising from the expert group consultation (29 participants), 39 interim recommendations were defined. A response rate of 81.5% was achieved in the consensus survey. Six recommendations were identified as high priority and 15 as medium-level priority. The recommendations range from aspects of fibromyalgia features that should be considered in future autoantibody research, to specific immunological investigations, suggestions for trial design in FMS, and therapeutic interventions that should be assessed in trials.

By applying these principles, the recommendations aim to enhance the understanding and management of FMS through targeted research efforts.

### Rheumatic syndromes associated with complement deficiency [^114gHhVg]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Deficiency of an early component of the classical complement pathway, such as C1q, C1r/C1s, C4, or C2, regularly produces autoimmunity in humans, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus. It has long been suggested that disruption of this pathway would lead to inappropriate handling of immune complexes. An intriguing hypothesis that builds on this idea pertains to a defect in the clearance of one's own cellular debris, namely apoptotic cells. An appealing aspect of this emerging concept is that blebs on apoptotic cells are adorned with antigens to which much of the autoantibody specificity is directed in systemic lupus erythematosus.

A second hypothesis, primarily generated from complement deficiencies, relates to an impairment in the humoral immune response or the regulation of autoreactive B cells. This review begins by summarizing the recognized autoimmune manifestations of complement deficiency and then describes new data derived from targeted gene deletions of complement proteins.

### Multibiomarker disease activity score and C-reactive protein in a cross-sectional observational study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis with and without concomitant fibromyalgia [^115ieFhE]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether the multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) score distinguished between clinically discernible levels of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity when C-reactive protein (CRP) was low, swollen joint count (SJC) results were analyzed for the 184 patients with CRP ≤ 1.0 mg/dl. SJC was chosen as a comparator because, lacking imaging data, it was the most objective non-blood test indicator of synovitis available.

The distributions of SJC increased across the low, moderate, and high categories of MBDA score, showing statistically significant correlation. Univariate negative binomial regression analyses, using ordinal scores for MBDA score or CRP, demonstrated that SJC was significantly related to the MBDA score, but not to CRP. The association between SJC and MBDA scores remained similar regardless of adjustment for BMI (regression coefficient = 0.52, P = 0.004) or without it (regression coefficient = 0.45, P = 0.004). Multivariate negative binomial regression using ordinal scores demonstrated that the MBDA score was significantly associated with SJC after controlling for CRP (P = 0.021), but CRP was not associated with SJC after controlling for MBDA score (P = 0.847). Similar results were obtained with regression analyses using continuous scales for both MBDA score and CRP. These results indicate that, among patients with CRP ≤ 1.0 mg/dl, elevated MBDA scores were independently associated with RA disease activity, as measured with SJC, but CRP was not.

### Complement C3 is a risk factor for the development of diabetes: A population-based cohort study [^113wZFpd]. Diabetes (2005). Low credibility.

Cross-sectional studies have reported strong correlations between plasma levels of complement C3, insulin, and glucose. This prospective study explored whether elevated levels of C3, C4, and other inflammation-sensitive plasma proteins (ISPs), including fibrinogen, orosomucoid, alpha1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, and ceruloplasmin, are associated with the development of diabetes. Plasma proteins were measured in 2,815 nondiabetic healthy men aged 38–50 years, who were reexamined following a mean follow-up of 6.1 years. The development of diabetes (n = 123) was studied in relation to baseline levels of plasma proteins.

After adjusting for age, screening year, and baseline glucose levels, the odds ratio (95% CI) for developing diabetes was 1.00, 2.4 (1.1–5.3), 2.9 (1.4–6.0), and 5.6 (2.8–10.9) for men with C3 in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles, respectively (trend: P < 0.00001). Fibrinogen, haptoglobin, C4, and the number of elevated ISPs were also related to future diabetes in this model.

Only C3 was significantly associated with diabetes development after further adjustments for potential confounders, including BMI, insulin, and other inflammatory markers. We concluded that the risk of developing diabetes is related to levels of complement C3.

### Recognizing and diagnosing fibromyalgia [^1139Qtkb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia affects an estimated 2% of the American population. It is understood as a neurologic disorder of central pain processing that causes the perception of pain in response to stimuli that would not be painful in healthy individuals. The recognition of fibromyalgia can lead to effective treatment with significant improvement in functioning. Unfortunately, due to the chronic nature of the pain condition and associated counterproductive behaviors and disability, patients and physicians may quickly become frustrated with each other and abandon the pursuit of adequate diagnosis and treatment.

If the physician instead recognizes the diagnostic pattern of pain and appreciates the real nature of the underlying pathology, then he or she can be of great benefit to patients and their families in managing this chronic disease.

### Evidence of central inflammation in fibromyalgia-increased cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-8 levels [^112gE5Yp]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2012). Low credibility.

Activation of glia cells resulting in intrathecal elevation of cytokines and chemokines has been hypothesized in chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia. To our knowledge, this is the first study assessing intrathecal concentrations of pro-inflammatory substances in fibromyalgia. We report elevated cerebrospinal fluid and serum concentrations of interleukin-8, but not interleukin-1beta, in FM patients. This profile is in accordance with FM symptoms being mediated by sympathetic activity rather than dependent on prostaglandin-associated mechanisms and supports the hypothesis of glia cell activation in response to pain mechanisms.

### Serum complement C3/C4 ratio, a novel marker for recurrent cardiovascular events [^111HBpnQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome is an inflammatory disease during which the complement cascade is activated. We assessed the complement C3 and C4 concentration ratio (C3/C4 ratio) in serum as a potential measurement to predict cardiovascular attacks. Patients with acute coronary syndrome (n = 148) were followed after an initial attack for subsequent ischemic cardiovascular events, defined as a composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or stroke. During the follow-up period (average 555 days), 44 patients met an endpoint. Blood samples were taken at hospitalization, 1 week, 3 months, and 1 year after hospital admission. Serum complement C3 and C4 concentrations and the C3/C4 ratio were analyzed.

Patients reaching an endpoint consistently had a higher C3/C4 ratio throughout the follow-up period compared to those without these endpoints (repeated measures analysis of variance, p = 0.007). When all traditional cardiovascular risk factors and other potential confounding factors were considered in a Cox multivariate logistic regression survival analysis, the C3/C4 ratio emerged as a novel risk factor for any new cardiovascular event (odds ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.63, p = 0.007). When the C3/C4 ratio was divided into four quartiles, 24% of patients in quartiles 1 and 2 (lowest) and 48% in quartile 4 (highest) had endpoints during the follow-up (odds ratio 3.04, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 7.29, p = 0.01).

In conclusion, an increased serum C3/C4 ratio is a readily available and novel marker for recurrent cardiovascular events in acute coronary syndrome.

### Medical records-based genetic studies of the complement system [^116pGYpg]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Genetic variants in complement genes have been associated with a wide range of human disease states, but well-powered genetic association studies of complement activation have not been performed in large multiethnic cohorts.

- **Methods**: We performed medical records-based genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies for plasma C3 and C4 levels among participants of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network.

- **Results**: In a GWAS for C3 levels in 3,949 individuals, we detected two genome-wide significant loci: chr.1q31.3 (CFH locus; rs3753396-A; β = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.25; P = 1.52x10^-11) and chr.19p13.3 (C3 locus; rs11569470-G; β = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.24; P = 1.29x10^-8). These two loci explained approximately 2% of variance in C3 levels. GWAS for C4 levels involved 3,998 individuals and revealed a genome-wide significant locus at chr.6p21.32 (C4 locus; rs3135353-C; β = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.45; P = 4.58x10^-35). This locus explained approximately 13% of variance in C4 levels. The multiallelic copy number variant analysis defined two structural genomic C4 variants with large effect on blood C4 levels: C4-BS (β = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.30; P = 2.98x10^-22) and C4-AL-BS (β = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.29; P = 8.11x10^-23). Overall, C4 levels were strongly correlated with copy numbers of C4A and C4B genes. In comprehensive phenome-wide association studies involving 102,138 eMERGE participants, we cataloged a full spectrum of autoimmune, cardiometabolic, and kidney diseases genetically related to systemic complement activation.

- **Conclusions**: The study highlights the significant genetic loci associated with C3 and C4 levels, establishing a genetic basis for complement system involvement in various diseases.

### The evolving landscape for complement therapeutics in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases [^1111cqeR]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The complement system is increasingly understood to play major roles in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Due to this understanding, there are rapidly expanding commercial efforts to develop novel complement inhibitors and effector pathway-modulating drugs.

This review provides insights into the evolving understanding of complement system components, mechanisms of activation within and across the three pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin), how these pathways are normally controlled, and how they become dysregulated in target tissues. Additionally, it addresses what diseases are known to be largely complement-dependent through the successful development and approval of complement therapeutics in patients.

- **Mechanisms of complement activation**: Mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and thrombotic microangiopathies are illustrated.
- **Therapeutic drugs**: Specific therapeutic drugs that are both approved and under development are discussed in the context of both nonrheumatic and rheumatic diseases.
- **Assessment methods**: Methods by which the complement system can be assessed in humans through biomarker studies are outlined, with the goal of understanding how the system is functioning in specific patients.

### Genome-wide association study for serum complement C3 and C4 levels in healthy Chinese subjects [^111ZBXSc]. PLoS Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Complement C3 and C4 play key roles in the main physiological activities of the complement system, and their deficiencies or overexpression are associated with many clinical infectious or immune diseases. A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed for serum levels of C3 and C4. The first stage was conducted in 1,999 healthy Chinese men, and the second stage was performed in an additional 1,496 subjects.

We identified two SNPs, rs3753394 in the CFH gene and rs3745567 in the C3 gene, that are significantly associated with serum C3 levels at a genome-wide significance level (P = 7.33 × 10^(-11) and P = 1.83 × 10^(-9), respectively). For C4, one large genomic region on chromosome 6p21.3 is significantly associated with serum C4 levels. Two SNPs, rs1052693 and rs11575839, were located in the MHC class I area that includes HLA-A, HLA-C, and HLA-B genes. Two SNPs, rs2075799 and rs2857009, were located 5' and 3' of the C4 gene. The other four SNPs, rs2071278, rs3763317, rs9276606, and rs241428, were located in the MHC class II region that includes HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB, and HLA-DQB genes. The combined P-values for these eight SNPs ranged from 3.19 × 10^(-22) to 5.62 × 10^(-97).

HBsAg-positive subjects have significantly lower C3 and C4 protein concentrations compared with HBsAg-negative subjects (P < 0.05). Our study is the first GWAS report to show that genetic components influence the levels of complement C3 and C4. Our significant findings provide novel insights into their related autoimmune and infectious diseases, as well as their molecular mechanisms.

### Genome-wide association study for serum complement C3 and C4 levels in healthy Chinese subjects [^113ZSQr9]. PLoS Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Some confounding factors, such as age, smoking, BMI, and hsCRP, are predictive of the C3 or C4 levels. However, the most significant covariate for C3 is the BMI (P = 2.88×10⁻⁷), and age for C4 (P = 5.56×10⁻¹¹) in our multivariate linear model, which also included novel SNPs identified in this study. Together, these variables could explain more than 90% of the variance of the C4 level (R² > 0.90). Serum levels of high-sensitivity chronic reactive protein (hsCRP), which is a potential confounder for the acute phase reactants C3 and C4 protein, were also available in our dataset. Further adjustment of hsCRP revealed similar results.

Considering the high infection rate of hepatitis B virus in the general Chinese population and its potential influence on complements, we carried out an interaction analysis of infection-by-genotype. Although both the C3 and C4 levels in the HBsAg positive group were significantly lower than the negative group in the combined 3,495 subjects (1.09 ± 0.21 vs. 1.18 ± 0.34 for C3 and 0.32 ± 0.09 vs. 0.34 ± 0.10 for C4, P < 0.05), the potential cause could be that the synthesis ability of complements was still normal in the liver organ.

In summary, through a two-stage GWAS of 3,495 healthy Chinese male subjects, we identified that CFH and C3 loci were significantly associated with serum level of C3, and a ∼2 Mb loci on the 6p21.3 region was significantly associated with seru…

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^1159dFP8]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The research recommendation process was conducted in five phases:

- **Situation analysis**: Conducted by the convenors to define the scope.
- **Design phase**: Included stakeholder engagement, protocol development, and defining decision-making criteria.
- **Expert group consultation**: This phase consisted of a two-day face-to-face workshop of invited multidisciplinary researchers, clinicians, and people living with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The workshop was facilitated by the research charity funders.
- **Interim recommendations**: Arising from the workshop, these were prepared and shared with the stakeholders who had attended the meeting. Stakeholders were invited to critically assess these recommendations, which were reviewed in an iterative manner until consensus was reached.
- **Consultation and revision**: After two iterative rounds, an anonymous e-survey was conducted to ascertain levels of stakeholder agreement.

The stakeholder group consisted of 29 individuals (16 male, 13 female), of whom 25 also took part in the face-to-face workshop. This group included patients (n = 2) and caregivers (n = 1). One of the participating patients had previously received specific research review training from VA and had experience as a "patient insight partner" for pain-related research. The group provided a broad mix of clinical and scientific skills and experiences.

### Complement dysregulation and Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome [^117FRtBM]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Low credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of immune dysregulation and chronic inflammatory diseases in Down syndrome (DS), there are remarkably few studies investigating the role of complement, a key driver of inflammation. Some studies have shown the presence of complement proteins in DS brains; a few have explored levels of individual complement proteins in small numbers of DS plasma samples. We conducted an in-depth analysis of components, regulators, and activation products encompassing the classical, alternative, and terminal pathways of complement in adults with DS versus euploid controls. Further, we examined whether dementia or APOE ε4 genotype affected complement protein levels in DS.

The classical pathway, predominantly triggered by immune complexes, was first linked to DS in 1993. Circulating C1q-binding immune complexes were present in plasma from 70% of individuals with DS but only 10% of controls. The demonstration of C1q immunoreactivity with Aβ plaques in DS brains implicated complement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in older adults with DS. Studies of plasma proteome changes in children and adolescents with DS, measured using mass spectrometry, identified evidence of complement consumption, including decreased levels of C1q subunit A. In contrast, we found that plasma levels of C1q, the trigger for activation of the classical pathway, were significantly elevated in adults with DS compared to matched controls (mean 191 vs. 110 μg/ml). The reasons for this marked increase are unclear. C1q levels are modulated by inflammatory cytokines, and plasma C1q levels are elevated in chronic infection states.
