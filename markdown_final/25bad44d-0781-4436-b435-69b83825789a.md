## Question

fix mistakes: DIltiezam
bumex 1mg tablet
apixaban 2.5mg BID

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to fix mistakes in medication names and dosing details, while standardizing three entries: a misspelled diltiazem, a "bumex 1mg tablet" entry, and an "apixaban 2.5mg BID" entry. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct identification and spelling of the agents. Then, I should verify labeled names, indications, and formulations from authoritative sources. Next, I will standardize dose-route-frequency formatting and ensure indication specificity for apixaban. Finally, I must add safety, interaction, and documentation best-practice considerations with supporting citations from FDA SPLs and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the first error: "DIltiezam" is not a recognized medication name, and the intended agent is almost certainly Diltiazem, a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with immediate- and extended-release oral formulations and IV preparations, marketed under brands such as Cardizem and Tiazac, used for angina and rate control in atrial arrhythmias, so correcting to "Diltiazem" is appropriate based on SPL listings of diltiazem hydrochloride and ER products and their labeled indications for angina and rate control in atrial arrhythmias [^117TUEcx] [^1122sdUL].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical context so I don't overstate the indication wording; although labels may say "treatment" in AF, the role of diltiazem is rate control rather than rhythm conversion, and I need to ensure key cautions are preserved such as bradycardia risk with beta-blockers or digoxin, AV block, and hypotension, as well as the availability of IV bolus and infusion dosing for acute control which supports the identification and confirms the agent identity and use-case [^114VXSkv] [^117TUEcx] [^113KHvf7].

> Next, I will examine the second entry, "bumex 1mg tablet"; hold on, "Bumex" is a brand and it is acceptable in informal notes, but for safety and clarity the generic-first convention is better, so I should correct it to "Bumetanide 1 mg tablet (Bumex)" and standardize the case and spacing, since bumetanide is the generic name and is the loop diuretic corresponding to Bumex [^114QvYqh].

> I should double-check pharmacology and safety to ensure the correction also conveys clinical meaning; bumetanide is a potent loop diuretic roughly equivalent to 40 mg of furosemide per 1 mg, indicated for edema in heart failure, hepatic disease, or renal disease, with important contraindications such as anuria, severe electrolyte depletion, and hepatic coma, and notable adverse reactions including hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, and rare severe skin reactions, which reinforces the need to document it precisely to avoid look-alike or dose confusion errors [^116TLQPr] [^116Ly2dc] [^111ztW5r].

> Now, I will validate "apixaban 2.5mg BID"; my initial impression is that the dose can be correct, but wait, let me verify the indication-dependence and reduction criteria, because 2.5 mg twice daily is not the universal dose and is reserved for specific scenarios such as AF patients meeting at least two of the following: age 80 years or older, weight 60 kg or less, or serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or greater, and is also used for post-operative VTE prophylaxis and extended secondary prevention after treatment completion, so I should ensure the entry specifies the indication and route as "Apixaban 2.5 mg PO BID" with indication context [^113iMMcA].

> Hold on, I should review the full dosing spectrum to avoid an incomplete recommendation; for primary VTE treatment, apixaban requires 10 mg PO BID for 7 days followed by 5 mg PO BID, not 2.5 mg BID, whereas for post-orthopedic prophylaxis after knee or hip replacement 2.5 mg PO BID is appropriate for 12 days and 35 days respectively, and for extended secondary prevention after at least 6 months of treatment 2.5 mg PO BID is evidence-based and FDA-labeled, all of which confirms that "2.5 mg BID" is correct only if paired with the right indication and timing in therapy [^111cJHZg] [^112G7Uhf] [^113PJ11K] [^111z5ptX] [^112svMyJ].

> I should confirm evidentiary support in the pivotal trials for extended therapy, because if I recommend 2.5 mg BID without context it could be misapplied; AMPLIFY established the treatment-phase regimen and AMPLIFY-EXT established 2.5 mg BID efficacy for extended prevention with low major bleeding, which substantiates using 2.5 mg BID after the initial 6 to 12 months of treatment have been completed in appropriate patients [^113CuUEV] [^116bGtqJ].

> But wait, what if the chart implied off-label contexts such as cancer-associated thrombosis prevention or HIT; I need to flag that the references list off-label uses and dose patterns, including 2.5 mg BID prevention in certain cancer contexts and HIT treatment schedules, so documentation should explicitly state "off-label" and include the clinical rationale and risk–benefit discussion if those are intended, rather than implying standard labeling [^1164YjGr] [^113twkQs] [^116fuqfx].

> I will now compile the corrected entries in a standardized, generic-first format with dose, route, and frequency, and I should include the brand parenthetically where helpful for recognition; the final entries read as: Diltiazem, Bumetanide 1 mg tablet (Bumex), and Apixaban 2.5 mg PO BID with the indication specified in the order to avoid ambiguity, which aligns with SPL nomenclature and minimizes look-alike risk and dosing errors [^112y5Rib] [^116TLQPr] [^1125jo7v].

> Let me think about key safety hooks that should accompany these corrections; for diltiazem I should note AV block and hypotension contraindications and bradycardia risk when combined with beta-blockers or digoxin, for bumetanide I should ensure electrolyte monitoring and contraindication in anuria or hepatic coma, and for apixaban I should highlight bleeding risk, avoidance in Child-Pugh C, interactions with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors, and the availability and limitations of andexanet alfa for life-threatening bleeding reversal, so appropriate CDS alerts can be leveraged in the EHR [^114VXSkv] [^114QvYqh] [^113yKNr7] [^1138Kjw6] [^113WX4eq].

> Hold on, I should verify interaction nuances; apixaban is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4 and is a P-gp substrate, so strong dual inhibitors require dose reduction from standard doses and should be avoided when the patient is already on 2.5 mg BID, and diltiazem can meaningfully alter exposure to coadministered drugs such as certain benzodiazepines while its own exposure can be affected by other agents, reinforcing the importance of documenting both route and indication for context in interaction screening [^114dw672] [^1138Kjw6] [^117HiCPw].

> I should double-check renal and special population notes to avoid hidden pitfalls; for apixaban in AF, reduced dosing criteria hinge on age, weight, and serum creatinine rather than eGFR per se, and labeling notes limited experience in advanced kidney disease, so specifying the indication and the reason for a reduced dose helps clinicians verify that the 2.5 mg BID entry is justified in that patient [^113iMMcA].

---

The correct spellings and dosing are: **diltiazem** (not "DIltiezam") [^112y5Rib], **bumetanide 1 mg tablet** (not "Bumex 1mg tablet") [^114QvYqh], and **apixaban 2.5 mg BID** — appropriate only for specific indications (VTE prophylaxis after hip/knee replacement [^113PJ11K] [^112G7Uhf] or extended VTE prevention [^116bGtqJ]) or for atrial fibrillation when ≥ 2 dose-reduction criteria are met (age ≥ 80, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL) [^113iMMcA]. For AF without dose-reduction criteria, use **apixaban 5 mg BID** [^116AqjZP].

---

## Corrected medication names and dosages

| **Incorrect entry** | **Corrected medication name** | **Corrected dosage** | **Clinical notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| DIltiezam | Diltiazem | Dose varies by indication and formulation | Calcium channel blocker for AF rate control [^112y5Rib], angina, and SVT [^1122sdUL] |
| Bumex 1mg tablet | Bumetanide 1 mg tablet | 1 mg tablet | Loop diuretic [^114QvYqh]; 1 mg ≈ 40 mg furosemide [^116TLQPr] |
| Apixaban 2.5mg BID | Apixaban 2.5 mg BID | 2.5 mg BID | Correct for VTE prophylaxis after hip/knee replacement [^113PJ11K] [^112G7Uhf], extended VTE prevention [^116bGtqJ], or AF with ≥ 2 dose-reduction criteria [^113iMMcA] |

## Clinical implications of corrected medications

### Diltiazem

Diltiazem is indicated for AF rate control [^112y5Rib], angina, and SVT [^1122sdUL]. Dosing varies by **indication and formulation (IR vs ER)**. Use caution in **heart failure** and when combined with beta-blockers; monitor for bradycardia and hypotension [^114VXSkv].

---

### Bumetanide

Bumetanide is indicated for edema associated with CHF, hepatic disease, or renal disease. Typical dosing uses a 1 mg tablet; onset is rapid and duration short [^115zaAWu], and 1 mg ≈ 40 mg furosemide [^116TLQPr]. Monitor **electrolytes**, renal function, and volume status, and avoid use in anuria [^114QvYqh] [^116Ly2dc].

---

### Apixaban

- **Indications**: NVAF, VTE treatment, and VTE prophylaxis [^1125jo7v].
- **Dosing**: 2.5 mg BID for VTE prophylaxis after hip/knee replacement [^113PJ11K] [^112G7Uhf], extended VTE prevention [^116bGtqJ] [^111z5ptX], or AF with ≥ 2 dose-reduction criteria (age ≥ 80, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL) [^113iMMcA].
- **Precautions**: Monitor for bleeding [^115r38sH]; adjust for renal impairment [^113iMMcA] and drug interactions [^1138Kjw6].

---

## Potential drug interactions and contraindications

- **Diltiazem and apixaban**: Diltiazem (CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor) can increase apixaban levels and bleeding risk; consider dose adjustment and monitor closely [^114dw672] [^1138Kjw6] [^1168QTDD].
- **Bumetanide and apixaban**: Bumetanide-induced electrolyte disturbances may increase bleeding risk with apixaban; monitor electrolytes and bleeding.
- **Diltiazem and bumetanide**: Both can cause hypotension; monitor blood pressure and adjust therapy as needed [^114VXSkv] [^114QvYqh].

---

## Clinical scenarios for apixaban 2.5 mg BID

- **VTE prophylaxis**: After hip replacement (35 days) [^113PJ11K] or knee replacement (12 days) [^112G7Uhf].
- **Extended VTE prevention**: After ≥ 6 months of initial treatment [^116bGtqJ] [^111z5ptX] [^112svMyJ].
- **AF dose reduction**: Use 2.5 mg BID if ≥ 2 of age ≥ 80, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL [^113iMMcA] [^114Xcg4W].

---

## Summary of corrections

The **corrected entries** are diltiazem, bumetanide 1 mg tablet, and apixaban 2.5 mg BID for specific indications. For diltiazem, ensure correct spelling and dose per indication and formulation. For bumetanide, use the correct spelling and the 1 mg tablet. For AF, apixaban is generally **5 mg BID** unless dose-reduction criteria are met; **2.5 mg BID** is used only for specific indications.

---

Ensure accurate **spelling and dosing** to reduce errors and improve outcomes.

### Clinical and pharmacological effects of apixaban dose adjustment in the ARISTOTLE trial [^114Xcg4W]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

In the ARISTOTLE (apixaban for reduction in stroke and other thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation) trial, patients with atrial fibrillation and ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria (age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl [133 μmol/l]) were randomized to receive apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or warfarin.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of apixaban dose adjustment on clinical and pharmacological outcomes.

- **Methods**: Patients receiving the correct dose of study drug were included (n = 18,073). The effect of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin on population pharmacokinetics, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (PF1+2), and clinical outcomes was compared with the standard dose (5 mg twice daily).

- **Results**: Patients receiving apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily exhibited lower apixaban exposure (median area under the concentration time curve at a steady state 2,720 ng/ml vs. 3,599 ng/ml; p < 0.0001) than those receiving the standard dose. In patients with ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria, reductions in D-dimers (p interaction = 0.20) and PF1+2 (p interaction = 0.55) were consistent with those observed in the standard-dose population. Patients with ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria (n = 751) were at higher risk for stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all-cause death than the standard-dose population (0 or 1 dose-adjustment criterion, n = 17,322). The effect of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin in the ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria population was consistent with the standard dose in the reductions in stroke or systemic embolism.

### Bumetanide [^116TLQPr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg of bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg of furosemide. The major site of bumetanide action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumetanide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by a marked reduction of free-water clearance (CH2O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (TCH2O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by bumetanide, and bumetanide is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.

Potassium excretion is also increased by bumetanide in a dose-related fashion. Bumetanide may have an additional action in the proximal tubule, as phosphate reabsorption, which largely takes place in the proximal tubule, is indicative of phosphaturia during bumetanide-induced diuresis. This is further supported by the reduction in the renal clearance of bumetanide by probenecid, associated with a diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumetanide does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.

Bumetanide decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Following oral administration of bumetanide, the onset of diuresis occurs in 30 to 60 minutes.

### Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116AqjZP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The ARISTOTLE study, published by Granger CB and colleagues in 2011 in the New England Journal of Medicine, is related to diseases such as atrial fibrillation, acute ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack. The trial question addressed was the role of apixaban in patients with AF. The study design was multi-center, double-blinded, and a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population included 18,201 patients, comprising 6,416 females and 11,785 males.

The inclusion criteria were patients with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. Key exclusion criteria included AF due to a reversible cause, moderate or severe mitral stenosis, conditions other than AF that required anticoagulation (e.g. a prosthetic heart valve), stroke within the previous 7 days, the need for aspirin at a dose of more than 165 mg a day or for both aspirin and clopidogrel, and severe renal insufficiency.

- **Interventions**: The interventions consisted of 9,120 patients receiving apixaban (5 mg PO BID) and 9,081 patients receiving warfarin (dose-adjusted, with target INR 2.0 to 3.0).

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome demonstrated a significant decrease in the incidence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism (1.2% per year vs. 1.6% per year; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- There was a significant decrease in the incidence of major bleeding (2.13% per year vs. 3.09% per year; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.8).
	- A significant decrease in death from any cause was observed (3.52% vs. 3.94%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.8 to 0.99).
	- A significant decrease in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was also noted (0.24% per year vs. 0.47% per year; HR 0.51, 95% CI).

### Apixaban for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism [^116bGtqJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor that can be administered in a simple, fixed-dose regimen, may be an option for the extended treatment of venous thromboembolism.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind study, we compared two doses of apixaban (2.5 mg and 5 mg, twice daily) with placebo in patients with venous thromboembolism who had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and for whom there was clinical equipoise regarding the continuation or cessation of anticoagulation therapy. The study drugs were administered for 12 months.

- **Results**: A total of 2486 patients underwent randomization, of whom 2482 were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death from venous thromboembolism occurred in 73 of the 829 patients (8.8%) who were receiving placebo, compared with 14 of the 840 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 2.5 mg of apixaban (a difference of 7.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 5.0 to 9.3) and 14 of the 813 patients (1.7%) receiving 5 mg of apixaban (a difference of 7.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 4.9 to 9.1). The rates of major bleeding were 0.5% in the placebo group, 0.2% in the 2.5-mg apixaban group, and 0.1% in the 5-mg apixaban group. The rates of clinically relevant non-major bleeding were 2.3% in the placebo group, 3.0% in the 2.5-mg apixaban group, and 4.2% in the 5-mg apixaban group. The rate of death from any cause was 1.7% in the placebo group, compared to 0.8% in the 2.5-mg apixaban group and 0.5% in the 5-mg apixaban group.

### Bumetanide [^115zaAWu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg of bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg of furosemide. The major site of bumetanide's action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

Bumetanide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as demonstrated by a marked reduction in free-water clearance (CH2O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (TcH2O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by bumetanide, and it is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.

Potassium excretion is also increased by bumetanide in a dose-related manner.

Bumetanide may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption largely occurs in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during bumetanide-induced diuresis suggests this additional action. This is further supported by the reduction in renal clearance of bumetanide by probenecid, which is associated with a diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumetanide does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.

Bumetanide decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid levels. Diuresis starts within minutes following an intravenous injection and reaches maximum levels shortly thereafter.

### Eliquis [^114dw672]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Approximately 25% of an orally administered apixaban dose is recovered in urine and feces as metabolites. Apixaban is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2J2. O-demethylation and hydroxylation at the 3-oxopiperidinyl moiety are the major sites of biotransformation.

Unchanged apixaban is the major drug-related component in human plasma; there are no active circulating metabolites.

- **Elimination**: Apixaban is eliminated in both urine and feces. Renal excretion accounts for about 27% of the total clearance. Biliary and direct intestinal excretion contribute to the elimination of apixaban in the feces. Apixaban has a total clearance of approximately 3.3 L/hour and an apparent half-life of approximately 12 hours following oral administration. Apixaban is a substrate of transport proteins: P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein.

- **Drug interaction studies**: In vitro apixaban studies at concentrations significantly greater than therapeutic exposures show no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, or CYP2C19, nor induction effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a significant inhibitor of P-gp.

- **Effect of coadministered drugs**: The effects of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban are illustrated in Figure 2 [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Bumetanide is contraindicated in anuria. Although bumetanide can be used to induce diuresis in renal insufficiency, any marked increase in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, or the development of oliguria during therapy of patients with progressive renal disease, is an indication for discontinuation of treatment with bumetanide. It is also contraindicated in patients in hepatic coma or in states of severe electrolyte depletion until the condition is improved or corrected. Furthermore, bumetanide is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to this drug.

### Concomitant use of diltiazem with direct oral anticoagulants and bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation [^1168QTDD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

This study explored the relationship between the concomitant use of diltiazem with direct oral anticoagulants and the associated bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. The investigation was supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. However, it is important to note that the funding sources did not influence the study design, data analysis, interpretation, or manuscript preparation.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^115meMtu]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate determination of anticoagulant drug levels is essential in critical clinical situations such as urgent surgery, planned thrombolysis, or major bleeding. Any anticoagulation treatment is inevitably associated with an increased risk of bleeding, which can be as high as 15% per year in certain patient populations. Additionally, approximately 25% of intracranial haemorrhages, which are among the most dangerous adverse events, are linked to anticoagulation treatment.

The bleeding risk associated with anticoagulants is particularly crucial in trauma patients because uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of death in these patients. In cases of massive bleeding, early and targeted treatment is critical to save lives, as 80% of trauma deaths occur within the first hour after trauma. Laboratory tests that can rapidly verify the presence of a relevant anticoagulant drug level will support fast treatment with reversal agents.

Additionally, knowledge of the anticoagulant drug level is essential in urgent surgery and planned thrombolysis. Rapid intervention is required in both cases, but an increased bleeding risk exposes patients to high procedural risks. Therefore, simple laboratory tests that accurately determine the anticoagulant drug level would improve care in patients undergoing anticoagulation treatment.

### Diltiazem HCl [^117TUEcx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage & administration**:

	- **Direct intravenous single injections (bolus)**: The initial dose of diltiazem hydrochloride injection should be 0.25 mg/kg actual body weight as a bolus administered over 2 minutes (20 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). If the response is inadequate, a second dose may be administered after 15 minutes. The second bolus dose of diltiazem hydrochloride injection should be 0.35 mg/kg actual body weight, administered over 2 minutes (25 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). Subsequent intravenous bolus doses should be individualized for each patient. Patients with low body weights should be dosed on a mg/kg basis. Some patients may respond to an initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg, although the duration of action may be shorter. Experience with this dose is limited.

	- **Continuous intravenous infusion**: For continued reduction of the heart rate (up to 24 hours) in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, an intravenous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection may be administered. (For reconstitution of diltiazem hydrochloride for injection, see instructions contained within the packaging.) Immediately following bolus administration of 20 mg (0.25 mg/kg) or 25 mg (0.35 mg/kg) diltiazem hydrochloride injection and reduction of heart rate, begin an intravenous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection. The recommended initial infusion rate of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection is 10 mg/h. Some patients may maintain response with lower doses.

### Do new oral anticoagulants require laboratory monitoring? The clinician point of view [^115dkaES]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Although no laboratory monitoring is needed for new anticoagulants, the measurement of their activity is required in special clinical situations. Standardized tests have been developed for rivaroxaban and dabigatran, which allow the measurement of the patient's response to the drug at Cmax (2 to 3 hours after intake) or at trough (before repeated administration). The results can be expressed in mg per mL of plasma and compared to the expected concentrations. The influence of the new anticoagulants on coagulation assays has been determined. Several clinical cases of major bleeding have been reported, and a severe coagulopathy was found in these patients, characterized by prolonged PT and aPTT and increased drug concentration in plasma. These observations raise the question regarding the potential benefit of laboratory coagulation monitoring from time to time. Trials are needed to determine the relationship of assay results with bleeding or thrombotic complications. The pros and cons of laboratory measurements are discussed.

### Reversal of antithrombotic agents [^115bNhtK]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants are the mainstay of therapy for thromboembolic diseases. In addition to the more traditional agents, new oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have been shown to be effective across several indications. Bleeding is a serious complication associated with any anticoagulant; however, many of the traditional parenteral and new oral agents do not currently have specific antidotes. This review describes available and future options for the reversal of the effects of anticoagulants, particularly the new oral agents, and discusses management strategies for bleeding events in clinical practice.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis - can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies [^111Mb5pD]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Apixaban drug levels were obtained from 143 measurements taken between August 2017 and January 2023. Data were collected from 24 patients, with 7 patients changing their dosing regimen during the observation period, providing data for both dosing schedules.

Seventeen patients were on a dosing regimen of 2.5 mg once daily, yielding 87 measurements with a median (range) of 4 (1–17) per case. Fourteen patients were on a regimen of 2.5 mg twice daily, resulting in 56 measurements with a median (range) of 2 (1–11) per case. The median interquartile range (IQR) for follow-up, defined as the time between the first and last drug level measurement, was 12.5 (5.5–21) months, with a maximum follow-up of 51 months.

- **Apixaban drug levels**: Median (IQR) drug levels were 54.1 (< 40–72.1) ng/mL for the 2.5 mg once-daily group and 71.3 (45.8–104.1) ng/mL for the twice-daily group (P < 0.001). The highest levels observed were 157.6 ng/mL and 223.7 ng/mL, respectively. Thirty percent of the once-daily dosing group and 14% of the twice-daily dosing group had drug levels below the assay's detection limit of < 40 ng/mL. Drug levels measured pre- and post-hemodialysis did not differ significantly.

### Andexxa [^111AhnLu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Do not use unfractionated heparin following Andexxa administration due to unresponsiveness characterized by non-prolongation of activated clotting times. See full prescribing information for details on drug interactions.

- **Use with unfractionated heparin**: Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin has occurred following Andexxa administration, characterized by non-prolongation of activated clotting times and the requirement for increased dosing of heparin. Do not use unfractionated heparin following Andexxa administration.

- **Interference of Andexxa with anti-FXa activity test**: Commercial clinical anti-FXa activity assays are unsuitable for measuring FXa activity following administration of Andexxa. Due to the reversible binding of Andexxa to the FXa inhibitor, the high sample dilution currently used in commercial clinical assays promotes dissociation of the inhibitor from Andexxa, resulting in the detection of erroneously elevated anti-FXa activity levels and thereby causing an underestimation of the reversal activity of Andexxa.

### Apixaban to prevent recurrence after cryptogenic stroke in patients with atrial cardiopathy: The ARCADIA randomized clinical trial [^113pEXH6]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

The ARCADIA study, published in 2024 in the journal JAMA, investigates the role of apixaban in patients with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy without atrial fibrillation (AF). This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included 1,015 patients (551 female, 464 male) and aimed to explore treatment outcomes within 180 days of stroke.

The inclusion criteria featured patients with cryptogenic stroke and atrial cardiopathy without AF. Key exclusion criteria included major-risk cardioembolic sources, such as any history of AF or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 30%. Patients with definite indications or contraindications for antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, a history of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or significant bleeding diathesis were excluded.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Apixaban Group**: 507 patients received an oral dose of 5 mg or 2.5 mg twice daily (BID) plus aspirin placebo.
	- **Aspirin Group**: 508 patients received an oral dose of 81 mg once daily plus apixaban placebo.

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in recurrent stroke (4.4% vs. 4.4%; HR 1, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.55).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in recurrent ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (4.1% vs. 4.4%; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.44).
	- No significant difference in recurrent stroke or death from any cause (7.3% vs…).

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1145McAu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) — are pharmacotherapies used for the prevention of thrombosis in several cardiovascular contexts. DOACs are categorized into two main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (i.e. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (i.e. dabigatran).

In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first DOAC, dabigatran, followed by rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in subsequent years. DOACs are relatively new agents demonstrating superiority or noninferiority to prior standards of care, such as anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; i.e. warfarin) or low‐molecular‐weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing the risk of thromboembolic complications while maintaining a similar or reduced bleeding risk. Advantages of DOACs compared with VKAs include fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow‐ups, more immediate drug onset and offset effects (important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management), and fewer drug and food interactions. As a result, by 2013, DOAC prescriptions exceeded those for warfarin, with apixaban being the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

Over the past decade, DOACs have been the subject of extensive investigation in many clinical scenarios. Though guidelines and review articles have provided detailed and in‐depth analyses of the immense literature base, these can be too cumbersome.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112F87kz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Apixaban Dosage Calculator" is crucial for managing various conditions, including perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management during noncardiac surgery, periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer-associated thrombosis, acute ischemic stroke, portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator is a clinical tool used to determine the appropriate dosage of apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) employed for thromboprophylaxis and the treatment of thromboembolic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The dosage depends on three factors: age, weight, and renal function (creatinine clearance). For atrial fibrillation, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg taken twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator determines the appropriate apixaban dosage based on specific patient information. This involves considering the patient's age, weight, creatinine clearance, and the reason for using apixaban. Here's how the process works:

- **Inputs**:
	- Age is captured in years, with a range of 18 to 120.
	- Weight can be entered in either kilograms (30 to 300 kg) or pounds (66 to 660 lb). If in pounds, it is converted to kilograms using a conversion rate (1 kg = 2.20462 lb).
	- Creatinine clearance is measured in mL/min, ranging from 0 to 150.
	- The indication for use includes four options: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thromboprophylaxis.

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112FikNY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The manuscript is the second update of the original practical guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al.]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions remain on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) aimed to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians about the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows:

1. Eligibility for NOACs
2. Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs
3. Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake
4. Switching between anticoagulant regimens
5. Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs
6. NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced kidney disease

The guide addresses these issues comprehensively based on the current evidence available.

Essentials

The measurement of DOACs (direct oral anticoagulants) is not widely implemented in the US, unlike in other areas of the world. The position of the Food and Drug Administration may explain this situation. Measurement of DOACs does not represent any technical difficulty and could be easily implemented in all laboratories. However, the fact that these laboratory tests are not available in some locations suggests disparities in patient care.

### Asundexian versus apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112uaboQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Stroke prevention with direct-acting oral anticoagulant agents in patients with atrial fibrillation confers a risk of bleeding and limits their use. Asundexian, an activated factor XI (XIa) inhibitor, is an oral anticoagulant that may prevent strokes with less bleeding.

- **Methods**: In a phase 3, international, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation in a 1:1 ratio to receive asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily or standard-dose apixaban. The primary efficacy objective was to determine whether asundexian is at least noninferior to apixaban for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety objective was to determine whether asundexian is superior to apixaban with respect to major bleeding events.

- **Results**: A total of 14,810 randomly assigned patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 73.9 ± 7.7 years, 35.2% were women, 18.6% had chronic kidney disease, 18.2% had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, 16.8% had received oral anticoagulants for no more than 6 weeks, and the mean CHA2DS2-VASc score (range, 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of stroke) was 4.3 ± 1.3. The trial was stopped prematurely at the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 98 patients (1.3%) assigned to receive asundexian and in 26 (0.4%) assigned to receive apixaban (hazard ratio, 3.79; 95% confidence interval, 2.46 to 5.83). Major bleeding occurred in 17 patients (0.2%) who received…

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1158bzAp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists have been shown to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, many patients are not suitable candidates for, or are unwilling to receive vitamin K antagonist therapy, and these patients have a high risk of stroke. Apixaban, a novel factor Xa inhibitor, may be an alternative treatment for such patients.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind study, we randomly assigned 5599 patients with atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke and for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy was unsuitable to receive apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (81 to 324 mg per day), to determine whether apixaban was superior. The mean follow-up period was 1.1 years. The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism.

- **Results**: Before enrollment, 40% of the patients had used a vitamin K antagonist. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study because of a clear benefit in favor of apixaban. There were 51 primary outcome events (1.6% per year) among patients assigned to apixaban and 113 (3.7% per year) among those assigned to aspirin (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.62; P < 0.001). The rates of death were 3.5% per year in the apixaban group and 4.4% per year in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.02; P = 0.07). There were 44 cases of major bleeding (1.4% per year) in the apixaban group and 39 (1.2% per year) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.75; P = 0.57).

### The role of the laboratory in treatment with new oral anticoagulants [^111GpvGB]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Orally active small molecules that selectively and specifically inhibit coagulation serine proteases have been developed for clinical use. Dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are given at fixed doses and do not require monitoring. In most circumstances, these drugs have predictable bioavailability, pharmacokinetic effects, and pharmacodynamic effects. However, there will be clinical circumstances when assessment of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs will be required. The effect of these drugs on laboratory tests has been determined in vitro by spiking normal samples with a known concentration of active compound or ex vivo by using plasma samples from volunteers and patients.

Data on the sensitivity of different reagents are now available, and so guidance as to the effect and interpretation of a test result is now possible. Laboratories should be aware of the sensitivity of their own assays to each drug. This may be achieved by using appropriate calibrated plasma samples.

### The X factor: Lack of bleeding after an acute apixaban overdose [^116T5vLb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

We present an acute apixaban overdose without reported coingestants; it is the first such case report associated with multiple serum drug levels to assist in determining overdose kinetics. A 62-year-old female presented to an emergency department (ED) 2 hours after ingesting sixty 5 mg tablets (5 mg/kg) of her spouse's apixaban medication. She denied coingestants and did not take her prescribed medications that day. Her vital signs were normal and she denied symptoms. Chemistry and hematology labs were unremarkable. Plasma apixaban concentrations were 2765.6 ng/ml at 14 hours post-ingestion with a non-linear half-life. There was no utilization of blood products or factor replacement. There was never any bleeding, and her hemoglobin did not decrease. This case demonstrates that a single ingestion of apixaban can occur without any complications.

As the dose of Matzim LA (diltiazem hydrochloride) extended-release tablets is increased from 120 to 240 mg, the area-under-the-curve increases 2.5-fold.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- **Impact of diltiazem on other coadministered drugs**:

		- **Anesthetics**: The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity, as well as the vascular dilation associated with anesthetics, may be potentiated by calcium channel blockers. When used concomitantly, anesthetics and calcium blockers should be titrated carefully.

		- **Benzodiazepines**: Studies showed that diltiazem increased the AUC of midazolam and triazolam by 3- to 4-fold and the Cmax by 2-fold compared to placebo. The elimination half-life of midazolam and triazolam also increased (1.5- to 2.5-fold) during coadministration with diltiazem. These pharmacokinetic effects observed during diltiazem coadministration can result in increased clinical effects.

### Efficacy and safety of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis. The Botticelli DVT dose-ranging study [^113KaUjN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Apixaban, an oral potent reversible direct inhibitor of activated factor X, has shown promise in the prevention of venous thromboembolism following major orthopedic surgery. We conducted a dose-ranging study in patients with deep vein thrombosis.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis were included and randomized to receive 84–91 days of apixaban 5 mg twice-daily, 10 mg twice-daily, or 20 mg once-daily, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism and asymptomatic deterioration as seen on bilateral compression ultrasound or perfusion lung scans. The principal safety outcome was the composite of major and clinically relevant, non-major bleeding.

- **Results**: The mean age of the 520 included patients was 59 years, and 62% were male. The primary outcome occurred in 17 of the 358 apixaban-treated patients [4.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8–7.5%] and in five of the 118 LMWH/VKA-treated patients (4.2%, 95% CI 1.4–9.6%) who were evaluable. The incidence in all three apixaban groups was low and comparable, without evidence of a dose response. The principal safety outcome occurred in 28 (7.3%) of the 385 apixaban-treated patients and in 10 (7.9%) of the 126 LMWH/VKA-treated patients. No dose response for apixaban was observed.

- **Conclusion**: These observations warrant further evaluation of apixaban in phase III studies. The attractive fixed-dose regimen of this compound may meet the demand to simplify anticoagulant treatment.

### Comparative safety and efficacy of a hybrid intravenous and oral diltiazem protocol for acute rate control in the emergency department [^112PvevF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Intravenous diltiazem has experienced numerous supply shortages over the past few years. This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of a traditional diltiazem intravenous bolus and continuous infusion protocol to a diltiazem intravenous bolus and oral maintenance protocol for acute rate control in the emergency department.

- **Methods**: Patients who received intravenous diltiazem in the emergency department between January 1, 2018, and May 31, 2019, were screened. Patients were included if they received the diltiazem intravenous bolus and continuous infusion protocol (IV + infusion group) or the hybrid diltiazem intravenous bolus and oral maintenance protocol (IV + PO group). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with rate control, without the need for additional rate control agents or additional boluses during the maintenance phase.

- **Results**: A total of 106 patients were matched with 53 patients in each group. For the primary outcome of rate control at four hours, 62.3% of patients in the intravenous bolus + infusion group versus 75.5% of patients in the IV bolus + PO group (p = 0.142) achieved rate control. There was no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia between groups.

- **Conclusion**: Results of this study demonstrated no difference in acute rate control when using a hybrid IV and oral diltiazem protocol, compared to a traditional IV bolus and infusion strategy. This information supports the further use of a hybrid diltiazem IV and oral protocol, which provides increased flexibility during shortages of either medication.

### Oral apixaban for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism [^113CuUEV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor administered in fixed doses, may simplify the treatment of venous thromboembolism.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind study, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily for 6 months) with conventional therapy (subcutaneous enoxaparin, followed by warfarin) in 5,395 patients with acute venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death related to venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcomes were major bleeding alone and major bleeding plus clinically relevant non-major bleeding.

- **Results**: The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 59 of 2,609 patients (2.3%) in the apixaban group, as compared with 71 of 2,635 patients (2.7%) in the conventional-therapy group (relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 1.18; difference in risk [apixaban minus conventional therapy], -0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.3 to 0.4). Apixaban was noninferior to conventional therapy (P < 0.001) for predefined upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals for both relative risk (< 1.80) and difference in risk (< 3.5 percentage points). Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients who received apixaban and in 1.8% of those who received conventional therapy (relative risk, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.55; P < 0.001 for superiority). The composite outcome of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 4.3% of the patients in the apixaban group, as compared with 9.7% of those in the conventional-therapy group.

### Automated misspelling detection and correction in Persian clinical text [^115q95GJ]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Accurate electronic health records are important for clinical care, research, and patient safety assurance. Correction of misspelled words is required to ensure the correct interpretation of medical records. In the Persian language, the lack of an automated misspelling detection and correction system is evident in medicine and health care. In this article, we describe the development of an automated misspelling detection and correction system for radiology and ultrasound's free texts in the Persian language.

To achieve our goal, we used an n-gram language model and three different types of free texts related to abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, head and neck ultrasound, and breast ultrasound reports. Our system achieved a detection performance of up to 90.29% for radiology and ultrasound's free texts, with a correction accuracy of 88.56%. Results indicated that high-quality spelling correction is possible in clinical reports. The system also achieved significant savings during the documentation process and final approval of the reports in the imaging department.

### Pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its metabolites in relation to CYP2D6 genotype [^114BG5eP]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Recently, it was shown in vitro that the polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 mediates O-demethylation of diltiazem. The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its major metabolites in healthy human volunteers representing different CYP2D6 genotypes.

- **Methods**: Norwegians of Caucasian origin were screened for their CYP2D6 genotype on the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) by melting-curve analysis of allele-specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes hybridized to polymerase chain reaction-amplified deoxyribonucleic acid. The first 5 individuals identified with genotypes corresponding to a homozygous extensive, heterozygous extensive, or homozygous poor CYP2D6-metabolizing phenotype, respectively, were voluntarily enrolled in the pharmacokinetic study. The participants received diltiazem, 120 mg, as a single oral dose, and plasma samples were collected up to 24 hours after administration. Plasma samples were purified by solid phase extraction. Diltiazem and 7 phase I metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

- **Results**: The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem was not significantly different between the subgroups. However, the systemic exposure of the pharmacologically active metabolites desacetyl diltiazem and N-demethyldesacetyl diltiazem was ≥ 5 times higher in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers than in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (P < .01).

- **Conclusions**: CYP2D6 activity does not have a major impact on the disposition of diltiazem. In contrast, desacetyl diltiazem and N-demethyldesacetyl diltiazem show significant differences in exposure based on CYP2D6 metabolizer status.
