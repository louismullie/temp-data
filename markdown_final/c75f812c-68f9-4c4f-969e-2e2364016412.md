## Question

For which types of patients should a folate receptor antibody assay be ordered?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which types of patients should have a folate-receptor antibody assay ordered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the assay measures and the core pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the highest-credibility clinical scenario where it changes management. Next, I will consider later-onset or atypical presentations, followed by lower-credibility reproductive contexts. After that, I need to explicitly exclude scenarios where this test is not appropriate, clarify interpretation if positive, outline treatment and monitoring, and finally summarize who should be tested with attention to guideline context and disease rarity, anchoring each step with the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm what this assay detects. The folate-receptor antibody assay measures circulating blocking autoantibodies against folate receptor alpha (FRα), typically at the choroid plexus, which impair transport of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate into the CSF despite normal systemic folate status, leading to cerebral folate deficiency physiology rather than classic dietary folate deficiency, and this distinction is essential to avoid conflating indications or misinterpreting results [^116GTiYQ] [^113XeBeV] [^116a3hTM].

> I should verify the highest-credibility indication. Hold on, let me not jump to conclusions until I anchor on the pivotal data. Infantile-onset cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) is the primary, well-supported scenario: low CSF 5MTHF with normal serum and erythrocyte folate, onset in late infancy with irritability, sleep disturbance, psychomotor delay or regression, movement disorders, spasticity, decelerating head growth, visual or hearing loss, and seizures; most affected children harbor high-affinity FRα-blocking autoantibodies, and oral folinic acid normalizes CSF 5MTHF with clinical improvement, which is a key management implication supporting test utility in this phenotype [^116GTiYQ] [^113XeBeV].

> Wait, I should double-check that I'm not conflating CFD with general folate deficiency workups. Initially, I almost thought serum folate would be the signal here, but in CFD serum folate is usually normal; evaluation for megaloblastic anemia or nutritional folate deficiency follows hematology guidance, which does not include FR autoantibody testing and advises serum folate as first-line, avoiding routine RBC folate except in special circumstances, and treating proven folate deficiency with folic acid, which is a different clinical problem than receptor-blocked CNS folate transport [^113bpSGh] [^1143fjQR] [^111vjaWs].

> Next, I should review later-onset or atypical CFD-like presentations. Let me consider adolescents or adults with neuropsychiatric disease and low CSF 5MTHF after excluding systemic folate and B12 disorders; case-level evidence links FRα-blocking antibodies to treatment-resistant psychosis or catatonia and to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with CNS involvement, though therapeutic response to folinic acid is inconsistent, so the test is reasonable when CSF 5MTHF is low and other causes are excluded, recognizing the lower certainty of benefit in these scenarios [^116oGrcq] [^116a3hTM] [^1119mcfK].

> But wait, what if the context is reproductive medicine. I need to check the credibility here. Small studies suggest associations between FRα-blocking antibodies and subfertility, and between maternal FR antibodies and prior neural-tube defect–affected pregnancies, yet these are exploratory and not guideline-endorsed; therefore, if considered at all, testing should be framed as investigational alongside standard periconceptional folic acid strategies recommended for high-risk NTD prevention, with clear counseling on the uncertainty of benefit from antibody testing in this space [^1148YdJs] [^1179tut6] [^116hvZfQ].

> Hold on, I should verify where this test does not fit. Oncology use of folate receptor focuses on tumor FRα expression to select targeted therapeutics and imaging, not on host autoantibodies; companion diagnostics for FRα IHC and FR-targeted agents such as mirvetuximab soravtansine or FR-targeted radioconjugates are separate pathways, so FR autoantibody serology should not be ordered for cancer therapy selection or biomarker stratification [^113DqqZB] [^1157q71F] [^113jiA1u].

> Now, I will examine interpretation when the assay is positive. I should confirm the biochemical signature of CFD: low CSF 5MTHF with normal serum folate and cobalamin, and usually normal or only mildly elevated homocysteine; I also need to exclude other causes of low CSF 5MTHF such as mitochondrial disease, antiepileptic drug effects, MTHFR-related issues, or syndromic disorders before ascribing causality to FR autoantibodies, to avoid premature closure and misattribution [^113XeBeV].

> Next, I need to ensure treatment implications are clear. If FRα-blocking antibodies are present in the appropriate phenotype, initiate folinic acid rather than folic acid to restore CSF folate and support clinical recovery; folic acid can compete at the receptor and is not the therapy of choice in CFD, which is distinct from hematologic folate deficiency where folic acid is standard, so choosing the right folate form is crucial here [^116GTiYQ] [^113XeBeV].

> I should confirm follow-up and monitoring. Antibody titers can fluctuate over time, which argues for periodic reassessment of clinical status and, when needed, CSF 5MTHF; limited data suggest a milk-free diet may reduce FR autoantibody titers, but this is adjunctive to folinic acid and not a replacement, so expectations should be set accordingly while maintaining core therapy [^1112SzgP] [^1149VNod].

> Let me reconsider genetic differentials so I do not miss an inherited transport defect. In patients with low CSF 5MTHF and a compatible phenotype but absent or inconclusive FR autoantibodies, loss-of-function variants in FOLR1 causing cerebral folate transport deficiency should be considered, and genetic testing can be diagnostic and prognostically informative in that subset [^116Q9eMa].

> Finally, I should summarize who to test so the ordering threshold is appropriate. Test FRα-blocking antibodies primarily in infants and young children with an unexplained CFD phenotype characterized by low CSF 5MTHF and normal systemic folate status, where the evidence is strongest and treatment changes outcomes; consider testing in older patients with low CSF 5MTHF and refractory neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental decline after excluding other causes, acknowledging lower evidence; consider reproductive contexts only as investigational with counseling; do not use this assay for oncology therapy selection or for routine screening in asymptomatic individuals or standard anemia workups, and remember this is a rare, niche, hypothesis-confirming test aligned to a specific biochemical and clinical pattern [^116GTiYQ] [^113XeBeV].

Patients who should be considered for a folate receptor antibody test are those with **infantile-onset neurological syndromes** (developmental delay, regression, seizures, ataxia, hypotonia, deceleration of head growth) and **low CSF 5-methyltetrahydrofolate with normal serum folate** [^116GTiYQ] [^113XeBeV]. Testing is also indicated in **unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders** [^113XeBeV] with normal peripheral folate, and in **refractory epilepsy or catatonia** [^1112SzgP] [^116oGrcq] with suspected cerebral folate deficiency. Consider testing in **recurrent neural tube defects** [^1179tut6] or **unexplained subfertility** [^1148YdJs] when other causes are excluded. Routine screening is not recommended; testing should be guided by clinical suspicion and low CSF folate with normal serum folate [^113XeBeV].

## Clinical indications for folate receptor antibody testing

### Infantile-onset neurological syndromes

- **Clinical features**: Developmental delay, regression, seizures, ataxia, hypotonia, deceleration of head growth [^113XeBeV], visual disturbances, and sensorineural hearing loss.
- **Laboratory findings**: Low CSF 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) with normal serum and erythrocyte folate levels [^116GTiYQ] [^113XeBeV].
- **Pathophysiology**: Autoantibodies against folate receptor alpha (FRα) block folate transport across the choroid plexus [^116GTiYQ], causing cerebral folate deficiency [^116neMBd].

---

### Unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders

- **Clinical features**: Developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder [^113XeBeV], and refractory epilepsy with normal peripheral folate levels [^116a3hTM].
- **Laboratory findings**: Low CSF 5-MTHF with normal serum folate [^113XeBeV], suggesting impaired CNS folate transport [^116GTiYQ].
- **Pathophysiology**: Autoantibodies against FRα [^113XeBeV] may underlie these unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders [^116neMBd].

---

### Refractory epilepsy and catatonia

Refractory epilepsy or catatonia [^1112SzgP] [^116oGrcq] warrant **FRα autoantibody testing**, particularly when cerebral folate deficiency is suspected. Laboratory support includes **low CSF 5-MTHF with normal serum folate** [^1112SzgP] [^113XeBeV]. Pathophysiologically, FRα autoantibodies can block CNS folate transport [^1112SzgP] and contribute to these presentations [^116GTiYQ].

---

### Recurrent neural tube defects and unexplained subfertility

Recurrent neural tube defects [^1179tut6] and unexplained subfertility [^1148YdJs] should prompt consideration of **FRα autoantibody testing** after other causes are excluded. When present, FRα autoantibodies can impair folate transport during embryogenesis [^1179tut6], increasing the risk of neural tube defects and subfertility [^1148YdJs].

---

## Laboratory criteria for folate receptor antibody testing

- **Low CSF 5-MTHF**: CSF 5-MTHF below age-specific reference ranges [^116GTiYQ] with normal serum folate [^113XeBeV].
- **Normal peripheral folate**: Normal serum and erythrocyte folate despite neurological symptoms [^116GTiYQ] [^113XeBeV].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: Rule out genetic mutations (e.g. FOLR1), metabolic disorders, and secondary causes of folate deficiency [^116Q9eMa] [^113XeBeV] [^116neMBd].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations support **targeted testing** for patients with neurological symptoms [^116GTiYQ] and low CSF folate alongside normal serum folate [^113XeBeV]. Routine screening is **not recommended**; testing should be guided by **clinical suspicion** and **laboratory findings** [^113XeBeV]. In FRα autoantibody-positive patients, high-dose folinic acid can normalize CSF folate and improve symptoms [^116GTiYQ].

### Association between blocking folate receptor autoantibodies and subfertility [^1148YdJs]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

The association between blocking folate receptor (FR) autoantibodies and subfertility was investigated in a longitudinal study of women attempting to become pregnant. Seventeen women with subfertility (defined as failure to conceive during 12 menstrual cycles) and 25 control women (who conceived and had normal pregnancy outcomes) were studied. Subfertility risk was found to be 12 times higher in women with blocking FR autoantibodies compared to those without (odds ratio: 12; 95% confidence interval: 1.9–129.6).

### Autoantibodies to folate receptors in the cerebral folate deficiency syndrome [^116GTiYQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). High credibility.

In infantile-onset cerebral folate deficiency, levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF) in the cerebrospinal fluid are low, while folate levels in the serum and erythrocytes remain normal. We examined serum specimens from 28 children with cerebral folate deficiency, 5 of their mothers, 28 age-matched control subjects, and 41 patients with unrelated neurologic disorders. Serum from 25 of the 28 patients and none of the 28 control subjects contained high-affinity blocking autoantibodies against membrane-bound folate receptors present on the choroid plexus. Oral folinic acid administration normalized 5MTHF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and led to clinical improvement. Cerebral folate deficiency is a disorder in which autoantibodies can prevent the transfer of folate from the plasma to the cerebrospinal fluid.

### Autoantibodies against folate receptors in women with a pregnancy complicated by a neural-tube defect [^1179tut6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

In the absence of clinical folate deficiency, periconceptional supplementation with folic acid reduces a woman's risk of having an infant with a neural-tube defect. Since antiserum to folate receptors induces embryo resorption and malformations in rats, we hypothesized that autoantibodies against folate receptors in women may be associated with pregnancy complicated by a neural-tube defect.
- **Methods**: Serum from 12 women who were or had been pregnant with a fetus with a neural-tube defect and from 24 control women (20 with prior normal pregnancies and 4 who were nulligravid) was analyzed for autoantibodies by incubation with human placental folate receptors radiolabeled with [3H]folic acid. The properties of these autoantibodies were characterized by incubating serum and the autoantibodies isolated from serum with placental membranes, ED27 cells, and KB cells, which express the folate receptors.
- **Results**: Serum from 9 of 12 women with a previous affected pregnancy (index subjects) and 2 of 20 control subjects contained autoantibodies against folate receptors (P < 0.001). The autoantibodies blocked the binding of [3H]folic acid to folate receptors on placental membranes and on ED27 and KB cells incubated at 4 degrees C, and blocked the uptake of [3H]folic acid by KB cells when incubated at 37 degrees C.
- **Conclusions**: Serum from women with a pregnancy complicated by a neural-tube defect contains autoantibodies that bind to folate receptors and can block the cellular uptake of folate. Further study is warranted to assess whether the observed association is significant.

### Cerebral folate deficiency [^113XeBeV]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) is defined as any neurological syndrome associated with a low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF) in the presence of normal peripheral folate status. CFD has a wide clinical presentation, with reported signs and symptoms generally beginning at around 4 months of age with irritability and sleep disturbances. These can be followed by psychomotor retardation, dyskinesia, cerebellar ataxia, and spastic diplegia. Other signs may include deceleration of head growth, visual disturbances, and sensorineural hearing loss.

Identification of CFD is achieved by determining 5MTHF concentration in CSF. Once identified, CFD can, in many cases, be treated by administering oral folinic acid. Supplementation with folic acid is contraindicated and, if used, may exacerbate the CSF 5MTHF deficiency. Generation of autoantibodies against the folate receptor required to transport 5MTHF into CSF and mutations in the folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) gene have been reported to be causes of CFD. However, other mechanisms are probably also involved, as CFD has been reported in Aicardi-Goutière's and Rett syndromes and in mitochondriopathies.

Several metabolic conditions and a number of widely used drugs can also lead to a decrease in the concentration of CSF 5MTHF, and these should be considered in the differential diagnosis if a low concentration of 5MTHF is found following CSF analysis.

### Folinic acid treatment for schizophrenia associated with folate receptor autoantibodies [^1112SzgP]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Auto-antibodies against folate receptor alpha (FRα) at the choroid plexus that block N(5)-methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) transfer to the brain were identified in catatonic schizophrenia. Acoustic hallucinations disappeared following folinic acid treatment. Folate transport to the CNS prevents homocysteine accumulation and delivers one-carbon units for methyl-transfer reactions and synthesis of purines. The guanosine derivative tetrahydrobiopterin acts as a common co-factor for the enzymes producing dopamine, serotonin, and nitric oxide.
- **Methods**: Our study selected patients with schizophrenia unresponsive to conventional treatment. Serum from these patients with normal plasma homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12 was tested for FR autoantibodies of the blocking type on serial samples each week. Spinal fluid was analyzed for MTHF and the metabolites of pterins, dopamine, and serotonin. The clinical response to folinic acid treatment was evaluated.
- **Results**: Fifteen of 18 patients (83.3%) had positive serum FR auto-antibodies compared to only 1 in 30 controls (3.3%) (χ² = 21.6; p < 0.0001). FRα antibody titers in patients fluctuated over time, varying between negative and high titers, modulating folate flux to the CNS, which explained low CSF folate values in 6 and normal values in 7 patients. The mean ± SD for CSF MTHF was diminished compared to previously established controls (t-test: 3.90; p = 0.0002). A positive linear correlation existed between CSF MTHF and biopterin levels. CSF dopamine and serotonin metabolites were low or in the lower normal range.

For acute ischemic stroke patients, particularly those with autoimmune diseases, the AHA/ASA 2024 guidelines suggest considering VKA therapy with a target INR of 2 to 3 in individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous unprovoked venous thrombosis. This is preferred over aspirin or DOACs for preventing thrombotic events, including stroke.

### The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha regulates chemokine receptor expression on ovarian cancer cells [^115F1SbZ]. Cancer Research (2005). Low credibility.

Epithelial ovarian cancer cells express the chemokine receptor, CXCR4, which may be associated with increased survival and metastatic potential, but the regulation of this receptor is not understood. The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is found in ovarian cancer biopsies and is associated with increased tumor grade. In this report, we show that CXCR4 expression on human epithelial ovarian cancer cells is associated with, and can be modulated by, TNF-alpha.

Ovarian cancer cells with high endogenous expression of TNF-alpha expressed higher levels of CXCR4 mRNA and protein than cells with low TNF-alpha expression. Stimulation of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary epithelial cancer cells with TNF-alpha resulted in increased CXCR4 mRNA and protein. The TNF-alpha-stimulated increase in CXCR4 mRNA was due partly to de novo synthesis, and up-regulation of CXCR4 cell surface protein increased migration to the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12. CXCR4 mRNA and protein were down-regulated by anti-TNF-alpha antibody or by targeting TNF-alpha mRNA using RNAi. TNF-alpha stimulation activated components of the nuclear factor kappaB pathway, and overexpression of the inhibitor of kappaB also reduced CXCR4 expression.

Coculture of macrophages with ovarian cancer cells also resulted in cancer cell up-regulation of CXCR4 mRNA in a TNF-alpha-dependent manner. Finally, there was a correlation between the levels of TNF-alpha and CXCR4 mRNA in clinical biopsies of ovarian cancer, and TNF-alpha protein was expressed in CXCR4-positive tumor cells. TNF-alpha is a critical mediator.

### Molecular characterization of folate receptor 1 mutations delineates cerebral folate transport deficiency [^116Q9eMa]. Brain (2012). High credibility.

Cerebral folate transport deficiency is an inherited brain-specific folate transport defect caused by mutations in the folate receptor 1 gene coding for folate receptor alpha (FRα). This genetic defect results in a progressive neurological disorder with late infantile onset. We screened 72 children with low concentrations of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the cerebrospinal fluid and neurological symptoms that developed after infancy. We identified nucleotide alterations in the folate receptor 1 gene in 10 individuals who exhibited developmental regression, ataxia, profound cerebral hypomyelination, and cerebellar atrophy.

We found four novel pathogenic alleles: one splice mutation and three missense mutations. Heterologous expression of the missense mutations, including previously described mutants, revealed a minor decrease in protein expression but loss of cell surface localization, mistargeting to intracellular compartments, and thus absence of cellular binding of folic acid. These results explain the functional loss of folate receptor alpha for all detected folate receptor 1 mutations. Three individuals presenting a milder clinical phenotype revealed very similar biochemical and brain imaging data but partially shared pathogenic alleles with more severely affected patients. Thus, our studies suggest that different clinical severities do not necessarily correlate with residual function of folate receptor alpha mutants and indicate that additional factors contribute to the clinical phenotype in cerebral folate transport deficiency.

### Folic acid conjugates for nuclear imaging of folate receptor-positive cancer [^1157q71F]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The folate receptor (FR) is overexpressed on a variety of tumor types, whereas its distribution in normal tissues and organs is highly limited. Exploration of the utility of the FR revealed its promising potential for targeting with folate-based radiopharmaceuticals. Herein, we report the principle of the FR-targeting strategy and summarize the development of several folic acid radioconjugates useful for SPECT and PET of cancer diseases. The potential applicability of folate radiopharmaceuticals for FR-targeted radionuclide therapy is also discussed.

### Antibodies contributing to focal epilepsy signs and symptoms score [^1144jjbV]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

All samples were screened for immunoreactivity with immunohistochemistry (IHC) as previously described. Subsequently, all samples with a positive or questionable IHC result were tested more extensively. A combination of laboratory techniques was used, depending on the staining pattern and the clinical phenotype.

Commercial cell-based assay (CBA; Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) was used to detect anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR), anti-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (anti-AMPAR), anti-γ-aminobutyric acid B receptor (anti-GABA B R), anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (anti-LGI1), anti-contactin-associated protein-like 2 (anti-CASPR2), and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (anti-GAD65). Anti-GAD65 was tested with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Medizym anti-GAD 96, Medipan, Berlin, Germany) as well, to quantify antibody concentration.

An in-house CBA with live cells was used to detect anti-GABA A R, anti-GABA B R, anti-AMPAR, and anti-dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6. Radioimmunoassay (RIA; VGKC Antibody Assay RIA, DLD Diagnostika, Hamburg, Germany) was used to detect voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies (anti-VGKC), and immunoblotting was used to detect onconeural antibodies (anti-Hu/Yo/Ri/Tr/amphyphysin/CV2/Ma1/Ma2; Euroimmun).

Serum anti-GAD65 was considered relevant if the ELISA concentration was > 10,000IU/ml. Only samples tested positive by ELISA and with a compatible positive staining on IHC were considered positive. In addition, all serum samples were screened for the presence of anti-glycine.

### Technical validation of an autoantibody test for lung cancer [^112Jts1Z]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is the highest cause of death from cancer worldwide, responsible for the deaths of over 1 million men and women every year. It is often detected on chest X-ray, but by this time, the cancer is usually advanced and few patients are cured by treatment. However, if diagnosed early, the chances of cure are approximately 90%. At present, there is no early detection test or acceptable screening method for this disease; therefore, there is an urgent need to produce a screening test that can identify the cancer in its early curable stage, especially in high-risk individuals.

Circulating antibodies that react with tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) have been found in serum samples from patients with a variety of cancers, including lung cancer, and may represent an early indicator of the presence of cancer. It is hypothesized that the heterogeneity of antigen expression will mean that a panel of assays for autoantibodies of various TAA specificities will be needed for effective detection of lung cancer. Recent publications have confirmed that measuring autoantibodies to a panel of antigens provides a significantly greater level of sensitivity compared to a single antigen.

Autoantibodies have been found in the blood of patients who develop lung cancer up to five years before screening spiral computed tomography scans were able to detect the tumour. Consequently, monitoring people at increased risk of lung cancer for the presence of serum autoantibodies may enable earlier detection of the disease, allowing earlier therapeutic intervention.

### Guidelines on the investigation and management of antiphospholipid syndrome [^112ypws8]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for antiphospholipid syndrome, specifically concerning confirmatory testing, the BSH 2012 guidelines recommend performing a confirmatory test (e.g. using a high phospholipid concentration, a platelet neutralizing reagent, or a lupus-anticoagulant insensitive reagent) to definitively establish the presence of lupus anticoagulant.

### Cerebral folate deficiency [^116a3hTM]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) is associated with low levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), while folate levels remain normal in plasma and red blood cells. Symptoms typically begin to manifest at around 4 to 6 months of age. This condition leads to delayed development, deceleration of head growth, hypotonia, and ataxia. In one-third of affected children, further complications such as dyskinesias (choreo-athetosis, hemiballismus), spasticity, speech difficulties, and epilepsy may occur.

The reduced level of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the CSF is often due to impaired transport across the blood-brain barrier. This is likely caused by the binding of folate receptor antibodies to folate receptors in the choroid plexus, which blocks folate transport into the CSF. Treatment with folinic acid over extended periods can significantly improve clinical symptoms and restore normal levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the CSF. Given the positive response to treatment in CFD and related conditions, it could be beneficial to screen the CSF of patients with neurological disorders of unknown origin.

### Non-allergic urticarial skin reactions associated with MOv18 IgE, a first-in-class IgE antibody recognising folate receptor alpha [^117R1DE5]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

- **Studies in human samples**: Paired 4-mm skin punch biopsies (n = 2 cores from n = 1 patient) were obtained from urticarial lesional and unaffected skin from the back of a patient with metastatic ovarian cancer treated with MOv18 IgE in the Phase I study, who developed a CTCAE grade 3 urticarial skin reaction (Patient A).
- **Tissue microarrays (TMA)**: Details on TMA and FRα expression evaluation by IHC are described in Methods S1.
- **Tissue IHC and IF**: Toluidine blue staining and tissue IF of patient biopsy tissue are described in Methods S1.
- **IMS**: MOv18 IgG1, or negative control NIP IgG1, antibodies were tested for reactivity against tissue lysates from fresh frozen healthy skin (n = 3). IgG1 antibodies were loaded on protein G magnetic beads and incubated with lysates. The beads were washed, immunoprecipitated proteins digested with trypsin, and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) followed by parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (PRM‐MS) [see Methods S1].
- **Serological investigations**: Serum and whole blood samples were collected from Patient A and other MOv18 IgE‐treated patients at baseline and various timepoints during and after MOv18 IgE doses. Cytokine, anti‐drug antibodies (ADA), anti‐αGAL IgE antibodies, serum β‐tryptase, total serum IgE, anti‐FRα and autoantibodies detection, and Basophil Activation Test (BAT) were performed using blood drawn from these patients [see Methods S1].
- **Statistical analyses**: Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Analyses were performed.

### Predicting response to antibody drug conjugates: A focus on antigens' targetability [^113DqqZB]. The Oncologist (2023). Low credibility.

Folate Receptor Alpha is a cell surface glycoprotein responsible for folate entrance into the intracellular environment and is limitedly expressed in normal tissues. Since folate is necessary for DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation, Folate Receptor Alpha (FRα) is upregulated when cellular metabolic demand increases, which is typical of cancer cells. FRα is overexpressed in different cancers, especially high-grade serous ovarian cancer (OC), and its expression remains constant without being influenced by systemic therapies, thus representing an ideal therapeutic target.

MIRV is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) conjugating an anti-FRα antibody to the tubulin disruptor maytansinoid DM4 via a cleavable linker. FRα expression can be tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using FOLR1–2.1, a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb). After proving activity in patients with FRα-positive (IHC 2+ in ≥ 25% of tumor cells) platinum-resistant OC (overall response rate [ORR] 26%), MIRV outcomes were evaluated according to FRα expression. The evaluation demonstrated that high-FRα levels (IHC 2+ in ≥ 75% of tumor cells) were associated with better ORR.

MIRV efficacy in patients with FRα-high platinum-resistant OC was specifically evaluated in the single-arm phase I SORAYA trial. The study met its primary endpoint, achieving an ORR of 32.4%, leading to the FDA approval of MIRV for patients with pretreated FRα-positive, platinum-resistant OC, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Importantly, in FORWARD I — a phase III trial enrolling patients with FRα-positive platinum-resistant OC — MIRV did not improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared with single-agent chemotherapy in the intention-to-treat population.

### Prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in adult gluten-sensitive enteropathy at diagnosis: role of B12, folate, and genetics [^114Cgyi2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to investigate hyperhomocysteinemia, a risk factor for thrombosis, miscarriages, and osteoporosis. This condition might arise from acquired folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies and from a C677T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. Undiagnosed gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) is linked to vitamin deficiencies, osteoporosis, and miscarriages. We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors for hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with newly diagnosed GSE.

- **Methods**: In this prospective study conducted in a tertiary care setting, 40 consecutive subjects with newly diagnosed GSE were evaluated for homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12 levels and for C677T polymorphism. One hundred twenty sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects were studied. Nonparametric tests and multiple regression analysis were used to evaluate the risk factors inducing hyperhomocysteinemia in the GSE population.

- **Results**: Hyperhomocysteinemia was more frequent in GSE patients than in control subjects (8/40, 20.0% vs. 7/120, 5.8%) (relative risk, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–8.9), as was folate deficiency (17/40, 42.5% vs. 10/120, 8.3%) (relative risk, 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.5–10.2). Multiple regression analysis revealed that folate and B12 levels were independently and inversely associated with homocysteine levels. However, homozygosity for the MTHFR thermolabile variant was not significantly associated. The prevalence of the MTHFR variant in the GSE population did not differ from that reported in racially comparable control groups. The adoption of a gluten-free diet was able to normalize folate and vitamin B12 levels in the GSE patients evaluated.

### Antibodies in the diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of psychotic disorders [^115PVMSL]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Low credibility.

NMDAR antibodies have been shown to disrupt neuronal glutamatergic signaling. It is possible that when detected in individuals with psychosis, these individuals may have a primarily glutamatergic rather than dopaminergic pathology. Furthermore, response to antipsychotic treatment in psychosis is associated with dopaminergic pathology, and nonresponse is associated with glutamatergic pathology. However, no study at the time of writing has assessed glutamatergic and/or dopaminergic function in NMDAR antibody-positive patients with psychosis.

Interestingly, there is some evidence that neuronal autoantibodies may be most frequently identified in subgroups of patients with psychosis that have classically been considered more "organic" in nature, for example, childhood-onset psychosis, postpartum psychosis, or psychosis associated with epilepsy. These studies did not specifically assess immunotherapy response. In the epilepsy literature, there is evidence that the presence of neuronal autoantibodies in chronic refractory "idiopathic" epilepsies indicates an increased likelihood of preferential response to immunotherapies over standard antiepileptic medications. This raises the intriguing possibility that neuronal autoantibody status in these psychoses may index immunotherapy-responsiveness over antipsychotic-responsiveness.

Further, NMDAR antibodies may indicate that a patient will have an adverse response to antipsychotic medications, with increased rates reported of rhabdomyolysis and neuroleptic-malignant syndrome-type reactions, as well as extrapyramidal symptoms.

### Macrophages in ovarian cancer and their interactions with monoclonal antibody therapies [^116p6EcZ]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Depletion of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) via monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a significant area of research due to the extensive pro-tumoral activity displayed by TAMs in ovarian cancer. Several monoclonal antibody therapies have aimed to deplete their presence in the tumor microenvironment (TME).

Firstly, C–C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) drives the recruitment of monocytes expressing C–C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) from the blood into the ovarian TME, with densities of intra-tumoral TAMs and cells expressing CCL2 positively correlating. CCL2 is frequently highly abundant in the tumor parenchyma, stroma, and ascites and is secreted by both tumor cells and supportive cells, such as TAMs themselves, to drive a positive recruitment feedback loop.

Secondly, colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) is a hematopoietic growth factor that binds to the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) expressed on monocytes and macrophages. In addition to acting as a chemokine for monocytes, CSF-1 also promotes their survival and differentiation into TAMs, generating a phenotype skewed towards M2-associated immunosuppressive activity in the absence of additional signals. In ovarian cancer, high levels of CSF-1 in the serum and ascites are associated with poorer patient outcomes. In one cohort of patients, co-expression of CSF-1 and CSF-1R in ovarian metastatic lesions was associated with decreased progression-free survival (PFS).

Monoclonal antibodies targeted against CCL2 and CSF-1R to reduce TAM recruitment and/or survival have been investigated in phase I clinical trials involving ovarian cancer patients (NCT02526017). With respect to anti-CCL2 mAbs, further research in an ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model is ongoing.

### Characterization of folate receptor alpha (FRα) expression in archival tumor and biopsy samples from relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer patients: A phase I expansion study of the FRα-targeting antibody-drug conjugate mirvetuximab soravtansine [^1144hcj8]. Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is considered a malignancy particularly amenable to the application of FRα-targeting therapeutics. The development of highly selective, directed therapies of this type has necessitated reliable quantification of tumor FRα expression in order to use this measure as a response-predictive biomarker for patient selection.

The initial clinical evaluations of the first folate receptor-targeting agents, such as the humanized antibody farletuzumab and the folate-cytotoxic agent conjugate vintafolide, provided critical proof-of-concept evidence for FRα as a druggable target for cancer treatment; unfortunately, these agents exhibited only modest single-agent activity and neither demonstrated meaningful efficacy over chemotherapy alone when evaluated as part of combination regimens in advanced-stage, recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (reEOC) in Phase III trials. Of note, it has been suggested that a contributing factor to these disappointing results, at least for farletuzumab, was a lack of a priori patient selection for FRα expression. In contrast, mirvetuximab soravtansine as monotherapy has shown encouraging evidence of clinical activity in the setting of platinum-resistant disease in early human studies, sufficient to prompt the initiation of a pivotal Phase III monotherapy trial in this patient population (FORWARD I).

Accurate assessment of a patient's receptor status has important prognostic and diagnostic implications for the development of FRα-selective investigational agents, particularly in light of the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).

Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

**Statistical considerations**: Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and baseline characteristics, and additional analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4). For the safety evaluations, baseline was defined as the last available assessment prior to Cycle 1, Day 1, and any adverse event with the same onset date as the start of study treatment or later was reported as treatment-emergent. For the efficacy assessments, all response-evaluable patients who had a post-baseline assessment were included in the objective response rate analyses, along with the corresponding exact 95% confidence intervals based on the Clopper-Pearson method. Progression-free survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Subgroup analysis of objective response rate and progression-free survival by FRα expression level was conducted to evaluate the relationship between receptor expression and antitumor activity. No formal statistical hypothesis was tested for association between expression and response.

### Impact of clinical factors on accuracy of ovarian cancer detection via platelet RNA profiling [^114oppcb]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

When comparing our findings with the existing OC detection methods, we noted significant advancements. The deep learning–based imPlatelet tool by Pastuszak et al. exemplifies the potential of platelet-based diagnostics, achieving up to 88% specificity but at a lower 95% sensitivity (ROC AUC = 0.95). In our previous work based on LogReg, we reached 72% sensitivity at a 99% specificity threshold in early-stage OC detection. Gao et al, by combining the platelet RNA and CA-125, reached 85.3% specificity at 86.4% sensitivity across samples from various stages, and 73.2% sensitivity at an 86.0% specificity in the case of early-stage detection in OC classification involving the combination of platelet RNA and CA-125. This was not feasible in our case because of the lack of CA-125 marker data for asymptomatic controls.

Another liquid biopsy type used for OC detection is cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Cohen et al. developed a blood-based CancerSEEK diagnostic test, which comprised protein biomarker concentrations and cfDNA (circulating tumor DNA), reaching a remarkable 98% OC detection level and 70% mean detection for other cancer types. However, this test for samples collected from patients with stage I disease showed only a 40% sensitivity. Wong et al. and Rahaman et al. achieved 96.6% and 99.2% sensitivity, respectively, at a 99% specificity for cancer detection and approximately 99% sensitivity for OC detection using the semi-naïve Bayesian machine-learning model (CancerA1DE) and average 1-dependent estimators model (CancerEMC) on the CancerSEEK dataset.

### Safety and anti-tumour activity of the IgE antibody MOv18 in patients with advanced solid tumours expressing folate receptor-alpha: A phase I trial [^116dHaCG]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In this trial, we performed a basophil activation test (BAT) ex vivo on whole unfractionated blood from each patient just prior to dosing. This was done to address concerns that MOv18 IgE bound to endogenous Fcε receptors might be cross-linked by endogenous antibodies or other circulating factors. The BAT results remained negative for all patients, except for one who developed anaphylaxis on their first exposure to MOv18 IgE. The episode resolved rapidly and did not recur after the withdrawal of the drug. This patient demonstrated a positive BAT at baseline, prior to any exposure to MOv18 IgE.

We hypothesize that, in this single patient, both anaphylaxis and the positive BAT at baseline reflected the presence of an endogenous circulating factor able to cross-link the MOv18 IgE antibodies bound to receptors on the surface of effector cells. One such candidate may be autoantibodies to the oligosaccharide galactose-α−1,3-galactose (alpha-GAL). Subjects with an endogenous IgE response against this post-translational modification on a therapeutic antibody have been reported to develop Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions during treatment with some monoclonal antibodies.

Development of anti-alpha-GAL IgE antibodies following treatment with MOv18 IgE was detected in three patients in our trial, but it was not associated with any clinical sequelae. Furthermore, seropositivity to alpha-GAL was not detected, before or after treatment with MOv18 IgE, in the patient who experienced anaphylaxis.

### Characterization of folate receptor alpha (FRα) expression in archival tumor and biopsy samples from relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer patients: A phase I expansion study of the FRα-targeting antibody-drug conjugate mirvetuximab soravtansine [^117QPNLd]. Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Clinical activity based on FRα expression**: All 27 patients were evaluable for efficacy and included in the analyses. Figure 2 plots changes in patient target lesion burden as a function of time, with individuals grouped according to FRα levels. Regardless of the tissue source analyzed (archival or pre-treatment biopsy), higher FRα expression was associated with greater antitumor activity. Confirmed tumor responses were observed in 6 patients, comprising 2 complete responses (CR) and 4 partial responses (PR), for an overall objective response rate (ORR) of 22%.

When patients were sorted based on archival FRα positivity, the ORR in the cohort of patients with high FRα expression was 31% (5/16), which included the two CRs. This was compared to 20% (1/5 patients) observed in the medium cohort and a lack of any objective responses in individuals with low FRα-expressing tumors. Further evidence of a trend toward improved outcomes in patients with higher receptor expression was provided by the progression-free survival (PFS) results. The median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 5.4 months) for the overall population, 5.4 months (2.8, −) for the high FRα cohort, 3.9 months (2.6, 12.7) for the medium subset, and 2.8 months (1.3, 5.4) for the low expressers.

### Loss of function variants contribute to cerebral folate deficiency by downregulating expression [^112xLz3v]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

It was previously reported that high titres of FOLR1 autoantibody are associated with the CFD phenotype and can functionally block the ability of FOLR1 to bind and transport folates. CIC deficiency was previously reported to promote T cell differentiation and induce autoimmunity, so we expected to detect FOLR1 autoantibody in the CIC p.R353X carrier. However, we observed that the serum FOLR1 autoantibody levels varied at different time points. This result is consistent with an earlier report by Ramaekers and coworkers on the variable levels of FOLR1 autoantibodies over time. Autoantibodies to FOLR1 were also reported to respond to folate supplementation, so folate serum concentrations may be a modifier of FOLR1 autoantibodies and FOLR1 expression. It has also been reported that folate supplementation results in a loss of significant correlations between folate, homocysteine, and autoantibodies concentrations. The lack of correlation between autoantibodies in this patient and serum blocking of FOLR1-folate binding indicates that autoantibodies, serum, and CFD folate concentrations may vary over time and thereby influence day-to-day physiology. Consequently, the impact of FOLR1 and CIC on CFD should be examined on more than one occasion to avoid detection of spurious depressed or elevated readings. A large CFD-control cohort with multiple sampling time points for folate, CSF folate, and FOLR1 autoantibody data are required to best determine whether CIC deficiency also increases the risk of FOLR1 autoantibodies and thereby also contributes to CFD risk.

### Cerebral folate deficiency presenting as adolescent catatonic schizophrenia: a case report [^116oGrcq]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Cerebral folate deficiency presents during infancy with irritability, deceleration of head growth, seizures, and progressive cognitive and motor impairment. Although low serum folate levels have been found in patients with schizophrenia, we describe the first case of cerebral folate deficiency presenting as catatonic schizophrenia. A 13-year-old previously healthy boy presented to our hospital with a 17-month history of schizophrenic symptoms with progressively worsening catatonia. On admission, he demonstrated near-complete mutism, frequent enuresis and encopresis, and severe psychomotor retardation. Our initial diagnostic evaluations, including brain magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, and routine metabolic tests, were normal. A lumbar puncture done to look for neurotransmitter defects or cerebral folate deficiency revealed low levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (31 nmol/L; reference range, 40–150 nmol/L). He also had elevated titers of folate receptor-blocking antibodies. He was treated for the next 9 months with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (folinic acid), but his catatonia was unchanged.

### Lack of association between folate receptor autoantibodies and conotruncal congenital heart defects [^112BQPDr]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Conotruncal cardiac defects are partially prevented by maternal folic acid supplementation. However, the biochemical mechanism remains unknown. Maternal autoantibodies to folate receptors, which were previously associated with an increased risk for neural tube defects, might also account for this protective effect.

This study aimed to examine the titers of folate receptor-blocking autoantibodies in mothers of children with conotruncal congenital heart defects and compare them to those in the general population. Serum samples were obtained from 22 women whose pregnancies included conotruncal congenital heart malformations. These samples were analyzed for autoantibodies against [(3)H] folic acid-labeled folate receptors, the quantitative amounts of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM autoantibodies to the folate receptor, and the ability to block-bind folic acid to receptors.

No elevated levels of antibodies binding to [(3)H] folic acid-labeled folate receptors were found. Furthermore, there was no difference in antifolate receptor alpha-IgG or IgM median levels between the cases (261 vs. 240 μg/mL) and control subjects (773 vs. 924 μg/mL). There was no increased blocking of folic acid binding between the cases (0.69 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval, 0.006–0.01) and control subjects (0.69 ng/mL; 95% CI, 0.003–0.013).

Although epidemiologic evidence suggests that periconceptual folic acid may prevent many conotruncal congenital heart defects, this study suggests that the presence of maternal autoantibodies to the folate receptor is unlikely to explain this effect.

### Soliris [^1135v4L6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of Soliris or other eculizumab products.

The immunogenicity of Soliris has been evaluated using two different immunoassays for the detection of anti-eculizumab antibodies:

- **Direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)**: This assay uses the Fab fragment of eculizumab as a target and was used for the PNH indication.

- **Electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) bridging assay**: This assay uses the whole eculizumab molecule as a target and was used for the aHUS, gMG, and NMOSD indications, as well as for additional patients with PNH.

In the PNH population, antibodies to Soliris were detected in 3 out of 196 (2%) patients using the ELISA assay and in 5 out of 161 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. In the aHUS population, antibodies to Soliris were detected in 3 out of 100 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. In the gMG population, none of the 62 adult patients and 11 pediatric patients had antibodies to Soliris detected following the 26-week active treatment. In the NMOSD population, antibodies to Soliris were detected in 2 out of 96 (2%) patients during the entire treatment period.

An ECL-based neutralizing assay with a low sensitivity of 2 mcg/mL was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies for the 5 patients with PNH.

### Safety and anti-tumour activity of the IgE antibody MOv18 in patients with advanced solid tumours expressing folate receptor-alpha: a phase I trial [^115gehi6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

FRα was chosen as the target for testing IgE therapy in a clinical trial. This tumour-associated antigen is present at very low levels in normal tissues but is expressed in a range of solid tumours. Several IgG-based antibody therapies targeted to FRα have been tested clinically, with the recent approval of mirvetuximab soravtansine further validating this target. Our pre-clinical evidence supporting superior anti-tumour activity of FRα-targeting IgE suggests a route to improvement of earlier clinical results with anti-FRα IgG. Tumour types most commonly expressing FRα with the IHC used in this trial were epithelial ovarian/tubal and endometrial cancers. We observed preliminary evidence of MOv18 IgE anti-tumour activity in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, with a fall in CA125 and tumour shrinkage in a patient with chemotherapy-resistant disease. If this is confirmed in subsequent clinical development, this antibody may join the growing immunotherapy armamentarium in FRα-positive cancers. More broadly, these results offer the opportunity to generate a new class of IgE antibody cancer therapies specific for other antigens already validated as targets for IgG drugs.

### Severity and phenotype of bullous pemphigoid relate to autoantibody profile against the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of the BP180 ectodomain [^1135EdBm]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid, the most common autoimmune subepidermal bullous disorder, is associated with autoantibodies targeting antigenic sites clustered within the extracellular domain of BP180. To investigate the epitope and subclass specificity of autoantibodies in bullous pemphigoid, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay utilizing baculovirus-expressed recombinant forms of the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of the extracellular domain of BP180. We examined sera obtained from patients with active bullous pemphigoid (n = 116) and controls (n = 100).

Ninety-three (80%) and 54 (47%) of the 116 bullous pemphigoid sera recognized the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions, respectively, of the extracellular domain of BP180.

- **Efficiency of the assay**: This novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is highly specific (98%) and sensitive (93%) as 108 of 116 bullous pemphigoid sera reacted with at least one of the baculovirus-derived recombinants.
- **Immunoglobulin class distribution**: In active bullous pemphigoid, autoantibodies against the NH2-terminus of the extracellular domain of BP180 were predominantly of the IgG1 class. A dual IgG1 and IgG4 response to this region was related to more severe skin involvement.
- **Mucosal lesions**: Autoreactivity against both the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions was more frequently detected in patients with mucosal lesions.
- **Disease severity correlation**: Levels of IgG (and IgG1) against the NH2-terminal, but not against the COOH-terminal portion of the extracellular domain of BP180, reflected disease severity. This indicates that autoantibodies against the NH2-terminus are critical in the pathogenesis of the disease.

### Juvenile onset central nervous system folate deficiency and rheumatoid arthritis [^1119mcfK]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Isolated cerebral folate deficiency was detected in a 13-year-old girl with cognitive and motor difficulties and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Her serum contains autoantibodies that block membrane-bound folate receptors located on the choroid plexus, which diminish the uptake of folate into the spinal fluid. Although her serum folate exceeded 21 ng/mL, her spinal fluid contained only 3.2 ng/mL of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a consequence of the autoantibodies diminishing its uptake.

### A prospective study of the prevalence of undiagnosed coeliac disease in laboratory defined iron and folate deficiency [^111M2Hm5]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: To determine the prevalence of coeliac disease in a group of patients in the community who have been shown in the laboratory to have iron and/or folate deficiency. Additionally, to assess the cost efficiency of this laboratory-based case-finding strategy.
- **Methods**: The study was undertaken in a large general hospital in the UK, serving a population of 300,000. Three hundred and thirty-three eligible patients with iron and/or folate deficiency were identified and contacted over an 18-month period. Case finding was performed by testing for coeliac disease using serological methods, followed by subsequent histological confirmation.
- **Results**: Of the 333 eligible and contactable patients with iron and/or folate deficiency, 258 (77%) consented to coeliac disease antibody testing. Twenty-eight patients (10.9%) tested positive for coeliac disease antibodies. Of these, 24 patients proceeded to endoscopy and biopsy, resulting in 12 cases of histologically confirmed coeliac disease (4.7% [95% confidence interval, 2.1% to 6.8%] of patients tested for coeliac disease antibodies).
- **Conclusions**: This laboratory-based methodology detected a considerable number of new coeliac disease cases in the community. Many of these patients did not present with clinical findings suggestive of malabsorption and might not otherwise have been diagnosed. Laboratory-based methodologies should be considered in conjunction with other strategies for the early identification and treatment of coeliac disease.

### Safety and anti-tumour activity of the IgE antibody MOv18 in patients with advanced solid tumours expressing folate receptor-alpha: A phase I trial [^115XaKVn]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Twenty of 24 patients, who had at least one on-treatment CT scan, were evaluable for efficacy. Six patients continued dosing into the maintenance period, with a best response of stable disease according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) criteria. One patient with platinum-resistant mixed high-grade serous and endometrioid ovarian carcinoma treated at 700 μg/week exhibited a 52% reduction of the serum CA125 tumour marker concentration in cycles 1 and 2. This marker reduction was not sustained beyond 28 days, therefore not meeting formal Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria for response. This patient's on-treatment scan after 6 weeks revealed resolution of ascites and short-lived shrinkage of peritoneal tumour deposits, not amounting to RECIST partial response. The scan and tumour marker at 12 weeks demonstrated disease progression, following per protocol reduction of dosing frequency to two-weekly. This evidence of anti-tumour activity was seen in a patient who had derived little benefit from conventional chemotherapy. Their previous treatment course was notable for relapse within five months of adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by six cycles of weekly paclitaxel without response. At the time of trial enrolment, this patient was aged 62 and had a performance status of zero. Membrane FRα expression was observed on 10% of their tumour cells (range for recruited patients 10–95%).

### Characterization of folate receptor alpha (FRα) expression in archival tumor and biopsy samples from relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer patients: A phase I expansion study of the FRα-targeting antibody-drug conjugate mirvetuximab soravtansine [^113C7rWM]. Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

A number of experimental FR-targeting agents have undergone clinical evaluation, including the humanized anti-FRα monoclonal antibody farletuzumab and the small molecule folate-cytotoxic agent conjugate vintafolide. While well tolerated in human studies, the development of these agents has been hampered due to a lack of meaningful single-agent activity in ovarian cancer patients and only modest efficacy in pivotal trials. Notably, the ability of FRα to internalize large molecules makes this receptor well suited for antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)-based therapeutic approaches.

ADCs are complex engineered molecules comprised of a monoclonal antibody, directed toward tumor-associated antigens, conjugated via a stable linker to a potent cytotoxic agent. In this manner, ADCs couple the targeting and pharmacokinetic features of the antibody moiety with the additional cancer-killing impact of the cytotoxic payload. Mirvetuximab soravtansine (IMGN853) is an ADC consisting of a humanized anti-FRα antibody linked to the maytansinoid DM4. High affinity binding of the conjugate to FRα, followed by internalization, results in intracellular accumulation of DM4, which subsequently acts as a potent antimitotic agent through its ability to suppress microtubule dynamics.

In addition, the cleavable linker incorporated into mirvetuximab soravtansine allows active DM4 metabolites to diffuse into proximal tumor cells and kill them, an effect termed bystander killing. Confirming design expectations, mirvetuximab soravtansine exhibits robust antitumor activity against FRα-expressing tumors.

### Folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine generates immunity in breast and ovarian cancer patients [^115vrmPy]. Clinical Cancer Research (2018). Low credibility.

Folate receptor alpha (FR) is overexpressed in several cancers, and endogenous immunity to FR has been demonstrated in patients, suggesting the feasibility of targeting FR with vaccines or other immune therapies. CD4 helper T cells are central to the development of coordinated immunity, with prior work showing their importance in protecting against relapse. Our previous identification of degenerate HLA-class II epitopes from human FR led to the development of a broad coverage epitope pool potentially useful in augmenting antigen-specific immune responses in most patients.

We conducted a phase I clinical trial testing the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine. We enrolled patients with ovarian or breast cancer who had completed conventional treatment and showed no evidence of disease. Patients were initially treated with low-dose cyclophosphamide and then vaccinated six times, monthly. Immunity and safety were examined during the vaccine period and up to one year later.

Vaccination was well tolerated in all patients. The vaccine elicited or augmented immunity in more than 90% of patients examined. Unlike recall immunity to tetanus toxoid (TT), FR T-cell responses developed slowly over the course of vaccination, with a median time to maximal immunity of five months. Despite the slow development of immunity, responsiveness appeared to persist for at least 12 months. These results demonstrate that it is safe to augment immunity to the FR tumor antigen, and the developed vaccine is testable for therapeutic activity in most patients whose tumors express the receptor.

### Genetic assessment and folate receptor autoantibodies in infantile-onset cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) syndrome [^116neMBd]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) syndromes are defined as neuro-psychiatric conditions with low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) folate. They can be attributed to different causes, such as autoantibodies against the folate receptor-alpha (FR) protein that can block folate transport across the choroid plexus, FOLR1 gene mutations, or mitochondrial disorders. High-dose folinic acid treatment restores many neurologic deficits.
- **Study aims and methods**: Among 36 patients from 33 families, the infantile-onset CFD syndrome was diagnosed based on typical clinical features and low CSF folate. All parents were healthy. Three families had two affected siblings, while parents from four families were first cousins. We analyzed serum FR autoantibodies and the FOLR1 and FOLR2 genes. Among three consanguineous families, homozygosity mapping attempted to identify a monogenetic cause. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in the fourth consanguineous family, where two siblings also suffered from polyneuropathy as an atypical finding.
- **Results**: Boys (72%) outnumbered girls (28%). Most patients (89%) had serum FR autoantibodies fluctuating over 5–6 weeks. Two children had a genetic FOLR1 variant without pathological significance. Homozygosity mapping failed to detect a single autosomal recessive gene. WES revealed an autosomal recessive polynucleotide kinase 3' phosphatase (PNKP) gene abnormality in the siblings with polyneuropathy.

Infantile-onset CFD was characterized by serum FR autoantibodies as its predominant pathology, whereas pathogenic FOLR1 gene mutations were absent. Homozygosity mapping excluded an autosomal recessive gene beyond the PNKP in siblings with polyneuropathy.

### Loss of function variants contribute to cerebral folate deficiency by downregulating expression [^112gvp7Y]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Folic acid binding assay: The FA surface binding activity of HeLa cells stably expressing GFP, GFP-CIC WT, or GFP-CIC p.R353X was determined (Figure 6A). As expected, the CIC p.R353X variant reduced HeLa cells' ability to bind FA by twofold (p < 0.01) compared with wildtype GFP-CIC. The concentration of folate in iPSCs derived from the patient was also determined (Figure 6B). Folate concentration was decreased by 25% (p < 0.05) in iPSCs derived from the CIC p.R353X variant carrier when compared with iPSCs derived from a control donor lacking the CIC LoF variant.
- **Effect of CIC variants**:
	- **Folic acid surface binding**: by HeLa cells stably expressing GFP, GFP-CIC WT, or GFP-CIC p.R353X. Cells were exposed to 5 nmol/L [3 H] folic acid, binding was calculated relative to GFP transfected cells (n ≥ 3, each carried out in duplicate), ✱✱ p < 0.01.
	- **Folate concentration**: in control iPSCs and family 1 proband iPSCs, ✱ p < 0.05.

FOLR1 autoantibody analysis: Multiple serum samples were collected from the patient with CFD and tested using the previously described microELISA assays for the detection of autoantibodies to FOLR1 and inhibition of FA binding to FOLR1. All samples tested positive for IgG autoantibodies to FOLR1, but the relative concentration of IgG was variable (patient range 1.7–52.2) over time (days 1, 8, 15, 22, 64, 131, 134, 236, and 293) (Figure 7A). The blocking of FA uptake and binding by patient serum was also variable (0.63–1.77 ng/mL) over the same timepoints (Figure 7B).

### Antibodies as biomarkers for cancer risk: A systematic review [^114V8xhr]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Over the past few decades, it is evident that a substantial body of work has been undertaken to identify the most immunogenic TAAs and their associated tumor-reactive antibodies and autoantibodies, with the end goal being the development of assays to measure the presence of such antibodies (alone or in combination with other markers) for use in cancer screening and diagnostics. Many of these studies have focused on cancers where screening tests are currently lacking, such as in lung cancers, hepatocellular carcinomas, and ovarian cancers, in which earlier detection and prompt clinical intervention could provide substantial survival benefits.

Some autoantibodies were frequently observed in association with multiple cancer types. For example, anti-p53 antibodies are detected in breast, colorectal, esophageal, lung, and ovarian cancers. While the detection of anti-p53 antibodies alone is not a very sensitive marker for cancer, a combination with other antibody biomarkers and clinical characteristics could provide additional value for risk stratification. Anti-MUC1 antibodies mark another autoantibody found to be associated with several cancer types and appear to correlate with a more favorable prognosis. MUC1 (also known as CA 15.3) is a transmembrane mucin, a glycoprotein with O-glycosylated tandem repeats, overexpressed in cancer, particularly in breast cancer. MUC1 has also been found aberrantly glycosylated in cancer compared to normal tissue, and some reported anti-MUC1 antibodies are actually against these aberrantly glycosylated variants.

### Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with anti-ITPR1 antibodies [^1168RgTJ]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Over the following two years, her neurologic status worsened, and she became unable to walk unassisted. CSF analysis and neuroimaging were unchanged. Three cycles of IV immunoglobulin (2 g/kg) were attempted without clinical benefit. Thereafter, she stabilized but remained severely disabled. Anti-Purkinje cell autoantibodies were persistently positive in the serum and were later characterized as anti-ITPR1 antibodies.

Following familial genetic counseling, she tested positive for a detrimental germline mutation in the BRCA1 gene that was first identified in a relative affected with breast cancer (figure e-1). She thus entered a dedicated screening program for breast and ovarian cancers.

Six years later, a suspicious lymph node was detected on mammography. She underwent radical right mastectomy, revealing a bifocal ductal carcinoma (grade I; estrogen-receptor–positive (ER+) 100%, progesterone-receptor–positive (PR+) 90%, Her2/neu−), with two intramammary and one axillary metastatic lymph nodes. Immunopathology revealed substantial ITPR1 expression in both the breast tumor and the metastatic lymph nodes (figure 1, C-F). Local radiotherapy was considered unfeasible because of her comorbidities, and adjuvant tamoxifen was introduced. At six-month follow-up, she was considered in tumor remission; her neurologic status was unchanged.

### Genetic architecture of vitamin B12 and folate levels uncovered applying deeply sequenced large datasets [^111mdSYL]. PLoS Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

The association of identified sequence variants with other traits linked to B12 and folate levels reveals the underlying complexity. Rare mutations in some of the B12 genes, such as MMACHC, MMAA, MUT, CD320, TCN2, and CUBN, have been described in connection with rare conditions, including methylmalonic aciduria and megaloblastic anemia, which are all related to defects in B12 metabolism (OMIM database).

In addition, epidemiological studies have suggested a link between reduced B12 and folate levels and the risk of common conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and neurodegenerative disorders. To evaluate the effect of the B12 or folate variants on these conditions, we analyzed the association with coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and Alzheimer's disease using data obtained from deCODE's phenotype database.

As outlined in Table S10, variants associated with serum B12 or folate levels did not consistently affect the risk of the diseases tested. The B12 or folate increasing allele for some variants was weakly protective, while for others, it was weakly at risk. Only two loci, CUBN associated with CAD and MTHFR with stroke, were statistically significant (P < 0.0018), but these loci had opposite effects on these diseases.

B12 or folate deficiencies can lead to increased serum homocysteine. Yet, of all the B12 or folate loci tested, only two were significantly associated with homocysteine levels; the B12 or folate increasing allele decreased the homocysteine levels as expected. These loci included the folate-associated MTHFR variant, which was previously reported to associate with homocysteine.

### Targeting the folate receptor: Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to personalize cancer treatments [^113PpE9d]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

In cancer therapy, molecularly targeted agents have the potential to maximize antitumor efficacy while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. However, these agents may only be effective in specific tumor subtypes with defined genomic profiles. This emphasizes the importance of developing personalized cancer therapeutic strategies, such as the use of companion diagnostic tests, to appropriately select and treat patients who are likely to benefit from specific targeted therapies, thus leading to improvements in clinical and safety outcomes. A potential biological target is the folate receptor (FR), which has been shown to be overexpressed on the surface of many cancers, including tumors of the lungs and ovaries.
- **Design**: We carried out a literature search to identify how the FR can be a potential target for selected tumors and how the FR expression can be exploited by targeted therapies.
- **Results**: The two main therapeutic strategies for targeting the FR are based on the use of: (i) an anti-FR antibody (e.g. farletuzumab) and (ii) folate conjugates of folate-targeted chemotherapies and companion radiodiagnostic imaging agents (e.g. vintafolide and (99m)technetium-etarfolatide). Both of these strategies are being assessed in phase III trials.
- **Conclusions**: The important role that the FR plays in cancer development and progression has led to the development of FR-targeted therapeutic approaches. At the time of writing, the promising data observed in phase II clinical trials have not been confirmed in phase III studies. Accordingly, there is a need for further research.

### Safety and anti-tumour activity of the IgE antibody MOv18 in patients with advanced solid tumours expressing folate receptor-alpha: A phase I trial [^1116jBfD]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

- **Results**:

	- **Dose escalation**: Patients with any solid tumour expressing FRα, using our immunohistochemical assay (Fig. 2a, b), were eligible. All patients recruited to this trial had ovarian epithelial cancer (n = 21), tubal carcinoma (n = 3), or endometrial cancer (n = 2). A low prevalence of FRα expression was observed in other tumour types screened using our validated assay. Twenty-four patients (median age 61) were treated with up to six weekly MOv18 IgE infusions (Fig. 2c) after intradermal or skin prick testing (Fig. 2d; see Methods) at escalating doses ranging from the starting dose of 70 μg to 12 mg (Fig. 2e). Patients potentially benefitting (stable disease or response), and without intolerable toxicity, could continue with three subsequent two-weekly maintenance doses. All patients had received prior systemic therapy, and in many cases, were multiply pre-treated. The first patient developed symptomatic brain metastases after one 70 μg dose, and so was withdrawn and replaced. A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade 3 urticaria occurred in the second (250 μg) cohort, which was expanded. No further DLT was seen at this dose, but five patients in this cohort demonstrated a reaction to intradermal testing with MOv18 IgE prior to their first or second dose and were withdrawn. Intradermal testing was replaced by the skin prick test for subsequent recruitment, and three further patients safely received multiple 250 μg doses. A dose-limiting toxicity of anaphylaxis occurred in the third (500 μg) cohort, which was expanded to six patients without further DLT.

### A phase I trial of CT900, a novel α-folate receptor-mediated thymidylate synthase inhibitor, in patients with solid tumors with expansion cohorts in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer [^111haTTT]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Low credibility.

Translational relevance

The α-folate receptor (α-FR) is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors, including high-grade serous ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. CT900 is a small-molecule thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor that binds to and is taken up by α-FR. This is the first clinical trial to show reproducible single-agent responses caused by a small molecule in α-FR–overexpressing cancers. The toxicity profile did not show classical TS inhibitor toxicity, such as myelosuppression, suggesting differential α-FR–mediated uptake in tumor tissue. This trial is proof of concept for developing α-FR–targeting small molecules that are selectively taken up in α-FR–overexpressing tumors for patient benefit and are an alternative approach to antibody-drug conjugates that already target α-FR.

### Characterization of folate receptor alpha (FRα) expression in archival tumor and biopsy samples from relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer patients: A phase I expansion study of the FRα-targeting antibody-drug conjugate mirvetuximab soravtansine [^117WfqHa]. Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Folate is a B vitamin that plays essential roles in cellular metabolism, as well as DNA synthesis, methylation, and repair. Since folate is lipophilic, it requires active transport into cells, primarily through interaction with the reduced folate carrier (RFC), a ubiquitously-expressed protein that binds folate and promotes cellular uptake via a bidirectional anion-exchange mechanism. Folate may also enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, facilitated by the folate receptor (FR) family of glycoproteins, the best-characterized member of which is folate receptor alpha (FRα).

In contrast to its highly restricted distribution pattern in normal tissues, aberrant over-expression of FRα is characteristic of a variety of epithelial tumors, including ovarian carcinoma. Although absent from normal ovarian epithelium, approximately 80% of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tumors constitutively express FRα; moreover, elevated receptor expression may be a negative prognostic factor concerning chemotherapeutic response in this malignancy. Thus, FRα has emerged as an attractive candidate for molecularly targeted approaches designed to exploit its differential distribution pattern as a novel avenue of therapeutic intervention in EOC.

### Association of vitamin D status and COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality [^11642W65]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in unprecedented suffering, morbidity, and mortality worldwide. The COVID-19 vaccine has promised to decrease COVID-19 prevalence, yet persistent vaccine hesitancy and barriers to vaccine access in racial and ethnic minority and underserved populations, coupled with emerging COVID-19 variants, are leading to new surges of infection. Thus, interventions to mitigate COVID-19 disease severity remain highly relevant due to disparities in individuals' ability to prevent or access effective therapies for COVID-19 and because of critical shortages of hospital beds.

Vitamin D deficiency, typically defined as 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/ml, is highly prevalent. Those who are at risk include the elderly (age > 65 years), obese individuals, and those residing in Northern latitudes with less sunlight. Several studies have demonstrated an independent association between vitamin D deficiency and testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Other observational studies have reported poorer clinical outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with vitamin D deficiency, but these studies have been relatively small or single-site. At the time of writing, randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19-related outcomes have demonstrated mixed results. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a variety of chronic health conditions (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease), yet randomized controlled trials are still needed to establish definitive causality and outcomes.

### Evaluation of laboratory-derived immunohistochemical assays for folate receptor α expression in epithelial ovarian cancer and comparison with a companion diagnostic [^113jiA1u]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The VENTANA FOLR1 (FOLR1–2.1) RxDx (FOLR1 CDx) assay, developed by Roche Tissue Diagnostics, is a Food and Drug Administration-approved immunohistochemical assay intended for use in the assessment of folate receptor α (FRα) expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal tumor specimens. No published reports have compared the performance of other available FRα antibodies with the approved FOLR1 CDx.
- **Objective**: To assess the performance of research FRα laboratory-developed tests compared with the FOLR1 CDx.
- **Design**: The performance of 6 FRα-targeting antibodies was compared with the approved FOLR1 CDx in normal fallopian tube specimens. Two antibodies were selected for further assessment and compared with the FOLR1 CDx in ovarian tumor specimens.
- **Results**: Of the 6 antibodies tested, 4 displayed a lack of specific membrane staining and/or high background, whereas 2 antibodies, produced by Leica Biosystems and Biocare Medical, respectively, exhibited specific and sensitive FRα staining. When assessed for their ability to correctly identify FRα-positive samples (per the FOLR1 CDx label, ≥ 75% of viable tumor cells with moderate and/or strong membranous staining intensity), both assays overpredicted FRα positivity compared with the FOLR1 CDx in archival ovarian tumor samples.
- **Conclusions**: These data highlight the need for caution in antibody selection when developing immunohistochemistry-based assays, as some antibodies failed to cleanly and specifically identify FRα expression. We identified two antibodies that showed specific and sensitive staining but tended to overpredict FRα positivity compared to the benchmark set by FOLR1 CDx.

### Safety and anti-tumour activity of the IgE antibody MOv18 in patients with advanced solid tumours expressing folate receptor-alpha: A phase I trial [^115VFcT4]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

All antibodies approved for cancer therapy are monoclonal IgGs. However, the biology of IgE, supported by comparative preclinical data, offers the potential for enhanced effector cell potency. Here, we report a Phase I dose escalation trial (NCT02546921) with the primary objective of exploring the safety and tolerability of MOv18 IgE, a chimeric first-in-class IgE antibody, in patients with tumours expressing the relevant antigen, folate receptor-alpha. The trial incorporated skin prick and basophil activation tests (BAT) to select patients at the lowest risk of allergic toxicity.

Secondary objectives included the exploration of anti-tumour activity, the recommended Phase II dose, and pharmacokinetics. Dose escalation ranged from 70 μg to 12 mg. The most common toxicity of MOv18 IgE is transient urticaria. A single patient experienced anaphylaxis, likely explained by detection of circulating basophils at baseline that could be activated by MOv18 IgE. The BAT assay was used to avoid enrolling further patients with reactive basophils.

The safety profile is tolerable, and the maximum tolerated dose has not been reached, with evidence of anti-tumour activity observed in a patient with ovarian cancer. These results demonstrate the potential of IgE therapy for cancer.

### Diagnosis and management of cerebral venous thrombosis: a statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^112WMt43]. Stroke (2011). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cerebral venous thrombosis, and more specifically with respect to screening for thrombophilia, AHA/ASA 2011 guidelines recommend considering testing for the following prothrombotic conditions in patients with CVT:

- **Protein C deficiency**: Testing for protein C deficiency is essential in identifying prothrombotic conditions.
- **Protein S deficiency**: Inclusion of protein S deficiency screening is crucial for a comprehensive thrombophilia assessment.
- **Antithrombin deficiency**: Antithrombin deficiency should be screened to prevent potential complications.
- **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: Identifying antiphospholipid syndrome can guide appropriate management strategies.
- **Prothrombin G20210A mutation**: Screening for the prothrombin G20210A mutation is important for assessing thrombosis risk.
- **Factor V Leiden**: Including Factor V Leiden testing helps in evaluating the overall risk of thrombophilia.

These recommendations are classified as Class IIa with a Level of Evidence B.

### Exploiting the folate receptor α in oncology [^115whkHX]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Folate receptor α (FRα) came into focus as an anticancer target many decades after the successful development of drugs targeting intracellular folate metabolism, such as methotrexate and pemetrexed. Binding to FRα is one of several methods by which folate is taken up by cells; however, this receptor is an attractive anticancer drug target owing to the overexpression of FRα in a range of solid tumors, including ovarian, lung, and breast cancers.

Furthermore, using FRα to better localize effective anticancer therapies to their target tumors using platforms such as antibody-drug conjugates, small-molecule drug conjugates, radioimmunoconjugates, and, more recently, chimeric antigen receptor T cells could further improve the outcomes of patients with FRα-overexpressing cancers. FRα can also be harnessed for predictive biomarker research. Moreover, imaging FRα radiologically or in real-time during surgery can lead to improved functional imaging and surgical outcomes, respectively.

In this review, we describe the status of research into FRα in cancer, including data from several late-phase clinical trials involving FRα-targeted therapies and the use of new technologies to develop FRα-targeted agents with improved therapeutic indices.

### A milk-free diet downregulates folate receptor autoimmunity in cerebral folate deficiency syndrome [^1149VNod]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

In cerebral folate deficiency syndrome, the presence of autoantibodies against the folate receptor (FR) explains decreased folate transport to the central nervous system and the clinical response to folinic acid. Autoantibody cross-reactivity with milk FR from different species prompted us to test the effect of a milk-free diet.

Intervention with a milk-free diet in 12 children (nine males, three females; mean age 6 years [SD 4 years 11 months], range 1–19 years) decreased autoantibody titer significantly from 2.08 pmol of FR blocked per mL of serum (SD 2.1; range 0.24–8.35) to 0.35 pmol (SD 0.49; range 0–1.32; p = 0.012) over 3 to 13 months, whereas FR autoantibody titer increased significantly to 6.53 (SD 6.08; range 0.54–14.07; p = 0.013) in nine children who were re-exposed to milk for 6 to 14 weeks.

In 12 children on a normal diet (eight males, four females; mean age 5 years 5 months [SD 4 years 1 month], range 1 year 6 months-16 years 4 months), the antibody titer increased significantly from 0.84 pmol of FR blocked per mL (SD 0.39; range 0.24–1.44) to 3.04 pmol (SD 1.42; range 0.84–6.01; p = 0.001) over 10 to 24 months.

Decreasing the autoantibody titer with a milk-free diet in conjunction with folinic acid therapy may be advocated for these patients.
