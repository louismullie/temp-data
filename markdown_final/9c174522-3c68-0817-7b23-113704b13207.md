## Question

Why are the TICH-2 results clinically significant for managing spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the TICH-2 results are clinically significant for managing spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and whether it answers a clinically relevant question. Then, I should verify the primary and key secondary outcomes and their statistical interpretation. Next, I will examine mechanistic signals and safety. After that, I need to check subgroup findings that might refine patient selection. I will then contextualize these results within the broader ICH literature and guidelines. Finally, I should synthesize practical clinical implications and acknowledge limitations before concluding with a balanced, reference-supported take-home message.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and its relevance. TICH-2 was a large, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of 2,325 adults with spontaneous ICH treated within 8 hours of onset, which directly addresses whether tranexamic acid improves functional outcomes in real-world acute ICH populations, and it used rigorous central randomization and blinded outcome assessment, strengthening internal validity and applicability to clinical practice [^f15c3e72] [^58ac63ef].

> I need to verify the primary outcome and its interpretation. The primary endpoint was a shift in the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days, and there was no statistically significant benefit with tranexamic acid versus placebo, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.88 and a 95% CI that crossed 1, so routine use to improve functional recovery is not supported by the primary analysis [^f15c3e72] [^d28cdade].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the key secondary signals. Tranexamic acid reduced hematoma expansion by about 1.37 mL on average and lowered the proportion of patients with expansion by roughly 4%, and it also reduced early deaths by day 7 and serious adverse events, all without increasing venous thromboembolism, which suggests a biologically meaningful antifibrinolytic effect even if it did not translate into a 90-day functional benefit in the overall cohort [^4c645b7c] [^d28cdade] [^f15c3e72].

> Wait, let me verify the safety profile because that matters for bedside decisions. There was no increase in thromboembolic events with tranexamic acid, and serious adverse events were fewer in the treatment arm, which is reassuring and distinguishes this agent from procoagulant strategies like recombinant factor VIIa that have shown increased arterial events without functional benefit in larger trials [^d28cdade] [^0c84c8bd].

> Next, I should review subgroup findings that might refine patient selection. A prespecified subgroup analysis found a significant interaction whereby patients with baseline systolic blood pressure ≤ 170 mmHg experienced a favorable shift in 90-day mRS with tranexamic acid, whereas those with SBP > 170 mmHg did not benefit, implying that lower SBP may identify a phenotype more likely to respond, possibly reflecting nonhypertensive etiologies or different clot biology and timing dynamics [^b57f4457] [^6f34b8c6].

> I will now examine the mechanistic and translational implications. The reduction in hematoma expansion aligns with the pathophysiology that early growth worsens outcomes, and the absence of a functional benefit in the overall population likely reflects modest absolute volume reduction, late treatment initiation for many patients, and heterogeneity of ICH causes and baseline severity, which together blunt the clinical effect size despite a real biological signal [^d28cdade] [^e403eb4f].

> Let me consider the broader evidence context to avoid overgeneralization. Prior hemostatic strategies such as recombinant factor VIIa reduced expansion but failed to improve functional outcomes and increased thrombotic events, whereas intensive blood pressure lowering improves functional outcomes in some trials, underscoring that not all mechanisms that limit growth translate into patient-centered benefit and that timing and patient selection are critical [^0c84c8bd] [^6f34b8c6].

> I should confirm how guidelines position this information. Contemporary AHA/ASA guidance states that while tranexamic acid produced a modest reduction in hematoma expansion and early death, there was no improvement in functional outcome, and it does not recommend routine use outside of trials, though it acknowledges the SBP interaction and supports continued research, including ultra-early administration and enriched selection strategies [^32b99962] [^d867d844].

> But wait, what if earlier treatment changes the calculus. The median time to randomization in TICH-2 was around 3.7 hours, and individual patient data meta-analyses suggest the probability of hematoma expansion declines steeply after the first few hours, so ultra-early administration within 2–3 hours and faster imaging-to-treatment times are plausible ways to amplify benefit, which is why ongoing trials like TICH-3 are testing earlier treatment windows and stricter selection [^e403eb4f] [^8039d088].

> I should double-check special populations. In antiplatelet-associated ICH, tranexamic acid still reduced expansion without a clear functional benefit signal, and in surgically managed patients, TXA did not reduce the need for surgery or improve postoperative outcomes, so routine use cannot be justified in these subgroups based on current data, though hypothesis-generating signals may inform future trials [^a1e77bff] [^68786fc7].

> Let me synthesize the clinical significance succinctly. TICH-2 is clinically significant because it provides high-quality evidence that tranexamic acid is safe and reduces hematoma expansion and early adverse events, but it does not improve 90-day functional outcomes in unselected patients, which means it should not be used routinely outside of research settings; however, the SBP ≤ 170 mmHg subgroup signal, the absence of thrombotic harm, and the time-sensitive biology of expansion together justify continued investigation of earlier administration and enriched selection, and they inform shared decision-making when expansion risk is high and treatment can be delivered promptly [^f15c3e72] [^b57f4457] [^d867d844].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical takeaways are explicit. Clinicians should prioritize evidence-based interventions with proven functional benefit, such as rapid blood pressure management and reversal of anticoagulation when indicated, while recognizing that tranexamic acid is not a standard-of-care therapy for spontaneous ICH but remains a reasonable option within trials or carefully selected scenarios where ultra-early treatment and low SBP may converge to benefit, pending confirmatory studies [^32b99962] [^d867d844].

---

TICH-2 is clinically significant because it is the **largest RCT to date** testing tranexamic acid in acute spontaneous ICH, showing a **modest reduction in hematoma expansion** and early deaths without improving 90-day functional outcomes [^f15c3e72] [^d28cdade]. It confirms **safety without excess thromboembolism** and identifies a **prespecified subgroup with SBP ≤ 170 mmHg** that may benefit, supporting further research into ultra-early treatment and patient selection [^b57f4457] [^6f34b8c6]. The trial informs guidelines that tranexamic acid is **not routine care** but may be considered in selected patients or trials, and highlights the need for faster treatment and better risk stratification [^d867d844] [^e403eb4f].

## Key findings and clinical implications

### Primary outcome

The primary outcome — functional status at 90 days — **did not differ significantly** between tranexamic acid and placebo (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.76–1.03, p = 0.11) [^f15c3e72] [^d28cdade].

---

### Secondary outcomes

- **Hematoma expansion**: Tranexamic acid reduced hematoma expansion (25% vs 29%; aOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66–0.98, p = 0.03) and the mean increase in hematoma volume (3.72 mL vs 4.90 mL; adjusted difference −1.37 mL, 95% CI −2.71 to −0.04, p = 0.043) [^4c645b7c].

- **Early mortality**: Fewer deaths occurred by day 7 in the tranexamic acid group (9% vs 11%; aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53–0.99, p = 0.0406), but this did not translate into a significant reduction in 90-day mortality (22% vs 21%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.77–1.10, p = 0.37) [^f15c3e72] [^4c645b7c].

- **Serious adverse events**: Tranexamic acid reduced serious adverse events by day 2 (33% vs 36%), day 7 (39% vs 43%), and day 90 (45% vs 48%) [^f15c3e72] [^d28cdade].

---

### Safety profile

Tranexamic acid was **safe**, with no significant increase in venous thromboembolism or arterial occlusive events, which is a critical consideration given the potential risk of thrombotic complications with hemostatic agents [^d28cdade] [^f15c3e72].

---

## Subgroup analyses and patient selection

A prespecified subgroup analysis identified a **significant interaction** between baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and treatment effect [^b57f4457]. Patients with SBP ≤ 170 mmHg benefited from tranexamic acid, with improved functional outcomes and reduced hematoma expansion, whereas those with SBP > 170 mmHg did not [^b57f4457] [^6f34b8c6]. This finding suggests that **patient selection based on baseline SBP** could optimize the therapeutic effect of tranexamic acid.

---

## Comparison with previous studies

TICH-2 builds on smaller, earlier studies that suggested potential benefits of tranexamic acid in ICH. However, it is the **first large-scale RCT** to provide robust evidence on its efficacy and safety, establishing that while tranexamic acid reduces hematoma expansion and early mortality, it does not significantly improve long-term functional outcomes in the general ICH population [^f94508e1] [^d28cdade].

---

## Clinical guidelines and current practice

Current clinical guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) state that the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in improving functional outcomes is **not well established** and recommend further research [^d867d844]. They acknowledge the modest reduction in hematoma expansion and early mortality but emphasize the lack of sustained functional benefit [^32b99962].

---

## Limitations and future research directions

Several limitations must be considered when interpreting TICH-2:

- **Treatment window**: The median time to treatment was approximately 3.7 hours, potentially missing the critical window for maximal benefit. Ultra-early administration (within 2 hours) may yield different results [^e403eb4f].

- **Patient heterogeneity**: The trial included a broad range of patients, potentially diluting the treatment effect. Future studies should focus on specific subgroups, such as those with SBP ≤ 170 mmHg or those with active hematoma expansion [^b57f4457].

- **Outcome measures**: The primary outcome (90-day mRS) may not capture delayed benefits. Longer follow-up periods and composite outcomes incorporating functional recovery may be needed [^22745007].

---

## Conclusion and clinical significance

TICH-2 is clinically significant because it provides high-quality evidence that tranexamic acid **reduces hematoma expansion and early mortality** without improving 90-day functional outcomes in unselected ICH patients [^f15c3e72]. It highlights the importance of patient selection, particularly baseline SBP, and supports further research into ultra-early administration and targeted subgroups [^b57f4457]. Clinically, tranexamic acid is **not recommended for routine use** in ICH but may be considered in selected patients or within clinical trials, pending further evidence [^d867d844].

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid for randomised controlled trials of antifibrinolytics and tranexamic acid up to Nov 27, 2017, using the terms "tranexamic acid" and "exp basal ganglia hemorrhage"or "intracranial hemorrhages" or "cerebral hemorrhage" or "intracranial hemorrhage, hypertensive". To identify further published, ongoing, and unpublished randomised controlled trials we scanned bibliographies of relevant articles and searched international registers of clinical trials in Nov 27, 2017. We searched for trials in all languages. The quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach. We found two small randomised controlled trials of tranexamic acid with a total of 54 participants, with no clear evidence of benefit or harm associated with tranexamic acid. Five further randomised controlled trials are ongoing.

Added value of this study

TICH-2 is, to our knowledge, the first large multicentre, international, randomised controlled trial of tranexamic acid in acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. It included an older population than in previous tranexamic acid trials after trauma and post-partum haemorrhage. Tranexamic acid was not associated with any significant improvement in functional outcome at 90 days, despite a significant reduction in the number of participants with haematoma expansion and fewer deaths by days 2 and 7 among those allocated tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid was safe, with fewer serious adverse events and no increase in thromboembolic events compared with placebo.

Implications of all the available evidence

Although there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of tranexamic acid in clinical practice for spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, the results do not exclude a possible small effect. The reductions in haematoma expansion and early deaths are promising, but larger randomised trials are needed to confirm or refute a clinically significant treatment effect. Future research should also investigate which subgroups of patients are most likely to benefit.

Therefore, the Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary IntraCerebral Haemorrhage (TICH-2) trial tested the hypothesis that intravenous tranexamic acid reduces death and dependence when given within 8 h of spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage.

CONCLUSION

In this post hoc analysis of surgically treated patients from the TICH-2 trial, we found no evidence that TXA given within 8 hours reduced surgery or improved outcome of surgically treated patients or postoperative HV. Earlier administration within 4.5 hours could potentially be more effective in preventing deterioration and the need for surgery. The ongoing TICH-3 trial of TXA (ISRCTN97693550) will examine this question in a larger cohort.

Conclusions

Pre‐ICH antiplatelet therapy is associated with an increased risk of hematoma expansion, neurological deterioration, death, and unfavorable functional outcome in spontaneous ICH. Trials of hemostatic therapies in ICH should include or even prioritize patients with antiplatelet therapy due to these reasons. Tranexamic acid did not have significantly greater benefit in patients with antiplatelet‐associated ICH, and its use in these patients needs to be further explored.

METHODS

This is post hoc analysis of data from the TICH-2 trial (ISRCTN93732214). The TICH-2 protocol has been published in detail (Figure 1). No ethical approval for this analysis of fully anonymized data. The TICH-2 trial was approved by Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and received approval by the National Research Ethics Service Committee East Midlands 23/11/2012, ref: 12/EM/0369. In brief, the TICH-2 trial was designed to measure the efficacy of TXA as an off-label investigational product to reduce death and dependency at 90 days after spontaneous ICH, measured by ordinal shift analysis of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (0–6). Consent was acquired from patients, relative proxies (or independent doctors when necessary) presenting within 8 hours of spontaneous ICH. Participants were randomized to receive intravenous TXA as a 1 g loading dose followed by a further infusion of 1 g over 8 hours or placebo, using a random allocation sequence generated using the trial packaging. Key eligibility criteria stipulated participants were adults with acute ICH admitted to a participating hospital within 8 h of stroke symptom onset (or time last seen well). Participants who underwent immediate surgery; had ICH secondary to anticoagulation, trauma, known structural abnormalities; prestroke dependence (mRS > 4); life expectancy < 3 months; and GCS < 5 were excluded. Routine care such as blood pressure lowering treatment, neurosurgery, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was recorded prospectively and provided at the discretion of local care providers.

Data Sharing

The trial data can be shared upon reasonable request to the corresponding author and trial steering committee.

Study Design and Population

We analyzed data from the TICH‐2 trial, which was a prospective multicenter randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial. Patients aged > 18 years with spontaneous ICH presenting within 8 hours of symptoms onset were eligible, while secondary (macrovascular or structural) causes of ICH were excluded. Patients who were taking anticoagulants at the time of ICH were excluded as well. Recruited patients were randomized 1:1 with minimization on key prognostic factors and stratification by country to receive 2 g of intravenous tranexamic acid or matching placebo. Detailed descriptions of the trial were previously published. 14, 15, 16

Outcomes

We compared hematoma expansion at 24‐hour, early outcomes (death and neurological deterioration within 7 days), and day 90 outcomes (modified Rankin Scale, disability, cognition, depression, and quality‐of‐life scores) between the antiplatelet and no‐antiplatelet groups. In the antiplatelet subgroup analysis, we explored the effects of tranexamic acid on hematoma characteristics and clinical outcomes. These outcomes were prespecified in the trial protocol. 15

Definitions

Hematoma expansion was defined as an increase of > 6 mL or > 33% in hematoma volume at 24‐hour computed tomography scan compared with baseline hematoma volume, measured using semiautomated segmentation technique with ITK‐SNAP version 3.6.0 software. 17, 18 Details on image acquisition and analyses were previously described. 19 A Modified Rankin Scale score of 4 to 6 was considered poor functional outcome.

The strengths of this study include the prespecified nature of the analyses within the context of the largest trial of haemostatic therapies in ICH with almost complete follow-up data. However, there are several limitations. First, we do not have data on what BP lowering medications patients were taking prior to their ICH. Therefore, we were unable to establish any association between the use of pre-ICH antihypertensives and prerandomisation baseline BP. This includes any BP lowering medication given after symptom onset of their ICH but before randomisation, which may have influenced the baseline BP recorded prior to randomisation. Second, there were few BP readings recorded in the trial; two measurements prerandomisation and two measurements on day 2. Therefore, we were unable to assess any effect of BP variability, which has been shown to be a stronger predictor of clinical outcome in acute ICHand ischaemic strokethan absolute BP. Nor could we adjust for early BP change within the first hours after ICH. Instead, we used the change in BP from baseline to day 2 to look for any associations with outcome. These analyses were within randomised treatment groups, are therefore observational, may represent chance and should be considered as hypothesis generating. Third, ICH aetiology was investigator-reported and largely determined by CT imaging. This may have led to less precise characterisation of ICH aetiology, particularly in those with mixed pathology. Last, given this is a subgroup analysis, our findings may represent chance. Although we did not adjust for multiplicity of testing, this subgroup analysis was prespecified in the statistical analysis plan of the main TICH-2 trial (including the SBP cut-point), has biological plausibility, had a positive interaction with treatment on outcome and followed the statistical analysis plan of the main TICH-2 trial.

In summary, this prespecified subgroup analysis of the TICH-2 trial demonstrated that randomisation to tranexamic acid in participants with baseline SBP ≤ 170 mm Hg was associated with less haematoma expansion and improved clinical outcomes across multiple domains both early and late after ICH. Future research should seek to establish which subgroups of patients may benefit from tranexamic acid in acute ICH, including by haemorrhage location, size and underlying aetiology including CAA. Whether BP lowering is additive or synergistic in the presence of tranexamic acid in acute ICH is unclear and future clinical trials may help to provide a clearer treatment paradigm for clinicians.

### Effects of blood pressure and tranexamic acid in spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: a secondary analysis of a large randomised controlled trial [^d560f11d]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

TICH-2 was an international prospective double-blind randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial that tested the safety and efficacy of intravenous tranexamic acid in people with acute spontaneous ICH within 8 hours of symptom onset. Details pertaining to the trial protocol and main results are published. Written consent was obtained from patients or their representatives before starting trial procedures.

Blood pressure

Baseline BP was measured immediately prior to randomisation and recorded on the randomisation form, a further two BP measurements were taken and recorded on day 2. We used the predefined baseline SBP cut-point used in the statistical analysis plan and main results paper of TICH-2: ≤ 170 mm Hg and > 170 mm Hg. This cut-point was the median baseline SBP found in acute ICH patients previously. We also assessed whether change in SBP from baseline to day 2, independent of baseline SBP, was associated with clinical outcome using categories applied in a previously published secondary analysis of a large acute stroke trial as follows: large decrease (> 15% decrease), moderate decrease (5%–15% decrease), no change (5% decrease to 5% increase, reference group), increase (> 5% increase). The association between SBP on day 2 and clinical outcome by treatment group was assessed in those with SBP ≤ 140 mm Hg and > 140 mm Hg and in 20 mm Hg increments across the range of day 2 SBP. Data on the number, route and class of antihypertensive medications used between randomisation and day 2 were collected.

Clinical outcomes

The primary outcome in TICH-2 was functional outcome measured using the mRS by trained assessors over telephone at day 90. Quality of life was recorded at day 90 using European Quality of Life 5-dimensions derived health utility status and European Quality of Life visual analogue scale. Safety outcomes included death and serious adverse events (SAEs) at day 2, day 7, discharge and day 90, and neurological status at day 7 using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). In addition, length of hospital stay was recorded.

Imaging outcomes

A baseline CT brain scan was performed prior to randomisation and a repeat CT scan at 24 ± 12 hours. Haematoma volumes were assessed by three independent raters blinded to clinical data using semiautomated segmentation tools of ITK-SNAP software V.3.6.0. Haematoma expansion was defined as an increase in haematoma volume on follow-up scan of > 33% or > 6 mL compared with the baseline scan.

### Effects of blood pressure and tranexamic acid in spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: a secondary analysis of a large randomised controlled trial [^b57f4457]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid reduced haematoma expansion and early death, but did not improve functional outcome in the tranexamic acid for hyperacute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage-2 (TICH-2) trial. In a predefined subgroup, there was a statistically significant interaction between prerandomisation baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the effect of tranexamic acid on functional outcome (p = 0.019).

Methods

TICH-2 was an international prospective double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial evaluating intravenous tranexamic acid in patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Prerandomisation baseline SBP was split into predefined ≤ 170and > 170mm Hg groups. The primary outcome at day 90 was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a measure of dependency, analysed using ordinal logistic regression. Haematoma expansion was defined as an increase in haematoma volume of > 33%or > 6mL from baseline to 24 hours. Data are OR or common OR (cOR) with 95% CIs, with significance at p < 0.05.

Results

Of 2325 participants in TICH-2, 1152 had baseline SBP ≤ 170mm Hg and were older, had larger lobar haematomas and were randomised later than 1173 with baseline SBP > 170mm Hg. Tranexamic acid was associated with a favourable shift in mRS at day 90 in those with baseline SBP ≤ 170mm Hg (cOR 0.73, 95%CI 0.59 to 0.91, p = 0.005), but not in those with baseline SBP > 170mm Hg (cOR 1.05, 95%CI 0.85 to 1.30, p = 0.63). In those with baseline SBP ≤ 170mm Hg, tranexamic acid reduced haematoma expansion (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.47 to 0.82, p = 0.001), but not in those with baseline SBP > 170mm Hg (OR 1.02, 95%CI 0.77 to 1.35, p = 0.90).

Conclusions

Tranexamic acid was associated with improved clinical and radiological outcomes in ICH patients with baseline SBP ≤ 170mm Hg. Further research is needed to establish whether certain subgroups may benefit from tranexamic acid in acute ICH.

### Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary intraCerebral haemorrhage (TICH-2): an international randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 superiority trial [^b2e2fe26]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

To date, the only intervention to improve functional outcome after intracerebral haemorrhage is early intensive blood pressure lowering. Although no significant effects on haematoma growth were detected in INTERACT-2, secondary analysis suggested that blood pressure lowering did attenuate bleeding in a dose-dependent manner. The interaction between baseline systolic blood pressure and treatment in our study suggests that participants with lower blood pressure were more likely to benefit from tranexamic acid. This finding could have been confounded by stroke severity, given that larger haematomas have increased blood pressure and worse outcomes.

Baseline haematoma volume is the strongest predictor of outcome after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, and in an exploratory post-hoc analysis, participants with a baseline haematoma volume of between 30 mL and 60 mL who received tranexamic acid seemed to have better outcomes (figure 3). Although this finding could be due to chance, it is also compatible with the notion that patients with moderately sized haematomas might be more likely to benefit from tranexamic acid, and hence could be targeted for future studies, as has been postulated with recombinant factor VIIa.

The strengths of this study include its double-blinding, allocation concealment, low risk of bias, high adherence to treatment, and very few missing data on primary outcomes. Treatment groups were well balanced for baseline factors. The use of approved brief and proxy consent processes allowed the rapid enrolment of patients without the capacity to consent, which is important to avoid bias in acute stroke studies. Our inclusion criteria were deliberately broad to reflect the clinical population and to facilitate recruitment from multiple international sites. Nevertheless, most participants were recruited from the UK. The study had several other limitations. We did not collect screening logs so are unable to present data on eligibility. Wide inclusion criteria led to a heterogeneous population with more severe strokes, larger haematoma volumes, and a greater proportion of lobar haematomas and intraventricular haemorrhage than populations in other intracerebral haemorrhage trials, which could have diluted any potential treatment effect. Finally, despite efforts to ensure rapid treatment, most participants were enrolled more than 3 h after the onset of intracerebral haemorrhage, which could explain the absence of a significant interaction with time in the subgroup analysis.

### Effect of tranexamic acid administration on remote cerebral ischemic lesions in acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a substudy of a randomized clinical trial [^5d21c955]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

The study TICH-2 (substudy) was published by Stefan Pszczolkowski and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Intracerebral hemorrhage. In the TICH-2 (substudy) study, the trial question was: what is the role of tranexamic acid on remote cerebral ischemic lesions in acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage? In the TICH-2 (substudy) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TICH-2 (substudy) study, the population was: 219 patients (93 female, 126 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage who underwent MRI. The key exclusion criteria were ICH secondary to anticoagulation; thrombolysis, contraindication to study drug; trauma or a known underlying structural abnormality. In the TICH-2 (substudy) study, the interventions were: n = 96 tranexamic acid (1 g in 100 mL intravenous bolus, followed by 1 g in 250 mL infusion within 8 hours of hemorrhage onset) n = 123 placebo (0.9% saline within 8 hours of hemorrhage onset). In the TICH-2 (substudy) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in DWI hypertense lesions (20.8% vs. 22.8%; OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.53). In the TICH-2 (substudy) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mean number of DWI hypertense lesions (1.75 vs. 1.81; MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.2). In the TICH-2 (substudy) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage who underwent MRI, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to a DWI hypertense lesions.

### Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary intraCerebral haemorrhage (TICH-2): an international randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 superiority trial [^ce4b78b7]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage is the cause of up to 20% of all strokes, yet accounts for nearly half of all stroke deaths worldwide. Survival after intracerebral haemorrhage has not changed for several decades, and the only intervention that improves functional outcome is early intensive blood pressure lowering.

Around a quarter of intracerebral haemorrhages are complicated by haematoma expansion, which most often occurs within the first few hours, but can occur at up to 24 h, and is associated with poor outcomes. Radiological markers, including the CT angiography (CTA) spot sign, have been used to try to predict which patients are at greater risk of haematoma expansion. Drug therapies aimed at limiting haematoma expansion include recombinant factor VII, but a meta-analysis of this and other haemostatic therapies found no benefit on functional outcome.

In patients with traumatic haemorrhage (including from head injuries), tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic drug, significantly reduces death due to bleeding and all-cause mortality, with no increase in vascular occlusive events. A post-hoc analysis of the CRASH-2 trial showed that because death due to bleeding occurred early after trauma, timely administration of tranexamic acid was necessary for patients to receive any benefit. A meta-analysis of tranexamic acid in traumatic intracranial haemorrhage showed that it was associated with a significant reduction in subsequent intracranial bleeding, and a larger trial is ongoing. Tranexamic acid also reduced the number of deaths due to bleeding in women with post-partum haemorrhage. Use of tranexamic acid after acute intracerebral haemorrhage has been tested in two small randomised studies, including TICH-1, which assessed the feasibility of a larger trial. The administration of tranexamic acid was feasible and well tolerated.

### Noncontrast computed tomography signs as predictors of hematoma expansion, clinical outcome, and response to tranexamic acid in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^231a5762]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The TICH-2 trial was a prospective randomized placebo controlled trial testing the efficacy and safety of intravenous tranexamic acid in patients with acute spontaneous ICH presenting within 8 hours of symptom onset. Details of the trial were previously published. Ethics approval was obtained from the local institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from patients or relatives before enrolment. After publication of the planned primary and secondary analyses, the trial data can be shared on reasonable request to the corresponding author and trial steering committee.

Image Acquisition

An NCCT was required for the diagnosis of spontaneous ICH before recruitment and randomization. All CT brain scans were performed as per local protocol. CT scans obtained from any scanner of any manufacturer; any slice thickness with a minimum of an axial view was accepted. CT scans with incomplete or missing slices were excluded. Baseline scans were performed before randomization. Follow-up CT scans were performed at 24 ± 12 hours after the baseline scans. When multiple scans were available, the scan closest to 24 hours after randomization was used to determine hematoma expansion. The exception was if the 24-hour CT was performed after neurosurgery, when a preoperative CT scan was used instead. A participant would be excluded from analysis for hematoma expansion if no follow-up scans or only postsurgery scans were available.

### Effects of blood pressure and tranexamic acid in spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: a secondary analysis of a large randomised controlled trial [^16a62efc]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this prespecified secondary analysis of the TICH-2 trial, randomisation to tranexamic acid in the presence of baseline SBP ≤ 170 mmHg was associated with less haematoma expansion and improved clinical outcomes with fewer deaths and SAEs, less death and dependency, and improved quality of life scores compared with placebo. This was despite patients being older, randomised later and having larger baseline haematoma volumes than those with SBP > 170 mm Hg. A > 15% reduction in SBP from baseline to day 2 was associated with fewer deaths by day 7 and 90 in those randomised to tranexamic acid but not placebo, while a > 5% increase in SBP was associated with increased death and SAEs by day 7 overall, and increased SAEs in those randomised to placebo by day 7 and 90. BP lowering treatment by day 2 was more frequently used over the time course of the trial in line with changes in international clinical guidelines. Despite this, 66% of the trial population remained hypertensive on day 2.

### Intensive blood pressure reduction in deep intracerebral hemorrhage… [^c2417688]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

in comparison with standard therapy. 11 The ATACH-2 trial reported no significant effect of this intervention on hematoma expansion or poor outcome at 3. We therefore performed an exploratory analysis of the ATACH-2 trial data focusing on patients with deep ICH. The overarching hypothesis is that ICH caused by hypertension will be more sensitive to intensive BP treatment. We performed an exploratory analysis of the ATACH-2 trial, the details of which are described elsewhere. 17 In brief, ATACH-2 was an international, randomized, multicenter, 2-group, open-label trial that enrolled 1000 patients within 4. 5 hours of onset of primary ICH of less than 60 mL who also had elevated systolic BP. Among 1000 patients enrolled in ATACH-2, 870 had supratentorial, deep ICH. Of these, 780 had complete neuroimaging data and were included in the analysis.

Among the included patients, 336 had thalamic ICH, 444 had basal ganglia ICH, and 405 were randomized to intensive BP reduction. We report an exploratory analysis of the ATACH-2 trial testing the hypothesis that intensive BP reduction decreases hematoma expansion specifically in hemorrhages located in deep structures of the brain. Importantly, baseline characteristics across the treatment and control groups remained balanced, as they were in the original trial, after restricting the analysis to patients with deep ICH, the subgroup of interest in this analysis. In conclusion, we report the results of an exploratory analysis of the ATACH-2 trial focused on deep ICH. We found that intensive BP reduction within 4. 5 hours of symptom onset is associated with a decreased risk of hematoma expansion in patients with deep ICH.

Interaction analysis followed by stratified analysis indicated that this association was driven by hemorrhages located in the basal ganglia. We did not see improved outcomes in this population. Whether this reduction in hematoma expansion can translate into clinical benefit warrants further study.

There was no difference in the number of surgically treated participants who received TXA vs placebo, 57/1153 vs 64/1163, respectively (OR 0.893; 95% CI 0.619–1.289; P -value = .545) (Table 5). There was no significant difference in timing or types of surgery received between the TXA and placebo groups. Baseline IVH was more common in the TXA group (OR 2.14; 1.04–4.44; P = 0.04). Otherwise, TXA and placebo groups were well matched with no significant differences in age, premorbid mRS, GCS, history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, venous thromboembolism, previous antiplatelets, or hematoma location. At 90 days, total number of deaths, functional outcome, quality of life, cognition, or depression did not differ between TXA vs placebo (Table 5; Figure 3). Of those who received hematoma evacuation, either by craniotomy or hematoma drainage (95/2316), there was also no association between improved outcome and TXA (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.30–2.09; P = 0.64). To ensure there were no differences were observed in participants receiving EVD and endovascular coiling, analysis was repeated returning nonsignificant of ORs 0.99 (95% CI 0.45–2.14; P = 0.982) and 4.9 (95% CI 0.58–42.64; P = 0.143), respectively. Equally, when cases receiving endovascular coiling were removed, no difference in surgical intervention was observed between participants who received TXA vs placebo, OR 1.05 (95% CI 0.72–1.52; P = 0.796). Secondary outcomes including total deaths, measures of cognition, depression, and quality of life did not differ between TXA and placebo.

TABLE 2.
Baseline Characteristics of Patients Treated Surgically and Nonsurgically in the TICH-2 Trial

Outcomes were compared between surgically treated and nonsurgically treated participants, adjusting for baseline characteristics (age, mRS, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, HV, and IVH) (Table 3). Participants who were treated with neurosurgery were less likely to have died by day 7 (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06–0.40; P < .001); however, this was not found at day 90 (OR 1.11; 95% CI 0.63–1.95; P = 0.77; Table 3). There was no significant difference in safety outcomes between surgically and nonsurgically treated participants except for seizures, which were more common in surgically treated participants (15.7% vs 6.5%; OR 2.69; 95% CI 1.60–4.52; P = 0.001) (Supplemental Digital Content 2) There was no significant difference in venous thromboembolism, which occurred in 5% of surgically participants and 3.1% in medically managed participants. The characteristics of surgical participants who had favorable (mRS 0–3) and unfavorable outcomes (mRS 4–6) were compared (Table 4). Surgical participants were more likely to have an unfavorable outcome (mRS 4–6) at 90 days (OR 3.34; 95% CI 1.80–6.01; P = 0.008). Death and severe disability (mRS 5 or 6) at 90 days were also more likely in surgically treated participants (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.22–3.92; P = 0.01) (Table 5). Deep supratentorial hematomas and HE were less common in those with favorable outcomes OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.20–0.48; P = 0.02) and OR 0.30 (95% CI 0.12–0.77 P = 0.01), respectively. Only HE within 24 hours of randomization independently predicted unfavorable outcome in surgically treated participants (OR 3.46; 95% CI 1.35–8.81; P = 0.01). Days to surgery were less for participants who had an unfavorable outcome (MD −0.63, 95% CI −1.22 to 0.058; P = 0.031).

Patients and methods

TICH-2 trial was a prospective multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trial testing the efficacy and safety of intravenous tranexamic acid in patients with acute spontaneous ICH presenting within 8 h of onset. Details of the trial protocol were published. In short, patients with acute ICH were randomised in a double-blinded manner to receive 2 g of intravenous tranexamic acid or matching placebo. Centralised, blinded assessor telephone follow up was performed at 1 year for patients from the United Kingdom only (due to funding/logistical reasons). The primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included death, Barthel index, Telephone Interview Cognitive Status-modified (TICS-M), EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) and Zung Depression Scale (ZDS). Ethics approval was gained prior to the commencement of the trial. Analysing these outcomes of participants at 1-year was a pre-specified secondary analysis of the TICH-2 trial.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^5661fac1]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Craniotomy for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of volume > 10 mL — benefit, timing, and potential life‑saving use are characterized as uncertain overall but with signals in selected contexts. Craniotomy for ICH of volume > 10 mL remains of uncertain benefit compared with conservative management, and STICH I and STICH II demonstrated no benefit in functional outcome with craniotomy. A patient-level data meta-analysis suggested that certain cohorts might benefit, and a smaller (n = 108) single-center RCT found improved functional outcome with craniotomy; meta-analyses published in 2020 provide mixed results, with two suggesting benefit in functional outcome and mortality and one finding no benefit. For patients who are deteriorating, craniotomy for hematoma evacuation may be considered as a life-saving measure; in STICH II there was a 21% crossover from medical therapy to surgery, 74% attributable to deterioration, and a recent small (n = 61) RCT demonstrated improved mortality with surgery. Timing may be important: surgery in prior trials was performed primarily > 12 hours after onset; two small single-center RCTs requiring surgery within ≤ 12 hours suggested benefit; further research is indicated to evaluate whether early (< 12 hours) intervention might provide benefit, with a promising mortality signal when performed within 12 hours in a study not powered for efficacy (n = 34) and benefit in functional outcome when undertaken within < 8 hours (n = 108).

Table 1
Characteristics of the studies included in the systematic review and meta-analysis

Haemostatic therapy reduced the rate of haematoma expansion at a marginally significant level, compared with placebo (27.4 vs 40.0% in the control group; OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.00; p = 0.051), and the result had similar trends but with less significance when patients from Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary intracerebral hemorrhage (TICH-2) were excluded(41.5 vs 45.0% in the control group; OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.34; p = 0.52) (figure 1A). For patients with the spot sign, the rate of haematoma expansion was similar between the haemostatic therapy group and the control group (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.59; p = 0.93). For patients with the blend sign, the rate of haematoma expansion was marginally lower in the haemostatic therapy group with no statistical significance (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.11; p = 0.15). For patients with the black hole sign, a significant reduction of haematoma expansion was seen in the haemostatic therapy group (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; p = 0.03). The subgroup analysis on different haemostatic agents revealed no significant difference in the rate of haematoma expansion. Notably, there was no significant heterogeneity across the four studies and subgroups, except for the subgroup with the black hole sign (figure 1B, C).

Conclusions

In summary, tranexamic acid had no significant benefit on functional outcome 1 year after ICH. This study reassures us that tranexamic acid does not prolong life at the cost of severe disability. The results highlight that many patients with ICH have poor outcomes, with significant mortality, disability, and reduced cognition and quality of life at 1 year. Better treatments are urgently needed for ICH. Whether limiting haematoma growth with early haemostatic therapy (< 4.5 h) (as is being tested in current ongoing trials TICH-3 (ISRCTN97695350), INTRINSIC (NCT05836831), THE-ICH trial (ChiCTR1900027065)) leads to clinical benefit or improves outcome remains uncertain.

### Outcome 1 year after ICH: data from the tranexamic acid for intraCerebral haemorrhage 2 (TICH-2) trial [^017f764d]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

The Tranexamic acid for IntraCerebral Haemorrhage-2 (TICH-2) trial reported no significant improvement in death and dependency at day 90 despite reductions in haematoma expansion, early neurological deterioration and early death. However, significant recovery after stroke, particularly intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), may take more than 3 months. Here we report the participant outcomes at 1 year after stroke.

Patients and methods:

TICH-2 was a prospective randomised controlled trial that tested the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in spontaneous ICH when given within 8 h of onset. Patients with ICH on anticoagulation were excluded. Centralised blinded telephone follow up was performed for patients from the United Kingdom at 1 year. The primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included Barthel index, Telephone Interview Cognitive Status-modified, EuroQoL-5D and Zung Depression Scale. This was a prespecified secondary analysis of the TICH-2 trial.

Results:

About 2325 patients were recruited into the trial (age 68.9 ± 13.8 years; 1301 male, 56%). About 1910 participants (82.2%) were eligible for day 365 follow up. 57 patients (3.0%) were lost to follow up. Tranexamic acid did not reduce the risk of poor functional outcome at 1 year (adjusted OR 0.91 95% CI 0.77–1.09; p = 0.302). However, Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed significant survival benefit in the tranexamic acid group (adjusted HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70–0.99; p = 0.038).

Conclusion:

There was no difference in functional outcome at 1 year after ICH. Tranexamic acid may reduce mortality at 1 year without an increase in severely dependent survivors. But this should be interpreted with caution as this is a result of secondary analysis in a neutral trial.

### Outcomes in antiplatelet-associated intracerebral hemorrhage in the TICH-2 randomized controlled trial [^a1e77bff]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Antiplatelet therapy increases the risk of hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) while the effect on functional outcome is uncertain. Methods and Results This is an exploratory analysis of the TICH-2 (Tranexamic Acid in Intracerebral Hemorrhage-2) double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which studied the efficacy of tranexamic acid in patients with spontaneous ICH within 8 hours of onset. Multivariable logistic regression and ordinal regression were performed to explore the relationship between pre-ICH antiplatelet therapy, and 24-hour hematoma expansion and day 90 modified Rankin Scale score, as well as the effect of tranexamic acid. Of 2325 patients, 611 (26.3%) had pre-ICH antiplatelet therapy. They were older (mean age, 75.7 versus 66.5 years), more likely to have ischemic heart disease (25.4% versus 2.7%), ischemic stroke (36.2% versus 6.3%), intraventricular hemorrhage (40.2% versus 27.5%), and larger baseline hematoma volume (mean, 28.1 versus 22.6 mL) than the no-antiplatelet group. Pre-ICH antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of hematoma expansion (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.01–1.63), a shift toward unfavorable outcome in modified Rankin Scale (adjusted common OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.32–1.91) and a higher risk of death at day 90 (adjusted OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.25–2.11). Tranexamic acid reduced the risk of hematoma expansion in the overall patients with ICH (adjusted OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.93) and antiplatelet subgroup (adjusted OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41–0.91) with no significant interaction between pre-ICH antiplatelet therapy and tranexamic acid (P interaction = 0.248). Conclusions Antiplatelet therapy is independently associated with hematoma expansion and unfavorable functional outcome. Tranexamic acid reduced hematoma expansion regardless of prior antiplatelet therapy use. Registration URL: https://www.isrctn.com; Unique identifier: ISRCTN93732214.

Forty-eight of 95 (51.1%) participants who received hematoma evacuation, either by craniotomy or drainage, had a postoperative scan we could analyze. In this subgroup, the average time to evacuation was 0.5 days for TXA and 0.65 days for placebo (MD 0.22 days; 95% CI −0.89 to 1.35; P = 0.66). Postoperative hematomas were nonsignificantly smaller in the TXA group (15.7 vs 24.7 mL; MD −8.97 mL; −23.77 to 5.82; P = 0.23, Figure 3). Hematoma clearance was nonsignificantly higher in TXA group compared with placebo (55.3 vs 45.0 mL, MD 10.36; 95% CI −14.35 to 35.07; P = 0.23). Sixteen participants who received TXA had a postoperative residual hematoma of ≤ 15 mL compared with 13 who received placebo (OR 2.67; 95% CI 0.79–8.97; P = 0.40).

Sensitivity analyses and risk of bias

Sensitivity analysis for the rate of each endpoint showed that the overall effect of haemostatic therapy was consistent with the overall estimate from all studies excluding the TICH-2 study. Sensitivity analysis by sequentially dropping individual trials and then evaluating the overall outcomes failed to identify any of the individual trials that influenced the outcomes to any significant extent. Fixed-effects analyses showed a consistent trend for haemostatic therapy in all sensitivity analyses for the rate of haematoma expansion (online supplemental 4). There was also no significant publication bias detected with the examination of funnel plots for the outcome of haematoma expansion or with Egger's regression test (online supplemental 5).

DISCUSSION

Our meta-analysis of meticulously performed RCTs that compared haemostatic therapy with placebo in patients with spontaneous ICH predicted by CT signs showed a potential nonstatistically significant benefit of reducing early haematoma expansion with haemostatic therapy. Haemostatic therapy did not lower the 90-day risk of poor functional outcome and all-cause mortality. However, in patients with the black hole sign, there was a statistically significant reduction of haematoma expansion with haemostatic therapy, a benefit not seen in subgroups with other CT signs. This is the first meta-analysis of published trials of high-quality and low bias risk that evaluates the effectiveness of haemostatic therapy for spontaneous ICH predicted by CT signs.

Haemostatic therapy for spontaneous ICH without CT signs

The rFVIIa was a rapid procoagulant developed for haemophilia-related haemorrhage. In previous trials (FAST-2, FAST-3), FVIIa reduced ICH expansion by about 50% compared with placebo but did not improve clinical outcomes. Tranexamic acid for patients with ICH was first tested in Malaysian trial (n = 30)and TICH trial (n = 24), which revealed a reduction of ICH expansion. Following that, a pragmatic phase III prospective double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial, TICH-2enrolled 2325 patients with ICH who received either tranexamic acid or placebo within 8 hours of onset. In the TICH-2 trial, tranexamic acid did not show any benefit in 90-day functional outcome when compared with placebo (adjusted OR 0·88; 95% CI 0·76 to 1·03; p = 0·11), despite a reduction in early deaths and serious adverse events. However, a potential benefit of reducing haematoma expansion was seen in a smaller proportion of patients treated with the tranexamic acid (265 (25%)/1054 vs placebo 304 (29%)/1058) with an OR of 0·80 (95% CI 0·66 to 0·98; p = 0·03). The absolute effect on reducing haematoma growth was modest (1 mL). Overall, haemostatic therapy had a slight benefit in reducing haematoma growth but did not significantly improve the functional outcome in patients with ICH without any CT signs.

RESULTS

Of the 2325 participants who were randomized in TICH-2, 121 underwent neurosurgical intervention (Figure 2) including craniotomy (69/121; 57%), hematoma drainage (26/121; 33%) and external ventricular drainage (46/121; 21%). Six participants had an underlying cerebral aneurysm and received endovascular coiling. Nineteen participants received more than 1 surgical procedure. Median time from onset to surgery was 1 day (IQR 2 days).

### Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary intraCerebral haemorrhage (TICH-2): an international randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 superiority trial [^61d26859]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study TICH-2 was published by Nikola Sprigg and colleagues in 2018 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Intracerebral hemorrhage. In the TICH-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tranexamic acid in patients with stroke due to intracerebral hemorrhage? In the TICH-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TICH-2 study, the population was: 2325 patients (1024 female, 1301 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with intracerebral hemorrhage from acute stroke. The key exclusion criteria were intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to anticoagulation, thrombolysis, trauma, or a known underlying structural abnormality; contraindication to tranexamic acid; prestroke dependence; life expectancy < 3 months; and GCS score < 5. In the TICH-2 study, the interventions were: n = 1161 tranexamic acid (1 g intravenous bolus followed by another 1 g infused over 8 hours, within 8 hours of symptom onset) n = 1164 placebo (normal saline 0.9% administered with an identical regimen). In the TICH-2 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at 90 days (22% vs. 21%; aHR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.1). In the TICH-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in change in volume of hematoma from baseline to 24 hours (3.72 mL vs. 4.9 mL; AD -1.37 mL, 95% CI -2.71 to -0.04) Significant increase in length of stay in hospital (63.12 days vs. 63.73 days; AD 1.09 days, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.24). In the TICH-2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in venous thromboembolic events, arterial occlusions, seizure, nervous system disorders, infections. significant differences in serious adverse events by day 2 (33% vs. 36%), day 7 (39% vs. 43%), 90 days (45% vs. 48%). In the TICH-2 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with intracerebral hemorrhage from acute stroke, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to death at 90 days.

### Absolute risk and predictors of the growth of acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data [^e403eb4f]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

We found that the rate of decline in the probability of intracerebral haemorrhage growth was steepest during the 0·5–3 h after intracerebral haemorrhage symptom onset and that the predicted probability of intracerebral haemorrhage growth peaked at an intracerebral haemorrhage volume of about 75 mL. These findings could in part explain the neutral results of recent randomised trials of acute interventions designed to limit intracerebral haemorrhage growth, which enrolled many patients towards or beyond the time of greatest risk of intracerebral haemorrhage growth and most patients had small intracerebral haemorrhages at low probability of growth. For example, the average time to randomisation after intracerebral haemorrhage symptom onset and average intracerebral haemorrhage volume were 3·7 h and 13 mL in TICH2,3·7 h and 11 mL in INTERACT2,3·1 h and 10 mL in ATACH2, and 2·7 h and 22–24 mL in FAST. In particular, our findings about the association between time after intracerebral haemorrhage symptom onset and the probability of intracerebral haemorrhage growth emphasise the importance of extremely rapid assessment, investigation, and randomisation in future trials of therapies to improve outcome by limiting intracerebral haemorrhage growth.

The prediction models that we have developed could be useful in clinical practice for predicting the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage growth, which is recommended in the emergency assessment of acute intracerebral haemorrhage. The clinically useful threshold for the predicted probability of intracerebral haemorrhage growth will vary according to its desired accuracy (appendix), the clinical setting, and future therapeutic advances, such that our models might help in determining patients' place of care and frequency of observation.

Haemostatic therapy and clinical outcome

A total of four studies were included for the analysis of the clinical outcome. There was no significant heterogeneity between the four studies and their subgroups. When all patients were analysed, haemostatic therapy did not reduce the rate of the poor functional outcome when compared with placebo (53.3 vs 53.3% in the control group; OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.17; p = 0.96 and 45.8 vs 46.3% in the control group; OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.47; p = 0.78) whether TICH-2 (figure 2A) was included or not. The results in all subgroup analyses were generally consistent with the main analysis (figure 2B, C). No benefit was seen in reducing 90-day mortality after haemostatic therapy (figure 3A–C) in the main or subgroup analysis.

### Effects of blood pressure and tranexamic acid in spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: a secondary analysis of a large randomised controlled trial [^f27a3cf6]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Statistics

Analyses followed the statistical analysis plan for the overall TICH-2 trial. Data are number (%), mean (SD), median [IQR]. Baseline characteristics of participants by baseline SBP were compared using X 2 test, one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate. Analyses between treatment groups were assessed by intention to treat. The primary outcome was assessed across all seven levels of the mRS using ordinal logistic regression with adjustment for baseline prognostic variables as in the main TICH-2 trial: age, sex, time since onset to randomisation, baseline SBP, baseline NIHSS, presence of intraventricular haemorrhage and antiplatelet therapy before stroke onset. Sensitivity analyses of the mRS were performed including unadjusted, mRS > 3 and with additional adjustment for baseline haematoma volume and location. Other outcomes were analysed using binary logistic, multiple linear or Cox regression models as appropriate with adjustment as outlined above. A sensitivity analysis using > 33% increase in haematoma volume to define haematoma expansion was performed, given that absolute volume increase may have a differential effect depending on haematoma location. To assess whether haematoma location influenced the effect of tranexamic acid on the primary outcome, an interaction term was added to an adjusted ordinal logistic regression model. Resultant common OR (cOR), OR, HR or mean difference with corresponding 95% CIs are given, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results were not adjusted for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS V.23.

### The effect of tranexamic acid on neurosurgical intervention in spontaneous intracerebral hematoma: data from 121 surgically treated participants from the tranexamic acid in intraCerebral hemorrhage-2 randomized controlled trial [^68786fc7]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

An important proportion of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) undergo neurosurgical intervention to reduce mass effect from large hematomas and control the complications of bleeding, including hematoma expansion and hydrocephalus. The Tranexamic acid (TXA) for hyperacute primary IntraCerebral Hemorrhage (TICH-2) trial demonstrated that tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces the risk of hematoma expansion. We hypothesized that TXA would reduce the frequency of surgery (primary outcome) and improve functional outcome at 90 days in surgically treated patients in the TICH-2 data set.

Methods

Participants enrolled in TICH-2 were randomized to placebo or TXA. Participants randomized to either TXA or placebo were analyzed for whether they received neurosurgery within 7 days and their characteristics, outcomes, hematoma volumes (HVs) were compared. Characteristics and outcomes of participants who received surgery were also compared with those who did not.

Results

Neurosurgery was performed in 5.2% of participants (121/2325), including craniotomy (57%), hematoma drainage (33%), and external ventricular drainage (21%). The number of patients receiving surgery who received TXA vs placebo were similar at 4.9% (57/1153) and 5.5% (64/1163), respectively (odds ratio [OR] 0.893; 95% CI 0.619–1.289; P -value = .545). TXA did not improve outcome compared with placebo in either surgically treated participants (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.30–2.09; P = 0.64) or those undergoing hematoma evacuation by drainage or craniotomy (OR 1.19 95% 0.51–2.78; P -value = .69). Postoperative HV was not reduced by TXA (mean difference -8.97 95% CI -23.77, 5.82; P -value = .45).

Conclusion

TXA was not associated with less neurosurgical intervention, reduced HV, or improved outcomes after surgery.

### The effect of tranexamic acid on neurosurgical intervention in spontaneous intracerebral hematoma: data from 121 surgically treated participants from the tranexamic acid in intraCerebral hemorrhage-2 randomized controlled trial [^b9d3990b]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Lifetime risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is 8%. There are few effective treatments, and outcomes have failed to improve over time. Less than half of patients survive beyond 2 years — most dying within a month. Age, diabetes mellitus, impaired consciousness, hematoma volume (HV), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), infratentorial location, and small vessel disease predict early mortality, but hematoma expansion (HE) remains an important modifiable risk factor. - Lowering blood pressure and correcting coagulopathy can reduce the risk of HE. Surgery can help reduce mass effect and/or intracranial pressure after ICH, immediately or after neurological deterioration. Exactly in whom and how surgery should be used remains controversial. Recently, the industry-funded Early Minimally Invasive Removal of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ENRICH) trial reported that minimally invasive trans-sulcal parafascicular surgery improved outcomes for participants with lobar ICH within 24 hours of ictus. However, no other clinical trial has demonstrated that surgical intervention improves outcome. - Nevertheless, pooled data support surgical intervention, and surgery is thought to be a reasonable intervention in patients with hydrocephalus and patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 10 to 13, with hematomas that are large or centered in the cerebellum or temporal lobe. -

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a lysine analog that prevents plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin helping to stop hemorrhage. TXA has been studied in spontaneous ICH (summarized in Table 1), as well as other neurosurgical pathologies such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute head injury, craniosynostosis surgery, chronic subdural hematoma, meningioma surgery, and perinatal periventricular hemorrhage (summarized in Supplemental Digital Content 1). The TXA in IntraCerebral Hemorrhage-2 (TICH-2), a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, recruited 2325 participants and showed TXA reduced HE and early neurological deterioration.TXA may also reduce brain injury arising from neurotoxicity and neuro-inflammation. Therefore, TXA could reduce need for rescue surgery, reduce secondary brain injury, and possibly reduce intraoperative bleeding.

TABLE 1.
Summary Table of Clinical Studies Using TXA in Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage

We hypothesized that TXA would reduce surgical intervention after ICH, improve outcome for surgical participants, and reduce postoperative HVs. We analyzed data from the TICH-2 trial to test these hypotheses and also to describe the characteristics of surgically treated participants.

Recombinant factor VIIa for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — trial results and timing: In a phase IIb randomized controlled trial (RCT), a dose‑dependent reduction in hematoma expansion (HE) and significant reduction in poor functional outcome were seen with recombinant factor VIIa with no difference in serious thromboembolic events. In a larger phase III study testing recombinant factor VIIa within 4 hours of ICH onset, despite significant similar modest limitation of HE with the 80–μg/kg dose, there was no difference in functional outcome at 3 months compared with placebo, and there was a significant increase in arterial thrombotic events. Meta‑analysis of recombinant factor VIIa RCTs showed no benefit on HE, functional outcome, or SAEs. In a pooled analysis of 2 RCTs halted early, the CTA spot sign was not effective in predicting response to factor VIIa 80 μg/kg given within 6.5 hours of ICH onset.

### Outcome 1 year after ICH: data from the tranexamic acid for intraCerebral haemorrhage 2 (TICH-2) trial [^22493481]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Tranexamic acid for IntraCerebral Haemorrhage-2 (TICH-2) trial reported no significant improvement in death and dependency at day 90 despite reductions in haematoma expansion, early neurological deterioration and early death. However, significant recovery after stroke, particularly intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), may take more than 3months. Here we report the participant outcomes at 1year after stroke.

Patients and Methods

TICH-2 was a prospective randomised controlled trial that tested the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in spontaneous ICH when given within 8h of onset. Patients with ICH on anticoagulation were excluded. Centralised blinded telephone follow up was performed for patients from the United Kingdom at 1year. The primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale at 1year. Secondary outcomes included Barthel index, Telephone Interview Cognitive Status-modified, EuroQoL-5D and Zung Depression Scale. This was a prespecified secondary analysis of the TICH-2 trial.

Results

About 2325 patients were recruited into the trial (age 68.9 ± 13.8years; 1301 male, 56%). About 1910 participants (82.2%) were eligible for day 365 follow up. 57 patients (3.0%) were lost to follow up. Tranexamic acid did not reduce the risk of poor functional outcome at 1year (adjusted OR 0.91 95% CI 0.77–1.09; p = 0.302). However, Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed significant survival benefit in the tranexamic acid group (adjusted HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70–0.99; p = 0.038).

Conclusion

There was no difference in functional outcome at 1year after ICH. Tranexamic acid may reduce mortality at 1year without an increase in severely dependent survivors. But this should be interpreted with caution as this is a result of secondary analysis in a neutral trial.

### Surgical management of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: insights from randomized controlled trials [^88ff2e4b]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) are a major cause of neurologic morbidity and mortality. The optimal management strategy of ICH remains controversial. We examine the available randomized controlled trial (RCT) data regarding neurosurgical evacuation of ICHs. A systematic literature review on surgical evacuation of spontaneous ICHs was performed to identify pertinent RCT data published between 1980 and 2019. We identified five RCTs that assessed the clinical impact of evacuation of spontaneous ICHs. Data from two high-quality RCTs randomizing 1033 and 601 patients with spontaneous ICHs (Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (STICH) I and II) (1) failed to demonstrate a significant clinical benefit of routine open surgical evacuation of spontaneous cortical ICHs and (2) reinforced the high morbidity and mortality associated with ICH. These trials were nonetheless limited by high (> 20%) crossover from the medical to surgical arms. Data from three smaller RCTs on minimally invasive (stereotactic and endoscopic) surgical approaches randomizing 377, 242, and 100 patients with spontaneous ICHs suggest potential benefits relating to mortality and functional outcomes in patients with subcortical ICHs. While these RCTs do not clearly define the role of surgical resection for ICHs, they provide insights into opportunities for patient advocacy, clinical trial design, and future research studies. Ongoing studies building upon the potential for minimally invasive approaches for ICH evacuation may expand the surgical indications for ICH.

### Comparative study of traumatic and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage [^9f4612bc]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Object

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) and traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (TICH) are common disorders. The authors planned to study how these two types of hemorrhage behave pathologically and clinically to gain further insight into their causes, pathogeneses, indications for surgical intervention, and prognoses.

Methods

Prospectively filled databases of demographic, clinical, radiological, and outcome details have been maintained for all patients admitted to the Regional Neurosciences Centre with head injury since 1987 and with SICH since 1993. Of the 5686 patients whose case information was included in the head-injury database, 90 were found to suffer from an isolated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) as the only major abnormality observed on computerized tomography scans (subdural and extradural hematomas were excluded). Case details on these 90 patients and the 440 patients from the SICH database were extracted and analyzed using a statistical software program. The median age of patients with TICH was lower than the median age of patients with SICH (51 years compared with 65 years, respectively), but it was much higher than the median age of the entire head-injury group (21 years). Among patients younger than 45 years of age, 0.8% of patients who experienced trauma suffered from an ICH compared with 4.3% of patients older than 45 years of age. Irrespective of intervention, much better outcomes were achieved by patients with TICH compared with those with SICH (67% favorable outcomes compared with 24% in patients with SICH). Following trauma, there was no significant relationship between the severity of injury and the development of ICH. At presentation the median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score for both groups was 13. Younger age and higher GCS score at presentation were strongly related to a favorable outcome for both types of hemorrhage. There was no significant difference in patient age, presenting GCS score, or outcomes of patients who underwent surgery compared with those who did not for either type of hemorrhage. No conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy of surgery from such observational studies.

Conclusions

On the basis of these data the authors suggest that TICH and SICH have different features: TICH affects a slightly younger age group and carries a much better prognosis compared with SICH. In addition, indications for surgical intervention are not well defined for either type of hemorrhage. Practice is subjective and inconsistent. The International Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Haemorrhage may resolve the dilemma for SICH. A similar trial in which surgery is compared with conservative management should be considered for cases of TICH.

### Outcomes in antiplatelet-associated intracerebral hemorrhage in the TICH-2 randomized controlled trial [^2f561fc8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet therapy increases the risk of hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) while the effect on functional outcome is uncertain.

Methods and Results

This is an exploratory analysis of the TICH‐2 (Tranexamic Acid in Intracerebral Hemorrhage‐2) double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial, which studied the efficacy of tranexamic acid in patients with spontaneous ICH within 8 hours of onset. Multivariable logistic regression and ordinal regression were performed to explore the relationship between pre‐ICH antiplatelet therapy, and 24‐hour hematoma expansion and day 90 modified Rankin Scale score, as well as the effect of tranexamic acid. Of 2325 patients, 611 (26.3%) had pre‐ICH antiplatelet therapy. They were older (mean age, 75.7 versus 66.5 years), more likely to have ischemic heart disease (25.4% versus 2.7%), ischemic stroke (36.2% versus 6.3%), intraventricular hemorrhage (40.2% versus 27.5%), and larger baseline hematoma volume (mean, 28.1 versus 22.6 mL) than the no‐antiplatelet group. Pre‐ICH antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of hematoma expansion (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.01–1.63), a shift toward unfavorable outcome in modified Rankin Scale (adjusted common OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.32–1.91) and a higher risk of death at day 90 (adjusted OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.25–2.11). Tranexamic acid reduced the risk of hematoma expansion in the overall patients with ICH (adjusted OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.93) and antiplatelet subgroup (adjusted OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41–0.91) with no significant interaction between pre‐ICH antiplatelet therapy and tranexamic acid (P interaction = 0.248).

Conclusions

Antiplatelet therapy is independently associated with hematoma expansion and unfavorable functional outcome. Tranexamic acid reduced hematoma expansion regardless of prior antiplatelet therapy use.

Figure 3
Primary outcome by subgroups

All subgroups were predefined except for intracerebral haemorrhage volume, which was added as a post-hoc analysis. OR = odds ratio. NIHSS = National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.

Fewer participants had haematoma expansion at day 2 in the tranexamic acid group (265 [25%] of 1054 participants) than in the placebo group (304 [29%] of 1058 participants; aOR 0·80, 95% CI 0·66 to 0·98, p = 0·0300). The mean increase in haematoma volume from baseline to 24 h was also less in the tranexamic acid group (3·72 mL, SD 15·9) than in the placebo group (4·90 mL, 16·0; adjusted mean difference −1·37, 95% CI −2·71 to −0·04, p = 0·0432). Neurological impairment (mean NIHSS score at day 7) did not differ between the tranexamic acid group and placebo group (adjusted mean difference −0·43, 95% CI −0·94 to 0·09; p = 0·10).

There were no significant differences in any of the day 90 functional outcomes between treatment groups — ie, activities of daily living, mood, cognition, or quality of life (table 2). Length of hospital stay and discharge disposition did not differ between treatment groups (table 2).

By day 7, fewer patients had died in the tranexamic acid group (101 [9%] of 1161) than in the placebo group (123 [11%] of 1164; table 2). However, the numbers of deaths by day 90 did not differ between the tranexamic acid group (250 [22%] patients) and the placebo group (249 [21%] patients; table 2). Survival did not differ between the treatment groups over 90 days (adjusted hazard ratio 0·92, 95% CI 0·77–1·10, p = 0·37; appendix).

### Effects of blood pressure and tranexamic acid in spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: a secondary analysis of a large randomised controlled trial [^6f34b8c6]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Elevated blood pressure (BP) in acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is associated with haematoma expansion and increased death and dependency. Large trials of intensive BP lowering in ICH patients with elevated BP at presentation have produced mixed results: in INTERACT-2 intensive BP lowering was associated with less death and dependency in a shift analysis of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS); ATACH-2, which assessed a more aggressive intensive BP lowering strategy, did not influence mRS at day 90 but did lead to more renal adverse events. Current guidelines recommend to consider reduction of elevated BP in acute ICH in line with the INTERACT-2 protocol.

In the tranexamic acid for hyperacute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage-2 (TICH-2) trial, tranexamic acid reduced haematoma expansion and early death but did not influence the mRS at day 90. In predefined subgroups, there was a statistically significant interaction between baseline systolic BP (SBP) and tranexamic acid on the primary outcome of mRS at day 90. Those with baseline SBP ≤ 170 mm Hg randomised to tranexamic acid had a favourable shift in the mRS to less death and dependency compared with placebo, while those with baseline SBP > 170 mm Hg randomised to tranexamic acid had no change in the mRS compared with those randomised to placebo.

We sought to investigate this interaction in this predefined subgroup in more detail, and in particular to assess the association of baseline SBP on the potential treatment effect of tranexamic acid. We hypothesised that patients with lower baseline SBP were more likely to have non-hypertension-related ICH aetiologies with more lobar ICH, present later, have milder clinical phenotypes, may not have undergone haematoma expansion, and therefore, might benefit from tranexamic acid.

### Recombinant factor VIIA in traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage: results of a dose-escalation clinical trial [^23516245]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Intracerebral hemorrhages, whether spontaneous or traumatic (tICH), often expand, and an association has been described between hemorrhage expansion and worse clinical outcomes. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is a hemostatic agent that has been shown to limit hemorrhage expansion and which, therefore, could potentially reduce morbidity and mortality in tICH. This first prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study evaluated the safety and preliminary effectiveness of rFVIIa to limit tICH progression.

Methods

Patients were enrolled if they had tICH lesions of at least 2 mL on a baseline computed tomographic scan obtained within 6 hours of injury. rFVIIa or placebo was administered within 2.5 hours of the baseline computed tomographic scan but no later than 7 hours after injury. Computed tomographic scans were repeated at 24 and 72 hours. Five escalating dose tiers were evaluated (40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 microg/kg rFVIIa). Clinical evaluations and adverse events were recorded until Day 15.

Results

No significant differences were detected in mortality rate or number and type of adverse events among treatment groups. Asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis, detected on routinely performed ultrasound at Day 3, was observed more frequently in the combined rFVIIa treatment group (placebo, 3%; rFVIIa, 8%; not significant). A nonsignificant trend for rFVIIa dose-response to limit tICH volume increase was observed (placebo, 21.0 ml; rFVIIa, 10.1 ml).

Conclusion

In this first prospective study of rFVIIa in tICH, there appeared to be less hematoma progression in rFVIIa-treated patients (80–200 microg/kg) compared with that seen in placebo treated patients. The potential significance of this biological effect on clinical outcomes and the significance of the somewhat higher incidence of ultrasound-detected deep vein thromboses in the rFVIIa-treated group need to be examined in a larger prospective randomized clinical trial.

Antiplatelet-associated spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — desmopressin and platelet transfusion: In patients with spontaneous ICH on antiplatelet agents, desmopressin (0.4 μg/kg) given with platelet transfusion did not reduce hematoma expansion (HE) or improve functional outcome versus usual care. In a randomized trial of supratentorial ICH with concomitant antiplatelet therapy, giving 1 U platelet concentrate (2 U for adenosine-diphosphate receptor blockers) was associated with a shift toward worse functional outcome at 3 months with a borderline significant increase in any serious adverse event, with no reduction in hematoma expansion or in 3‑month mortality; only 5 of the 190 participants were taking ADP blockers alone, and these findings do not apply to preoperative platelet transfusions. Knowledge gaps noted include that ticagrelor is not reversed by platelet transfusions, a monoclonal antibody reversed ticagrelor's platelet inhibition in healthy volunteers with a phase III trial ongoing, and the effect of desmopressin is uncertain because of the lack of RCTs with trials ongoing.

### Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary intraCerebral haemorrhage (TICH-2): an international randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 superiority trial [^d28cdade]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this trial of tranexamic acid versus placebo after acute intracerebral haemorrhage, there was no significant difference between the groups in the primary outcome of functional status at day 90. However, in the tranexamic acid group, we detected significant reductions in the prespecified secondary outcomes of early death, haematoma expansion, and serious adverse events, consistent with tranexamic acid having an antifibrinolytic effect after intracerebral haemorrhage.

Tranexamic acid was associated with a small but significant reduction in haematoma expansion and smaller haematoma volumes, key factors that are known to affect outcomes after intracerebral haemorrhage. However, the small reduction in haematoma volume (1·37 mL smaller in the tranexamic acid group than in the placebo group) might have been insufficient to translate into improved functional status in this population.

One explanation for our findings could be that the anticipated treatment effect (OR 0·79) was too large, which the trial was unable to detect. Indeed, previous randomised controlled trials of tranexamic acid in other settings have enrolled more than ten times the number of participants to identify smaller effects on bleeding-related deaths after trauma (OR 0·85)and post-partum haemorrhage (OR 0·81). Furthermore, the findings of an individual patient data meta-analysis of 40 138 participants have subsequently shown that it is necessary to start tranexamic acid within 3 h of the start of bleeding to receive any benefit in other conditions.

We found no evidence of an increase in serious adverse effects with tranexamic acid; notably, there was no increase in venous thromboembolism in this significantly older population with more comorbidities than participants in previous studies of tranexamic acid. It is therefore unlikely that any potential benefit of tranexamic acid was offset by harm, as has been suggested with recombinant factor VIIa. In a phase 3 trial, there was no evidence of clinical benefit from recombinant factor VIIa, which was associated with a reduction in haematoma expansion but an increased risk of arterial occlusive events. Although tranexamic acid and recombinant factor VIIa are both haemostatic agents, tranexamic acid acts through antifibrinolytic mechanisms and recombinant factor VIIa is a procoagulant, so they have different risk-benefit profiles.

### Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary intraCerebral haemorrhage (TICH-2): an international randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 superiority trial [^f15c3e72]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid can prevent death due to bleeding after trauma and post-partum haemorrhage. We aimed to assess whether tranexamic acid reduces haematoma expansion and improves outcome in adults with stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage.

Methods

We did an international, randomised placebo-controlled trial in adults with intracerebral haemorrhage from acute stroke units at 124 hospital sites in 12 countries. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 1 g intravenous tranexamic acid bolus followed by an 8 h infusion of 1 g tranexamic acid or a matching placebo, within 8 h of symptom onset. Randomisation was done centrally in real time via a secure website, with stratification by country and minimisation on key prognostic factors. Treatment allocation was concealed from patients, outcome assessors, and all other health-care workers involved in the trial. The primary outcome was functional status at day 90, measured by shift in the modified Rankin Scale, using ordinal logistic regression with adjustment for stratification and minimisation criteria. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN93732214.

Findings

We recruited 2325 participants between March 1, 2013, and Sept 30, 2017. 1161 patients received tranexamic acid and 1164 received placebo; the treatment groups were well balanced at baseline. The primary outcome was assessed for 2307 (99%) participants. The primary outcome, functional status at day 90, did not differ significantly between the groups (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·88, 95% CI 0·76–1·03, p = 0·11). Although there were fewer deaths by day 7 in the tranexamic acid group (101 [9%] deaths in the tranexamic acid group vs 123 [11%] deaths in the placebo group; aOR 0·73, 0·53–0·99, p = 0·0406), there was no difference in case fatality at 90 days (250 [22%] vs 249 [21%]; adjusted hazard ratio 0·92, 95% CI 0·77–1·10, p = 0·37). Fewer patients had serious adverse events after tranexamic acid than after placebo by days 2 (379 [33%] patients vs 417 [36%] patients), 7 (456 [39%] vs 497 [43%]), and 90 (521 [45%] vs 556 [48%]).

Interpretation

Functional status 90 days after intracerebral haemorrhage did not differ significantly between patients who received tranexamic acid and those who received placebo, despite a reduction in early deaths and serious adverse events. Larger randomised trials are needed to confirm or refute a clinically significant treatment effect.

### The effect of tranexamic acid on neurosurgical intervention in spontaneous intracerebral hematoma: data from 121 surgically treated participants from the tranexamic acid in intraCerebral hemorrhage-2 randomized controlled trial [^c1e9ccf5]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1.
Post hoc analysis of surgically treated spontaneous intracerebral hematoma from the TICH-2 trial. TICH-2, Tranexamic acid in IntraCerebral Hemorrhage-2.

In this analysis, our primary outcome was surgery performed within 7 days, which was documented on the case report form (CRF). Surgical intervention was divided into placement of external ventricular drain, craniotomy, minimally invasive drainage procedures, or endovascular coiling. Although, participants who underwent multiple procedures were counted as surgically managed participants, further details of reoperation (ie, indication, timing, procedure order) were not recorded on the CRF. Date of surgery was determined as the date of first intervention. Characteristics and outcomes of surgically treated participants who received TXA were compared with placebo. HE was defined as an absolute increase of more than 6 mL or a relative growth of > 33% between baseline imaging and repeat imaging performed at 24 hours. Neurological deterioration was defined as an increase in National Institute of Health Stroke Scale by 4 points or more or reduction in GCS by 2 or more points. HV on preoperative imaging and postoperative HV were compared if, first, a postoperative computed tomography scan was performed and, second, if the participant had received hematoma evacuation (by either drainage or craniotomy). Participants who did not have a postoperative scan or did not receive hematoma evacuation were excluded from volumetric analysis. Hematoma and perihematoma edema volumes were calculated by segmentation using ITK Snap (Version 3.8.0) as previously described. Hematoma clearance was defined as the difference in HV between the preoperative and postoperative imaging. Time to surgery was calculated in days from date of ictus to date of surgery. For those with a postoperative scan, time to surgery was also estimated based on time from ictus to postoperative imaging (if the interval on the CRF was longer).

### Outcome 1 year after ICH: data from the tranexamic acid for intraCerebral haemorrhage 2 (TICH-2) trial [^f4c03d66]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

About 2325 patients were recruited into the TICH-2 trial (age 68.9, (±)13.8 years; 1301 male, 56%). Of these, 1910 participants (82.2%) were eligible for 1 year follow up. At 1 year, 57 patients (3.0%) were lost to follow up, 26 (1.4%) withdrew consent (withdrawal from trial/refused at time of follow-up) and 37 (1.9%) did not complete the follow-up for other reasons, leaving valid 1-year mRS outcome available in 1790 patients (93.7%) (Figure 1). Vital status was available in 1873 patients (Figure 1). The mean age was 69.7 (13.7) and 1041 (54.50%) participants were male. The median time from stroke onset to randomisation was 3.5 h (IQR 2.6–4.8 h). The mean baseline systolic blood pressure was 172.6 mmHg (SD 27.6 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure was 92.3 mmHg (SD 18.3 mmHg). 543 (56.92%) participants' haematoma location was supratentorial deep, 325 (34.07%) supratentorial lobar and 61 (6.39%) infratentorial. Mean haematoma volume was 25.3 mL (SD 27.8 ml). There were no baseline differences between the treatment groups followed up till 1-year and those who were followed up till 90 days, apart from country of origin (Table 1).

Knowledge gaps and future research — antithrombotic therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): In addition to the uncertainty of risk and benefit of anticoagulation in patients with AF and ICH, there is limited evidence for individual selection of optimal timing of anticoagulation resumption in patients for whom anticoagulation will be restarted, and ongoing trials and future studies with stratification based on ICH location, mechanism, and risk factors for recurrence may lead to more informative decisions. Most analyses evaluating the role of appropriate antithrombotic therapy in patients with ICH have focused on recurrent events, and future studies that incorporate outcomes such as disability or quality of life in addition to clinical events may provide information that is more patient-centric.

### Seizure prophylaxis after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage… [^3d8ce15d]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

This decision analysis underscores the importance of early discontinuation of antiseizure drug therapy initiated before or after early seizures; use of the 2HELPS2B score to guide the clinical decision on initiation of short-term primary vs secondary early-seizure prophylaxis should be considered for all patients after sICH, assuming timely availability of electroencephalography. Sensitivity analyses suggested that short-term strategies are preferred under most scenarios, and the risk-guided strategy performs comparably to or better than alternative strategies in most settings. Conclusions and Relevance This decision analytical model suggests that short-term prophylaxis dominates longer-term therapy after sICH. Use of the 2HELPS2B score to guide clinical decisions for initiation of short-term primary vs secondary early-seizure prophylaxis should be considered for all patients after sICH.

We modeled 3 strategies that reflect the plausible range of approaches in the current care of patients with sICH, as well as a risk-guided approach that incorporates risk stratification of early seizure using the 2HELPS2B score into the decision process underlying seizure prophylaxis. eFigure 2 in the Supplement details the application of these 4 strategies in clinical practice. We used a decision analytical model to examine the net benefit of 4 antiseizure drug prophylaxis strategies across 4 common base cases starting from presentation with incident sICH. We found short-term early-seizure prophylactic regimens are preferred over long-term regimens under most realistic clinical scenarios.

Our results also suggest that a strategy that incorporates an early-seizure risk stratification tool to identify patients most likely to benefit from short-term primary vs secondary early-seizure prophylaxis is favored over alternative strategies in most settings. Our decision analysis indicates the advantages of short-term antiseizure drug strategies across a spectrum of clinical scenarios for patients presenting with incident sICH. This finding underscores the importance of early discontinuation of antiseizure drug strategies initiated for early-seizure prophylaxis. Moreover, we recommend a risk-based approach using the 2HELPS2B score to guide clinical decision on initiation of primary vs secondary early-seizure prophylaxis for all patients after sICH, assuming timely availability of EEG.

### Outcome 1 year after ICH: data from the tranexamic acid for intraCerebral haemorrhage 2 (TICH-2) trial [^24729856]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) accounted for approximately 3.2 million cases of strokeand 2.89 million deaths in 2019. In terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), ICH accounted for 4.4% of all stroke-related DALYs in 2019. ICH carries a high morbidity and mortality rate due to complications such as haematoma expansion, neuroinflammation and brain oedema as well as few successful treatment options. Haematoma expansion occurs in 38% of patients with acute ICH within the first few hours of onset and leads to higher mortality and worse functional outcome. Hence, limiting haematoma expansion with haemostatic therapy is an important therapeutic target. The Tranexamic acid for IntraCerebral Haemorrhage-2 (TICH-2) trial tested the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, in acute spontaneous ICH, within 8 h of symptom onset. There was no significant improvement in death and dependency at day 90 despite small but significant reductions in haematoma expansion, early neurological deterioration, early death and serious adverse events. One possible explanation is the modest reduction in haematoma volume of 1.4 mL may be insufficient to translate into improvement in functional outcome. The primary outcome of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was assessed at 90 days, which corresponds to the period of greatest motor recovery after stroke. However, motor functions of people with stroke due to ICH may continue to improve beyond 3 months. The prevalence of recurrent ICH, ischaemic stroke and other vascular events are cumulative over the years especially in the older ages groups (55–94). Recent literature supports avoiding early prognostication as it is a poor indicator of long-term recovery.– Prognostication and morbidity amongst ICH patients with co-morbidities such as diabetes is worse and not always accounted for in trials. It has also been shown that reduction of haematoma volume in the first month has a positive impact on recovery at 1 year. Language and cognitive function may also continue to improve up to 2 years after stroke. In addition, stroke complications are common with approximately 46% of the trial patients experiencing serious adverse events in the first 90 days, thus impairing the recovery process.

Here, we report on outcomes at 1 year after stroke to explore the possibility of a delayed effect of tranexamic acid on improving functional recovery after ICH. We tested the hypothesis that intravenous tranexamic acid given within 8 h of spontaneous ICH reduces death and dependence at 1 year.

### Outcome 1 year after ICH: data from the tranexamic acid for intraCerebral haemorrhage 2 (TICH-2) trial [^1b790a93]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this pre-specified sub-study, tranexamic acid did not improve functional outcome compared to placebo 1 year after ICH. There was no difference in other secondary outcomes between treatment groups at 1 year.

Cox proportional hazard regression showed significant improvement in survival in the tranexamic acid group at 1-year and the benefit appeared to be cumulative. However, this was a secondary analysis, in a neutral trial, therefore this result may be due to chance. Contrary to the reduction in early death (< 7 days) in the primary TICH-2 analysis, the survival curves converge till day 100 before diverging. Possible physiological reasons for a delayed effect on mortality could be the reduced haematoma volume or fewer serious adverse events (SAEs) up until 90 days post stroke in the tranexamic acid group which may have improved the recovery trajectory. However, we cannot draw conclusions on this as SAEs or fatal SAEs were not collected past 90 day and the primary TICH-2 analysis on survival at 90 days was conducted on a larger cohort.

### Early surgery versus initial conservative treatment in patients with traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (STITCH [trauma]): the first randomized trial [^79f28302]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of early surgical TICH removal is to prevent secondary brain injury, which is thought to be caused by a number of mechanisms. Extravasated blood is believed to be neurotoxic, leading to secondary injury that may be avoided by early surgical removal. Larger TICHs may be associated with an ischemic penumbra of brain tissue that could be salvaged and some TICHs expand to the point where they cause mass effect, resulting in secondary brain injury. Contused brain does not seem to recover and appears later as encephalomalacic brain tissue loss on convalescent phase imaging. Removal of irreversibly damaged brain contusion with TICH does not increase tissue loss. As with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH), there are patients who will deteriorate clinically and the question of early surgery arises to anticipate such secondary damage.

Use of surgery for TICH varies around the world. It is more frequent in Asia than in Europe or North America. There have been randomized trials of surgery for SICH, but none thus far of surgery for TICH. Patients suffering a TICH tend to be younger than those suffering a SICH, and therefore level of disability may have a larger effect on ability to return to employment and economic output. TICHs are more likely to be lobar, superficial, and have a medium-sized volume (25–65 cc). These differences between the conditions mean that the role of surgery for TICH cannot be directly derived from results of the published trials of surgery for SICH. If early surgery is of benefit to TICH patients, then implementation of early referral and diagnosis with immediate treatment may reduce incidence of death and disability in this specific group of TBI patients.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK published their second edition of guidelines for the triage and management of TBI patients in 2007, and the Brain Trauma Foundation published their guidelines for the surgical management of TBI in 2006. Both of these organizations have emphasized that studies have been observational and that there is a lack of class 1 evidence from well-designed randomized, controlled trials. Those unrandomized studies that attempt to compare outcome between surgical and nonsurgical groups cannot adequately control for known prognostic variables. The NICE recommended in the 2007 guideline that research is needed to develop a consensus on criteria for lesions not currently considered to be surgically significant, namely, TICH. This recommendation facilitated the funding of [STITCH(TRAUMA)] to find out whether early surgery would improve outcomes, compared with initial conservative treatment, in patients with supratentorial TICH.

### Outcome 1 year after ICH: data from the tranexamic acid for intraCerebral haemorrhage 2 (TICH-2) trial [^9d46cf3c]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the loss to follow up rate increased by nearly 10-fold from day 90 to 1 year follow up, there was still a low number (3%) of patients that withdrew or were lost to follow up. This supports the feasibility of future trials having longer follow up. To our knowledge, this study is one of the largest randomised controlled trials of ICH patients with a 1-year follow up. A limitation of the study is that fatal SAEs and safety outcomes were only reported till day 90, and only up to 7 days for other SAEs. This sub-study was only able to include participants recruited from the UK and not the all the TICH-2 participants were included. Furthermore, this study is a secondary analysis of the TICH-2 trial, and death was not the primary outcome of this study. Therefore, it is possible that the difference seen on the survival analysis is due to chance and we cannot draw robust conclusions or further explore the potential reasons for difference in survival after 90 days.

### Significance of intraventricular hemorrhage in acute intracerebral hemorrhage: intensive blood pressure reduction in acute cerebral hemorrhage trial results [^6677fc99]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage indicates a poor prognosis but uncertainty exists over the pattern of association. We aimed to elucidate risk associations of IVH and outcome in the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2) data set.

Methods

INTERACT2 was an international prospective, open-blinded end point, randomized controlled trial in 2839 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (< 6 hours) with elevated systolic blood pressure randomly assigned to intensive (target systolic blood pressure < 140 mm Hg) or guideline-based (systolic blood pressure < 180 mm Hg) blood pressure management. Associations of baseline IVH in 740 of 2613 (28%) patients and poor outcomes (death and major disability defined on the modified Rankin Scale) at 90 days were determined in linear and logistic regression models.

Results

Patients with IVH were significantly older and with greater neurological impairment, history of ischemic stroke, and larger hematomas more often deep hemisphere located at presentation, after adjustment for other baseline variables. Death or major disability occurred in 66% with IVH versus 49% in intracerebral hemorrhage-alone patients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–2.06; P < 0.01). Associations of IVH volume and clinical outcomes were strong and near continuous. Adjusted analyses by thirds of IVH volume indicate thresholds of ≈5 and 10 mL for significantly increased odds of death and death or major disability, respectively.

Conclusions

A strong association exists between the amount of IVH and poor outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage. An IVH volume of 5 to 10 mL emerges as a significant threshold for decision making on prognosis in these patients.

### Outcomes in antiplatelet-associated intracerebral hemorrhage in the TICH-2 randomized controlled trial [^ede06e49]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately 25% of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are on antiplatelet treatment before ICH. 1 Antiplatelet therapy impairs hemostasis, which may lead to hematoma expansion. 2 In addition, patients taking antiplatelet therapy were more likely to have a previous ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease, or peripheral vascular disease leading to more post‐ICH complications. Nevertheless, the effect of antiplatelet therapy on clinical outcomes is uncertain. Some studies reported that pre‐ICH antiplatelet therapy increased the risk of neurological deterioration, death, and poor functional outcome, 1, 3, 4, 5 while others did not. 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Antiplatelet therapy was reported to be associated with larger baseline hematoma volume, 6 intraventricular hemorrhage, 11 and hematoma expansion 2, 12 in some studies, though others have shown that antiplatelet therapy did not have significant effects on hematoma characteristics. 9, 10 A large individual patient data meta‐analysis (5435 patients, 36 observational cohorts) concluded that antiplatelet therapy, as well as shorter time from onset to imaging, larger baseline hematoma volume, and pre‐ICH anticoagulant therapy, independently increased the risk of hematoma expansion. 2

There is currently no specific hemostatic therapy for antiplatelet‐associated intracerebral hemorrhage. Platelet transfusion was harmful in 1 randomized controlled trial. 13 The effects of tranexamic acid on antiplatelet‐associated ICH have not been studied in a randomized controlled setting.

In the primary publication of the TICH‐2 (Tranexamic Acid in Intracerebral Hemorrhage‐2) trial, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of ordinal shift in day 90 modified Rankin scale between tranexamic acid and placebo arm, despite a reduction in hematoma expansion. 14 In the current analysis, we aimed to explore the relationship between pre‐ICH antiplatelet therapy and hematoma characteristics and functional outcome in spontaneous ICH; and to explore the effect of tranexamic acid in patients taking antiplatelet therapy. We hypothesized that antiplatelet therapy increases the risk of hematoma expansion and poor functional outcome and that tranexamic acid has a beneficial effect on hematoma expansion and outcome in patients taking antiplatelet therapy.

Intraventricular thrombolysis (IVT) with alteplase in obstructive IVH and small- to moderate-volume intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — In patients with IVH obstructing the third or fourth ventricle and ICH volume < 30 mL requiring a routinely placed external ventricular drain (EVD), controlled irrigation with a thrombolytic "improves survival", and in CLEAR III mortality was "significantly lower… at 180 days" for EVD plus alteplase versus EVD plus saline. Functional benefit is uncertain: "It is not clear whether EVD plus IVT improves functional outcomes", and in CLEAR III "EVD plus irrigation with alteplase did not improve functional outcomes at 180 days" in obstructive IVH with ICH volume < 30 mL. Reported functional benefit increased with greater clot removal "(> 85%)" of IVH volume, while "a greater proportion of patients in the IVT arm had severe disability (mRS score 5) at 180 days". Safety findings include that symptomatic hemorrhage "was not different between study groups", "bacterial ventriculitis and SAEs were significantly less frequent" with alteplase, and other trials show "no significant difference in safety end points (rebleeding after treatment and ventriculitis)". Most randomized clinical trials "included patients up to 75 or 80 years of age", and CLEAR III "excluded patients with anticipated early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies". For candidates for IVT, "shared decision-making between physicians and family members is recommended", and "there is uncertainty over whether EVD alone improves functional outcomes" compared with conservative care.

### Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary intraCerebral haemorrhage (TICH-2): an international randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 superiority trial [^940d6ebc]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

We prespecified subgroups in the statistical analysis plan:age (< 70 years vs ≥ 70 years), sex (female vs male), time from onset to randomisation (< 3 h vs ≥ 3 h), mean systolic blood pressure (< 170 mm Hg vs ≥ 170 mm Hg), stroke severity (NIHSS score < 15 vs ≥ 15), presence of intraventricular haemorrhage (no vs yes), known history of antiplatelet treatment before stroke onset (no vs yes), spot sign on CTA (yes vs no), intracerebral haemorrhage location (supratentorial deep vs supratentorial lobar), and ethnicity (other vs white).

Prespecified safety outcomes were death, venous thromboembolism, ischaemic events (stroke, transient ischaemic attack, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, peripheral artery disease), and seizures. These were reported up to day 90, along with all serious adverse events in the first 7 days. Safety outcomes and serious adverse events were independently adjudicated masked to treatment assignment. Serious adverse events were categorised in accordance with the medical dictionary for regulatory authorities (MeDRA).

Statistical analyses

The total sample size based on an ordinal primary analysis was estimated at 2000 participants, assuming significance of 5%, power of 90%, an ordinal odds ratio (OR) of 0·79, a distribution of the mRS based on data from participants with primary intracerebral haemorrhage in the ENOS trial(4% had mRS 0, 17% had 1, 16% had 2, 19% had 3, 24% had 4, 7% had 5, and 13% had 6), increases due to loss of follow-up at 5%, and a 20% reduction for baseline covariate adjustment. The OR of 0·79 was chosen because it lay in the range seen in related trials. The effect of tranexamic acid on an unfavourable functional status (ie, death, vegetative state, or fully dependent requiring attention day and night or dependent but not requiring constant attention) had a relative risk of 0·77 (95% CI 0·59–1·02) when given within 8 h of traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage.

### Effect of tranexamic acid administration on remote cerebral ischemic lesions in acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a substudy of a randomized clinical trial [^3973dfec]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Hyperintense foci on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) that are spatially remote from the acute hematoma occur in 20% of people with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Tranexamic acid, a hemostatic agent that is under investigation for treating acute ICH, might increase DWI hyperintense lesions (DWIHLs).

Objective

To establish whether tranexamic acid compared with placebo increased the prevalence or number of remote cerebral DWIHLs within 2 weeks of ICH onset.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective nested magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) substudy of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) recruited participants from the multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 RCT (Tranexamic Acid for Hyperacute Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage [TICH-2]) from July 1, 2015, to September 30, 2017, and conducted follow-up to 90 days after participants were randomized to either the tranexamic acid or placebo group. Participants had acute spontaneous ICH and included TICH-2 participants who provided consent to undergo additional MRI scans for the MRI substudy and those who had clinical MRI data that were compatible with the brain MRI protocol of the substudy. Data analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis on January 20, 2020.

Interventions

The tranexamic acid group received 1 g in 100-mL intravenous bolus loading dose, followed by 1 g in 250-mL infusion within 8 hours of ICH onset. The placebo group received 0.9% saline within 8 hours of ICH onset. Brain MRI scans, including DWI, were performed within 2 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence and number of remote DWIHLs were compared between the treatment groups using binary logistic regression adjusted for baseline covariates.

Results

A total of 219 participants (mean [SD] age, 65.1 [13.8] years; 126 men [57.5%]) who had brain MRI data were included. Of these participants, 96 (43.8%) were randomized to receive tranexamic acid and 123 (56.2%) were randomized to receive placebo. No baseline differences in demographic characteristics and clinical or imaging features were found between the groups. There was no increase for the tranexamic acid group compared with the placebo group in DWIHL prevalence (20 of 96 [20.8%] vs 28 of 123 [22.8%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.33–1.53; P = 0.39) or mean (SD) number of DWIHLs (1.75 [1.45] vs 1.81 [1.71]; mean difference [MD], -0.08; 95% CI, -0.36 to 0.20; P = 0.59). In an exploratory analysis, participants who were randomized within 3 hours of ICH onset or those with chronic infarcts appeared less likely to have DWIHLs if they received tranexamic acid. Participants with probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy appeared more likely to have DWIHLs if they received tranexamic acid.

Conclusions and Relevance

This substudy of an RCT found no evidence of increased prevalence or number of remote DWIHLs after tranexamic acid treatment in acute ICH. These findings provide reassurance for ongoing and future trials that tranexamic acid for acute ICH is unlikely to induce cerebral ischemic events.

Furthermore, in 249 patients enrolled in the TICH-2 trial, 56 patients with a positive spot sign were randomised to receive tranexamic acid (24) or placebo (32). The trial found a poor treatment effect of tranexamic acid in the subgroup analysis. In the post hoc analysis in the same studyfor the purpose of defining the role of the NCCT signs as predictors of haematoma expansion and poor functional outcome, blend sign, black hole sign and hypodensities were found to be predictive of haematoma expansion. Black hole sign, hypodensities and island signs predicted a poor functional outcome. The study did not show any significant correlation between the presence of signs and the benefit of tranexamic acid in reducing haematoma expansion. NCCT signs do not indicate a better response to tranexamic acid regarding the clinical outcome. In summary, studies on patients susceptible to haemorrhage expansion predicted by CT signs, especially the spot sign, showed that haemostatic therapy did not significantly prevent the haematoma growth or improve the outcome.

Future direction

This meta-analysis showed that haemostatic therapy might have the benefit of reducing early haematoma expansion in selected patients with ICH. It has been reported by a prior systematic reviewthat haemostatic therapy does not increase the occurrence of thrombotic events. However, no significant improvement in prognosis or reduction in mortality was observed with haemostatic therapy in patients with ICH with or without CT signs. There are several possible explanations. First, modest absolute volume reduction in haematoma may not be sufficient to show clinical benefit. Second, the previous studiesshowed some other uncertainties that might impact the outcome. Haemostatic therapy could modestly reduce haematoma expansion but not enough to alter the pathophysiological process. For example, haemostatic therapy could not change perihaematomal brain oedemaand other complications, similar to the limitations of surgical intervention for ICH. However, these unresolved clinical problems may have a bigger impact on the final prognosis of patients with ICH. Predictive CT signs used in these studies were proved to be valuable in predicting haematoma expansion and poor prognosis, but the underlying pathological mechanisms remain unclear. It appears that different CT signs may have different predictive roles in evaluating the therapeutic effects of the haemostatic therapy. It is time to evaluate different predictive CT signs in those subgroups that showed potentially improved outcome. In the post hoc analysis of Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage (ATACH-2), ultraearly blood pressure (BP) reduction ≤ 2 hours could reduce haematoma growth and further improve functional outcome. Subgroup analyses from the TICH-2, STOP-AUST and TRAIGE all found that earlier treatment (within 2–3 hours) seemed to show more benefit. The proposed time window could also be used for haemostatic therapy in future research. More trials using tranexamic acid to treat ICH in the early time window are already ongoing (EudraCT 2012-005594-30 and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03385928). There was speculation that haemostatic therapy might be similar to intravenous thrombolysis for ischaemic stroke, namely, earlier cessation of haematoma expansion might stop the trend of a cascade of deterioration.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) blood pressure management in moderate to severe cases — A post hoc analysis of ATACH-2 including 682 participants with moderate to severe ICH (GCS < 13, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥ 10, ICH volume ≥ 30 mL, or IVH) found that EIBPL reduced HE but did not reduce death or disability at 90 days. In patients with large ICH (≥ 30 mL) requiring ICP monitoring or severe IVH requiring EVD, CPP burdens of < 60 and < 70 mm Hg were associated with increased mortality and poor functional outcomes, respectively, suggesting that BP reduction be accompanied by maintenance of CPP of 60 to ≥ 70 mm Hg in those with large ICH, ICP elevation, or compromised CPP. Although patients with SBP > 220 mm Hg were not intentionally included in the trials, it is common practice to take a similar BP-lowering approach in these patients.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis timing and safety are described as follows: In safety-focused evidence, "a more recent meta-analysis of 9 studies and > 4000 patients… prophylaxis with any type of heparin was not associated with a significant increase of HE or extracranial hemorrhage, an increase in mRS scores of 3 to 5, or an increase in numbers of Glasgow Outcome Scale scores of 2 to 3". Reported early starts included "4 days (versus 10 days)" in an RCT, "a median of 42 hours after admission" when comparing "within 48 hours of admission versus > 48 hours", and "within 48 hours from symptom onset", with "the earliest start… 25 hours after admission". The narrative notes "It may be reasonable to first document hemorrhage stability on CT if LMWH prophylaxis is started in the 24- to 48-hour window after ICH onset", and in another cohort starting UFH or LMWH "0 to 1 days after CT demonstrating stability, intracranial hemorrhagic complications were observed in 1.7%".

### Surgery for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage [^24a8cb6b]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage is a devastating disease, accounting for 10 to 15% of all types of stroke; however, it is associated with disproportionally higher rates of mortality and disability. Despite significant progress in the acute management of these patients, the ideal surgical management is still to be determined. Surgical hematoma drainage has many theoretical benefits, such as the prevention of mass effect and cerebral herniation, reduction in intracranial pressure, and the decrease of excitotoxicity and neurotoxicity of blood products.

Several surgical techniques have been considered, such as open craniotomy, decompressive craniectomy, neuroendoscopy, and minimally invasive catheter evacuation followed by thrombolysis. Open craniotomy is the most studied approach in this clinical scenario, the first randomized controlled trial dating from the early 1960s. Since then, a large number of studies have been published, which included two large, well-designed, well-powered, multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical trials. These studies, The International Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (STICH), and the STICH II have shown no clinical benefit for early surgical evacuation of intraparenchymal hematoma in patients with spontaneous supratentorial hemorrhage when compared with best medical management plus delayed surgery if necessary. However, the results of STICH trials may not be generalizable, because of the high rates of patients' crossover from medical management to the surgical group. Without these high crossover percentages, the rates of unfavorable outcome and death with conservative management would have been higher. Additionally, comatose patients and patients at risk of cerebral herniation were not included. In these cases, surgery may be lifesaving, which prevented those patients of being enrolled in such trials. This article reviews the clinical evidence of surgical hematoma evacuation, and its role to decrease mortality and improve long-term functional outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary intraCerebral haemorrhage (TICH-2): an international randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 superiority trial [^58ac63ef]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

TICH-2 was an international double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase 3 trial. Participants were enrolled by investigators from acute stroke units at 124 hospital sites in 12 countries: Denmark, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK. Ethics approval was obtained at each site and country before the start of the study. The trial was adopted in the UK by the National Institute Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network and registered as ISRCTN93732214. The full TICH-2 trial protocol and statistical plan have been published.

Adults with acute intracerebral haemorrhage were eligible for inclusion if they were admitted to a participating hospital within 8 h of stroke symptom onset (or time last seen well). We chose 8 h as the treatment window for consistency with both of the previous trials of tranexamic acid in traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage. We sought to include participants as quickly as possible because haematoma expansion usually occurs in the first few hours after intracerebral haemorrhage, but allowed randomisation up to 8 h because some patients present later and haematoma expansion can occur up to 24 h. Key exclusion criteria were intracerebral haemorrhage secondary to anticoagulation, thrombolysis, trauma, or a known underlying structural abnormality; patients for whom tranexamic acid was thought to be contraindicated; prestroke dependence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score > 4); life expectancy less than 3 months; and Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 5. The complete list of exclusion criteria has been published previously.

Investigators obtained written informed consent from each participant if they had the capacity to provide it. If participants could not give consent, a relative or representative gave proxy consent. When consent was deferred or given by a proxy, we informed the participant about the trial as soon as possible and sought their consent.

### Spot sign in intracerebral hemorrhage: critical reappraisal and future clinical implications [^81e25676]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Specifically, 4 clinical trials have selected patients based on the presence of the spot sign to increase the likelihood of demonstrating the benefit of hemostatic treatments: SPOTLIGHT (Spot Sign Selection of Intracerebral Hemorrhage to Guide Hemostatic Therapy)/STOP-IT (The Spot Sign for Predicting and Treating ICH Growth Study) (published together), STOP-AUST (Spot Sign and Tranexamic Acid on Preventing ICH Growth–Australasia Trial), and TRAIGE (Tranexemic acid for acute intracerebral haemorrhage growth based on imaging assessment) (Table 1). – These trials investigated the use of rFVIIa and TXA in small-moderate spontaneous ICH within 4.5 to 6.5 hours from symptom onset. All 4 trials found no significant clinical or radiological benefits. These results might have been attributed to several factors: (1) a relatively small number of patients, (2) a long median time from onset to drug administration, and (3) unexpectedly low absolute HE in participants. Moreover, a prespecified analysis of SPOTLIGHT showed that in most patients, the majority of HE had already been completed in the short time interval between baseline imaging acquisition and drug administration — confirmed by an immediate postdose NCCT — hampering any potential treatment benefit of hemostatic therapy in that trial population.

Table 1.
Spot Sign–Guided Selection Trials

Similarly, post hoc analyses of trials that were not imaging-guided in the selection of patients also failed to demonstrate an interaction between the hemostatic therapeutic effect and the spot sign. A secondary analysis of the TICH-2 trial (Tranexamic Acid for Hyperacute Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage) did not reveal any additional benefit of TXA over placebo in the subgroup of patients with positive spot sign. However, TXA was administered after a median of 225 minutes from symptom onset, and the median delay between imaging acquisition and drug administration was 76 minutes, thereby minimizing any potential hemostatic benefit.

A recent individual patient meta-analysis of spot sign–positive patients from clinical trials, however, did show a modest reduction of hematoma growth of 1.6 mL with TXA administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.

The relationship between timing and spot sign can further hint at the failure of these trials, as the positive predictive value of the spot sign progressively decreases as time elapses. Currently, RCTs have switched focus to selecting patients in an ultraearly time window (< 2 hours) for all participants rather than based on imaging features such as the spot sign.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — thromboembolism burden and device efficacy evidence support IPC over stockings and characterize pharmacologic timing. The in-hospital incidence of thromboembolic complications in patients with ICH is ≈7%, and the risk of DVT is 4 times higher than in patients with acute ischemic stroke. A network meta-analysis showed that IPC devices were more effective than compression stockings to reduce VTE in patients with acute ICH, and the CLOTS Trial 3 was the largest of the randomized controlled trials even when the subset with hemorrhagic stroke (13%) was considered. Graduated compression stockings of any length are not effective against symptomatic DVT according to 2 large RCTs and 2 meta-analyses. In a meta-analysis of 2 RCTs and 2 observational studies with a total of 1000 patients with ICH, heparin prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of PE, with a nonsignificant increase in HE and no significant difference in DVT or death; initiation timing varied at 24–96 hours from admission, and follow-up was only 10 days in 1 study.

### Advances in therapeutic approaches for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage [^7530e4c3]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) results in high rates of morbidity and mortality, with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) being associated with even worse outcomes. Therapeutic interventions in acute ICH have continued to emerge with focus on arresting hemorrhage expansion, clot volume reduction of both intraventricular and parenchymal hematomas, and targeting perihematomal edema and inflammation. Large randomized controlled trials addressing the effectiveness of rapid blood pressure lowering, hemostatic therapy with platelet transfusion, and other clotting complexes and hematoma volume reduction using minimally invasive techniques have impacted clinical guidelines. We review the recent evolution in the management of acute spontaneous ICH, discussing which interventions have been shown to be safe and which may potentially improve outcomes.

### Tranexamic acid for intracerebral hemorrhage in patients on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (TICH-NOAC): a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^e1ab9a2b]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this first randomized controlled trial of TXA versus placebo in patients with NOAC-associated ICH, we found no evidence that TXA limits HE nor that it improves clinical outcomes by 90 days. However, there were no major safety concerns for the use of TXA, and treatment might hold potential for preventing HE in selected patient subgroups, particularly those treated early after ICH onset.

The hemostatic effect reflects the balance between the opposing processes of thrombin generation through the coagulation cascade leading to fibrin clot formation and endogenous fibrinolysis leading to fibrin clot disintegration. TXA does not affect the coagulation factors thrombin or factor Xa, which are the targets of the NOAC, but blocks endogenous fibrinolysis, thus delaying fibrin disintegration and accelerating and stabilizing fibrin clot formation, a mechanism of action that is not specific to NOAC-associated bleeding. TXA was recently tested for acute ICH treatment in several randomized controlled trials, with further trials ongoing. Meta-analyses of the so far available evidence, driven mostly by the large TICH-2 trial, showed that TXA may be modestly effective in limiting HE, particularly when administered early in patients at high risk for HE. However, these trials excluded patients with NOAC-associated ICH, who are becoming increasingly more common in clinical practice.

### A restrictive versus a liberal transfusion strategy in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a secondary analysis of TRAIN randomized clinical trial [^078868ad]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe form of cerebrovascular injury, representing 10% to 20% of all strokes; ICH is associated with high early mortality and limited potential for recovery or improvement in functional outcomes over time. The incidence of spontaneous ICH is anticipated to rise due to the aging population and the increasing use of novel anticoagulants. Various therapeutic approaches have been proposed to improve outcomes following ICH, including blood pressure reduction, reversal of anticoagulation, intraventricular fibrinolysis and minimally invasive surgery –; however, results from these interventions remain controversial, despite being effective in selected patients.

Secondary brain injuries prevention is a pivotal aspect of managing ICH. Whether early and aggressive management of the systemic variables (eg, glucose, sodium, or temperature)might contribute to minimizing the progression of cerebral damage and improving functional outcomes remains unknown. Among these, anemia is a frequent medical complication following ICH, affecting 20% to 25% of patients. Observational studies have reported a significant association between anemia, hematoma expansion, and poor outcomes. – Moreover, it has been suggested that red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) might improve 30-day mortality after spontaneous ICH. Nevertheless, there is no consensus on the optimal hemoglobin threshold to guide transfusion in this context.

A recent large randomized controlled trial, comparing a liberal and a restrictive transfusion strategy, demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of unfavorable neurological outcomes in the liberal group in a mixed population of patients with acute brain injury. In addition, the liberal strategy group exhibited a lower risk of cerebral ischemic events. This secondary analysis aimed to determine whether these benefits were observed specifically in patients with spontaneous ICH.

We further analysed the data with the two treatment arms as seperate subgroups, looking at the outcome differences between day 90 and 1-year (Table 3). We saw no difference in mRS in between day 90 and 1 year in the placebo group or tranexamic group (adjusted OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85–1.19, p = 0.97, adjusted OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93–1.31, p = 0.25 respectively) (Table 3). We also reviewed the continuous secondary outcomes between 90 days and 1 year. Neither placebo nor tranexamic acid group showed any statistically significant difference in the EQ-5D HUS score (MD −0.00, 95% CI −0.04 to −0.03, p = 0.76), (MD −0.02, 95% CI −0.05 to 0.01, p = 0.16), EQ-5D VAS score (MD 1.93, 95% CI −0.65 to −4.52, p = 0.14), (MD 2.44, 95% CI −0.35 to 5.23, p = 0.09), or Barthel index (MD −0.36, 95% CI −3.37 to −2.65, p = 0.81), (MD −0.03, 95% CI −3.16 to 3.10, p = 0.98) (Table 3). However, there was a significant worsening between 90 days and 1 year in the TICS-M and ZDS scores in the placebo group (MD 1.12, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.16, p = 0.04 and MD −3.12, 95% CI −5.75- −0.49, p = 0.02 respectively), which was not observed in the tranexamic acid group (MD 0.42, 95% CI −0.66–1.50, p = 0.44, MD −2.26, 95% CI −4.92–0.40, p = 0.10 respectively) (Table 3).

Glucose management — synopsis and rationale in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): Glucose monitoring and management are often considered part of the general care of all patients, including those with ICH. Hyperglycemia on presentation may herald a worse prognosis, yet tight glucose control may increase the risk of hypoglycemic events and worsen outcomes, and the ideal evidence-based approach to glucose management in patients with ICH has remained elusive. Monitoring serum glucose is important because it can provide an opportunity to intervene in the event of hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic events, and in the QASC single-blind cluster randomized clinical trial an intervention of fever, hyperglycemia, and swallowing protocols resulted in patients who were significantly less likely to be dead or dependent at 90 days, although the impact of each specific intervention could not be determined. No trials have analyzed the effects of untreated hypoglycemia given the known acute clinical risks.

Outcome prediction after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — recommendations: In patients with spontaneous ICH, administering a baseline measure of overall hemorrhage severity is recommended as part of the initial evaluation to provide an overall measure of clinical severity (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In patients with spontaneous ICH, a baseline severity score might be reasonable to provide a general framework for communication with the patient and their caregivers (COR 2b, LOE B-NR). In patients with spontaneous ICH, a baseline severity score should not be used as the sole basis for forecasting individual prognosis or limiting life-sustaining treatment (COR 3: No Benefit, LOE B-NR).

Results

Study Population

From a total of 850 patients randomized to the original trial, 144 (16.9%) presented with spontaneous ICH and were analyzed for this study; 71 patients were randomized to the liberal and 73 patients to the restrictive transfusion strategy group. Baseline characteristics and clinical profiles were comparable between the 2 groups (Table 1). Mean age was 58.4 (± 13.4) with a prevalence of female patients (54.2%). The majority of patients presented with a hematoma > 30 mL (n = 109, 75.7%), with the concomitant presence of intraventricular hemorrhage in 83 (57.6%) patients and hydrocephalus in 64 (44.4%) patients. Deep ICH localization was the most represented (n = 88, 61.1%).

Intracerebral hemorrhage characteristics (such as volume, localization, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus on admission) were also similar in the 2 groups; no difference was found in the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies at randomization.

### Surgical decision making in brain hemorrhage [^c14b52c1]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Randomized controlled trials are the prevailing paradigms of clinical research, and surgical evacuation of intracerebral hematomas (ICHs) has been the subject of 16. – The more powerful trials and meta-analyses, have repeatedly failed to displace the null hypothesis though have often shown nonsignificant benefits. That notwithstanding, there is an ongoing interest in the question with further trials ongoing or planned (MISTIE III [Minimally Invasive Surgery and rtPA for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation], CLEAR IV [Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage], and STITCH III [International Surgical Trial in IntraCerebral Haemorrhage]).

The null results of trials and meta-analyses led to the hypothesis that the effect of surgery, if any, is too small to detect with current trial data. The amount of randomized data now in hand has limited the size of such an overall benefit to the extent that, were it there, it would be of doubtful clinical significance. These analyses used an assumption common to much clinical research: there is a uniform response to a treatment for the population under study. This assumption is particularly weak with surgical treatments because in addition to the patient-specific variables that affect medical treatments, there is also variation between surgeons. Mechanistic lines of argument have led to a different theory, one commonly held by surgeons and one that predates all trial data. This theory is that response to surgery is not uniform from one case of ICH to another but varies with clot volume and clinical condition.

In this article, we present a combined analysis of trial data specifically aimed at testing the hypothesis: Is the neutrality of trial data a consequence of little effect or a consequence of mixing cases who benefit from surgery with those that are harmed?

Two trials used similar methodology to investigate whether patients had a better outcome with a policy of early surgery to evacuate spontaneous ICH compared with initial conservative treatment. The STICH (Surgical Trial in Lobar Intracerebral Haemorrhage) included patients with supratentorial ICH of at least 2 cm in diameter and with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of at least 5. In STICH II (Surgical Trial in Lobar Intracerebral Haemorrhage), these criteria were refined to include only patients with a lobar hemorrhage within 1 cm of the cortex surface of between 10 and 100 mL and where the Motor GCS was 5 or 6 and the Eye score of the GCS 2 or more.

Temperature management in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) shows mixed evidence: in a prospective database, pharmacological treatment of temperatures ≥ 37.5°C for 48 hours was associated with an increased likelihood of a good outcome at 3 months, whereas an RCT of catheter-based normothermia targeting 36.5°C reduced fever burden without differences in mortality or long-term outcomes, and overall clinical trial evidence does not support a benefit of therapeutic temperature modulation; therapeutic hypothermia 35°C/95° F to 36.5°C/97.7° F may be physiologically reasonable to reduce perihematoma edema but has not been demonstrated to be clinically beneficial, is not without risk, and should be considered of unclear benefit, with limited data including 2 small pilot studies noting high survival and maintenance of stable perihematomal edema volume.

### Outcomes in antiplatelet-associated intracerebral hemorrhage in the TICH-2 randomized controlled trial [^80b93b28]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 2325 patients recruited, 611 (26.3%) were taking antiplatelet therapy at the time of ICH, while 1713 (73.7%) were not; information on antiplatelet intake was not available in 1 patient. Data on functional outcome and hematoma expansion were available in 2306 and 2077 patients, respectively (Figure S1). Patients who were taking antiplatelet therapy were significantly older, more likely to have previous stroke or ischemic heart disease, and had more severe stroke and lower systolic blood pressure on admission (Table 1). Patients with pre‐ICH antiplatelet therapy had significantly larger baseline hematoma volume and were more likely to have intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid extension, old infarct(s), leukoaraiosis, and cerebral atrophy on baseline computed tomography scan. There was no difference in the proportion of patients with supratentorial lobar, supratentorial deep, and infratentorial hematoma between the antiplatelet and no‐antiplatelet groups. Within the antiplatelet group, characteristics of patients who received tranexamic acid and placebo were similar (Table 1).

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of Patients With Intracerebral Hemorrhage Associated With Versus Without Prior Antiplatelet Therapy

At 24 hours, patients with pre‐ICH antiplatelet therapy had significantly larger hematoma volume, greater absolute hematoma growth, and hematoma expansion compared with the no‐antiplatelet group (Table 2). The risks of intraventricular and subarachnoid extension of hemorrhage were significantly increased as well. The risks of neurological deterioration and death in the first 7 days were significantly higher in the antiplatelet group even after adjusting for key prognostic factors, as stated in the Methods section. At day 90, the risks of death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.63; 95% CI, 1.25–2.11; P < 0.001) and poor functional outcome (aOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.17–1.98; P = 0.002) were significantly higher in the antiplatelet group compared with the no‐antiplatelet group. Similarly, disability, depression, quality of life, and cognition scores were significantly worse in the antiplatelet group (Table 2). The proportion of patients with new stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and venous thromboembolism did not differ between the 2 groups. Pre‐ICH antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significant shift toward unfavorable outcome in ordinal regression analysis (aOR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.32–1.91; P < 0.001; Figure 1).

### Tranexamic acid for intracerebral hemorrhage in patients on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (TICH-NOAC): a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^dc5086d4]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence-based hemostatic treatment for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) associated with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is lacking. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic drug potentially limiting hematoma expansion. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of TXA in NOAC-ICH.

Methods

We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial at 6 Swiss stroke centers. Patients with NOAC-ICH within 12 hours of symptom onset and 48 hours of last NOAC intake were randomized (1:1) to receive either intravenous TXA (1 g over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over 8 hours) or matching placebo in addition to standard medical care via a centralized Web-based procedure with minimization on key prognostic factors. All participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. Primary outcome was hematoma expansion, defined as ≥ 33% relative or ≥ 6 mL absolute volume increase at 24 hours and analyzed using logistic regression adjusted for baseline hematoma volume on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

Between December 12, 2016, and September 30, 2021, we randomized 63 patients (median age, 82 years [interquartile range, 76–86]; 40% women; median hematoma volume, 11.5 [4.8–27.4] mL) of the 109 intended sample size before premature trial discontinuation due to exhausted funding. The primary outcome did not differ between TXA (n = 32) and placebo (n = 31) arms (12 [38%] versus 14 [45%]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.22–1.82]; P = 0.40). There was a signal for interaction with onset-to-treatment time (P interaction = 0.024), favoring TXA when administered within 6 hours of symptom onset. Between the TXA and placebo arms, the proportion of participants who died (15 [47%] versus 13 [42%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.07 [0.37–3.04]; P = 0.91) or had major thromboembolic complications within 90 days (4 [13%] versus 2 [6%]; odds ratio, 1.86 [0.37–9.50]; P = 0.45) did not differ. All thromboembolic events occurred at least 2 weeks after study treatment, exclusively in participants not restarted on oral anticoagulation.

Conclusions

In a smaller-than-intended NOAC-ICH patient sample, we found no evidence that TXA prevents hematoma expansion, but there were no major safety concerns. Larger trials on hemostatic treatments targeting an early treatment window are needed for NOAC-ICH.

### Recommended primary outcomes for clinical trials evaluating hemostatic agents in patients with intracranial hemorrhage: a consensus statement [^22745007]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

In patients with acute spontaneous or traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, early hemostasis is thought to be critical to minimize ongoing bleeding. However, research evaluating hemostatic therapies has been hampered by a lack of standardized clinical trial outcome measures.

Objective

To identify appropriate primary outcomes for phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of therapies aimed at reducing acute intracranial bleeding.

Evidence Review

A comprehensive review of all previous clinical trials of hemostatic therapy for intracranial bleeding was performed, and studies measuring the frequency, risk factors, and association of intracranial bleeding with outcome of hemorrhage growth were included.

Findings

A hierarchy of 3 outcome measures is recommended, with the first choice being a global patient-centered clinical outcome scale measured 30 to 180 days after the event; the second, a combined clinical and radiographic end point associating hemorrhage expansion with a poor patient-centered outcome at 24 hours or later; and the third, a radiographic measure of hemorrhage expansion at 24 hours alone. Additional recommendations stress the importance of separating various subtypes of bleeding when possible, early treatment within a standardized treatment window, and the routine use of computerized planimetry comparing continuous measures of absolute and relative hemorrhage growth as either a primary or secondary end point.

Conclusions and Relevance

Standardization of outcome measures in studies of intracranial bleeding and hemostatic therapy will support comparative effectiveness research and meta-analysis, with the goal of accelerating the translation of research into clinical practice. The 3 outcome measures proposed in this consensus statement could help this process.

### Minimally invasive surgery vs medical management alone for intracerebral hemorrhage: the MIND randomized clinical trial [^97d26bfa]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

It remains uncertain whether surgical evacuation improves functional outcomes in patients with supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery with the Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device to guideline-based medical management alone for spontaneous supratentorial ICH.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The MIND open-label, multicenter randomized clinical trial randomized patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH in a 2:1 ratio to either minimally invasive surgery or medical management alone. Participants were enrolled at 32 participating global sites between February 6, 2018, and August 28, 2023. This article reports on the primary trial outcome. Of 4066 eligible adult patients (aged 18–80 years) with moderate- to large-volume supratentorial ICH (20–80 mL), baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 6 or higher, and Glasgow Coma Scale score between 5 and 15, 154 were randomized to minimally invasive surgery and 82 to medical management. Data were analyzed from February to September 2024.

Intervention

Minimally invasive surgery (within 72 hours of symptom onset) plus medical management or medical management alone.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was 180-day combined death and disability via ordinal modified Rankin Scale score (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). The primary safety outcome was 30-day mortality.

Results

Following an independent feasibility analysis prompted by the publication of positive results of a contemporaneous ICH trial, enrollment was stopped early at 236 participants. Overall median (IQR) participant age was 60 (50–70) years, 87 participants (36.9%) were female, 164 (69.5%) had primarily deep bleeds, and 72 (30.5%) had primarily lobar bleeds. Efficacy results of the primary model analysis suggested lack of evidence for the superiority of minimally invasive surgery over medical management (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 96% CI, 0.62–1.72; P = 0.45). The adjusted model's mean OR was also nonsignificantly greater than 1 (OR, 1.10; 96% CI, 0.66–1.85; P = 0.35). By 30 days, 11 participants (7.2%) in the surgery group and 8 (9.8%) in the medical management group died (difference, -2.5%; 95% CI, -11.7% to 4.8%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In the MIND randomized clinical trial, minimally invasive surgery within 72 hours did not significantly reduce 30-day mortality or improve 180-day disability in patients with supratentorial ICH compared to medical management alone.

Knowledge gaps and future research in ICH BP management — The safety and efficacy of EIBPL in SBP > 220 mm Hg and in large or more severe ICHs require more study, with insufficient data to define a target BP range for large ICH and uncertainty about the rate of BP reduction at excessively high SBP; in INTERACT2, ≈75% had mild to moderate ICH < 20 mL with median ICH volume 11 mL and NIHSS 10 in the EIBPL group, whereas in ATACH-2, 91% had ICH volume < 30 mL with median ICH volume 10 mL and NIHSS 11. Only 16% of INTERACT-2 and 9.7% of ATACH-2 patients had lobar ICH. Ultraearly BP lowering remains unclear: in RIGHT-2, which included 145 of 1149 patients (13%) with ICH and SBP ≥ 120 mm Hg, transdermal nitroglycerine in the ambulance (median time 74 minutes from ICH onset to randomization) was associated with worse outcomes and larger hematoma and edema volumes, and benefits beyond the first 6 hours are uncertain because INTERACT2 and ATACH-2 initiated treatment within 6 and 4.5 hours, respectively.

Factor Xa inhibitor–associated ICH — andexanet alfa data and use: Andexanet alfa is a recombinant coagulation factor that reverses the inhibition of factor Xa; in a large multicenter open-label study of major bleeding within 18 hours after a factor Xa inhibitor, andexanet alfa significantly reduced anti–factor Xa activity, with a 10% VTE rate and 15% mortality rate, and in a subgroup with ICH, excellent or good hemostatic outcome, defined as < 35% increase in hematoma volume after 12 hours, was seen in 79% of patients. Small single-center comparisons reported higher rates of hemostatic efficacy and thromboembolism and significantly higher cost versus PCC, while another small comparison found similar stability of hematoma on CT at 6 and 24 hours; hence, although andexanet alfa can be effective to reverse anti–factor Xa activity, data on safety and clinical outcomes from a randomized trial are awaited, and the recommended dosing depends on the specific factor Xa inhibitor and the time since last dose.

Key Points

Question

Can minimally invasive surgery with the Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device improve outcomes in patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage?

Findings

The MIND randomized clinical trial stopped early, given the positive results of a contemporaneous trial and the outcome of a subsequent feasibility analysis; however, the available data for 236 participants suggest that minimally invasive surgery (within 72 hours of symptom onset) did not improve 180-day disability or reduce 30-day mortality in patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage compared to guideline-based medical management. Minimally invasive surgery significantly improved 30-day disability and reduced the occurrence of 180-day serious adverse events.

Meaning

While MIND did not demonstrate a benefit of minimally invasive surgery over medical management with respect to reducing 180-day disability or 30-day mortality, the Artemis system achieved efficient, safe, and substantial hemorrhage reduction in both deep and lobar bleeds.
