## Question

Behavior management in dementia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about behavior management in dementia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and its prevalence and impact. Then, I should verify the overarching principle that nonpharmacologic strategies are first-line. Next, I will examine the structured assessment framework and how to identify triggers and reversible causes. After that, I need to categorize nonpharmacologic interventions by mechanism and appraise the strength of evidence. Then, I should review pharmacologic options, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, and others, with explicit risk–benefit considerations. Finally, I will integrate special populations and settings, outline implementation and monitoring, and close with a concise, practical algorithm that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its significance. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) occur in up to 90% of people with dementia over the course of illness and drive caregiver burden, earlier institutionalization, and increased costs, so I need to ensure my approach addresses both patient and caregiver outcomes [^b6ad5c7a] [^3934f6b2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment hierarchy. I should confirm the first-line principle. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on nonpharmacologic interventions as initial management for BPSD, reserving medications for refractory cases or when safety is at risk, given modest efficacy and meaningful harms with psychotropics in this population [^b6ad5c7a] [^d9199b82] [^f861f8bc].

> Next, I should review the structured assessment framework. I need to check that we describe the target behavior precisely, identify antecedents and consequences, and screen for reversible contributors such as pain, delirium, infection, constipation, polypharmacy, sensory deficits, and environmental stressors. This is foundational because BPSD often reflects unmet needs or modifiable triggers rather than primary psychiatric pathology [^b6ad5c7a] [^b8bcf8e6] [^4b1e675a].

> I will now examine nonpharmacologic interventions by mechanism, starting with caregiver education and skills training. Wait, let me verify the durability of benefit. High-quality syntheses and RCTs show that structured caregiver interventions, including problem-solving and behavioral management training, reduce BPSD and caregiver distress with effects lasting months in some studies, supporting this as a cornerstone strategy [^b6ad5c7a] [^de352238] [^c5133b02].

> Let me consider environmental modifications next. I should confirm that creating a calm, predictable, and safe environment with consistent routines, minimizing overstimulation, and addressing sensory deficits reduces agitation and wandering. Guidelines endorse these measures broadly, and they align with person-centered care principles [^b6ad5c7a] [^2eccb4b3].

> Now, I need to appraise person-centered activity interventions. Music therapy, cognitive stimulation, reminiscence, and Montessori-based activities show modest but meaningful improvements in mood, engagement, and behavior, particularly when tailored to preferences and preserved abilities. I should double-check that guidelines recommend offering these in routine care where feasible [^f1661951] [^fed9484c] [^87a8ad0b] [^3857715d].

> But wait, what about physical activity and exercise. A rapid review and contemporary guidelines suggest structured physical activity reduces agitation and can improve sleep and mood, with higher adherence linked to greater benefit. I should confirm that we prescribe exercise with attention to capacity and safety [^c03c1939] [^98a2d2ae].

> I should also review sensory and complementary approaches. Massage and animal-assisted therapy have supportive signals for agitation reduction, though evidence quality varies. Given low risk, these can be considered when aligned with patient preferences and care context [^52648a9d] [^e3cd54d5].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of interdisciplinary care and system-level supports. Realist reviews and guidelines emphasize that sustained BPSD reduction requires not just initial training but ongoing education, leadership buy-in, and adaptable protocols embedded in workflow, which explains why isolated education without supports often fails to maintain gains [^694bbc77] [^0a715493] [^df61dbe2].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic options and their risk–benefit profile. Antipsychotics can produce modest short-term improvements in aggression and psychosis but carry increased mortality, cerebrovascular events, and metabolic risks. Thus, I need to ensure they are reserved for severe, dangerous, or highly distressing symptoms after nonpharmacologic trials, using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with scheduled attempts to taper [^b6ad5c7a] [^d9199b82] [^34a2480e].

> Let me think about antidepressants. Citalopram has the most consistent evidence for moderate agitation and can be considered when antipsychotic risks are unacceptable or contraindicated, but I should confirm ECG monitoring for QT prolongation and use caution with drug interactions. SSRIs are less effective for non-depressive BPSD and should not be first-line for agitation without a mood indication [^43d71812] [^479ae344] [^b6ad5c7a].

> I should double-check other agents. Short-acting benzodiazepines may be used emergently for severe agitation with imminent harm when other options are unavailable, but risks include falls, delirium, and respiratory depression, so they are not routine. Carbamazepine is a reasonable alternative for refractory agitation after antipsychotics, and cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine should be optimized for underlying dementia rather than treating BPSD directly [^f074880b] [^4204f6f7] [^e948d119].

> Let me consider special populations and settings. In acute hospitals, BPSD are common and often iatrogenic; staff training, environmental adjustments, and integrated discharge planning reduce symptoms and readmissions. In long-term care, antipsychotic stewardship programs and person-centered care models reduce inappropriate psychotropic use. For frontotemporal dementia, nonpharmacologic strategies leveraging preserved functions and caregiver support are essential given limited pharmacologic options [^ff4cb107] [^2086872c] [^e69b82d7].

> I need to ensure implementation and monitoring are explicit. Measurement-based care with standardized scales such as the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory or Neuropsychiatric Inventory, coupled with iterative reassessment of triggers and intervention effectiveness, is recommended. Care plans should be documented, communicated across settings, and revised regularly as symptoms evolve [^5290f155] [^ea1d3160] [^d9199b82].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought antipsychotics were FDA-approved for dementia-related agitation, but I should correct that. No antipsychotic is FDA-approved for BPSD, and regulatory warnings underscore mortality risk, reinforcing the need to prioritize nonpharmacologic strategies and document justification when medications are used [^2c8661c2] [^34a2480e].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. First, complete a structured assessment of the behavior, antecedents, consequences, and reversible causes. Second, implement nonpharmacologic interventions tailored to triggers and preferences, including caregiver training, environmental optimization, meaningful activities, and exercise. Third, reassess in 2–4 weeks and escalate to pharmacotherapy only if symptoms remain severe, dangerous, or highly distressing, starting with the lowest effective dose and planning for time-limited use with taper. Fourth, continue iterative monitoring and adjust the plan as the disease progresses and contexts change [^b6ad5c7a] [^d9199b82] [^ea1d3160].

> In conclusion, I should confirm that effective BPSD management hinges on a person-centered, trigger-informed, nonpharmacologic-first approach embedded in supportive systems, with medications reserved for select indications and continuously re-evaluated. This strategy reduces symptoms, improves caregiver well-being, and aligns with contemporary evidence and guidelines [^b6ad5c7a] [^d9199b82] [^df61dbe2].

Behavior management in dementia centers on **nonpharmacologic strategies first** [^b6ad5c7a] because they are safer and more effective than medications for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [^notfound]. Key interventions include **caregiver education** [^c5133b02], environmental modifications, and individualized activities (music, exercise, reminiscence) [^f1661951] [^98a2d2ae] [^87a8ad0b], with antipsychotics reserved for severe agitation or psychosis after nonpharmacologic measures fail [^d00a4af5] [^f861f8bc]. Regular assessment, person-centered care, and caregiver support are essential to reduce symptoms, delay institutionalization, and improve quality of life [^3934f6b2] [^1ac4fb80].

---

## Nonpharmacological interventions (first-line)

Nonpharmacological interventions are the cornerstone of behavior management in dementia, with **strong evidence supporting their use** [^b6ad5c7a] [^3934f6b2].

---

### Caregiver education and training

- **Effectiveness**: Caregiver education and training programs significantly reduce BPSD and caregiver burden [^c5133b02] [^de352238].
- **Components**: Training includes understanding dementia, communication strategies, stress management, and problem-solving skills [^cf7f6468].
- **Duration**: Programs typically involve multiple sessions over several weeks, with ongoing support for sustained benefits [^504abe76].

---

### Environmental modifications

Environmental modifications aim to create a **safe, calm, and predictable environment** that reduces confusion and agitation [^2eccb4b3].

- **Safety measures**: Remove hazards, install grab bars, and ensure adequate lighting [^notfound].
- **Routine establishment**: Consistent daily routines for meals, activities, and bedtime [^de3ec3e4].
- **Sensory adaptations**: Use calming colors, reduce noise, and provide familiar objects [^notfound].

---

### Individualized activities

Engaging patients in meaningful, individualized activities reduces boredom, agitation, and depression [^notfound].

- **Music therapy**: Improves mood, reduces agitation, and enhances cognition [^f1661951].
- **Exercise**: Regular physical activity reduces agitation and improves sleep [^98a2d2ae] [^c03c1939].
- **Reminiscence therapy**: Enhances mood and reduces depressive symptoms [^87a8ad0b].

---

### Behavioral interventions

Behavioral interventions focus on identifying and modifying triggers of problematic behaviors [^b8bcf8e6].

- **ABC analysis**: Identify antecedents, behaviors, and consequences to develop targeted interventions [^b8bcf8e6].
- **Positive reinforcement**: Use rewards and praise to encourage desired behaviors [^2eccb4b3].
- **Redirection**: Gently redirect attention to alternative activities or topics [^2eccb4b3].

---

## Pharmacological interventions (second-line)

Pharmacological treatments are considered when **nonpharmacological interventions fail** or when behaviors pose significant safety risks [^d00a4af5] [^f861f8bc].

---

### Antipsychotics

Antipsychotics are the most studied pharmacological option for severe agitation or psychosis, but they carry **significant risks** [^b6ad5c7a] [^34a2480e].

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|
| Risperidone | Severe agitation, psychosis | Increased mortality, cerebrovascular events, extrapyramidal symptoms [^34a2480e] [^2c8661c2] |
| Aripiprazole | Severe agitation, psychosis | Increased mortality, cerebrovascular events, extrapyramidal symptoms [^34a2480e] [^2c8661c2] |
| Olanzapine | Severe agitation, psychosis | Increased mortality, cerebrovascular events, metabolic syndrome [^34a2480e] [^2c8661c2] |

---

Guidelines recommend using the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration, with regular monitoring for side effects [^d00a4af5] [^34a2480e].

---

### Other medications

- **Antidepressants**: Citalopram may be considered for moderate agitation or anxiety, particularly when antipsychotics are contraindicated [^43d71812] [^479ae344].
- **Benzodiazepines**: Short-acting benzodiazepines may be used for acute agitation, but only as a last resort due to risks of sedation, falls, and cognitive impairment [^f074880b] [^34a2480e].
- **Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine**: These medications are primarily used for cognitive symptoms but may indirectly improve behavior by enhancing cognition and function [^e948d119] [^d1cb1807].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pain management**: Undertreated pain is a common trigger for BPSD; regular pain assessment and management are essential [^4b1e675a].
- **Sleep disturbances**: Nonpharmacological sleep interventions (sleep hygiene, light therapy, caregiver education) are recommended before medications [^e9a8794f] [^fed830e3].
- **Individualized care**: Interventions should be tailored to the patient's preferences, cultural background, and stage of dementia [^9a9caf8c] [^050c7405].

---

## Outcomes and effectiveness

Nonpharmacological interventions consistently demonstrate **significant reductions in BPSD**, improved caregiver well-being, and delayed institutionalization [^c5133b02] [^de352238]. Pharmacological treatments offer modest benefits and are associated with significant risks, reinforcing the need for cautious, individualized use [^b6ad5c7a] [^34a2480e].

---

Behavior management in dementia prioritizes **nonpharmacological strategies**, with pharmacological treatments reserved for severe cases. Caregiver education, environmental modifications, and individualized activities are key components, supported by regular assessment and person-centered care.

### Nonpharmacological management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: what works, in what circumstances, and why? [^694bbc77]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) refer to the often distressing, noncognitive symptoms of dementia. BPSD appear in up to 90% of persons with dementia and can cause serious complications. Reducing the use of antipsychotic medications to treat BPSD is an international priority. This review addresses the following questions: What nonpharmacological interventions work to manage BPSD? And, in what circumstances do they work and why?

Method

A realist review was conducted to identify and explain the interactions among context, mechanism, and outcome. We searched electronic databases for empirical studies that reported a formal evaluation of nonpharmacological interventions to decrease BPSD.

Results

Seventy-four articles met the inclusion criteria. Three mechanisms emerged as necessary for sustained effective outcomes: the caring environment, care skill development and maintenance, and individualization of care. We offer hypotheses about how different contexts account for the success, failure, or partial success of these mechanisms within the interventions.

Discussion

Nonpharmacological interventions for BPSD should include consideration of both the physical and the social environment, ongoing education/training and support for care providers, and individualized approaches that promote self-determination and continued opportunities for meaning and purpose for persons with dementia.

### Guidelines for the management of cognitive and behavioral problems in dementia [^2eccb4b3]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Family physicians play a crucial role in the management and ongoing care of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). This article reviews the effects of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions on the functional abilities and behavior of patients with dementia and how these can be implemented into clinical practice. Nonpharmacologic interventions are recommended as the initial strategy for managing problematic behaviors. Strategies for improving behavior include ensuring that the patient's environment is safe, calm, and predictable; removing environmental stressors; and identifying and avoiding situations that agitate or frighten the patient. Simple interventions include redirecting and refocusing the patient, increasing social interaction, establishing regular sleep habits, eliminating sources of conflict and frustration, and establishing rewards for successes. The effectiveness of long-term behavioral management is largely dependent on the caregiver; as such, it is important to assess the role and needs of the caregiver. Because currently available therapies cannot reverse the pathologic processes of AD, the primary objective of pharmacotherapy is to preserve cognitive and functional ability, minimize behavioral disturbances, and slow disease progression. Cholinesterase inhibitors represent first-line therapy for patients with mild to moderate AD, whereas a glutamate N-methyl D-aspartate antagonist is used in the treatment of moderate to severe AD. Looking forward, there are a number of therapies in development aimed at modifying the disease course; these include amyloid-lowering drugs, τ-based and neuroprotective approaches, acetylcholine agonists, and mitochondrial inhibitors.

### Nonpharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms in dementia [^3934f6b2]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Behavioral symptoms such as repetitive speech, wandering, and sleep disturbances are a core clinical feature of Alzheimer disease and related dementias. If untreated, these behaviors can accelerate disease progression, worsen functional decline and quality of life, cause significant caregiver distress, and result in earlier nursing home placement. Systematic screening for behavioral symptoms in dementia is an important prevention strategy that facilitates early treatment of behavioral symptoms by identifying underlying causes and tailoring a treatment plan. First-line nonpharmacologic treatments are recommended because available pharmacologic treatments are only modestly effective, have notable risks, and do not effectively treat some of the behaviors that family members and caregivers find most distressing. Examples of nonpharmacologic treatments include provision of caregiver education and support, training in problem solving, and targeted therapy directed at the underlying causes for specific behaviors (eg, implementing nighttime routines to address sleep disturbances). Based on an actual case, we characterize common behavioral symptoms and describe a strategy for selecting evidence-based nonpharmacologic dementia treatments. Nonpharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms in dementia can significantly improve quality of life and patient-caregiver satisfaction.

### Nonpharmacological management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: what works, in what circumstances, and why? [^539ef1ac]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives and Aims

The objective of this study is to improve our understanding of effective nonpharmacological treatment modalities of BPSD by identifying and examining the interactions among context (something that can enable or modify or block a mechanism; the context may be provided by the intervention or it might relate to a broader contextual backdrop — the organizational and system setting in which complex interventions are delivered), mechanisms (the processes that operate in particular contexts that ultimately lead to the outcomes), and outcomes (both intended and unintended).

### Nonpharmacological management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: what works, in what circumstances, and why? [^2086872c]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) refer to the often distressing, noncognitive symptoms of dementia (e.g. aggression, apathy, psychomotor agitation). BPSD appear in up to 90% of persons with dementia and can cause serious complications (e.g. increased emergency department visits, caregiver distress and illness, early institutionalization, and diminished quality of life). Antipsychotic medications are often prescribed to manage BPSD, especially in long-term care (LTC) settings. However, a clear association has been demonstrated between treatment with antipsychotic medications and increased morbidity and mortality in people with dementia. Thus, implementing initiatives aimed at reducing the use of antipsychotic medications for people with dementia has become an international priority. A central feature of these initiatives is the development of guidelines that recommend (or require) the use of nonpharmacological treatment modalities prior to initiating pharmacotherapy.

Nonpharmacological management of BPSD can be grouped into two categories: (a) indirect interventions aimed at decreasing BPSD through working with caregivers or adapting the environment (e.g. caregiver training, multidisciplinary team approaches, individualized treatment plans, and modifying environmental factors) and (b) direct interventions targeted directly at individuals with dementia to decrease BPSD (e.g. individualized recreation therapy, sensory-based therapy, exercise, music therapy, massage).

Review of the literature indicates that little is known about the feasibility and effectiveness of direct and indirect nonpharmacological interventions for the management of BPSD. A recent systematic review of interventions to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications demonstrated that most interventions focus primarily on education of care staff, physicians, and pharmacists. The authors of this review found that some of these indirect interventions may be effective in the short term (i.e. reduced prescribing levels immediately following the intervention) but that the culture and nature of care settings, in addition to the availability and feasibility of additional nonpharmacological alternatives (e.g. beyond education), needs to be addressed to sustain reduced antipsychotic prescribing over the long term.

The complexity of BPSD in dementia suggests that an integrated approach is required for effective intervention and management. Approaches that do not take into consideration the complex biological, psychosocial, psychological, and environmental factors will likely produce results that are sporadic, inconsistent, and short lived. Consequently, a comprehensive and integrated approach, which addresses the needs of the individual with dementia, the caregivers, and the context (e.g. physical and psychosocial environment) is required.

### Behavioral disturbance in dementia [^1c84eb46]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Behavioral disturbances are frequently the most challenging manifestations of dementia and are exhibited in almost all people with dementia. Common behavioral disturbances can be grouped into four categories: mood disorders (e.g., depression, apathy, euphoria); sleep disorders (insomnia, hypersomnia, night-day reversal); psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations); and agitation (e.g., pacing, wandering, sexual disinhibition, aggression). They are often persistent, greatly diminish quality of life of patients and their family caregivers, cause premature institutionalization, and pose a high economic burden on the patient, family, and society. Behavioral disturbances can be prevented and treated with a multifaceted approach that supports dignity and promotes comfort and quality of life of persons with dementia and their family members. Management involves prompt treatment of reversible factors and management of symptoms using primarily individualized nonpharmacological interventions. Pharmacological interventions need to be restricted to behavioral emergencies and for short-term treatment of behavioral disturbances that pose imminent danger to self or others.

### Managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^2b2d40df]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are universally experienced by people with dementia throughout the course of the illness and cause a significant negative impact on quality of life for patients and caregivers. Nonpharmacologic treatments have been recommended as first-line treatment of BPSD by multiple professional organizations and should target patients with dementia factors, caregiver factors, and environmental factors. Psychotropic medications are often prescribed off-label without significant evidence to support their use. The Describe, Investigate, Create, Evaluate approach can provide a structured method to investigate and treat BPSD with flexibility to use in multiple treatment settings.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^f95d5b3b]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Psychosocial treatments in dementia — behavior, emotion, cognition, and stimulation oriented approaches share goals and expected effects. These more specific psychosocial treatments for dementia can be divided into behavior oriented, emotion oriented, cognition oriented, and stimulation oriented, and although these treatment approaches differ, they share the broadly overlapping goals of improving quality of life and maximizing function in the context of existing deficits. Because these treatments generally do not provide lasting effects, those that can be offered regularly may be the most practical and beneficial; these treatments are generally delivered daily or weekly, and the choice of therapy is generally based on the patient's characteristics and preference, availability of the therapy, and cost. Behavioral techniques and interventions are in wide clinical use with patients who have difficult-to-manage behavioral problems; there is some evidence for modest benefits of such therapies, particularly while the intervention is ongoing, but additional well-designed clinical trials are needed, and there is also some evidence that behavioral interventions can reduce patients' depressive symptoms. Stimulation-oriented treatments are often included in care; they provide environmental stimulation recognized as part of humane care, and modest efficacy data exist that support their use for improving mood and reducing behavioral disturbances. Emotion-oriented treatments are often used to address issues of loss and to improve mood and behavior; although there is modest research support for the effectiveness of reminiscence therapy for improvement of mood and behavior, none of these modalities has been subjected to rigorous scientific testing. Cognition-oriented treatments may provide mild short-term improvements in selected domains of cognition, but such improvements, when achieved, are not lasting.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^fed830e3]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — sleep disturbance management emphasizes nonpharmacological strategies and careful sequencing; clinicians should consider behavioral and environmental interventions, combine nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies, and seek to avoid use of multiple psychotropic medications; other initial steps may include establishing regular sleep and waking times, limiting daytime sleeping, avoiding fluid intake in the evening, establishing calming bedtime rituals, and providing adequate daytime physical and mental activities; pharmacological treatment should be instituted only after other measures have been unsuccessful and the potential benefits outweigh the risk of side effects; if another behavioral or neuropsychiatric condition is present and medications for that condition have sedative properties, clinical practice favors prescribing that agent at bedtime, if appropriate; if the patient has psychotic symptoms and sleep disturbance, second-generation antipsychotics may be the initial treatment of choice; if there are clear deficits in sleep hygiene, education and behavioral management might be the preferred treatment course; identification of sleep apnea is particularly important, which may affect 33%–70% of patients with dementia, and this condition is a relative contraindication to the use of benzodiazepines or other agents that suppress respiratory drive.

### Behavioural changes and psychological symptoms in dementia disorders [^35cd1188]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

The traditional view of dementia is that the features most important to accurate diagnosis and management are cognitive decline and functional disability. Behavioural and psychological symptoms have generally been thought to be of secondary importance, but new evidence suggests that these are important determinants of patients' distress, carer burden, and outcome in dementia; they can also be valuable diagnostic pointers to the underlying pathological cause and disease diagnosis. Better methods to detect and measure the severity of behavioural and psychological symptoms are needed and these could be used in well-designed intervention trials. Although pharmacological management is a commonly used option, it is often limited in its effects and can be associated with a substantial risk of side-effects. Progress in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia will assist in developing more effective treatment approaches.

### Management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^352bbd69]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches to managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). We examine methods for assessment and evidence for interventions, focusing on recent findings and innovations. Finally, we recommend an algorithm for management of BPSD.

Recent Findings

Training of formal caregivers is the most effective intervention for BPSD; other non-pharmacological interventions are also beneficial. Antidepressants and antipsychotics remain a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for BPSD. There is limited evidence supporting the use of stimulants, cognitive enhancers, dextromethorphan/quinidine, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and pimavanserin. The management of BPSD is highly individualized. Following thorough assessment, the initial step is addressing contributing medical problems. Non-pharmacological interventions should be tried prior to pharmacological interventions. Antipsychotics should be prescribed only when behaviors pose a significant safety risk or if the person with dementia is very distressed. New approaches will be needed to address an increasing population of people with dementia.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^b8bcf8e6]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Behavioral and environmental management of agitation in dementia — In designing an intervention to treat a problematic behavior, a structured approach should be taken to facilitate selecting the optimal treatment and monitoring the effect of that treatment. The first step is to carefully describe the target behavior, including where, when, and how often it occurs, and the next step is to assess the specific antecedents and consequences of each problem behavior. Activities that consistently precede the problem behavior may be acting as precipitants and should be avoided whenever possible, multistep activities can be simplified, and whatever the intervention, it is critical to match the level of demand on the patient with his or her current capacity. Clinicians can recommend that caregivers maintain a log of specific behaviors as well as their intensity, frequency, precipitants, and consequences. If the agitation is deemed dangerous to the patient or others, it is important to undertake further measures to enhance safety, which may include providing one-on-one care, instituting behavioral measures, or initiating pharmacological treatment, and if agitation and aggressive behavior cannot be brought under control, hospitalization and/or nursing home placement must be considered.

Phase two: synthesis and interpretation

On completion of the data extraction, descriptive statistics were computed for each item in the matrix. Next, we identified recurrent contextual features that might have acted as barriers to, or enablers of, the success of the interventions aimed at decreasing BPSD, and tested the explanatory ability of our candidate theories against these. Throughout this process, we sought and highlighted disconfirming data.

### Targeting and managing behavioral symptoms in individuals with dementia: a randomized trial of a nonpharmacological intervention [^de352238]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To test the effects of an intervention that helps families manage distressing behaviors in family members with dementia.

Design

Two-group randomized trial.

Setting

In home.

Participants

Two hundred seventy-two caregivers and people with dementia.

Intervention

Up to 11 home and telephone contacts over 16 weeks by health professionals who identified potential triggers of patient behaviors, including communication and environmental factors and patient undiagnosed medical conditions (by obtaining blood and urine samples) and trained caregivers in strategies to modify triggers and reduce their upset. Between 16 and 24 weeks, three telephone contacts reinforced strategy use.

Measurements

Primary outcomes were frequency of targeted problem behavior and caregiver upset with and confidence managing it at 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were caregiver well-being and management skills at 16 and 24 weeks and caregiver perceived benefits. Prevalence of medical conditions for intervention patients were also examined.

Results

At 16 weeks, 67.5% of intervention caregivers reported improvement in targeted problem behavior, compared with 45.8% of caregivers in a no-treatment control group (P = 0.002), and reduced upset with (P = 0.03) and enhanced confidence managing (P = 0.01) the behavior. Additionally, intervention caregivers reported less upset with all problem behaviors (P = 0.001), less negative communication (P = 0.02), less burden (P = 0.05), and better well-being (P = 0.001) than controls. Fewer intervention caregivers had depressive symptoms (53.0%) than control group caregivers (67.8%, P = 0.02). Similar caregiver outcomes occurred at 24 weeks. Intervention caregivers perceived more study benefits (P < .05), including ability to keep family members home, than controls. Blood and urine samples of intervention patients with dementia showed that 40 (34.1%) had undiagnosed illnesses requiring physician follow-up.

Conclusion

Targeting behaviors upsetting to caregivers and modifying potential triggers improves symptomatology in people with dementia and caregiver well-being and skills.

### Behavioural and psychological symptoms of people with dementia in acute hospital settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ff4cb107]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Based on our systematic review, behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) are commonly observed in older patients with dementia during acute hospital admissions. These symptoms include aggression/agitation, irritability, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and eating problems. Emergency health conditions, such as pain and delirium, are linked to a higher risk of BPSD. The presence of BPSD not only increases the likelihood of invasive interventions and psychotropic use but also contributes to distress in family caregiver and hospital staff. Furthermore, interactions between patients and hospital staff are often suboptimal, and discharge plans for people with dementia frequently lack comprehensive strategies for managing BPSD. This fragmentation in care can result in repeated emergency admissions and hospital readmissions.

To address these issues, it is crucial for healthcare systems to implement more cohesive and tailored approaches to managing BPSD in older adults with dementia. Improving staff training, enhancing communication with caregivers, and developing integrated discharge plans can significantly reduce the frequency of BPSD and improve overall patient outcomes. Future research should focus on optimising these strategies to ensure better quality of care and more effective management of dementia-related symptoms in hospital settings.

### The rationale and design of behavioral interventions for management of agitation in dementia in a multi-site clinical trial [^1f1fbb18]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Agitation and aggression are common in patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and pose a significant burden on patients, caregivers, and the healthcare systems. Guidelines recommend personalized behavioral interventions as the first-line treatment; however, these interventions are often underutilized. The Standardizing Care for Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Quality of Life in Dementia (StaN) study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier # NCT0367220) is a multisite randomized controlled trial comparing an Integrated Care Pathway, that includes a sequential pharmacological algorithm and structured behavioral interventions, with treatment-as-usual to treat agitation in dementia in long-term care and inpatient settings.

Objective

To describe the rationale and design of structured behavioral interventions in the StaN study.

Methods

Structured behavioral interventions are designed and implemented based on the following considerations: 1) personalization, 2) evidence base, 3) dose and duration, 4) measurement-based care, and 5) environmental factors and feasibility.

Results

The process to design behavioral interventions for each individual starts with a comprehensive assessment, followed by personalized, evidence-based interventions delivered in a standardized manner with ongoing monitoring of global clinical status. Measurement-based care is used to tailor the interventions and integrate them with pharmacotherapy.

Conclusion

Individualized behavioral interventions in patients with dementia may be challenging to design and implement. Here we describe a process to design and implement individualized and structured behavioral interventions in the context of a multisite trial in long-term care and inpatient settings. This process can inform the design of behavioral interventions in future trials and in clinical settings for the treatment of agitation in dementia.

Behavior-oriented approaches — effects on specific behaviors and durability: Behavioral interventions have not been shown to improve the overall functioning of patients with dementia, but there is some evidence that they can be effective in lessening or eliminating some specific problem behaviors, and behavioral interventions such as scheduled toileting can reduce frequent urinary incontinence. A body of literature consisting of small trials or single case studies supports the short-term benefits of behaviorally focused interventions, and a small randomized controlled study (32 subjects in each group) of a four-session aggressive behavior management training program for caregivers showed a trend toward lower rates of aggression in the experimental group compared to the control group (P = 0.071), but that difference was not statistically significant; a review of the literature revealed modest effectiveness, and limited available follow-up data suggest that the benefits do not persist beyond the duration of the interventions.

Mechanism 3: individualization of care

Individualizing care practices and approaches is widely recognized as essential to both quality of care for persons with dementia and also as a successful strategy in the management of BPSD. In our review, 45 (58%) interventions were individualized to the unique needs and preferences of the care recipients. Of these, 17 (22%) included maximizing safety as a form of individualization of care; however, all but two included other methods of individualization. Of these two, both received an effectiveness rating of "C".

Historically, care of persons with dementia has primarily been focused on meeting safety and physiological needs. This emphasis is highlighted in the ever increasing (and some would argue constricting) number of regulations developed for the long-term, residential care industry. Banerjee and colleagues asserted that, "these regulations, and the reporting they require, take valuable time away from care, often fail to account for the relational aspects of care, and disempower residents while empowering paperwork (p. 7). The focus on safety in these regulations may lead to the disempowerment of persons with dementia by limiting their choices, removing their control, and ensuring that the dignity of risk is not extended to persons with dementia. It is for this reason that individualizing care based only on maximizing safety was specifically included within our model as a mechanism that is not effective in decreasing BPSD.

Those studies that focused solely on individualizing the interventions based on diagnosis or neurological assessment (i.e. stage of dementia, functional abilities) (n = 10, 13%) had mixed results (n = 9, 12%, rated as "C") or were ineffective (n = 1, 1.3%, rated as "D" or "E") in decreasing BPSD. Alternatively, we found that individualizing the interventions based on individual preferences and personal characteristics, which is a fundamental tenet of person-centered care, was significantly associated to effectiveness of the intervention. That is, of all interventions that received an effectiveness rating of "A" or "B" (n = 26, 34%), 22 (85%) included individualization of the intervention based on personal preferences and characteristics.

### Managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in the era of boxed warnings [^66dc6522]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide a comprehensive overview on the evaluation and management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) using evidence from literature.

Recent Findings

Evidence indicates efficacy for some non-pharmacological techniques including education of caregivers and cognitive stimulation therapy and pharmacological agents like antidepressant and antipsychotics for the management of BPSD. The use of antipsychotics has generated controversy due to the recognition of their serious adverse effect profile including the risk of cerebrovascular adverse events and death. BPSD is associated with worsening of cognition and function among individuals with dementia, greater caregiver burden, more frequent institutionalization, overall poorer quality of life, and greater cost of caring for these individuals. Future management strategies for BPSD should include the use of technology for the provision of non-pharmacological interventions and the judicious use of cannabinoids and interventional procedures like ECT for the management of refractory symptoms.

Sleep disturbance management in dementia — behavioral interventions such as caregiver education and sleep hygiene training improved sleep outcomes, with training in proper sleep hygiene resulting in improved sleep, better maintenance of a consistent bedtime and rising time, fewer naps during the day, and more physical activity in the form of walking; pharmacologically, 3 mg of melatonin at bedtime was found to prolong sleep and decrease nighttime activity in a small sample, but a randomized controlled trial that included 157 individuals showed no benefit of 10 mg of melatonin or 2.5 mg of slow-release melatonin compared with placebo, and Galantamine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, did not improve sleep quality in patients with dementia.

### Assessment and management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^b6ad5c7a]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia include agitation, depression, apathy, repetitive questioning, psychosis, aggression, sleep problems, wandering, and a variety of inappropriate behaviors. One or more of these symptoms will affect nearly all people with dementia over the course of their illness. These symptoms are among the most complex, stressful, and costly aspects of care, and they lead to a myriad of poor patient health outcomes, healthcare problems, and income loss for family care givers. The causes include neurobiologically related disease factors; unmet needs; care giver factors; environmental triggers; and interactions of individual, care giver, and environmental factors. The complexity of these symptoms means that there is no "one size fits all solution", and approaches tailored to the patient and the care giver are needed. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be used first line, although several exceptions are discussed. Non-pharmacologic approaches with the strongest evidence base involve family care giver interventions. Regarding pharmacologic treatments, antipsychotics have the strongest evidence base, although the risk to benefit ratio is a concern. An approach to integrating non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments is described. Finally, the paradigm shift needed to fully institute tailored treatments for people and families dealing with these symptoms in the community is discussed.

### Association between pain and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in older adults with dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4b1e675a]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the association between pain and BPSD, we consider that effective pain control may alleviate some of the distressing BPSD, and advocate for integrating pain management into dementia care plans. Effective interventions should focus on timely and comprehensive pain assessment and individualized pain relief measures. Furthermore, pain management not only alleviates BPSD but also significantly improves the patient's quality of life and reduce the caregiver's burden. Caregivers, who have the most frequent contact with patients, should be vigilant when observing BPSD such as depression, agitation, and aggression, as these may indicate underlying pain. Consequently, dementia caregivers are advised to receive specialized training to improve their skills in assessing and managing pain in patients. Cognitive decline often impairs patients' ability to effectively report their pain, leading to frequent under-recognition of pain. To facilitate better pain management, a variety of non-verbal behavioral pain assessment scales(observational pain scale, OPS), electronic pain assessment tools, and pain training programs for dementia caregivers have been developed and used in the studies included in this reviews. In addition to pharmacological treatments, employing non-pharmacological pain management strategies is also necessary. Although medications can be effective in relieving pain, they usually have side effects, particularly in the elderly. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as social robot, Tai Chi program, music therapy, and massage, may offer safer alternatives, addressing both the physiological and psychological aspects of pain.

Future research should broaden its scope to include Asian populations and hospitalized or home-based patients with dementia to generalize the findings. Additionally, incorporating cross-cultural and longitudinal approaches will lead to more effective care strategies and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the association between pain and BPSD. Moreover, we advise to explore deeper mechanisms underlying the association between pain and BPSD through further induction experiments and animal studies, as well as assess the effectiveness of different pain management strategies in reducing BPSD. It is also important to explore whether these strategies can be customized based on individual characteristics, such as the type of dementia or the severity of cognitive impairment.

### Management of agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer disease [^90d7988d]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Agitation and aggression are frequently occurring and distressing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These symptoms are disturbing for individuals with Alzheimer disease, commonly confer risk to the patient and others, and present a major management challenge for clinicians. The most widely prescribed pharmacological treatments for these symptoms-atypical antipsychotics-have a modest but significant beneficial effect in the short-term treatment (over 6–12 weeks) of aggression but limited benefits in longer term therapy. Benefits are less well established for other symptoms of agitation. In addition, concerns are growing over the potential for serious adverse outcomes with these treatments, including stroke and death. A detailed consideration of other pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to agitation and aggression in patients with Alzheimer disease is, therefore, imperative. This article reviews the increasing evidence in support of psychological interventions or alternative therapies (such as aromatherapy) as a first-line management strategy for agitation, as well as the potential pharmacological alternatives to atypical antipsychotics-preliminary evidence for memantine, carbamazepine, and citalopram is encouraging.

### Systematic review of recent dementia practice guidelines [^1e81206e]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Background

dementia is a highly prevalent acquired cognitive disorder that interferes with activities of daily living, relationships and quality of life. Recognition and effective management strategies are necessary to provide comprehensive care for these patients and their families. High-quality clinical practice guidelines can improve the quality and consistency of care in all aspects of dementia diagnosis and management by clarifying interventions supported by sound evidence and by alerting clinicians to interventions without proven benefit.

Objective

we aimed to offer a synthesis of existing practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of dementia, based upon moderate-to-high quality dementia guidelines.

Methods

we performed a systematic search in EMBASE and MEDLINE as well as the grey literature for guidelines produced between 2008 and 2013.

Results

thirty-nine retrieved practice guidelines were included for quality appraisal by the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) tool, performed by two independent reviewers. From the 12 moderate-to-high quality guidelines included, specific practice recommendations for the diagnosis and/or management of any aspect of dementia were extracted for comparison based upon the level of evidence and strength of recommendation.

Conclusion

there was a general agreement between guidelines for many practice recommendations. However, direct comparisons between guidelines were challenging due to variations in grading schemes.

### What Do we know about behavioral crises in dementia? A systematic review [^e9a748e9]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Behavioral crises in dementia are represented by a wide variety of symptoms, regularly require external intervention from professionals, and are reported as a risk factor for hospital admission. Little is known about the factors that are associated with them.

Objective

To determine the factors associated with dementia-related behavioral crises.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and AMED databases. An additional lateral search including reference lists was conducted. Two researchers screened all records for potential eligibility. Narrative synthesis was used to bring together the findings.

Results

Out of the 5,544 records identified, 24 articles (18 distinct studies) met the eligibility criteria. Aggression and agitation were the most common behaviors present at crises. Delusions, wandering/absconding, and hallucinations were also key behaviors contributing to crises. Behavioral crises predominantly happened in the severe stages of dementia (according to MMSE scores), in people with dementia residing in their own homes and in long-term care, and were the catalyst for admissions to psychiatric inpatient settings, specialist-care units, long-term care settings, or for referrals to psychiatric community services. Lack of consistency in assessment of behavior, and management of agitation/aggression in dementia crises were evident.

Conclusion

Interventions to reduce the likelihood of people with dementia-related behaviors reaching crisis point need to focus on both family and care home settings and incorporate aggression and agitation management. Future research should focus on determining the factors that could be addressed to prevent behavioral crises and the interventions and models of care that may help to prevent crises.

### Behavioural management of aggression in dementia: a randomized controlled trial [^a8fd9301]. Age and Ageing (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of a brief behaviour management training programme for family carers of patients with dementia and aggressive behaviour.

Design

A randomized controlled trial of a four-session, community-based behaviour management programme. The primary outcome measure was the Rating Scale for Aggressive Behaviour in the Elderly.

Participants

62 patients with dementia, and their co-resident carers.

Results

There were no significant differences in aggression scores between behaviour management and control groups at follow-up. After adjusting for baseline differences in Rating Scale for Aggressive Behaviour in the Elderly scores, there was a trend towards a reduction in aggressive behaviour in the patients in the behaviour management group compared with those in the control group (F = 3.37, P = 0.071).

Conclusions

This study adds to the small evidence base for the effectiveness of behavioural management strategies in dementia.

From Candidate Theories Toward a Model for Understanding Nonpharmacological Interventions to Manage BPSD

Of the selected candidate theories, none emerged as able to describe conclusively the interactions among context, mechanisms, and outcomes within interventions aimed at decreasing BPSD. As a result, we examined the specific principles within each candidate theory and a preliminary thematic analysis was undertaken to identify aspects of each study that were key to the intervention's success (or which explained its partial success or failure). Following this, we identified three mechanisms by which an intervention to decrease BPSD might achieve its goals and developed a unifying heuristic model to explain the influence of context on these mechanisms with the resulting outcomes (see Figure 2). Two of the mechanisms were indirect interventions — these included the caring environment and care skill development and maintenance. The third mechanism was individualization of care, which is considered a direct intervention. As represented in the model, we assert that all three of these mechanisms, and the contexts within which they occur, must be included and addressed for successful and sustainable outcomes related to the reduction of BPSD to occur.

Figure 2.
Heuristic model for clinical intervention implementation or future research.

The key contextual influences were then grouped according to those that caused the mechanisms to be unsuccessful in decreasing BPSD (and, in fact, could potentially lead to an increase in symptoms), those that produced inconsistent outcomes and we described as "necessary but not sufficient," and those that helped to ensure the mechanisms resulted in the successful decrease in BPSD. Once placed into the model, we found that these contextual influences could be further categorized as those that were more consistent with the medical model (i.e. focused almost exclusively on objective medical and clinical outcomes), to those that were more consistent with a social model of care (i.e. focused on tailoring care to an individual's needs and abilities while also promoting choice and enhanced relationships; see Figure 2). We describe the mechanisms and these contextual influences below.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbances in people with dementia [^e9a8794f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances occur frequently in people with dementia with a reported prevalence of up to 40%. Common problems are increased number and duration of awakenings and increased percentage of light sleep. Sleep disturbances are associated with a number of problems for people with dementia, their relatives, and carers. In people with dementia, they may lead to worsening of cognitive symptoms, challenging behaviours such as restlessness or wandering, and further harms, such as accidental falls. Sleep disturbances are also associated with significant carer distress and have been reported as a factor contributing to institutionalisation of people with dementia. As pharmacological approaches have shown unsatisfactory results, there is a need to synthesise the research evidence on non-pharmacological strategies to improve sleep in people with dementia. As interventions are often complex, consisting of more than one active component, and implemented in complex contexts, it may not be easy to identify effective intervention components.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of non-pharmacological interventions on sleep disturbances in people with dementia compared to usual care, no treatment, any other non-pharmacological intervention, or any drug treatment intended to improve sleep, and to describe the components and processes of any complex intervention included.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 13 January 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included individually or cluster-randomised controlled trials in people with dementia comparing non-pharmacological interventions to improve sleep compared to usual care or to other interventions of any type. Eligible studies had to have a sleep-related primary outcome. We included people with a diagnosis of dementia and sleep problems at baseline irrespective of age, type of dementia, severity of cognitive impairment, or setting. Studies reporting results on a mixed sample (e.g. in a nursing home) were only considered for inclusion if at least 80% of participants had dementia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. objective sleep-related outcomes (e.g. total nocturnal sleep time, consolidated sleep time at night, sleep efficiency, total wake time at night (or time spent awake after sleep onset), number of nocturnal awakenings, sleep onset latency, daytime/night-time sleep ratio, night-time/total sleep ratio over 24 hours) and 2.

Adverse Events

Our secondary outcomes were 3. subjective sleep-related outcomes, 4. behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, 5. quality of life, 6. functional status, 7. institutionalisation, 8. compliance with the intervention, and 9. attrition rates. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence and chose key outcomes to be included in summary of findings tables.

Main Results

We included 19 randomised controlled trials with 1335 participants allocated to treatment or control groups. Fourteen studies were conducted in nursing homes, three included community residents, one included 'inpatients', one included people from a mental health centre, and one included people from district community centres for older people. Fourteen studies were conducted in the US. We also identified nine ongoing studies. All studies applied one or more non-pharmacological intervention aiming to improve physiological sleep in people with dementia and sleep problems. The most frequently examined single intervention was some form of light therapy (six studies), five studies included physical or social activities, three carer interventions, one daytime sleep restriction, one slow-stroke back massage, and one transcranial electrostimulation. Seven studies examined multimodal complex interventions. Risk of bias of included studies was frequently unclear due to incomplete reporting. Therefore, we rated no study at low risk of bias. We are uncertain whether light therapy has any effect on sleep-related outcomes (very low-certainty evidence). Physical activities may slightly increase the total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency, and may reduce the total time awake at night and slightly reduce the number of awakenings at night (low-certainty evidence). Social activities may slightly increase total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency (low-certainty evidence). Carer interventions may modestly increase total nocturnal sleep time, may slightly increase sleep efficiency, and may modestly decrease the total awake time during the night (low-certainty evidence from one study). Multimodal interventions may modestly increase total nocturnal sleep time and may modestly reduce the total wake time at night, but may result in little to no difference in number of awakenings (low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effects of multimodal interventions on sleep efficiency (very low-certainty evidence). We found low-certainty evidence that daytime sleep restrictions, slow-stroke back massage, and transcranial electrostimulation may result in little to no difference in sleep-related outcomes. Only two studies reported information about adverse events, detecting only few such events in the intervention groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the inclusion of 19 randomised controlled trials, there is a lack of conclusive evidence concerning non-pharmacological interventions for sleep problems in people with dementia. Although neither single nor multimodal interventions consistently improved sleep with sufficient certainty, we found some positive effects on physical and social activities as well as carer interventions. Future studies should use rigorous methods to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal interventions using current guidelines on the development and evaluation of complex interventions. At present, no single or multimodal intervention can be clearly identified as suitable for widespread implementation.

### Non-pharmacological management for patients with frontotemporal dementia: a systematic review [^e69b82d7]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by changes in behavior and language caused by focal degeneration of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. The behavioral symptoms are distressing to patients and their caregivers. Non-pharmacological management is important as no disease-specific pharmacological treatment for FTD is currently available. The primary objective is to review the literature on non-pharmacological management for FTD and to propose directions for future research, with reference to findings. A search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Search terms included "frontotemporal dementia", and words related to non-pharmacological management, and it identified a total of 858 articles. Results revealed that very few randomized controlled trials exist on non-pharmacological management interventions for FTD. These interventions have been proposed by literature based on clinical experience. A small number of studies have supported behavioral management techniques that exploit disease-specific behaviors and preserved functions in patients with FTD, along with the management of caregivers' distress. These limitations warrant well-designed large-scale research to examine effects of non-pharmacological interventions on behavioral symptoms of FTD.

### Dementia prevention and treatment: a narrative review [^d1cb1807]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Dementia affects 10% of those 65 years or older and 35% of those 90 years or older, often with profound cognitive, behavioral, and functional consequences. As the baby boomers and subsequent generations age, effective preventive and treatment strategies will assume increasing importance.

Observations

Preventive measures are aimed at modifiable risk factors, many of which have been identified. To date, no randomized clinical trial data conclusively confirm that interventions of any kind can prevent dementia. Nevertheless, addressing risk factors may have other health benefits and should be considered. Alzheimer disease can be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and antiamyloid immunomodulators, with the last modestly slowing cognitive and functional decline in people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine may benefit persons with other types of dementia, including dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson disease dementia, vascular dementia, and dementia due to traumatic brain injury. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia are best treated with nonpharmacologic management, including identifying and mitigating the underlying causes and individually tailored behavioral approaches. Psychotropic medications have minimal evidence of efficacy for treating these symptoms and are associated with increased mortality and clinically meaningful risks of falls and cognitive decline. Several emerging prevention and treatment strategies hold promise to improve dementia care in the future.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although current prevention and treatment approaches to dementia have been less than optimally successful, substantial investments in dementia research will undoubtedly provide new answers to reducing the burden of dementia worldwide.

### Behavioral disorders in dementia: appropriate nondrug interventions and antipsychotic use [^f3335e4d]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia pose management challenges for caregivers and clinicians. Firstline nonpharmacologic treatments include eliminating physical and emotional stressors, modifying the patient's environment, and establishing daily routines. Family members and caregivers benefit from education about dementia symptoms and reminders that the behaviors are normal and unintentional. Cognitive and emotion-oriented interventions, sensory stimulation interventions, behavior management techniques, and other psychosocial interventions are modestly effective. In refractory cases, physicians may choose to prescribe off-label antipsychotics. Aripiprazole has the most consistent evidence of symptom improvement; however, this improvement is small. Olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone have inconsistent evidence of benefit. Physicians should use the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to minimize adverse effects, most notably an increased mortality risk. Other adverse effects include anticholinergic and antidopaminergic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, postural hypotension, metabolic syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia, and sedation. Patients should be monitored for these effects while receiving treatment; however, laboratory monitoring may be limited to patients receiving long-term therapy.

Specific psychotherapies/psychosocial treatments — comparative evidence in Alzheimer's disease: Specific psychosocial treatments for dementia can be divided into four broad groups: behavior oriented, emotion oriented, cognition oriented, and stimulation oriented, and at this time there is insufficient evidence to claim superiority of either behavioral approaches or pharmacological approaches. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial that included 149 patients with Alzheimer's disease and agitation, haloperidol (mean dose of 1.8 mg/day), trazodone (mean dose of 200 mg/day), and behavior management techniques were compared over a 16-week period; overall, 34% of the patients improved, but there were no differences between treatment groups, although fewer episodes of bradykinesia and parkinsonian gait occurred in the behavior management group. In a study that included 153 community-dwelling patients with Alzheimer's disease, routine medical care versus a structured program combining exercise training and caregiver training showed no statistically significant reduction in nursing home admissions due to behavioral disturbances but did show improvement in mood and physical role function, and in another study, 12 nursing homes or residential homes were randomly assigned to receive a 6-month education and training intervention that yielded slightly better cognition and mood without differences between groups on measures of behavior.

Application — nonpharmacologic and caregiver-focused strategies for dementia care indicate that functional difficulties associated with cognitive decline can sometimes be partially mitigated through the use of cognitive training paradigms or external aids; however, both approaches require intensive training, and caregivers and other environmental supports are crucial in maintaining the positive effects of these interventions. The page states that antipsychotic medications have been linked to negative outcomes for people living with dementia and that multiple organizations including the FDA have discouraged their long-term use in this population, while psychosocial and behavioral interventions can frequently mitigate many of these issues. It adds that challenging behaviors are considered by some an attempt to communicate unmet human needs in people living with dementia and related disorders, and that central features of caregiver approaches include dementia education, skills training, caregiver self-care and stress management, social support, addressing behavioral changes, and connecting families with community resources.

### Burden of insomnia and sleep disturbances and the impact of sleep treatments in patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease: a structured literature review [^e6ffb440]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

However, evidence of the independent association of sleep problems and clinical outcomes is generally lacking in the literature. Caregiver burden is likely to be multifactorial and impacted by variables beyond patients' sleep symptoms, including the severity of patients' AD. Multiple patient and caregiver factors influence the institutionalization of AD patients, not only the overall clinical status of AD patients, but also the health, functionality, and economic status of their caregivers.

Nevertheless, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are recognized factors contributing to increased burden in AD patients, and the effective management and treatment of sleep symptoms may be helpful in improving clinical outcomes and delaying institutionalization. However, sleep problems are not only poorly characterized in this population, but there are also very few studies evaluating the effects of sleep treatments specifically in AD patients. Non-pharmacological sleep treatments, such as behavioral and light therapy, are typically used as first-line approaches in patients with insomnia and sleep disturbances, despite a lack of consistent data and standardized recommendations in this population. However, access to non-pharmacological sleep treatments is limited due to availability and cost restraints. The limited research for non-pharmacological sleep treatments reflects the obstacles faced with initiating practices in clinical care, particularly in low-resource environments, such as the cost, time taken to train carers, limited equipment, and lack of clear guidelines to deliver treatment. For patients with dementia and in long term care, patients may also be unable or unwilling to partake in such therapies, preventing successful implementation. Implementing approaches that actively include input from care staff, residents and their families may help overcome the challenges associated with non-pharmacological treatments in long-term care. Practices that aim to improve the daily routines and quality of the sleeping environment for AD patients in care homes (such as the LOCK program, a specific frontline staff huddling program which enables staff to: L earn from bright spots; O bserve; C ollaborate in huddles; and K eep it bite-size) may also help alleviate sleep disturbances in this population. Importantly, strategies that include interventions in several behavioral and environmental domains, such as sleep hygiene, light exposure, and exercise, have shown some promise, which may suggest that a combined approach to behavioral therapy could improve outcomes. Implementation of non-pharmacological treatments may reduce the likelihood of patient institutionalization and the associated economic burden, but successful implementation remains a key challenge in AD patients. Furthermore, many patients may require pharmacotherapies alongside these strategies to ensure patients can be treated at home for as long as possible.

### Behavior disorders of dementia: recognition and treatment [^dd71c6eb]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Psychosis may pose a greater challenge than cognitive decline for patients with dementia and their caregivers. The nature and frequency of psychotic symptoms varies over the course of illness, but in most patients, these symptoms occur more often in the later stages of disease. Management of psychosis requires a comprehensive nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approach, including an accurate assessment of symptoms, awareness of the environment in which they occur, and identification of precipitants and how they affect patients and their caregivers. Nonpharmacologic interventions include counseling the caregiver about the nonintentional nature of the psychotic features and offering coping strategies. Approaches for the patient involve behavior modification; appropriate use of sensory intervention; environmental safety; and maintenance of routines such as providing meals, exercise, and sleep on a consistent basis. Pharmacologic treatments should be governed by a "start low, go slow" philosophy; a monosequential approach is recommended, in which a single agent is titrated until the targeted behavior is reduced, side effects become intolerable, or the maximal dosage is achieved. Atypical antipsychotics have the greatest effectiveness and are best tolerated. Second-line medications include typical antipsychotics for short-term therapy; and, less often, anticonvulsants, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, antidepressants, and anxiolytics. Goals of treatment should include symptom reduction and preservation of quality of life.

### Systematic review of psychological approaches to the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia [^c5133b02]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors systematically reviewed the literature on psychological approaches to treating the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia.

Method

Reports of studies that examined effects of any therapy derived from a psychological approach that satisfied prespecified criteria were reviewed. Data were extracted, the quality of each study was rated, and an overall rating was given to each study by using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria.

Results

A total of 1,632 studies were identified, and 162 satisfied the inclusion criteria for the review. Specific types of psychoeducation for caregivers about managing neuropsychiatric symptoms were effective treatments whose benefits lasted for months, but other caregiver interventions were not. Behavioral management techniques that are centered on individual patients' behavior or on caregiver behavior had similar benefits, as did cognitive stimulation. Music therapy and Snoezelen, and possibly sensory stimulation, were useful during the treatment session but had no longer-term effects; interventions that changed the visual environment looked promising, but more research is needed.

Conclusions

Only behavior management therapies, specific types of caregiver and residential care staff education, and possibly cognitive stimulation appear to have lasting effectiveness for the management of dementia-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms. Lack of evidence regarding other therapies is not evidence of lack of efficacy. Conclusions are limited because of the paucity of high-quality research (only nine level-1 studies were identified). More high-quality investigation is needed.

### Project CARE: a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention group for Alzheimer's disease caregivers [^ed74ef9f]. The Gerontologist (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease are a major contributor to caregiver distress and burden. Despite recent efforts to teach caregivers skills to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms and reduce burden, there continues to be limited evidence that these strategies have helped caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease to effectively manage neuropsychiatric symptoms. We report here on Project CARE, a randomized controlled trial designed to test the effectiveness of a caregiver-based multicomponent behavioral intervention aimed to reduce caregiver distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as general caregiver burden, and to decrease neuropsychiatric symptom severity among individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

Design and Methods

The behavioral intervention involved five weekly sessions designed to teach caregivers specific techniques for managing patient neuropsychiatric symptoms in the home environment. Through the use of a randomized control trial, 80 caregivers were assigned to either the behavioral intervention group or a psychoeducational control group and were assessed both before and after the intervention.

Results

Compared with caregivers in the control group, caregivers in the behavioral intervention group displayed significantly greater reductions in caregiver distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms (p = .005). Global caregiver burden, however, did not decrease significantly for caregivers in either group (p > .05). Although it was not statistically significant, there was a trend toward greater reductions in care recipients' neuropsychiatric symptom severity in the intervention group (p = .10).

Implications

The current findings suggest that targeted, group-based behavioral interventions are effective for reducing distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms among caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and for reducing care recipients' neuropsychiatric symptoms.

APA practice guideline — patient and family education in dementia — An important task of the psychiatrist is providing or coordinating education for the patient and family about the illness and its natural history, and it is important to educate the patient and family about the range of symptoms that could develop now or in the future to aid planning and recognition of issues needing medical attention. The family should be educated regarding basic principles of care, including recognizing declines and adjusting expectations, bringing sudden declines or new symptoms to professional attention, keeping requests simple, deferring requests if the patient becomes upset, avoiding overly complex tasks, not confronting patients about deficits, remaining calm, firm, and supportive with redirection when upset, being consistent and avoiding unnecessary change, and providing frequent reminders, explanations, and orientation cues. The guideline notes that although cognitive losses are generally not reversible, neuropsychiatric symptoms can often be improved or even eliminated with treatment, and that treating these symptoms, educating caregivers, and offering alternative strategies can help minimize caregivers' negative reactions.

### The effect of a multimodal comprehensive care methodology for family caregivers of people with dementia [^1ac4fb80]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dementia is a major health problem that causes physical and mental burdens on patients and caregivers. Informal caregivers, primarily spouses and children, play a central role in the care and health preservation of people with dementia who live at home. Although cognitive deficits are the clinical indication of dementia, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSDs) are almost ubiquitous and can dominate disease presentation.

Managing BPSDs is one of the most challenging aspects of care, causing caregiver burden and upset. Caregivers of people with BPSDs are more distressed and depressed than those who do not manage such behaviours. There is emerging evidence that caregiver distress associated with BPSDs is a more important predictor of institutionalization and inpatient and emergency department use than the frequency and severity of BPSDs themselves. Unfortunately, no effective treatment options for BPSDs are currently available to family caregivers. Typically, if a caregiver expresses concern about a BPSD to a physician, a sleep medication or anti-psychiatric medication is prescribed to control the symptom. However, medication is an ineffective and potentially dangerous strategy. On the other hand, non-pharmacologic strategies are recommended by multiple medical organisations and expert groups. Currently, some non-pharmacological approaches appear to be effective as interventions for family caregivers. However, such approaches, which require intensive and time-consuming training, have not been translated enough to real-world care.

### Systematic review of the effect of psychological interventions on family caregivers of people with dementia [^504abe76]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Caregivers of people with dementia are at high risk of psychological morbidity and associated breakdown in care. Many psychologically based interventions have been designed to help caregivers of people with dementia. More work is needed to identify which, if any, are helpful for such caregivers.

Method

We conducted a systematic review of the immediate and long term efficacy of different types of psychological interventions for the psychological health of caregivers of people with dementia, using standardized criteria, to assist clinicians in implementing rational, evidence-based management recommendations. We reviewed studies examining the effects of any therapy derived from a psychological approach that satisfied pre-specified criteria. Using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria we rated the quality of each study, extracted data and gave overall ratings to different types of intervention.

Results

We identified 244 references in our search of which 62 met our inclusion criteria.

Limitations

Our findings are limited by lack of good quality evidence, with only ten level 1 studies identified.

Conclusions

We found excellent evidence for the efficacy of six or more sessions of individual behavioral management therapy centered on the care recipient's behavior in alleviating caregiver symptoms both immediately and for up to 32 months. Teaching caregivers coping strategies either individually or in a group also appeared effective in improving caregiver psychological health both immediately and for some months afterwards. Group interventions were less effective than individual interventions. Education about dementia by itself, group behavioral therapy and supportive therapy were not effective caregiver interventions.

### What should we know about dementia in the 21st century? A Delphi consensus study [^544d7aa6]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment and prevention

The expert group agreed that there is no cure for dementia and that psycho-social (non-pharmacological) interventions are often most appropriate both to provide quality of life and ameliorate behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (as differentiated from symptoms due to pain or agitation at not being understood by care givers). Some of the risk factors for dementia were identified as modifiable in earlier stages of life. Congruent with expert feedback regarding the characteristics of dementia, research evidence supports the position that dementia is an incurable and progressively degenerative condition. Evidence is mixed, however, for the efficacy of pharmaceutical interventions in the management of dementia symptoms. There is evidence of harm (masking communication attempts or side effects attributable to the medicine or interaction with other pharmaceuticals) when a person with dementia is overprescribed psychotropic medication for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) that might be better ameliorated by less invasive means. Psychosocial interventions that are person-centred, individually tailored, and non-invasive are often more effective at improving mood, reducing agitation, and addressing depression and anxiety for people with dementia. However, pharmaceutical interventions for a person with dementia may be indicated to address pain or infections, which could trigger or exacerbate behavioural and psychological symptoms. In this regard, the use of pharmacological treatments in the person with dementia is complex and requires detailed observation and assessment to correctly ascertain the underlying cause of BPSD. Clearly, the potential for harm in the use of medication should be weighed carefully against the impact on quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia. The expert group suggests that psychosocial interventions require more attention in our 21st Century understanding of dementia.

There is emerging evidence to support the expert view that certain risk factors for dementia may be modifiable in earlier or later life, which may have varying outcomes in relation to the development or progression of dementia. Modifiable risk factors are similar to those associated with cardiovascular disease and certain cancers, including inactivity, poor diet, overweight, low level of education, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Exercise, for example, may reduce risks of developing dementia by limiting the development of diseases of the circulatory system associated with inactivity. Higher levels of education have also been shown to reduce the risk of developing dementia by potentially mitigating the expression of deleterious genetic material that underlies the development of certain dementias. Knowledge about the potential for changing individual risk of developing dementias is important as the transmission of such information could potentially prompt modification of lifestyle factors that contribute to the development or progression of dementia.

### Primary palliative care in dementia [^7ab54fd6]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary palliative care is a fundamental aspect of high-quality care for patients with a serious illness such as dementia. The clinician caring for a patient and family suffering with dementia can provide primary palliative care in numerous ways. Perhaps the most important aspects are high quality communication while sharing a diagnosis, counseling the patient through progression of illness and prognostication, and referral to hospice when appropriate. COVID-19 presents additional risks of intensive care requirement and mortality which we must help patients and families navigate. Throughout all of these discussions, the astute clinician must monitor the patient's decision making capacity and balance respect for autonomy with protection against uninformed consent. Excellent primary palliative care also involves discussion of deprescribing medications of uncertain benefit such as long term use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine and being vigilant in the monitoring of pain with its relationship to behavioral disturbance in patients with dementia. Clinicians should follow a standardized approach to pain management in this vulnerable population. Caregiver burden is high for patients with dementia and comprehensive care should also address this burden and implement reduction strategies. When these aspects of care are particularly complex or initial managements strategies fall short, palliative care specialists can be an important additional resource not only for the patient and family, but for the care team struggling to guide the way through a disease with innumerable challenges.

### The effectiveness of structured physical activity on agitation in people with dementia: a rapid review [^c03c1939]. Aging & Mental Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Managing agitation and other behaviours that challenge is a significant dementia care challenge. The priority is to find effective non-pharmacological interventions as drug treatments can have significant side effects. This review evaluates the effectiveness of structured physical activity on agitation in dementia.

Method

Our rapid review searched four electronic databases, Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Embase, for interventional studies using a structured physical activity programme in people with dementia and studied the effect of this activity on behaviours that challenge. Study quality was assessed using CASP criteria and data was narratively synthesised.

Results

We included 13 studies in this review (four rated as high quality), involving a total of 1546 participants. Results were analysed according to exercise type, frequency and intensity of the intervention. Exercise is effective in reducing agitation and studies with higher adherence to exercise demonstrated more positive effects on agitation and behaviours that challenge.

Conclusion

Physical activity can be effective in reducing agitation in older adults with dementia. Further research is needed to clarify the type of intervention that is most beneficial. Strategies to make physical activity more acceptable and available to people with dementia need to be established.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^c11067db]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Formulation and implementation of a treatment plan — site of care and visit frequency in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias emphasizes a multidisciplinary, multimodal approach with cautious change management and regular review. The treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is inherently multidisciplinary and multimodal, and choice of specific treatments begins with the establishment of a specific diagnosis and an assessment of the symptoms being experienced by that patient; a multimodal approach is often used, combining behavioral and psychopharmacological interventions as available and appropriate. When multiple agents or approaches are being used and problems persist (or new problems develop), it is advisable, if possible, to make one change at a time so that the effect of each change can be assessed, and the continuing utility of interventions must be regularly reevaluated. The site of treatment for an individual with dementia is determined by the need to provide safe and effective treatment in the least restrictive setting, and approximately two-thirds of patients with dementia live at home and receive care on an outpatient basis. The frequency of office or facility visits is determined by a number of factors, including the patient's clinical status, the likelihood that new problems will arise, and the need for specific monitoring of treatment effects; another factor is the reliability and skill of the patient's caregivers, particularly regarding the likelihood of their notifying the clinician if a clinically important change occurs. Most dementias are progressive, and symptoms change over time.

APA practice guidelines — research needs in dementia care emphasize that further research into using remaining abilities to maximize function and other strategies may help to identify specific aspects of therapies that benefit persons with dementia, and research is needed to better characterize aspects of nursing homes and other environments most likely to improve patient outcomes. Research is needed on models of care delivery for patients with dementia and their family, and there is a need to study how changes in payment for health services affect care. Research is also needed to identify which patients will benefit from alternative living environments and supplemental caregiving and to support development of treatment sites that are more comfortable, less costly, and equally safe and effective for individuals with moderate to severe dementia. Further studies of caregivers should identify the most effective interventions for relieving burden and those caregivers at highest risk for adverse outcomes.

### A European Academy of Neurology guideline on medical management issues in dementia [^d00a4af5]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Dementia is one of the most common disorders and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and decreased quality of life. The present guideline addresses important medical management issues including systematic medical follow-up, vascular risk factors in dementia, pain in dementia, use of antipsychotics in dementia and epilepsy in dementia.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was carried out. Based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework, we developed a guideline. Where recommendations based on GRADE were not possible, a good practice statement was formulated.

Results

Systematic management of vascular risk factors should be performed in patients with mild to moderate dementia as prevention of cerebrovascular pathology may impact on the progression of dementia (Good Practice statement). Individuals with dementia (without previous stroke) and atrial fibrillation should be treated with anticoagulants (weak recommendation). Discontinuation of opioids should be considered in certain individuals with dementia (e.g. for whom there are no signs or symptoms of pain or no clear indication, or suspicion of side effects; Good Practice statement). Behavioral symptoms in persons with dementia should not be treated with mild analgesics (weak recommendation). In all patients with dementia treated with opioids, assessment of the individual risk-benefit ratio should be performed at regular intervals. Regular, preplanned medical follow-up should be offered to all patients with dementia. The setting will depend on the organization of local health services and should, as a minimum, include general practitioners with easy access to dementia specialists (Good Practice statement). Individuals with dementia and agitation and/or aggression should be treated with atypical antipsychotics only after all non-pharmacological measures have been proven to be without benefit or in the case of severe self-harm or harm to others (weak recommendation). Antipsychotics should be discontinued after cessation of behavioral disturbances and in patients in whom there are side effects (Good Practice statement). For treatment of epilepsy in individuals with dementia, newer anticonvulsants should be considered as first-line therapy (Good Practice statement).

Conclusion

This GRADE-based guideline offers recommendations on several important medical issues in patients with dementia, and thus adds important guidance for clinicians. For some issues, very little or no evidence was identified, highlighting the importance of further studies within these areas.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — psychosis and agitation management emphasizes nonpharmacological interventions first with careful risk–benefit assessment. Clinicians must weigh the risk of not treating against the risks of active treatment and the consideration and use of behavioral, psychosocial, and psychotherapeutic treatments is particularly critical. If symptoms cause significant distress or are associated with behavior that may place the patient or others at risk, treatment with low doses of antipsychotic medication is indicated in addition to nonpharmacological interventions, and treatment with an antipsychotic is also indicated if a patient is agitated or combative in the absence of psychosis, with the use of these agents reevaluated and their benefit documented on an ongoing basis. When antipsychotics are ineffective, carbamazepine, valproate, or an SSRI may be used in a careful therapeutic trial, and a low-dose benzodiazepine may prove useful for symptoms limited to specific times or settings, noting problematic side effects in elderly patients. Although mood stabilizers and SSRIs are commonly used for agitation, delusions, and aggression, they have not been consistently shown to be effective or safe and should not be seen as having improved safety or comparable efficacy compared to antipsychotics. As illness evolves, the continued use of any intervention must be evaluated and justified on an ongoing basis, and periodic reevaluation and revision of the treatment plan, including a change in dose, a change in medication, or medication discontinuation, may be indicated, with patients whose initial symptom severity was relatively low potentially more easily withdrawn from psychotropics.

### Effective pharmacologic management of Alzheimer's disease [^dc1da917]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

In order to assist physicians in the effective pharmacologic management of this challenging population, evidence-based pharmacologic treatment algorithms for the different stages of Alzheimer's disease have been developed. Evidence-based guidelines outlining pharmacotherapeutic strategies can be systematically implemented to optimize outcomes for patients in different stages of Alzheimer's disease. The first step toward the best possible long-term management is early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, thereby facilitating early initiation of cholinesterase inhibitor treatment, which may stabilize/reduce the rate of symptomatic cognitive and functional decline. Cholinesterase inhibitor therapy with rivastigmine, donepezil, or galantamine is endorsed as standard first-line therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-antagonist, memantine, may be used as monotherapy or in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor for patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease, and as monotherapy for patients with severe Alzheimer's disease. During treatment, cognitive and functional status should be monitored over 6-month intervals, and pharmacologic therapy should ideally be continued until there are no meaningful social interactions and quality of life has irreversibly deteriorated.

### Real-world treatment patterns and characteristics among patients with agitation and dementia in the United States: findings from a large, observational, retrospective chart review [^2c8661c2]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Various non-pharmacological and pharmacological strategies are used for the management of patients with dementia who exhibit agitation. Historically, first- and second-generation antipsychotics have been used off-label as the first-line treatment of choice. However, there have been concerns about the risk of adverse events associated with antipsychotics, as well as concerns about their limited clinical efficacy in alleviating agitation. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an advisory warning after reports of a 60% to 70% increased risk of death associated with the use of atypical antipsychotics compared with placebo in older patients with dementia-related psychosis. Safety warnings were added to the labels of all atypical antipsychotic drugs, and government agencies have since focused on limiting the use of antipsychotics in older adults. In 2018, an international expert panel recommended non-pharmacological interventions, including person-centered care, environmental adaptation, caregiver training, and tailored activities as first-line approaches before any pharmacological treatments. Practice guidelines issued in 2016 by the American Psychiatric Association suggest that antipsychotics can be appropriate when symptoms of agitation or psychosis are severe, dangerous, and/or when symptoms cause significant distress to the patient. However, at present, no antipsychotic agent is approved by the FDA for the treatment of agitation related to dementia.

Although antipsychotic treatments are recommended for patients with dementia and severe or recurring agitation, there is limited information published on current clinical practice regarding the use of antipsychotic treatments for the management of agitation related to dementia in real-world settings in the US. The objective of this retrospective observational study was to examine real-world treatment patterns and characteristics of patients with agitation related to dementia who were treated with antipsychotics in residential care and community-based settings in the US.

### Nonpharmacological management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: what works, in what circumstances, and why? [^0a715493]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

Mechanism 2: care skill development and maintenance

To our surprise, only 22 (27%) of the interventions in our sample specified the inclusion of an education and training component. When reviewing the literature, it is clear that continuing professional development via education and training courses for care providers related to understanding dementia is necessary for the implementation of best practices in dementia care and that the lack of these opportunities can lead to increased prevalence of, and negative outcomes related to, BPSD. This empirical evidence is reflected in our model.

When examining our matrix to further elucidate the contextual factors that influence outcomes related to the presence of care skill development we found that 22 (28%) interventions included initial training to educate staff in dementia care and/or the benefits of the specific interventions. Of these studies, eight (36%) received an effectiveness rating "A" or "B", nine (40%) received an effectiveness rating "C", and five (23%) received an effectiveness rating "D" or "E". Thus, our review found that providing initial training on these essential topics may be necessary, but it is not sufficient in producing substantive or sustained improvements in decreasing BPSD.

When we compared these findings to those studies that included ongoing training and support (n = 9; 12%), we found that the majority (n = 6; 67%) received an effectiveness rating "A" or "B". This led to our conclusion that the successful reduction in BPSD requires ongoing education and training combined with supports. An exemplary example of this comes from McCabe and colleagues, who found that initial training and structured clinical protocols successfully decreased BPSD behaviors only [my own italics] when they were combined with ongoing training and clinical supports. Review of our matrix indicated that, in addition to having ongoing opportunities for training, the supports that were most influential included being adaptable to the needs of care providers, ensuring that appropriate resources are available to enable the implementation of the intervention, and implementing system (or organizational) processes that support and reinforce the intervention.

### Family caregivers' management of behavioral expressions of dementia [^b1903320]. The Gerontologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Behavioral expressions of dementia are often stressful for family caregivers to manage as they strive to ensure their relative's needs are met. Guided by Lazarus and Folkman's Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, we identified specific behaviors that disrupt daily routines and challenge the achievement of caregiving goals, and the approaches and strategies caregivers employ to address them.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted semistructured interviews with 30 family caregivers in rural Appalachia caring for a relative living with dementia. Analysis involved use of open and focused coding processes to identify the ways caregivers managed behaviors and bar graphs to examine management approaches relative to categories of behaviors and caregiver demographic and emotional well-being variables.

Results

Analyses revealed 10 types of behavioral expressions of dementia associated with confusion, irritability, and resistance to engaging in necessary activities of daily living. Caregiver approaches to managing behaviors included gentle persuasion, being harsh by yelling or threatening, being persistent in expecting the person with dementia to complete the tasks at hand, disengaging by postponing the activity, and employing a combination of strategies. Approaches differed across types of behavior and caregiver demographics and had varying effects on caregiver well-being.

Discussion and Implications

Uncovering specific behaviors family caregivers of persons living with dementia found bothersome, caregivers' adaptive strategies for managing behaviors, and the impact of those approaches provides new information to inform training on effective dementia caregiving practices and development of targeted intervention programs for dementia care.

### Pharmacologic treatment… [^de3ec3e4]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Virtually all patients with dementia will develop changes in behavior and personality as the disease progresses. 1 The nature and frequency of symptoms vary over the course of the illness, and psychotic features tend to present later, particularly when the patient becomes more dependent. Psychotic manifestations and other behavior problems may be more troubling and challenging than cognitive losses; these features result in an increased burden for caregivers, earlier institutionalization, and an acceleration in cognitive decline.
2. Nonpsychotic behaviors associated with dementia include agitation, wandering, and aggression. Agitation represents a cluster of physical manifestations that suggest emotional distress or motor restlessness. Patients with agitation should be evaluated for an underlying precipitating cause, such as hunger, thirst, drug use, or an undetected infection.

Patients who display physical or verbal aggression, which often is associated with delusional misidentification, may require a combination of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments. Nonpharmacologic Management Before introducing an intervention, the behavior problem or symptom must be identified and quantified in terms of frequency and severity. Identification and elimination of precipitating causes are essential. Goals of care should be negotiated with caregivers; the targeted behavior often cannot be eliminated completely, but it may be reduced to tolerable or acceptable levels.
6. APPROACHES FOR THE CAREGIVER Caregivers of patients with dementia should be educated about the disease process and the disease manifestations being exhibited. Attendance at support group meetings, personal discussion with the physician, and resources such as The 36-Hour Day 7 and the Alzheimer's Association may be helpful.

In most situations, coping strategies include remaining calm and using touch, music, toys, and familiar personal items. Helping the caregiver understand the lack of intentionality of the behaviors is essential. DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING ROUTINES Patients with dementia benefit from consistency. Serving meals at the same time each day reduces stress and lessens the likelihood of troublesome behaviors. SENSORY INTERVENTION Touch may be beneficial in many older adults who are delusional. Music therapy and pet therapy, which create a homelike environment in nursing homes, seem to lessen behaviors associated with psychosis and enhance patients' quality of life. 4.

### Dementia and cognitive impairment in ESRD: diagnostic and therapeutic strategies [^11a75394]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairment, including dementia, is a common but poorly recognized problem among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), affecting 16–38% of patients. Dementia is associated with high risks of death, dialysis withdrawal, hospitalization, and disability among patients with ESRD; thus, recognizing and effectively managing cognitive impairment may improve clinical care. Dementia screening strategies should take into account patient factors, the time available, the timing of assessments relative to dialysis treatments, and the implications of a positive screen for subsequent management (for example, transplantation). Additional diagnostic testing in patients with cognitive impairment, including neuroimaging, is largely based on the clinical evaluation. There is limited data on the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for dementia in the setting of ESRD; therefore, decisions about the use of these medications should be individualized. Management of behavioral symptoms, evaluation of patient safety, and advance care planning are important components of dementia management. Prevention strategies targeting vascular risk factor modification, and physical and cognitive activity have shown promise in the general population and may be reasonably extrapolated to the ESRD population. Modification of ESRD-associated factors such as anemia and dialysis dose or frequency require further study before they can be recommended for treatment or prevention of cognitive impairment.

### Treatment of inappropriate sexual behavior in persons with dementia: a systematic review [^f826ec7a]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Key points ○ Non‐pharmacologic interventions like distraction and caregiver education can be effective in managing inappropriate sexual behavior in people with dementia. ○ Except for one small randomized controlled trial (n = 15) of conjugated estrogens used in nursing home residents, the evidence for pharmacotherapy to treat inappropriate sexual behavior in people with dementia is limited to case reports or case series. ○ Some hormonal therapies may be effective for males in situations where inappropriate sexual behaviors are refractory to other interventions.
Why does this paper matter? ○ Up to one in four people with dementia will display inappropriate sexual behavior, which can be distressing to patients and their caregivers. ○ This systematic review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence informing clinicians' management strategies for inappropriate sexual behavior. ○ It also underscores the urgent need for more robust research in this field to better understand and manage these behaviors.

### Dementia-related agitation: a review of non-pharmacological interventions and analysis of risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy [^f9f0dafc]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Unsurprisingly, the subject of dementia has been a rising matter of public health concerns as people now live longer. World Alzheimer Report 2015, estimate that about 46.8 million people worldwide have dementia. These numbers are projected to almost double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050. The modality for treating agitation and other behavioral symptoms in dementia patients has been a challenge. Many years on, there has been no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy in treating dementia-related agitation. This review discusses the current knowledge of non-pharmacological interventions, and analyzes the risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy in the management of dementia-related agitation, as well as providing an anecdotal of the author's clinical experience. This article aims to provide opportunity for increase awareness for clinicians, particularly those with no specialty training in geriatrics medicine but see dementia patients with agitation and other behavioral symptoms from time to time. Likewise, it hopefully will benefit the readers of medical journals to update their existing knowledge on matters relating to the management of dementia-related agitation.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^34a2480e]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Dementia — agitation and psychosis management emphasizes first addressing reversible causes [I], using environmental measures if symptoms are not causing significant danger or distress [I], and considering behavioral measures [III]; if these are unsuccessful or behaviors are dangerous or distressing, judicious pharmacologic treatment may be used [II] with ongoing reevaluation and documentation [I]. Antipsychotic medications are recommended for psychosis [II] and agitation [II], can provide modest improvement in behavioral symptoms [I], and have evidence based mostly on 6–12-week trials with limited research beyond 12 weeks though clinical experience supports use [II]. Antipsychotics must be used with caution at the lowest effective dosage [I], with patients and families advised about potential benefits and risks, particularly mortality [I]; second-generation agents have a black box warning for increased mortality in elderly patients and first-generation agents carry at least a similar risk, with selection based on side-effect profile and patient characteristics [I]. Benzodiazepine benefit is modest but they may have a role for prominent anxiety [III] or on an as-needed basis for infrequent agitation or procedural sedation [II], with lorazepam and oxazepam preferable to longer half-life agents such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide [III]. Anticonvulsants, lithium, and beta-blockers have minimal evidence and are generally not recommended except after other treatments have failed [III]; trazodone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not well studied for non-depressive symptoms but may be appropriate for nonpsychotic patients with agitation, especially with mild agitation or prior antipsychotic sensitivity [III].

### Effects of a culturally adapted group based montessori based activities on engagement and affect in Chinese older people with dementia: a randomized controlled trial [^3857715d]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most of the people with dementia exhibit behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), for example agitation, repetition, restlessness, wandering, apathy and depressed mood, resulting from cognitive impairment. Non-pharmacological interventions have been advocated as the first line management for addressing the modifiable factors, and thereby reducing the use of anti-psychotic or sedative medications to prevent the associated adverse effects and mortality risk, and improve the quality of life of people with dementia. The effects of non-pharmacological interventions, for example, multisensory stimulation, cognitive or emotion-oriented interventions, behavioral management strategies, and physical exercise, have been widely studied for matching the unmet psychosocial need for sensory deprivation, social interaction and meaningful activities in people with dementia. While systematic reviews concluded that the effects of these non-pharmacological interventions on managing challenging behaviors are inconsistent, it is widely agreed that strategies that only passively engage people with dementia have poor effects, whereas those personalized to individual needs are more promising.

### Agitation and irritability in Alzheimer's disease: evidenced-based treatments and the black-box warning [^b96644a6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

More than five million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD), and this number is expected to triple by 2050. While impairments in cognition, particularly memory, are typically the defining features of the clinical syndrome, behavioral symptoms are extremely common, affecting up to 90% of patients. Behavioral symptoms in AD can be difficult to manage and may require a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches. The latter is complicated by FDA "black-box warnings" for the medication classes most often used to target these symptoms, and currently there are initiatives in place to limit their use. In this review, we describe common behavioral symptoms of AD-with a particular focus on the challenging symptoms of "agitation" and "irritability"-and discuss evidence-based approaches to their management. Ultimately, multidimensional approaches must be tailored to the patient and their environment, though evidence-based practices should define the treatment of agitation and irritability in AD.
