## Question

What are the common causes of anterior septal crusting?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of anterior septal crusting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomy and pathophysiology that make the anterior septum prone to crusting. Then, I should categorize etiologies by frequency and mechanism, starting with iatrogenic causes, followed by traumatic, inflammatory/vasculitic, infectious, environmental, and medication-related factors. Next, I will integrate how perforation modifies airflow and desiccation to worsen crusting. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized list of common causes and note key differentiators and red flags that warrant further workup, anchoring on high-quality guidelines and observational data where available.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why the anterior septum crusts. The anterior septum is lined by thin, highly vascular mucosa at Kiesselbach's plexus and is exposed to turbulent, drying airflow; crusting reflects mucosal injury, desiccation, and impaired healing, which are amplified when there is a septal perforation or persistent mucosal trauma, so I need to keep both local mucosal factors and systemic contributors in mind as I proceed [^af15fa1b].

> I will now examine iatrogenic causes, which are repeatedly cited as the most common. Septoplasty, submucous resection, and cautery can injure opposing mucoperichondrial flaps and cartilage, leading to perforation and chronic crusting; bilateral simultaneous cautery or packing also increases perforation risk, and large series attribute more than 40% of perforations to nasal surgery, with additional contributions from trauma and cautery, so I should prioritize iatrogenic etiologies at the top of the list [^f36afce7] [^483781fc] [^a577467c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about trauma being trivial. External nasal trauma and repetitive intranasal trauma, including nose picking and foreign bodies, can ulcerate the anterior septum and precipitate crusting; in children, unilateral rhinorrhea with crusting should trigger a search for a foreign body, and button batteries can cause septal perforation within hours, so I need to ask explicitly about habits and pediatric exposures while I correlate with endoscopic findings [^383ff04e].

> Next, I should review inflammatory and vasculitic etiologies, especially granulomatosis with polyangiitis, because anterior septal crusting is a hallmark. GPA involves destructive granulomatous inflammation of the upper airway with septal perforation, saddle nose, and chronic crusting; hemorrhagic, friable mucosa and a history of recurrent epistaxis heighten suspicion, and guidelines endorse reconstructive surgery only after sustained remission, so I need to check for systemic features and ANCA testing when the mucosa looks abnormal or the disease is suspected [^e46c5221] [^286199f8] [^2cfa7711].

> Wait, let me verify infectious contributors that can mimic or exacerbate crusting. Chronic bacterial colonization, including Staphylococcus aureus, is associated with recurrent epistaxis and crusting, and atrophic rhinitis (primary or secondary) produces thick, malodorous crusts with mucosal atrophy; in the right epidemiologic context, mucosal leishmaniasis can destroy the anterior septum and cause perforation, so I should consider geography, travel, and immune status when the crusting is progressive and destructive [^6c446cdf] [^7c89dbb7] [^aadda32c].

> I need to check environmental and behavioral modifiers that perpetuate crusting. Dry climate, heating, smoking, and occupational chemical exposures desiccate the mucosa and impair healing; cocaine use causes vasoconstriction, ischemia, and midline destructive lesions with extensive crusting and perforation, so a careful social and exposure history is essential to close the loop on modifiable drivers [^a577467c] [^a5e263df].

> But wait, what if medications are contributing. Intranasal corticosteroids, particularly when misdirected toward the septum or used on injured mucosa, can impair healing and rarely precipitate septal perforation; FDA labeling for fluticasone, azelastine-fluticasone, and ciclesonide lists crusting and septal perforation as potential adverse effects, so I should confirm spray technique and mucosal integrity before attributing causality [^79d0b42e] [^b755aec5] [^fe5ed71f].

> Let me consider how a perforation changes the game mechanistically. Anterior septal perforations create turbulent crossflow and vortices that dehydrate mucosa, trap secretions, and foster crusting; symptoms correlate with anterior and smaller perforations, and computational modeling shows marked airflow disturbance behind anterior caudal defects, explaining why even modest anterior perforations can cause disproportionate crusting and discomfort [^cc9c713a] [^af15fa1b].

> I should double-check the synthesis to ensure I'm aligning frequency with evidence. The most common causes of anterior septal crusting are iatrogenic injury from septal surgery or cautery, followed by traumatic causes including external trauma and habitual or foreign-body trauma, then inflammatory/vasculitic disease such as GPA, with infectious, environmental, and medication-related factors as important contributors or perpetuators; this hierarchy is supported by large perforation series, guideline-based reviews, and disease-specific literature, and it matches the pathophysiology of mucosal injury plus desiccation from altered airflow [^f36afce7] [^a577467c] [^e46c5221].

> Hold on, I should verify key differentiators that guide next steps. Persistent, malodorous crusting with mucosal atrophy suggests atrophic rhinitis; destructive, hemorrhagic mucosa with epistaxis and saddle nose raises concern for GPA; unilateral symptoms in a child should prompt a foreign-body search; and a history of recent nasal surgery or cautery points iatrogenic. Tailoring the workup to these patterns prevents missed diagnoses and directs timely ENT referral or systemic evaluation when indicated [^7c89dbb7] [^286199f8].

---

Anterior septal crusting most commonly results from **dry air exposure** and **trauma** (nose picking, digital manipulation, or foreign bodies) [^notfound], which damage the delicate anterior septal mucosa and cause bleeding and crust formation. Other frequent causes include **iatrogenic injury** (septoplasty, cautery, or packing) [^f36afce7], **infections** (chronic bacterial colonization, atrophic rhinitis, or granulomatous disease) [^7c89dbb7] [^aadda32c], and **environmental irritants** (smoking, occupational chemicals, or cocaine) [^a577467c]. Less common causes include systemic diseases (GPA, sarcoidosis) [^e46c5221], medications (intranasal steroids, anticoagulants), and nutritional deficiencies. Management focuses on humidification, saline irrigations, topical antibiotics, and avoidance of trauma; persistent or severe cases warrant evaluation for underlying disease or structural lesions [^7c89dbb7].

---

## Environmental factors

Environmental dryness is a major driver of anterior septal crusting; **low humidity** — especially with heating or air conditioning — desiccates the mucosa, causing cracking, bleeding, and crusting. Occupational or recreational exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke, industrial chemicals, and pollutants further injures the mucosa and promotes crusting [^notfound].

---

## Trauma and mechanical factors

Trauma is a leading cause of anterior septal crusting; **nose picking** or habitual digital manipulation damages the thin mucosa over the anterior septum, causing bleeding and crusting. Foreign bodies — particularly in children — can cause local trauma, infection, and crusting [^5230069f]. Iatrogenic trauma from septoplasty, cautery, or nasal packing can also injure the mucosa and lead to crusting [^f36afce7].

---

## Infectious causes

Chronic bacterial colonization, especially by Staphylococcus aureus, is common in the anterior nares and contributes to crusting and recurrent epistaxis [^6c446cdf]. Atrophic rhinitis causes **mucosal atrophy** with thick, malodorous crusts and is often associated with Klebsiella ozaenae [^7c89dbb7]. Granulomatous diseases such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) cause mucosal inflammation, ulceration, and crusting, often with septal perforation [^1492f15f].

---

## Systemic and inflammatory conditions

Systemic inflammatory diseases can manifest with **nasal crusting**. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) frequently involves the nasal septum, causing crusting, ulceration, and perforation [^1492f15f]. Sarcoidosis may involve the nasal mucosa, leading to crusting and granulomas. Relapsing polychondritis can cause nasal cartilage inflammation and crusting.

---

## Medications and medical therapies

Several medications can predispose to **anterior septal crusting**. Intranasal corticosteroids, particularly with improper technique, can cause mucosal thinning, dryness, and crusting [^notfound]. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents increase bleeding risk and crust formation. Topical nasal decongestants, when overused, cause rebound congestion and mucosal injury with crusting.

---

## Nutritional deficiencies

Nutritional deficiencies can impair mucosal integrity. Vitamin C deficiency (**scurvy**) causes poor wound healing and mucosal fragility, leading to bleeding and crusting. Vitamin K deficiency impairs clotting and increases bleeding and crust formation. Iron deficiency anemia contributes to mucosal fragility and recurrent epistaxis with crusting.

---

## Structural abnormalities

Structural nasal abnormalities can promote **local trauma and dryness**. A deviated nasal septum creates turbulent airflow that dries the mucosa and causes crusting. Septal perforation alters airflow patterns, causing dryness and crusting around the perforation [^af15fa1b]. Nasal valve collapse can similarly cause turbulent airflow and mucosal drying.

---

## Clinical evaluation and management

Evaluation should include a focused history and anterior rhinoscopy to identify trauma, infection, structural lesions, or systemic disease [^2d46e47d]. Management centers on **humidification**, saline irrigations, topical antibiotics for bacterial colonization, and avoidance of trauma or irritants [^7c89dbb7]. Persistent or severe cases may require further investigation for underlying systemic disease or structural abnormalities, and surgical intervention may be considered for refractory cases [^e46c5221].

---

Anterior septal crusting is most often due to **dry air, trauma, infection, or iatrogenic injury**, with contributions from systemic disease, medications, and structural abnormalities. Targeted evaluation and conservative measures usually suffice; persistent or severe cases need assessment for underlying disease or structural lesions.

### Numerical simulation of airflow patterns in nose models with differently localized septal perforations [^af15fa1b]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The most typical complaints of patients with nasal septal perforation (SP) are nasal obstruction, crusting, and recurrent epistaxis depending on the size and site of the SP mainly due to disturbed airflow patterns. The objective of the study was to determine the influence of differently localized SPs on intranasal airflow patterns during inspiration by means of numerical simulation.

Study Design

An experimental setup using three dimensional computer models of a human nose was created. Four different models with three differently localized septal perforation allowed an examination of intranasal airflow changes.

Methods

Four high-resolution, realistic, bilateral computer models of the human nose with three differently localized SPs were reconstructed based on computed tomography. A numerical simulation was performed. The intranasal airflow patterns (path lines, velocity, turbulent kinetic energy) during inspiration were displayed, analyzed, and compared.

Results

SPs cause a highly disturbed airflow in the area of the SP and behind. A spacious vortex within the perforation, including various localized vortices, was detected. The airflow in the nose was disturbed to varying degrees depending on the location of the perforation. SPs within the anterior caudal septum in area II led to increased negative turbulences and crossflow.

Conclusions

The numerical simulations demonstrate significantly disturbed intranasal airflow patterns due to SPs. This fact may contribute to crusting and nosebleed due to dehydration of the nasal mucosa. The location and size of the SP are crucial for the impact on disturbed airflow pattern and therefore the patients' complaints. Anterior caudal SPs seem to be the worst. Surgical closure of SPs or simply changes in the site and size of the SP if a complete closure is surgically impossible makes sense.

### Correlation of sinonasal symptoms with the size and position of nasal septal perforations [^cc9c713a]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the correlation of sinonasal symptoms and quality of life with size and position of nasal septal perforation (NSP).

Method

This is a prospective observational study in a tertiary referral center involving adult patients presented with NSP. The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) and its clinico-psychometric domains were analyzed, including additional NSP-specific symptoms (nasal crusting, epistaxis, and whistling noise during nasal breathing). The size of NSP was measured radiologically by calculating the area in cm² and anteroposterior (AP) diameter. Position of perforation was determined clinically by distance from columella to the anterior edge of the perforation.

Results

Forty patients were included in this study (22 males). The most common etiology of NSP was iatrogenic. The mean SNOT-22 score was 50.8 (standard deviation 23.8), and mean NSP size was 3.0 cm². No statistical correlation was observed between the total SNOT-22 score with either position or size of NSP. As for NSP-specific symptoms, there was a statistically significant negative correlation with the size of perforation (A-P diameter) (r = -0.34, P = 0.03) and position of the perforation (r = -0.49, P = 0.0016), suggesting that these symptoms improved with posterior and larger perforations.

Conclusion

Reported SNOT-22 scores were comparable to patients with recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis, although the scores did not correlate with size and position of NSP. Sinonasal symptoms typically observed in NSP improved with more posteriorly placed and larger sized perforations. This study provides an insight into the quality-of-life impact of NSP and affirms the clinical observation that anterior NSP are more symptomatic.

### Considerations in the etiology, treatment, and repair of septal perforations [^564989cc]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Nasal septal perforations present a distinct challenge to the facial plastic surgeon. A clearcut causal factor must be established from a long, diverse list of potential causes. Surgical repair presents a complex technical challenge, because a septal perforation is a hole in three distinct contiguous layers composed of both right and left septal mucoperichondral flaps and the intervening cartilage, all three of which must be separated from each other and repaired individually. This article describes presenting symptoms and findings for septal perforations, the history and physical examination, causes, helpful hints for prevention of perforations, and surgical and nonsurgical treatment options and outcomes.

### Presenting symptomatology for patients with nasal septal perforation: application of the NOSE-perf scale [^057b4817]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To objectively identify and quantitate presenting nasal symptoms in patients with a septal perforation using the validated NOSE-Perf scale.

Study Design

Case series retrospective review.

Methods

The medical records from August 2018 through January 2022 of patients at a tertiary care academic center with a septal perforation, and who completed the NOSE-Perf questionnaire, were reviewed. Perforation symptoms were identified and quantified using the 12-item NOSE-Perf scale (score range 0–48). NOSE-Perf findings were correlated to patient demographics, perforation etiology, and perforation length. NOSE-Perf scores of patients who pursued treatment were compared with those who did not.

Results

NOSE-Perf data were collected from 202 patients. Nasal crusting was noted in 94.1% of patients and was the most severe symptom reported (mean 2.9 of 4.0). Nasal congestion, difficulty breathing, and nasal obstruction followed in prevalence and severity. The mean total NOSE-Perf score was 23.7. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a weakly negative association of NOSE-Perf score with patient age and weakly positive association with increasing perforation length. NOSE-Perf scores were significantly higher in women and in patients pursuing treatment.

Conclusion

This is the first study to use the validated NOSE-Perf scale to objectively characterize and establish baseline septal perforation symptomatology. The NOSE-Perf scale can play a role in the standardization of perforation evaluation and treatment outcomes assessment. Laryngoscope, 133:1315–1320, 2023.

### Nasal reconstruction in granulomatosis with polyangiitis using an L-shaped cartilage strut graft [^51beb53c]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

GPA, historically referred to as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a potentially fatal disease mostly affecting the upper and lower respiratory system and the kidneys, resulting in the development of necrotizing granulomatous lesions. The ENT is frequently affected in patients with GPA, ranking as the most frequently involved organs upon diagnosis. In many instances, the lesions in these areas manifest before any respiratory or renal symptoms can be recognized. The prevalence and intensity of ENT symptoms highlight the need to assess the effect of GPA on patients, given that 70–95% of people with GPA experience head and neck symptoms. Furthermore, the inflammation frequently causes irreversible damage to the upper airway tissues. The nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are the most frequently affected locations, with a prevalence of 64–80%. This is followed by symptoms in the ear, pharynx and larynx. Typical sinonasal symptoms consist of nasal crusting, chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms, nasal obstruction and nasal necrotic–bloody discharge. Typically, the anterior part of the septum is affected, including the vascular plexus that provides blood to the septal components. This leads to serious damage to the cartilaginous and bony structures. Biopsy usually reveals necrotizing granulomas with giant cells and vasculitis that is predominantly characterized by neutrophils. However, all diagnostic symptoms uncommonly occur simultaneously. The clinical presentation includes the presence of mucosal erosions, scar development, occurrence of septal perforation and distinct deformity characterized by a reduction in the height of the nasal dorsum and a reduced nasal length. The symptomatic category of additional ENT sites includes various conditions, such as tinnitus, otitis media, otitis externa, tympanic membrane perforation, mastoiditis, sensorineural or conductive hearing loss and subglottic stenosis as an airway manifestation. Without systemic treatment, the condition can be fatal because it involves the lower airway, kidneys and other organs. However, in most cases, permanent remission can be achieved with immunosuppressive therapy, and saddle nose deformity remains a permanent stigma for patients. Although surgical nasal reconstruction exists, the procedure has not yet become widespread. Initially, patients are mostly monitored by immunologists and rheumatologists, who may not be familiar with this rehabilitation. Furthermore, the procedure requires surgical staff experienced in the reconstructive technique and can adjust to any potential intraoperative circumstances. Moreover, GPA recurrence and the potential subsequent deterioration of the rebuilt nose are prevalent concerns that hinder surgeons from initiating the surgery for such malformations.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) can cause rhinosinusitis with nasal obstruction. As the disease becomes established, sinonasal erosion with osteitis and osteogenesis is common. There is a predilection for nasal septum involvement and perforation (Fig. 9). Of note, T-cell variant of sinonasal lymphoma can be indistinguishable from GPA-associated rhinosinusitis. Whilst cocaine-associated sinonasal disease can appear similar to GPA, unlike GPA it has a propensity to also cause soft and hard palate destruction.

There is widespread mucosal thickening throughout the sinuses with evidence of "frond-like" chronic remodelling and osteitis (long arrows). On the coronal image (b), erosion of the middle turbinates and irregularity of the nasal septum can be seen (short arrow)

### Epistaxis and Staphylococcus aureus colonization in the nasal vestibule: is it a cause or consequence? [^6c446cdf]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between epistaxis and nasal colonization of Staphylococcus aureus in a population of patients with recurrent epistaxis. A total of 361 men and women were recruited, 245 patients with epistaxis (114 had crusting in the nasal vestibule; 131 did not) and 116 control subjects. A microbiology swab was taken from the anterior nasal cavity of each subject. Staphylococcus aureus was found to be more common in the epistaxis group when compared with the control group with a percentage of 31.8% and 4.3%, respectively (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the prevalence of S. aureus between the crust and non-crust groups (P > 0.05). When positive cultures were grouped and compared according to season, it was observed that the positive culture with epistaxis was much higher (44.82%) in the autumn period. Staphylococcus aureus colonization in the nasal vestibule is more likely to be observed in individuals who have recurrent epistaxis than in those who do not have. It seems that this colonization may have a role in the etiology of epistaxis. However, with an altered medium of the nasal vestibule after each epistaxis period, it is also possible to speculate that this colonization is may be the consequence of epistaxis itself.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for sinonasal malignancy, more specifically with respect to clinical follow-up, ESMO/EURACAN 2025 guidelines recommend to educate patients on nasal hygiene procedures for preventing or removing nasal crusting, and perform periodic debridement of the endoscopic cavity under endoscopic guidance.

### Nasal septal ulceration [^fa6564b8]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Nasal septal ulceration can have multiple etiologies. Determining the exact cause depends on who the consulting specialist is, who could either be the ENT surgeon or the dermatologist. The common causes are infections (tuberculosis, leprosy, leishmaniasis), vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss syndrome), and lupus erythematosus. Traumatic causes and malignancy can also be seen in tertiary referral centers. The diagnosis often requires thorough investigations and multiple tissue specimens from various sites, and in chronic cases, a suspicion of lymphoma should be considered. Apart from disease-specific therapy, a multidisciplinary approach is required in most cases to tackle the cosmetic disfigurement.

### Computed tomography for constructing custom nasal septal buttons… [^f36afce7]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion Custom septal buttons created using computed tomography are effective in relieving symptoms from large septal perforations. Between August 1980 and December 2000, 95 patients were fitted with custom septal buttons. Preoperative symptoms related to septal perforations are listed in Table 1. The most common symptoms experienced were crusting, epistaxis, and difficulty breathing. Other common symptoms included pain, rhinorrhea, postnasal discharge, and hyposmia. A cause for the perforation was sought in every case, though undetermined in 19 patients. More than 40% of perforations were caused by nasal surgery. External nasal trauma was responsible for 11% of perforations, and both cocaine use and nonsurgical intranasal trauma was the source of 8% of the perforations. In 19 patients, there was no identifiable cause.

The 6 most common symptoms from septal perforations and the percentage of patients experiencing symptom improvement or complete symptom resolution were crusting, 59%; epistaxis, 77%; difficulty breathing, 60%; pain, 71%; rhinorrhea, 39%; and postnasal drainage, 44%. Most patients experienced improved nasal airflow and a considerable decrease in crusting and epistaxis. Nasal septal perforations occur in many scenarios. In a previous series of 171 patients, nasal surgery was the most common cause, followed by intranasal trauma. 4 Other causes include external trauma, cautery, cocaine abuse, infection, and systemic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener granulomatosis, sarcoidosis. and, very rarely, Crohn disease. 4–8 Nasal perforations vary in symptomatology depending on both the size and location. 9, 10 The most common symptoms associated with septal perforations are crusting, epistaxis, breathing difficulty, and pain.

4, 6–8 Patients also may complain of whistling, rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, and hyposmia, among other symptoms. In addition, most of the patients experienced improved breathing, and decreased crusting and epistaxis. This indicates that CT provides a suitable alternative for creating custom septal buttons in patients with symptomatic perforations. Finally, custom septal buttons do not preclude future surgical repair. If patients cannot tolerate the button, it can be easily removed and surgical repair undertaken.

### Pediatric septal perforation repair with the endoscopic anterior ethmoid artery flap [^e4ae18b9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric nasal septal perforations can lead to crusting, obstruction, whistling, and recurrent epistaxis. Current approaches for pediatric nasal septal repair center on combination endonasal and external approaches. Herein we describe the successful utilization of a purely endoscopic anterior ethmoid artery flap, an established technique in adults, for nasal septal perforation repair in 3 children aged 12 to 13 years who presented with septal perforations ranging in size from 6 to 12 mm. Successful closure was achieved with an endoscopic anterior ethmoid artery flap, with all patients achieving complete closure and symptom resolution. Children with nasal septal defects are typically treated with temporizing measures until early adulthood, when definitive open repair may be performed. Our initial experience with the anterior ethmoid artery flap technique suggests that this surgery may be easily performed in children as young as 12 years, without the use of previously described adjunctive procedures such as turbinate translocation.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^7c89dbb7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Atrophic rhinitis — clinical features, epidemiology, and management — is a chronic nasal condition associated with atrophy of the nasal mucosa that paradoxically presents with nasal congestion due to a sensation of decreased airflow, and it can be categorized as primary or secondary. Primary atrophic rhinitis is associated with mucosal colonization, predominantly with Klebsiella ozaenae, is more common in young to middle-aged adults in developing countries with dry climates and uncommon in the United States and Europe, and one US study categorized approximately 19% as primary with a mean age of 52 years. It is characterized by progressive atrophy of the nasal mucosa, resorption of underlying bone and turbinates, nasal dryness, and foul-smelling nasal crusts, and by definition there is no history of nasal surgery or trauma. Secondary atrophic rhinitis is more common in the United States and less severe, often developing after excessive nasal surgery, trauma, irradiation, or chronic granulomatous infections; repeated sinonasal surgeries can widen the nasal vault leading to empty nose syndrome, which may occur after aggressive resection of the inferior and sometimes middle turbinates and is associated with severe nasal obstruction and inability to sense airflow even though examination typically finds widely patent nasal cavities and nasal resistance is normal or low. Treatment has traditionally focused on reduction of crusting; conservative options include nasal saline irrigation, glycerin-containing nose drops, nasal emollients, antibiotics, and vasodilators, while surgical interventions decrease nasal cavity size, achieved by surgically closing the nasal cavities (modified Young procedure) or implanting prostheses submucosally.

### Assessment of a novel tool for the clinical grading of nasal septal perforation [^05c14ef0]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Nasal septal perforations (NSP) can have a heterogeneous appearance on endoscopic examination with varying degrees of crusting, inflammatory change, and associated septal deviation. The clinical applicability of these findings as contributors to patient symptoms may be enhanced by use of a standardized assessment.

Methods

Video nasal endoscopy recordings were obtained from 40 patients with NSP. Five raters with varied levels of training ranging from a senior resident to an experienced septal perforation surgeon independently reviewed the videos for the following exam findings: crusting, scarring, granulation tissue, septal deviation, and edema. Scoring for each item was reported on a 3-point (0–2) scale, and each reviewer repeated scoring at a 14-day interval. Interrater and intrarater agreement were calculated using Fleiss kappa for each item and the total scores. Additionally, endoscopy scores were correlated with patient-reported NOSE-Perf symptom scores.

Results

Interrater agreement for the overall instrument was in the "fair-to-moderate" range with the following interrater agreement for each item: crusting (0.458–0.575), scarring (0.286–0.308), granulation (0.403–0.406), deviation (0.487–0.494), and edema (0.253–0.406). Intrarater agreement was generally "substantial" for individual items as well as the overall instrument (0.688). The NSP endoscopy scores were moderately correlated with NOSE-Perf scores (r = 0.44, p = 0.008).

Conclusions

An endoscopic evaluation of NSP comprising five exam findings has acceptable interrater and intrarater reliability and correlates with patient-reported outcomes. NSP endoscopy may be applied to future clinical studies for characterization of NSP and assessment of treatment outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^75d9c9f4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative debridement after ESS — Based on the type of surgery performed and the postoperative endoscopic exam, postoperative debridement may be performed, and removal of retained blood and dense crusting from the nasal cavity and sinuses is important to the healing process. This in-office procedure, typically done with topical anesthesia only, can be uncomfortable, and the importance and frequency of these visits should be discussed with patients in advance when needed to optimize outcomes.

### Trilayer temporalis fascia interposition graft for nasal septal perforation repair: a continued experience [^02406c4b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

The repair of nasal septal perforation (NSP) is complex, with a variety of described techniques and reported outcomes. At our institution, we commonly perform NSP repair using a trilayer graft of thin polydioxanone (PDS) plate wrapped on both sides with temporalis fascia without intranasal flaps. We aim to report our continued experience with this technique.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Single institution.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients undergoing repair of NSP using a trilayer temporalis fascial interposition grafting technique at our institution from 9/1/2018 to 10/31/2023.

Results

Fifty‐six patients (mean age 45 years, 58.9% female) were included in this study. The suspected cause of NSP was primarily iatrogenic (n = 26, 45.6%); however, a large number of patients did not have a definitive etiology of NSP (n = 18, 32.1%). The most commonly reported symptoms pre‐operatively included nasal obstruction/congestion (n = 51, 91.1%) and nasal crusting (n = 31, 55.4%). NSPs were most frequently anterior in location (n = 46, 82.1%) and medium in size (1‐2 cm) (n = 31, 55.4%), followed by small (< 1 cm) (n = 17, 30.4%). All patients within this study experienced improvement in their pre‐existing symptoms associated with NSP, with complete resolution of prior symptoms occurring in the majority of patients (n = 44, 78.6%). A minority of patients in this cohort experienced postoperative complications (n = 8, 14.3%). One patient (1.8%) demonstrated persistent perforation following repair. The median length of follow‐up in this study was 257 days (range 65‐1724).

Conclusion

The trilayer temporalis fascial interposition graft is an effective and reliable tool for the repair of NSP.

### Septal perfoplasty for management of symptomatic nasal septal perforation: an alternative to surgical closure [^c7723fad]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance: Symptomatic septal perforations are often difficult to manage and can have a significant impact on patient quality of life. Available surgical techniques for repair have demonstrated a varying rate of success, presenting a need for reliable interventions targeting symptom control. Objectives: To describe the modified surgical technique here termed septal perfoplasty. To demonstrate that creation of favorable septal perforation characteristics is effective in managing symptoms and improving patient quality of life. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective review of the medical record was performed of patients who underwent the procedure of interest between July 1, 2006 and October 1, 2019 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. All patients with symptomatic septal perforation who underwent septal perfoplasty within the timeframe reviewed were included. Septal perfoplasty was standardly performed in combination with turbinate reduction in all cases. This was combined with other indicated procedures for chronic sinusitis, repair of vestibular stenosis or nasal deformity. Main Outcomes and Measures: Creation of a well-mucosalized septal perforation, combined with patient-reported acceptable symptom control, was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include time to resolution, duration of follow-up, postsurgical complications, and need for further intervention. Results: Twenty patients (70% female; mean [range] age, 45.8 [15–72] years) underwent septal perfoplasty over the course of 13 years. The most common etiology of perforation was trauma (40%), presenting symptom was crusting (95%), and size of perforation repaired was large (60%). Mean follow-up was 37.6 months (range, 1–153 months). Overall, favorable perforation characteristics were created in 95% of cases by the first postoperative appointment. Acceptable symptomatic control was achieved in 18 out of 20 patients (90%), with a median time to improvement of 66 days. Eight patients required additional surgery to address chronic sinusitis or vestibular stenosis. Two patients experienced postoperative infections, treated conservatively with antibiotics. Conclusion and Relevance: Septal perfoplasty is a safe, simple, and effective method for management of symptomatic nasal septal perforation, which provides an alternative to more complicated interventions with comparable rates of symptomatic resolution. This procedure should particularly be considered for patients in which difficult repair is anticipated.

### Pathophysiology and progression of nasal septal perforation [^a577467c]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the prevalence, causes, and treatments of nasal septal perforation (NSP).

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed articles related to NSP using the keywords nasal septal perforation and septal perforation for articles published between January 1, 1969, and December 31, 2006, and references cited therein.

Study Selection

Articles were selected based on their direct applicability to the subject matter.

Results

Causes of NSPs include piercings, exposure to industrial chemicals, illicit drug use, intranasal steroid use, surgical trauma, bilateral cautery, and possibly improper use of nasal applicators. Prevalence is poorly reported. Mechanisms of substance-induced NSP formation are not understood. Progression from epistaxis to ulceration to NSP could not be substantiated by the literature.

Conclusion

Depending on the patient, NSP may be viewed as desirable (nose rings), problematic (whistling, congestion), or inconsequential. Understanding the pathogenesis of NSP is important for the practicing physician required to make decisions about whether to recommend surgical correction or medical treatment. Although the etiology of NSP is overwhelmingly iatrogenic, there is an association with a number of medical diseases in addition to use of illicit drugs and/or prescription nasal sprays.

### Trilayer temporalis fascia interposition graft for nasal septal perforation repair: a continued experience [^88104800]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Nasal septal perforation (NSP) is a full‐thickness defects of the nasal septum caused by loss of mucoperichondrial lining and underlying cartilage or bone. They may arise from several possible etiologies, including iatrogenic injury from nasal surgery or cauterization, intranasal drug use, rheumatologic or inflammatory conditions, and trauma. Prevalence of this condition is estimated at < 1%–3%, depending on the specific population studied. The clinical presentation of NSP is variable, ranging from asymptomatic to those causing significant derangements in nasal breathing and associated nasal symptoms of crusting, whistling, and epistaxis. As a result of these symptoms, patients with NSPs often exhibit a reduction in overall quality of life.

The management of NSPs varies and is dependent upon size, location, orientation, and symptomatology of the perforation. In patients without significant symptom burden, medical management alone consisting of a robust nasal hygiene regimen with daily intranasal saline sprays, topical emollients, and humidification of their local environment may be trialed. For patients with smaller perforations who are refractory to medical management and poor surgical candidates, nasal obturation in the form of a nasal septal button can be considered. However, for patients who desire a more permanent solution, surgical repair is often necessary.

Surgical repair of NSPs is complex and may be accomplished through a multitude of techniques with varying degrees of success. These techniques include both open and closed approaches and may range in complexity from local tissue rearrangement to free‐tissue transfer. At our institution, we routinely perform NSP repair using a trilayer graft, composed of a thin polydioxanone (PDS) plate wrapped with the superficial layer of the deep temporal fascia (temporalis fascia). We have previously reported on this technique and our initial experience with it, demonstrating a high degree of success. Given this success, we have continued to employ the trilayer temporalis fascial interposition graft for repair of NSPs and, thus, aim to report our continued experience with this technique, including lessons learned and additional insights.

### An unusual source of sinonasal disease in an immunocompromised patient: a case report of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis [^2f641b0f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic nasal crusting is a commonly encountered entity in an otolaryngology office. Progressive, extensive nasal crusting with erosion is relatively unusual, however. We present the case a 58-year-old renal transplant patient with a history of vasculitis and immunosuppression who presents with subjective headache and facial pain, nasal crusting, and isolated left ethmoid sinusitis. She developed extensive intranasal necrosis and underwent multiple endoscopic sinus surgeries with intraoperative biopsies, which played a critical role in her workup and eventual diagnosis of Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis. Although she endured a difficult course, proper diagnosis and treatment allowed for her recovery over time. The differential diagnosis for intranasal necrosis is often broad. This case highlights the wide range of etiologies to be considered in a patient with extensive nasal crusting and erosion/necrosis, and the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation in these patients, especially those in an immunocompromised state.

### Surgical management of the septal perforation [^621c6a5b]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Initial management of a septal perforation involves medical intervention, but there are several surgical options available. Deciding to proceed with a surgical repair is dependent on the etiology of the defect, how the symptoms impact the patient, the extent of damage or impending destruction to the nasal support, and the absence of any active disease process. The literature describes several methods for septal perforation repair; each has its technical challenges because of the tenuous nature of the tissues and limited surgical exposure of the area. This article reviews the diagnostic work-up of septal perforations, the medical management, and the surgical treatment options, with emphasis placed on the open rhinoplasty approach.

### Posterior septal resection: a simple surgical option for management of nasal septal perforation [^f51cc704]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Large and complex nasal septal perforations may cause considerable patient discomfort and are challenging to repair. Posterior septal resection (PSR) is a simple procedure and can be incorporated into the surgical management algorithm for this patient population.

Objective

To evaluate PSR for the treatment of symptomatic complex and large nasal septal perforations.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective medical chart review from 1995 through 2007 of patients who underwent PSR. Medical charts were reviewed, and a follow-up telephone questionnaire was performed.

Interventions

Posterior septal resection.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Improvement of selected symptoms after PSR.

Results

Twenty-one patients were identified, 16 patients had thorough documentation of perioperative information contained in their medical charts, and 12 patients were available for follow-up survey. All patients tolerated the procedure well without long-term sequelae from surgery. Overall nasal discomfort was significantly improved in 12 of 12 patients (P < .001). All nasal symptom scores of obstruction, pain, whistling, drainage, crusting, and epistaxis showed statistically significant (P < .05) improvement from preoperative values. Nasal obstruction and crusting were symptoms that improved with high statistical significance (P < .001). Patients reported on average a 79% improvement (range, 45%-100% improvement) in nasal airway, with only 1 patient reporting no improvement. All patients were satisfied with their surgery and would undergo the procedure again and recommend it to others.

Conclusions and Relevance

Posterior septal resection provides overall patient satisfaction and improvement in subjective nasal symptom scores when used for large and complex septal perforations. This simple procedure may be included in the treatment algorithm of large and complex symptomatic septal perforations.

### Total septal perforation repair with a pericranial flap: radio-anatomical and clinical findings [^7c695c64]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Endonasal surgeries are the primary cause of septal perforation (SP). However, trauma, inflammation, infections, neoplasms, or abuse of inhaled drugs can also cause SP. Septal repair is indicated in patients who experience nasal obstruction, crusting, intermittent epistaxis, purulent discharge, or nasal whistling and in those who fail conservative treatment. Multiple approaches have been suggested to repair the SP; however, none has been universally adopted. This study explores the feasibility of repairing a total SP using the pericranial flap (PCF).

Study Design

Anatomical cadaver and radiological study plus case study.

Methods

Total nasal septectomy and endoscopic reconstruction with a PCF was performed in 12 injected cadaveric specimens. Maximum length and area of the nasal septum and the PCF were measured in 75 computed tomography scans. Based on the anatomical study and the radiological measurements of the cadavers, one patient underwent total nasal septum repair.

Results

Anatomic measurements showed that the nasal septum has a mean length of 5.8 ± 0.7 cm, whereas the PCF was on average 18.4 ± 1.3 cm long (mean surface area 121.6 ± 17.7 cm²). Radiological measurements revealed that the PCF should provide a surface area of 40.9 ± 4.2 cm² to account for the total septal area and an additional 30% to account range for potential scar retraction. For total septum repair, the distal edge of the PCF had to be placed 0.8 ± 2.0 cm (3.4 ± 8.7°) from the adopted reference point (vertical projection of the external ear canal). Total septal reconstruction was performed successfully in one patient without complications.

Conclusions

Radio-anatomical data and a case study demonstrate that a PCF allows complete endoscopic repair of the nasal septum.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^9a2bada3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — physical examination for patients with symptoms compatible with rhinitis includes recording vital signs on all patients and general observations of facial pallor, elongated facies, preferred mouth breathing, and evidence of systemic disease. Findings to assess include ocular changes such as excessive lacrimation and conjunctival or eyelid signs; nasal abnormalities including reduced nasal valve patency, septal deviation or perforation, turbinate hypertrophy, mucosal color and edema or erythema with crusting, discharge features, and the presence of tumors or foreign bodies; ear changes such as tympanic membrane abnormalities and air-fluid levels; oropharyngeal and dental features including halitosis and signs associated with chronic mouth breathing; neck lymphadenopathy or thyroid enlargement; chest signs of asthma by auscultation; and skin rashes or dermatographism, with other organ systems examined when indicated. Documentation of presence or absence of these elements should be considered.

### Repair of large nasal septal perforations using facial artery musculomucosal (FAMM) flap [^f5b0b132]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Nasal septum perforations from surgical submucous resection, septoplasty, blunt trauma, and substance abuse may cause epistaxis, nasal obstruction, discharge, crusting, dryness, pain, and whistling. While small symptomatic perforations are closed with local mucosal flaps, options for closure of large symptomatic perforations are limited. A local pedicled flap, the facial artery musculomucosal (FAMM) flap was studied in patients with large symptomatic nasal septal defects.

Methods

Patients included in the study had (1) a nasal septal defect measuring at least 20 mm in greatest dimension; and (2) related symptoms of nasal crusting, discharge, dryness, obstruction, epistaxis, pain, or whistling. Six patients (3 males; 3 females) met these criteria and received FAMM flap repair. Outcomes were assessed based on comparison of preoperative versus last follow-up (range, 10–30 months; mean 17 months) assessment of perforation size and symptomatology. Overall discomfort was rated at each time point on a 1–10 scale.

Results

Age at time of operation ranged from 21 to 44 years, with a mean of 34 years of age. Causes of septal perforation included blunt trauma (50%), cocaine abuse (33%), and submucous resection (17%). Preoperatively, maximal recorded dimensions of septal perforations ranged from 3.1 to 4.0 cm with a mean of 3.5 ± 0.4 cm. Symptoms included pain (83%), dryness (67%), crusting (50%), discharge (33%), epistaxis (33%), and obstruction (33%). Three or more symptoms were experienced by 5 patients (83%). Overall discomfort ranged from 6–10, with a mean of 8.4. Postoperatively at last follow-up, all 6 patients (100%) achieved closure of their septal defect (P < 0.001). Overall discomfort score was zero for all 6 patients (100%) (P < 0.0001). Complete symptomatic resolution was also noted among all 6 patients (100%) (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

In summary, the advantages of the FAMM flap closure technique were (1) no visible external scar, with minimal donor site morbidity; (2) successful closure of large septal defects (> 2 cm) with vascularized tissue in a single stage; and (3) resolution of patient symptomatology.

### Nasal reconstruction in granulomatosis with polyangiitis: a two decade review [^44b8fc9b]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Saddle nose deformities can be devastating and, in the presence of a disease such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), they add insult to injury to a disease that often affects multiple organ systems. These patients are subject to a high level of psychological and emotional distress and their quality of life is greatly diminished. As such, patients are often eager to accept even the most minimal of improvement in their condition. A multidisciplinary approach that includes the rheumatologist, sinus surgeon, and an experienced rhinoplasty surgeon is required to achieve the best possible outcome.

The nasal deformity caused by GPA is due to a progressive loss of structural support of the nose. The vasculitis and granulomatous inflammatory changes in the nasal lining leads to a loss of septal cartilage and, eventually, changes in the nasal and facial bones. This leads to a collapse of the nasal framework, leading to varying degrees of saddle deformity, valvular obstruction, nasal foreshortening, and injury to the skin-soft tissue envelope (S-STE) of the nose. Most patients will also suffer from crusting, bleeding, and chronic and recurrent rhinosinusitis.

The degree of the deformity and loss of structural support, the presence or absence of a septal perforation, as well as the integrity of the S-STE of the nose will dictate the type of grafts and grafting materials. Costal cartilage has proven to be reliable, readily available, and easy to use. There are many issues that can occur with the use of costal cartilage, and these have been abundantly discussed in other publications.

Vertical support of the lower two thirds of the nose is achieved using strong columellar struts, septal extension grafts (SEG), or septal replacement grafts (SRG). We have found that these grafts need to be slightly larger and thicker than when used in non-GPA cases. They are, most often, attached to the anterior nasal spine through periosteal sutures or bone tunnels. Longitudinal support is always required, and the choice of grafting will also depend on the degree of nasal collapse. Mild to moderate saddle deformities (type I and II)can be dealt with the use of extended spreader grafts secured to the columellar strut, SEG, or SRG. The extended spreaders can often be designed to provide some vertical height as well.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^c70b01f1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Anterior rhinoscopy and septoplasty in recurrent epistaxis — anterior rhinoscopy may allow diagnosis of additional nasal pathology, such as nasal septal deviation or septal perforation, with resultant changes in management strategies, and septoplasty has been performed in patients with recurrent epistaxis and septal deviation with control of bleeding likely from some combination of improved nasal airflow, interruption of mucosal vasculature, and/or more effective packing.

### Septal perforation repair using a temporoparietal fascia and polydioxanone plate construct: a multi-institutional analysis [^77be2141]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: Nasal septal perforations (NSPs) are notoriously difficult to fix and closure can paradoxically lead to worsening of symptoms, prompting numerous techniques for repair including temporoparietal fascia (TPF)-polydioxanone (PDS) plate interposition grafting. Objectives: To compare rates of NSP closure with TPF-PDS interposition grafting among a variety of institutions with diverse environmental influences and patient-specific factors. Methods: Retrospective review of patients undergoing TPF-PDS interposition grafting at seven different U.S. institutions over 5 years. Outcomes include closure rate, self-reported symptom improvement, change in Nasal Obstruction Symptomatic Evaluation (NOSE) score, and postoperative complications. Results: Sixty-two patients (39 female) with a mean age of 41.5 years were included. Most common perforation location was anterior (53%), and average size was 1.70 cm². NSP closure with symptomatic improvement was achieved in 95% of participants. Postoperative NOSE scores decreased on average by 42 points. Residual crusting occurred in 29% of patients, independent of external factors. Conclusions: TPF-PDS interposition grafting is highly effective for NSP repair in a wide variety of settings, and NOSE scores correspond well with patient-reported outcomes.

### Repair of nasal septal perforation using a simple unilateral inferior meatal mucosal flap [^9f3bdeb4]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Nasal septal perforation may cause recurrent epistaxis, nasal obstruction, discharge, crusting, dryness, pain and whistling. Many surgical approaches for the repair of septal perforations have been reported in the literature, however most of the available closure techniques are technically difficult, require experienced surgeons and have a high rate of re-perforations. A new and simple surgical technique for the treatment of nasal septal perforations is described in the present study. A total of 13 patients with symptomatic nasal septal perforation measuring 17 ± 3mm (range 5–26 mm) at the widest point were enrolled in the present study. All patients were treated with a unilateral inferior meatal mucosal flap and had their septal defects closed. Complete symptomatic resolution was documented among all of these patients. This technique provides a new method with many advantages compared to other techniques for closure of septal perforations. Our first experiences with this flap show its reliability in repairing septal perforations.

### Diagnostic criteria for atrophic rhinosinusitis [^0d8278c5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with atrophic rhinosinusitis have intractable upper airway symptoms that result from loss of the normal nasal epithelium. There is no consensus on how to diagnose this condition, and diagnostic criteria are not available to perform multicenter treatment trials. We sought to establish diagnostic criteria for atrophic rhinosinusitis.

Methods

Twenty-two patients for whom there was a consensus on the diagnosis of atrophic rhinosinusitis were compared with a control group of 22 randomly selected patients with garden-variety chronic rhinosinusitis. Medical records were reviewed on all patients and clinical data were tabulated. Clinical variables included the presence of nasal obstruction, epistaxis, anosmia, purulence, crusting, chronic inflammatory disease involving the upper airway, and multiple sinus surgeries.

Results

Both groups had similar degrees of persistent nasal obstruction (82% vs 77%). The other 6 clinical features occurred more frequently in patients with atrophic rhinosinusitis than controls (P < .05). Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent nasal purulence had a 25-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9–221.7) increased probability, those with recurrent epistaxis had a 12-fold increased probability (95% CI, 1.3–106.8), and those with 2 or more sinus surgeries had a 15-fold (95% CI, 3.5–66.7) increased probability of having atrophic rhinosinusitis. As the number of symptoms increased, there was an increasing probability of the predetermined diagnosis of atrophic rhinosinusitis (P < .05). The presence of chronic rhinosinusitis and any 2 of the 6 clinical features for 6 months or longer resulted in a sensitivity of 0.95 and specificity of 0.77 for the diagnosis of atrophic rhinosinusitis.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of the common secondary form of atrophic rhinosinusitis may be made with certainty if a patient with chronic rhinosinusitis demonstrates 2 or more clinical features for 6 months and longer. These features are patient-reported recurrent epistaxis or episodic anosmia; or physician-documented nasal purulence, nasal crusting, chronic inflammatory disease of the upper airway, or 2 or more sinus surgeries.

### The eye is a common site of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. A collaborative study [^aae453b9]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Upper or/and lower airway symptoms included nasal, sinus, and pulmonary abnormalities, occurring in isolation or in variable combinations. The ENT system was involved in 17 of the 22 patients (77%); the clinical features included bloody nasal discharge, nasal crusts and/or ulcers, and sinusitis. In 2 patients, the inflammatory and granulomatous processes led to perforation of the nasal septum (Fig. 3 a) and consequent saddle nose deformity. 11 patients (50%) presented with pulmonary symptoms of variable severity, ranging from persistent cough and hemoptysis to cavitating pulmonary lesions (Fig. 3 b–d) and patchy or diffuse ground-glass opacities. Histopathologic examination of surgically achieved lung tissue showed granulomatous inflammation, stenotic involvement of the vascular lumen, infiltration of immune cells surrounding the vessels and disruption of the vascular wall (Fig. 4).

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^3262fb70]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Inferior turbinate reduction for allergic rhinitis (AR) is presented as a reasonable option for AR patients with inferior turbinate hypertrophy who have persistent symptoms despite medication management, with randomized and uncontrolled studies showing symptom and patency improvements at defined follow-ups. One prospective randomized study of 382 patients found submucous resection with inferior turbinate outfracture to be the most effective surgical therapy with the fewest complications among multiple techniques. Another randomized study of 60 patients reported both submucous resection and tissue ablation reduced subjective nasal obstruction at 3 and 6 months, with greater nasal patency at 12 months after submucous resection. A nonblinded randomized trial of 58 perennial AR patients who had failed oral antihistamines showed both surgical and INS groups reduced nasal resistance after 1 year, with statistically significant improvement in nasal congestion symptoms in the surgical group and a nonsignificant trend in the medical group. Prospective cohorts observed reduced nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing after inferior turbinate reduction, including 95 patients improved at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and 60 patients with decreased nasal response to allergen provocation at 2 and 12 months and sustained symptom improvement at 3- and 5-year follow-up. Reported complications include nasal bleeding, synechiae, crusting, and rarely atrophic rhinitis.

### The combined use of the temporoparietal fascia graft and polycaprolactone nasal sheets in iatrogenic nasal septal perforation repair [^f239ff99]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

NSP is most frequently iatrogenic in origin and has been found to derive from previous septoplasty or septorhinoplasty. In their 56 case study involving the sandwich graft technique, Özer et al. reported closure in 93.3% of medium-sized and large perforations of idiopathic origin and in 81% of those with iatrogenic causes. Kaya et al. reported an 86% success rate with a three-layer graft consisting of temporal fascia and conchal tissue in patients with small perforations less than 2 cm in size developing secondary to nasal septal surgery. Chen et al. reported a 92.3% success rate in perforations 1–2 cm in size using an interposition graft, irrespective of etiological causes. Similar success rates to those in the literature were achieved in the present study.

PCL has recently emerged as an alternative to autologous implants. PCL is a biocompatible material capable of being broken down biologically. It has also been shown to possess adequate thinness and mechanical support and to be capable of surgical manipulation. PCL has also been reported to cause a low rate of foreign body reaction. Some studies have also shown that it exhibits long-term stability (with bioabsorption over longer than two years). No foreign body reaction or extrusion occurred in any patient in the current study. Nasal sheet stability was preserved even after an average of one year in two cases without remucosalization. In contrast to the flap technique, intense crusting may develop in non-mucosal closure techniques. In our clinical practice, silicon splints were kept in the nasal cavity for three weeks, and no crusting was observed following their removal. The microporosity of PCL promotes fibrovascular tissue formation without forming granulation tissue. However, the long-term outcomes after complete resorption of the PCL plate are not fully known and a long-follow-up clinical study is required for this. Suboptimal positioning of the polycaprolactone (PCL) nasal sheet may lead to excessive pressure on the mucosal flap, potentially resulting in mucosal atrophy, extrusion of the nasal mucosa, and mucosal ulceration.

IDSA/ASTMH leishmaniasis guidelines — Assessment for mucosal disease in persons with cutaneous leishmaniasis acquired in Central or South America who may have or be at risk for ML — All persons at risk for ML — on the basis of the etiologic agent of the Leishmania infection, if known, and the region in the New World in which infection was acquired — should be questioned about and examined for mucosal symptoms and signs, respectively, even during the initial evaluation (strong, low). During all evaluations (ie, initial and subsequent), persons at risk for ML should be questioned explicitly about the development, evolution, and other characteristics of mucosal symptoms; and they should have a thorough examination of the naso-oropharyngeal mucosa even if they do not have any mucosal symptoms (strong, low). Persons at risk for ML should be educated and provided personalized documentation about the importance of seeking medical attention for possible ML if they ever develop persistent, atypical (unusual for the person) naso-oropharyngeal/ laryngeal manifestations that do not have a clear etiology (strong, low). Persons at risk for ML who have mucosal signs and symptoms should be referred to a specialist for an otorhinolaryngologic examination, which typically should include fiber-optic endoscopy (strong, low), and clinicians might refer some at-risk persons to an otolaryngologist when a thorough review of systems and mucosal examination was not possible or may have been inadequate or unreliable (weak, very low). In New World ML, the anterior nasal septum is the most commonly involved area; dried nasal secretions, if any, should be removed before beginning the examination, and the oral cavity and pharynx should be inspected using a tongue depressor and a light to visualize the entire hard palate by asking the patient to tip back his/her head.

### Nasal morbidity following endoscopic skull base surgery: a prospective cohort study [^ea717c26]. Head & Neck (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Nasal morbidity following skull base surgery necessitates follow-up for postoperative care. We describe nasal morbidity following endoscopic skull base surgery.

Methods

Patient and operative data and postoperative subjective and objective measures of morbidity were prospectively collected for 1 year. Time to absence of crusting and remucosalization were determined. Risk factor analyses for crusting and nasal discharge were performed.

Results

Nasal crusting (98%) and discharge (46%) were the most common postoperative symptoms. Median time to absence of crusting was 101.0 days, with longer times for complex cases (p = .033) but not for patients with septal flaps or fat grafts. Median time to remucosalization after nasoseptal flap was 89.0 days. There were no risk factors for crusting, although surgical complexity was a risk factor for postoperative discharge (odds ratio [OR] = 5.17).

Conclusions

Nasal morbidity following endoscopic skull base surgery is common and may be affected by surgical complexity and use of the nasoseptal flap.

### Differences and similarities between Eastern and Western rhinoplasty: features and proposed algorithms [^15418353]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

DIFFERENT NASAL PROFILES AND SURGICAL ALGORITHMS IN WESTERN AND EASTERN RHINOPLASTY

Although every nose should be evaluated individually and its rhinoplasty tailored to fit, there are common points of correction and undesirable features that are seen repetitively in these 2 populations. We have summarized the major features and our proposed algorithms hereinafter.

Typical Western Undesirable Features

Most common complaints when rhinoplasty patients come are that their noses are "too big, too high, or droopy". Figure 1 shows the front and profile photos of a typical female Western rhinoplasty patient. From the front view, the patient has a wide dorsum that consists of a wide bony vault. The tip is bulbous because of her large lateral crura of the tip lower lateral cartilages (LLCs). On the profile view, the tip appears droopy and pushed down from the relatively large dorsal hump. The long septum caudally can also be responsible for the excess tip derotation and sometimes an overhanging columella. These common features are listed in detail with their potential etiologies in Table 1.

### Fluticasone propionate (fluticasone propionate spray, metered) [^79d0b42e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What are the possible side effects of fluticasone propionate nasal spray?

Fluticasone propionate nasal spray may cause serious side effects, including:

nose problems. Nose problems may include:
nose bleeds.
sores (ulcers) in your nose.
a certain fungal infection in your nose, mouth, or throat (thrush).
hole in the cartilage of your nose (nasal septal perforation). Symptoms of nasal septal perforation may include:
crusting in the nose
nose bleeds
runny nose
whistling sound when you breathe
slow wound healing. You should not use fluticasone propionate nasal spray until your nose has healed if you have a sore in your nose, have had surgery on your nose, or if your nose has been injured.
glaucoma and cataracts. Using nasal and inhaled corticosteroid medicines may result in you developing glaucoma and/or cataracts. Your healthcare provider may have you see an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) if you develop eye symptoms or use fluticasone propionate nasal spray for long periods of time. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any changes in your eye sight while using fluticasone propionate nasal spray.
serious allergic reactions. Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical care if you get any of the following signs of a serious allergic reaction:
rash
hives
swelling of your face, mouth, and tongue
breathing problems
weakened immune system and increased chance of getting infections (immunosuppression). Taking medicines that weaken your immune system makes you more likely to get infections and can make certain infections worse. These infections may include tuberculosis (TB), ocular herpes simplex infections, and infections caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Avoid contact with people who have a contagious disease such as chickenpox or measles while using fluticasone propionate nasal spray. If you come in contact with someone who has chickenpox or measles call your healthcare provider right away.
Symptoms of an infection may include:

### Imaging for headache: what the otolaryngologist looks for… [^e1432984]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosing a rhinogenic cause of headache or facial pain outside of the classic definitions of chronic, acute, and subacute sinusitis can be challenging for the practicing otolaryngologist. Contact-point headaches have been clinically characterized as causing facial pain secondary to abutting mucosal contact from the lateral nasal wall to the septum. Imaging landmarks may help identify these potential contact points radiographically through revealing anatomic variants such as septal spurs and abnormally large lateral nasal structures. However, other potential rhinologic sources, such as barosinusitis, recurrent barotrauma, or recurrent acute sinusitis occurring between active episodes, are challenging to identify through hallmark imaging findings.

### Trilayer temporalis fascia interposition graft for nasal septal perforation repair: a continued experience [^f34f1f9c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

All patients within this study experienced an improvement in their pre‐existing symptoms associated with NSP. Specifically, the majority of patients experienced complete resolution of their prior symptoms (n = 44, 78.6%), with the remaining 12 patients (21.4%) experiencing partial resolution. In patients who did not experience complete resolution of symptoms, nasal obstruction was the most cited persistent symptom (n = 9), followed by crusting (n = 3). When examining patients with persistent nasal obstruction, septal thickening was noted on nasal endoscopy in 77.8% (n = 7). Importantly, no patients with persistent nasal obstruction required additional surgical intervention to address these symptoms. Among patients with persistent crusting, one patient reported continued nasal picking, and another was noncompliant with the use of nasal irrigations/emollient post‐operatively.

One patient within the study demonstrated the persistence of a partial NSP following the trilayer temporalis fascia interposition graft. This was discovered at the patient's four‐month post‐operative appointment. Despite this, the patient experienced partial improvement in symptoms, reduction in size of perforation, and ultimately did not elect to pursue additional repair. When examining factors associated with lack of complete symptom resolution (Table 2), no statistically significant relationships between patient age, suspected cause of perforation, size of perforation, location of perforation, prior nasal surgery, prior nasal steroid use, concomitant nasal procedure, duration of antibiotics, or duration of splinting was found.

Table 2
Factors Associated With Partial Resolution of Symptoms and Postoperative Complications

A minority of patients in this cohort experienced postoperative complications (n = 8, 14.3%). These included post‐operative infection (n = 3, 5.4%), synechiae requiring lysis (n = 2, 3.6%), nasal hemorrhage (n = 1, 1.8%), incomplete repair of the perforation (n = 1), delayed healing presenting as septal thickening and cartilage irregularity (n = 1, 1.8%), and dehiscence of the temporalis fascia harvest site (n = 1). Patients who did not have a history of prior intranasal steroid use (n = 21, 37.5%) had a statistically higher rate of complication (p = 0.0423) (Table 2). No patients required revision trilayer grafting for repair of NSP. The median length of follow‐up in this study was 257 days (range 65‐1724).

### Sinonasal wegener granulomatosis: a single-institution experience with 120 cases [^1492f15f]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Wegener granulomatosis (WG) is intimately associated with the sinonasal tract, with involvement reported in 85% of patients during the course of the disease process. The objectives of the study were: 1) to describe sinonasal symptoms and signs at the time of initial otolaryngologic evaluation; and 2) to review indications and outcomes for rhinologic surgery in WG at our institution.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 120 patients presenting with WG and referred for otolaryngology consultation at a tertiary care center was performed.

Results

Eighty-nine percent of patients exhibited sinonasal involvement including nasal crusting (69%), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) (61%), nasal obstruction (58%), bloody nasal discharge (52%), septal perforation (33%), saddle-nose deformity (23%), epiphora (13%), and mucocele formation (3.3%). Thirty-nine (33%) patients underwent primary functional endoscopic sinus surgery or dacryocystorhinotomy (DCR) prior to referral. Nineteen (16%) patients underwent noncosmetic, functional sinonasal procedures at our institution. These included endoscopic sinus surgery for CRS or mucocele decompression in 14 patients, DCR for chronic epiphora in seven patients, and orbital decompression for pseudotumor in three patients. Individual symptom recurrence within the first year was greatest for visual impairment from pseudotumor (50%), followed by CRS (14%) and nasolacrimal duct obstruction (11%).

Conclusions

The majority of patients with WG are referred to otolaryngology because of involvement of the sinonasal tract. Noncosmetic functional sinonasal procedures are indicated in a minority of patients. Sinonasal morbidity remains significant even after surgery. It is greatest for orbital pseudotumor, but also common for CRS and nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^483781fc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nasal packing — complications, typical duration, and antibiotics: Packing duration typically ranges from 48 hours to 72 hours or even longer, and one retrospective case series of 147 nosebleed patients showed no correlation between recurrence of nosebleeds and use of shorter packing durations, noting an 85% nosebleed control rate with packing durations of 1 to 3 days. Several studies suggest that use of systemic antibiotics following nasal packing should not be mandatory; although the 1 available systematic review did not show a significant benefit to the use of antibiotics with nasal packing, the individual studies were underpowered, so the risks and benefits should be evaluated in each patient. Reported complications include airway obstruction if packs are malpositioned or become dislodged, synechiae with long-term nasal obstruction, and nasal septal perforation with bilateral nasal packings.

### Complete clival resorption and pontine pneumatosis secondary to severe cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion: a case report [^685bf98f]. Neurosurgery Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic Intervention

The patient was placed in the supine position with the head fixed in a clamp. The nasal cavity, nasopharynx, and clival defect were inspected using an endoscope, and findings were that of a large perforation of the nasal septum, a missing left inferior turbinate, and crusting with surrounding mucous overlying the clival defect in the nasopharynx (Figure 2 A). A bicoronal skin incision was centered approximately 16 cm from the nasion (Figure 3 A). The length of the required pericranial flap, determined preoperatively, was approximately 10 cm in length (Figure 3 B). Dissecting the galea from pericranium at the upper most limit of the loose areolar tissue plane and laying as much loose areolar tissue on the pericranium helped create a more robust flap with adequate thickness. The right thigh was also prepared for a fascia lata graft. Next, we proceeded with left functional endoscopic sinus surgery which encompassed a maxillary antrostomy, anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy, sphenoidotomy, and a Draf 2B fronto-sinusotomy. This provided access to the left half of the anterior skull base. Care was taken to preserve the olfactory nerves when removing the mucosa overlying the anterior skull base. The clival defect (1 × 1 cm) was also explored and prepared to receive the pericranial flap. Next, we harvested a unilateral pericranial flap and passed it into the left nasal cavity by drilling a bony window in the glabella (Video). Under endoscopic guidance, the left pericranial flap was then laid along the left anterior skull base, lateral to the left middle turbinate, all the way to the clival defect at its distal tip. The clival defect was repaired in a multilayered fashion. Two layers of fascia lata were placed, sequentially, onto the clival defect as an onlay followed by the left pericranial flap. Tisseel (Fibrin Sealant) (Baxter) was then instilled along the edges, and the flap was further supported with a layer of Gelfoam (Pharmacia and Upjohn Company). The left Draf 2b frontal sinusotomy could now be seen lying medial to the left pericranial flap. This opening was then stented with NexPak intranasal splints (Hemostasis) infused with Depo-Medrol (Pfizer). A Valsalva maneuver revealed that the left pericranial flap provided a seal with no clinical evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak (Figure 2 B).

### Large nasal septal perforation repair by closed endoscopically assisted approach [^2aba1edb]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Options for the surgical closure of large symptomatic perforations are limited and consist of an open or closed approach using skin or mucosal flaps, with or without different grafts. The aim of this study is to review our experience in treating large nasal perforations using a closed approach with endoscopic assistance, undertaking a 3-layer reconstruction of the septum. We reviewed 14 consecutive patients with large (2–4 cm) nasal septal perforations, who were treated using an endonasal/endoscope-assisted approach. In these cases, the mucosal defect was reconstructed through a horizontal advancement of the bipedicled mucoperichondrial flaps and sutured using absorbable sutures. The cartilagineous defect was consistently reconstructed using autogenous auricular conchal grafts. Pre- and postoperative nasal symptom scores were used for the study; a decline in the number of Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation Scale symptoms were recorded in 12 of 14 patients (85.7%), and visual analogue scale scores for crusting, bleeding, nasal discharge, whistling, headache, nasal pain, snoring, olfactory loss, and overall discomfort levels also decreased. It was concluded that bipedicled mucoperichondrial flaps with the insertion of auricular cartilage for a 3-layer septal reconstruction seem to give reasonably good results. The use of nasal endoscopy is an endonasal approach, which offers superior precision in all surgical steps and provides a way to obtain excellent closure of the perforation without external incisions.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^dc6e3cfb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Interventions for nosebleed — initial measures and packing utilization: The majority of nosebleeds originate from the nasal septum, although the lateral nasal wall has a rich vascular supply as well. Initial ("first-line") treatment can include combinations of direct nasal compression, application of topical agents including vasoconstrictors, cautery of the bleeding site with chemicals or electrocautery, or packing with a variety of absorbable and nonabsorbable materials. In the NEDS review, 19.7% of emergency room visits for epistaxis involved treatment with nasal packing; among those requiring packing, Fifty-two percent also had nasal cautery; 41% had anterior packing alone; and 7% had anterior and posterior nasal packing performed.

### Clinical factors associated with the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^286199f8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective To determine the predictive value of nasal endoscopic findings and symptoms in the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Study Design A cross-sectional study. Setting A tertiary university hospital. Subjects and Methods A total of 116 adults were enrolled in the study: 19 patients with GPA, 29 patients with other rheumatic diseases, and 68 healthy volunteers. All patients were examined with a flexible endoscope, and nasal endoscopic images were recorded and evaluated blindly. The medical history of each patient was taken by a physician blinded to the patient's diagnosis. Results Univariate analysis indicated a statistically significant difference in rhinorrhea (P = 0.002), postnasal drip (P = 0.015), epistaxis (P < .001), and saddle nose (P = 0.017). However, binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that only history of epistaxis (P = 0.012; odds ratio, 5.6) was statistically significant in predicting GPA. Univariate analysis showed a statistically significant difference in nasal secretion (P = 0.028), nasal septal perforation (P < .017), nasal crusting (P < .001), nasal adhesion (P < .001), nasal granuloma (P = 0.017), and hemorrhagic fragile nasal mucosa (P < .001). A binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that only hemorrhagic fragile nasal mucosa (P < .001; odds ratio, 52.9) was a statistically significant predictor of GPA. Conclusions Given the results of this study, we believe that hemorrhagic fragile nasal mucosa and history of recurrent epistaxis may put patients at risk for GPA and should be investigated accordingly.

### Unilateral rhinorrhoea and button battery: a case report [^383ff04e]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

On physical examination, clinicians should look meticulously for the presence of a foreign body, excessive unilateral nasal crusts and nasal mucosa ulceration. A cold spatula test can be easily performed to elicit unilateral nasal obstruction. A cold spatula is placed under the nostrils to compare the area of mist formation. The reduced or absence of mist formation from one nostril highly suggests of an embedded foreign body. An immediate referral for urgent intervention is of paramount particularly in a case of an embedded button battery.

X-ray of the paranasal sinus is highly recommended when in doubt. Button battery often displays a characteristic 'double ring' or 'halo' density, owing to the composition difference between its electrode plates and plastic grommet seal. A heterogeneous spectrum of sequela may result from an embedded button battery in the nasal cavity, varying from no complication to hazardous outcome such as septal perforation. The extent of injury is influenced by several factors such as the duration of mucosa exposure, the size, location, remaining voltage and chemical composition of the battery. Nasal mucosa injury ensues as early as 3 hours following an embedded button battery. The extent of injury is proportionate to the exposed time, with reported worsening of mucosa necrosis and septal perforation within 24 hours of exposure. Four proposed mechanisms accounted to mucosa injury include (1) pressure necrosis, (2) sodium hydrocyte leakage from the battery content, (3) electrical discharge, and (4) toxic heavy metal absorption. The risk of secondary infections involving the regional structures includes sinusitis, periorbital cellulitis, otitis media and meningitis. If left untreated, sepsis may progress and result in fatal toxic shock syndrome. Consequently, timely removal of the button battery followed with generous irrigation of the nasal cavity is thus vital in order to eradicate the precipitate.

In conclusion, button battery in the nasal cavity represents an otorhinolaryngology emergency for its conceivable catastrophic sequela. The clinical presentation of unilateral nasal discharge in children should never be taken lightly. Foreign body should always be kept in mind for the differential diagnosis of unilateral rhinorrhoea for all general practitioners. Vigilant clinical assessment must be carried out and referral to the otorhinolaryngologist should be made to prevent complication.

### Endoscopic repair of nasal septal perforation with "Slide and patch" technique [^b5eb12e8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to report our new endoscopic technique for the repair of nasal septal perforations, called the "slide and patch" technique because it combines a mucoperiosteal free graft of the inferior turbinate with a mucosal rotational or advancement flap from the nasal septum.

Methods

Twenty-two patients with symptomatic septal nasal perforation of various sizes underwent our method of repair.

Results

At the last follow-up, 21 (95.4%) perforations were closed. There was a partial closure in only 1 patient with a large perforation (3.5 cm in diameter). After surgery, 19 (86.3%) patients were asymptomatic, 2 (9%) showed persistence of crusting, and 1 (4.5%) showed the appearance of nasal obstruction 1 month postoperatively.

Conclusion

The method described herein has shown to be effective in nasal septal perforation repair and in nasal symptoms relief with the advantage of not requiring grafts from outside the nose.

### Approach to correction of septal perforation [^33fa8c63]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Iatrogenic septal perforation is a complication of nasal surgery. Small or posterior perforations cause few symptoms, and need only conservative treatment. Larger and anterior perforations contribute to nasal airflow disturbances and external nasal deformities. When considering surgical candidacy, one should consider the severity of symptoms, location and size of the perforation, and need for revsional rhinoplasty. We repair perforations using intranasal mucosal advancement flaps augmented by an interposition connective tissue graft. Septal perforation repairs are tedious and technically challenging. We review key points to minimize unintended perforation formation following nasal surgery.

### Evidence-based recommendations regarding the differential diagnosis and assessment of nasal congestion: using the new GRADE system [^6c4b3f83]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Nasal congestion is an important symptom in nasal pathology and can be defined as an objective restriction of nasal cavity airflow because of mucosal pathology and/or increased mucus secretion (excluding anatomical variants). Using the new Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, evidence-based recommendations are made that will encompass different clinical questions regarding diagnostic modalities of nasal congestion: (i) their usefulness in assessment of presence and severity of congestion; (ii) their usefulness in assessment of etiological pathology responsible for congestion; and (iii) their usefulness in follow up and treatment effectiveness evaluation of nasal congestion.

### The combined use of the temporoparietal fascia graft and polycaprolactone nasal sheets in iatrogenic nasal septal perforation repair [^c210705f]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Operations performed for nasal septal perforations entail a high degree of difficulty. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first reported retrospective case series of nasal septal perforation closure using a combination of bilateral TPF and a PCL nasal sheet. In this study, involving 15 patients and an average follow-up time of one year, the endoscopic sandwich graft technique emerged as effective in the repair of medium-sized and large-diameter iatrogenic NSP.

Whether or not patients with NSP experience uncomfortable symptoms depends on several factors, including the size and site of the perforation. In their study of 44 patients with symptomatic NSP, Khong and Leong observed a significant association between perforation-specific symptoms and small, anteriorly located perforations. The most common symptom in NSP is nasal obstruction, seen in 65% of patients. This is followed by symptoms such as crusting (43%), nasal discharge (13%), a whistling sound (8%), and epistaxis (5%). In agreement with the literature, nasal obstruction was the most common symptom in the present study.

While no treatment is generally recommended for asymptomatic perforations, surgery is advised for patients with severe symptoms and/or insufficient relief after medical treatment. Numerous reconstruction techniques have been developed to repair NSP. Several surgical techniques are employed, depending on the dimension and location of the NSP and on the skill and experience of the surgeon. Since there is currently no standard protocol, deciding on the ideal NSP repair technique is problematic. The most frequently employed surgical technique for NSP repair is intranasal mucosal advancement flaps. Highly successful results have been achieved with this technique. Ribeiro and Silva reported that full closure could not be achieved in only three out of 258 patients undergoing repair using the bilateral advancement flap technique with a closed septorhinoplasty approach for perforations between 1 and 3.5 cm in diameter. Pedrosa et al. reported a 97% closure rate using the flap technique (perforation size > 1 cm in 88% of cases and < 1 cm in 12%). Villacampa et al. reported an 89% septal closure rate with the endonasal bilateral advancement flap technique in 37 patients.

### Interventions for atrophic rhinitis [^42f080b2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Atrophic rhinitis is a chronic nasal pathology characterised by the formation of thick dry crusts in a roomy nasal cavity, which has resulted from progressive atrophy of the nasal mucosa and underlying bone. The common symptoms may include foetor, ozaena, crusting/nasal obstruction, epistaxis, anosmia/cacosmia and secondary infection with maggot infestation. Its prevalence varies in different regions of the world and it is common in tropical countries. The condition is predominantly seen in young and middle-aged adults, especially females, with a racial preference amongst Asians, Hispanics and African-Americans. A wide variety of treatment modalities have been described in the literature, however the mainstay of treatment is conservative (for example, nasal irrigation and douches; nose drops (e.g. glucose-glycerine, liquid paraffin); antibiotics and antimicrobials; vasodilators and prostheses). Surgical treatment aims to decrease the size of the nasal cavities, promote regeneration of normal mucosa, increase lubrication of dry nasal mucosa and improve the vascularity of the nasal cavities.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for atrophic rhinitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 28 March 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying any treatment or combination of treatments in patients with atrophic rhinitis. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than five months following treatment/intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors abstracted and assessed studies. We tabulated and then compared the responses of the review authors separately for the individual studies.

Main Results

No studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. We identified one RCT comparing oral rifampicin plus nasal wash versus nasal submucosal placentrex injection plus nasal wash versus a control group (nasal wash) but had to exclude this study due to inadequate length of follow-up. A further RCT comparing Young's operation with nasal lubrication for primary atropic rhinitis is underway.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials concerning the long-term benefits or risks of different treatment modalities for atrophic rhinitis. Further high-quality research into this chronic disease, with a longer follow-up period, is therefore required to establish this conclusively.

### Nasal septal perforation surgical repair study methodology: a state of the art review [^179fabcb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Previous studies synthesizing published data on nasal septal perforation (NSP) repair outcomes have cited the lack of standardization in evaluation and data reporting. The heterogeneity of this literature base limits the quality of available evidence and precludes intercomparison. The aim of this study is to quantitatively characterize trends in NSP evaluation and reporting and identify areas for improvement.

Data Sources

PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science.

Review Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature published from 2012 through 2024 investigating NSP repair techniques was conducted, and perforation evaluation and outcome reporting were characterized and compared between contemporary and older cohorts.

Conclusions

Outcomes of NSP repair are increasingly studied. The heterogeneity of current literature concerning the evaluation of perforations and the reporting of outcomes precludes high-quality comparative analyses of outcomes across separate studies. This review demonstrated a lack of progress towards greater standardization over the last 12 years. There remains room for improvement in regard to the evaluation and reporting of etiology, defect size, symptomatology, and objective outcome of repair, allowing for adequate duration of follow-up.

Implications For Practice

There are many inconsistencies in the collection, organization, and analysis of data implicated in investigations of NSP repair outcomes. The development and agreement upon consensus practice guidelines would engender greater standardization among the evaluation and assessment of treatment outcomes. Based on this review and our institutional experiences, we propose specific measures that would facilitate higher-quality future research and advance the practice of perforation management.

### The combined use of the temporoparietal fascia graft and polycaprolactone nasal sheets in iatrogenic nasal septal perforation repair [^35cea9ef]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nasal septal perforations (NSP) represent a loss of the three-layered wall of the nasal septum that emerges due to iatrogenic causes and for reasons such as nasal trauma, neoplasias, granulomatous diseases, and the use of inhaled irritants. NSP has a significant impact on quality of life and is an important source of morbidity. It can give rise to symptoms such as nasal obstruction, in particular, nasal crusting, a whistling sound when breathing, nasal discharge, epistaxis, olfactory disorder, and headache.

Numerous surgical techniques have been reported for the repair of NSP, with extra- and intra-nasal approaches such as the closure of the mucoperichondrium by direct suturing and local intranasal flap use, interposition grafting with both synthetic and autologous graft material, alloplasty, fascia grafts, acellular human dermal allograft, and bone and cartilage grafts. However, success rates still range between 75 and 96%. The reperforation rate is also between 12 and 48%. Although small perforations can be closed with the majority of these techniques, the closure of medium-sized and large-diameter perforations is more difficult due to the absence of a standard approach and technique selection. The search for novel surgical NSP repair techniques is, therefore, still ongoing.

Polycaprolactone (PCL) is one of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration-approved biodegradable, slowly absorbed, linear polyester biomaterials used in tissue engineering. Three-dimensional printed PCL nasal mesh, introduced as an alternative to autologous implants, has recently been demonstrated to possess adequate mechanical support, thinness, and surgical manipulability. We encountered no previous studies of the use of the PCL nasal sheet in nasal septal perforation. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively examine cases of medium-sized (1–2 cm) and large-sized (> 2 cm) iatrogenic NSP repair using a three-layer interposition graft consisting of a combined temporoparietal fascia (TPF) and PCL nasal sheet (Bloocell® Bioscaffold; Bloocell nasal sheet) (for subsequent use as a sandwich graft) and evaluating the type of application and outcomes of the endoscopic sandwich graft technique performed.

### Granulomatosis with polyangiitis presenting with unilateral facial nerve palsy and nasal septum perforation [^a472aa93]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

The general physical examination revealed noticeable facial asymmetry with a depressed nasal bridge, nasal ulcers, septal perforation, bilateral pitting pedal oedema (grade II) and petechial and purpuric skin rashes with haemorrhagic crust over the dorsum of the right foot (figure 1). The chest examination revealed bilateral fine crackles over the upper lobes. The neurological examination revealed right-sided lower motor neuron facial palsy grade IV according to the House and Brackmann scale. The remaining neurological and systemic examinations were normal.

Figure 1

Laboratory investigations uncovered elevation of acute-phase reactant parameters, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (111 mm/hours) and C reactive protein level (7.7 mg/dL), in addition to evidence of normocytic anaemia (haemoglobin = 90 g/dL), leucocytosis (white cell count = 23 × 10⁹/L) and thrombocytosis (platelet count = 716 × 10⁹/L). The results of other biochemical investigations, including assessments of renal function, liver function, blood glucose levels and the thyroid profile, were normal. Bronchoscopy revealed no evidence of infection, haemorrhage or malignancy. Viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C were negative. Routine microscopy of urine revealed proteinuria (3+) and red blood cell casts. Accordingly, 24-hour urinary protein was measured, giving a result of 5.3 g/day. On further testing, rheumatoid factor and antinuclear factor were negative. However, c-ANCA was positive 54 AU/mL (anti-proteinase-3), p-ANCA was weakly positive 27 AU/mL (myeloperoxidase antibody) and anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane (BGM) was negative. Kidney biopsy revealed features suggestive of pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis.

### A patient with lobular capillary hemangioma originating from the inferior turbinate following cauterization with silver nitrate [^1e6e23b0]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Lobular capillary hemangiomas usually affect the skin and mucous membranes of the oral cavity (gingiva, lips, tongue, and buccal mucosa); however, the nasal cavity is frequently indicated as an unusual site of origin. Lobular capillary hemangiomas is a relatively common benign neovascularization, characterized by the hyperplasia of capillaries arranged in microscopically distinct lobular structures. Although the exact cause of LCH in the nasal cavity has not been elucidated, trauma, caused by factors such as intranasal packing and habitual nose-picking, has been reported as one of the causes. In addition, 2 cases of LCH caused by submucosal resection with powered instrumentation to the IT have been reported, suggesting that various types of traumas to the nasal mucosa can cause LCH. In our patient, LCH formation developed after cauterization with silver nitrate, which is a widely available and routinely used method to stop epistaxis. Silver nitrate acts as a strong oxidizing agent, and several side effects associated with silver nitrate cauterization have been reported, including failure/recurrent epistaxis, pain, and more rarely, septal perforation, crusting, adhesions, and discoloration of the nasal mucosa. This technique is commonly used for anterior nasal epistaxis; however, it has also more recently been used in the posterior nasal cavity. In our case, 1 month after IT posterior cauterization, a tumor was observed from the silver nitrate-applied site, and since no trauma such as gauze packing was performed during that time, this treatment was thought to be the cause of tumor development.

### Outcomes of septal perforation repair with concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery [^57d1eefa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study reviews a cohort of patients in whom septal perforation repair was performed concurrently with endoscopic sinus surgery. We present an endonasal perforation repair technique using bilateral mucosal flaps with an autogenous interposition graft. Intraoperative and postoperative management of the combined surgical patient is discussed and perforation closure outcomes are reported.

Study Design

Case series.

Setting

Tertiary care center.

Methods

In this institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review, adult patients who underwent concurrent bilateral mucosal flap septal perforation repair and endoscopic sinus surgery from March 1992 to March 2020 were identified. Data on demographics, clinical presentations, perforation size, surgical techniques, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed for patients with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up.

Results

Fifty-six patients met study inclusion criteria. Nasal obstruction/congestion was the most frequent symptom reported (80.4%), followed by crusting and epistaxis. Mean perforation size measured at the time of surgery was 14.7 (range, 3–41) mm in length by 9.3 (range, 2–23) mm in height. Temporalis fascia was the most frequent (57.9%) interposition graft material used. Complete perforation closure at the time of the last follow-up was noted in 51 (91.1%) patients. Only 1 failure was noted in the last 48 attempted repairs.

Conclusion

Patients with a perforated septum may have coexistent chronic sinusitis. The feasibility of attempting concurrent sinus surgery and perforation repair has been questioned. Our review demonstrates a high perforation closure rate when a bilateral mucosal flap procedure is performed after sinus surgery is performed at the same setting.

IDSA/ASTMH leishmaniasis guidelines — New World mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) specimen collection and diagnostic considerations — The initial and most prominent mucosal manifestations typically are nasal (eg, chronic unexplained congestion/secretions), and clinical signs may include erythema, edema, hyperemia, infiltration, nodules, erosion, ulceration, and tissue destruction (eg, perforation of the nasal septum) (fact, no grade). Mucosal areas that have macroscopic abnormalities are recommended for specimen collection; biopsy specimens, obtained by an otolaryngologist, are useful for confirming the diagnosis by molecular and traditional methods and for excluding other etiologies (strong, low). However, obtaining mucosal specimens for Leishmania testing — even via relatively noninvasive means (eg, via nasal swab or cytologic brush) — typically is not recommended for persons who do not have any macroscopic mucosal abnormalities, and detecting the parasite DNA in naso-oropharyngeal mucosa does not suffice to diagnose ML. Investigational testing for the presence of Leishmania RNA virus is not readily available and, to date, has not been found useful for identifying persons who may have or be at risk for ML.

### The utility of enlarging symptomatic nasal septal perforations [^59597b9d]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Nasal septal perforations cause a subset of patients to suffer with significant impairments in quality of life. While smaller perforations can often be surgically repaired, perforations exceeding 2 cm are challenging to close. These repairs are highly technical, and there is a lack of consensus regarding the most effective means to do so. The authors performed a retrospective chart review of patients with perforation enlargements and have found that, in select patients, enlarging the septal perforation's edge posterior to the head of the middle turbinates has proven effective in relieving symptoms.

### Pearls&Oy-sters: frontal lobe syndrome secondary to cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions [^a5e263df]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions (CIMDL) are a rare complication of chronic intranasal cocaine use involving the centrofacial mucosal structures, often with nasal septum perforation and, in severe cases, involvement of neurocranial structures. Patients present with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, facial pain, nasal ulcerative lesions with crusting, and septal and palate perforation causing dysphagia and nasal reflux. CNS involvement is uncommon. We report a 47-year-old man with a history of nasal cocaine use who developed a subacute frontal syndrome secondary to cribriform plate destruction complicated by bilateral frontal lobe empyema and abscesses and extensive white matter involvement. The frequent presence of serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in CIMDL makes this uncommon presentation challenging to differentiate from localized granulomatosis with polyangiitis. While ANCA antibodies may play a role in CIMDL, immunosuppression is not indicated and may lead to iatrogenesis.CIMDL should be considered in patients with isolated frontal lobe syndrome. Eliciting a history of cocaine use and obtaining toxicologic studies are essential in the diagnosis of CIMDL.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^eb97cfb5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — diagnostic symptoms and phenotypes indicates that the diagnosis of rhinitis is suggested by the presence of 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea (anterior and posterior), sneezing, and itching; rhinitis can be classified by pathogenic mechanisms as allergic or nonallergic, some forms of nonallergic rhinitis such as vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) or atrophic rhinitis may not be associated with inflammation of the nasal mucosa, and recognition of whether a patient has AR or NAR or another mimicking condition is important because management will differ; conditions with overlapping symptoms include rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, ciliary dyskinesia syndrome, and structural/mechanical factors such as congenital anomalies, deviated septum, and pharyngeal reflux.

### A 52-year-old man with a chronic nasal wound [^672a08d9]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 52-year-old man who sought evaluation for a chronic nasal lesion that had eroded into his nasal septum. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^5230069f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric nasal foreign body — epistaxis and complications: Nasal foreign bodies are a common issue in children, and delay in diagnosis is not uncommon; in a large case series, epistaxis was the presenting symptom in 7% of patients with a nasal foreign body, and bleeding was associated with the presence of a nasal foreign body or with removal of the foreign body in 30% of the cases. Delay in diagnosis can result in morbidity, including nasal infection, sinusitis, and nasal septal perforations or synechiae, and when the undetected foreign body is a disk battery, septal perforation can occur in as little as 3 hours. Nasal endoscopy may allow rapid and complete nasal examination to exclude foreign body not seen with anterior rhinoscopy.

Patient-reported symptoms and likely diagnosis — Allergic rhinitis (AR), nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), acute upper respiratory tract infection, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps, and CRS with nasal polyps — are contrasted by frequency descriptors. Rhinorrhea/sniffing in AR is described as very common with clear watery discharge, whereas NAR is common but less than AR overall; in acute infection it is common and may be clear to purulent and watery to mucoid with crusts; and in CRS (with or without nasal polyps) it is common and clear to mucoid. Ocular pruritus/watery discharge/red eyes is very common in AR but uncommon in NAR and acute infection and very uncommon in CRS. Nasal congestion or blocked nose/mouth breathing is very common and persistent in AR and very common, chronic, almost universal in CRS with nasal polyps. Facial or sinus pain/pressure is very uncommon in AR yet common in acute infection and in CRS without nasal polyps. Postnasal drip is uncommon and persistent in AR but very common in NAR and common in acute infection and CRS without nasal polyps. Nasal/palate/ear itching is common in AR and very uncommon in NAR, acute infection, and CRS with or without nasal polyps. Snoring is uncommon and persistent in AR but common in the other listed conditions, and sleep disturbance/sleep apnea is common across all listed conditions. Frequencies are based on expert evidence and opinion and the table was developed based predominantly on expert opinion.

### Clinical features of childhood granulomatosis with polyangiitis (wegener's granulomatosis) [^4308eedb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

The PRINTO database contains data on 1398 patients with childhood vasculitides, with age at diagnosis ≤ 18 years, vasculitis diagnosis after year 2000, as previously described. The database includes demographic data, clinical diagnosis ascertained by the treating physician and a comprehensive list of 70 signs/symptoms (predominantly categorical variables) in 12 broad organ-system categories, laboratory parameters, physician global assessment of disease activity on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS), biopsy findings and imaging reports. Data have been collected both retrospectively and prospectively, before or at the time of diagnosis and at least 3 months later via standardized web-based case report forms.

For the purposes of this analysis, we extracted all patients fulfilling the c-GPA/WG EULAR/PRINTO/PRES classification criteria. Patients with co-morbidities were excluded from the study. In brief, a patient is classified as childhood GPA/WG if at least three of the six following criteria are present: 1) histopathology (granulomatous inflammation); 2) upper airway involvement (nasal discharge or epistaxis/crusts/granulomata, nasal septum perforation or saddle nose deformity, sinus inflammation); 3) laryngo-tracheo-bronchial involvement; 4) pulmonary involvement by chest X-ray or CT; 5) ANCA positivity; 6) renal involvement.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Gaslini Hospital (Genoa, Italy) and by the ethics committees of all remaining participating centres and informed consent was obtained from parent(s) as required by the national law in each participating country.

Comparison with literature data (children and adults)

A PubMed search was used to retrieve studies, which included patients with GPA/WG (both children and adults), and included both prospective and retrospective cases describing the clinical picture of at least 50 patients. Search terms were "(((Granulomatosis AND (Wegener OR Wegener's OR polyangiitis)) OR (necrotizing AND vasculitis))) AND (group OR cohort OR patients) AND (prospective OR prospectively OR retrospective OR retrospectively) AND demographic AND age AND clinical AND study" in English.

Statistical analysis

The quantitative demographic, clinical and laboratory data were reported as median (1 st and 3 rd quartile); the categorical data were reported as absolute frequencies and as percentage frequencies of measured subjects.

The data were entered in an Access XP database and analysed with Statistica 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc).

*Values are no. (%) patients except as indicated. BP, blood pressure; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; IQR, interquartile range. †These characteristics represent diagnosis and treatment provided for COVID-19 prior to mucormycosis events.

The median time from COVID-19 detection to mucormycosis symptom onset was 28 days (IQR 15–45 days). The most common symptoms at onset were face pain (74%), headache (54%), and nose pain (48%). Eschar over or in the nose was the symptom that prompted the patient to seek care in 133 (75%) cases; fever was present in 42 (24%) of those patients. In diagnostic endoscopy, 133 (75%) patients had black eschar surrounded by indurated and reddish areas (Figure 2, panel A); 22 (12%) had extradural abscess (Figure 2, panel B). Altered mental status was seen in 17 (10%) patients. Vital signs on admission for mucormycosis were relatively normal (Table 1).

Nasal cracking is the habit of applying pressure to one's nose until hearing a popping noise or feeling a release of pressure. Clinicians are mostly unaware of it as it is a lesser known habit that has been popularized on social media. Most often it is harmless, however sometimes it can lead to adverse consequences such as pain, bruising, bleeding, and/or breathing problems. In this case study, a patient is evaluated and treated for nasal cracking that led to a septal hematoma.

### Congenital and acquired lesions of the nasal septum: a practical guide for differential diagnosis [^68598538]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Many different types of lesions may involve the nasal septum, and some can destroy it. Congenital nasal septal anomalies are rare and tend to have fairly typical imaging features, which, when considered alongside the imaging appearance of the normal anatomy, help determine the correct diagnosis in most instances. By contrast, many acquired lesions have nonspecific imaging features, and their diagnosis therefore must be based also on the patient's age and the histologic findings. Acquired nasal septal abnormalities may be caused by trauma, infection, toxicity, inflammation, or tumors. Traumatic lesions may result from surgery or from repetitive behaviors such as rhinotillexomania. Frequent use of decongestants and cocaine also may erode the nasal septum. Bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi may cause infections of the nasal septum, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Inflammatory diseases that may affect the nasal septum include sarcoidosis, reparative granuloma, and Wegener granulomatosis. Last, the tumors that may arise in the nasal septum or may involve it secondarily include carcinomas, Pindborg tumor, sarcoma, angiofibroma, hemangioma, neuroendocrine tumor, and schwannoma.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

What are the possible side effects of OMNARIS Nasal Spray?

OMNARIS Nasal Spray may cause serious side effects, including:

Nasal Problems. Symptoms of nasal problems may include:
Nose bleeds.
Crusting in the nose.
Sores (ulcers) in the nose.
Hole in the cartilage of the nose (nasal septal perforation). A whistling sound when you breathe may be a symptom of nasal septum perforation.
Thrush (candida), a fungal infection in your nose and throat. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any redness or white colored patches in your nose or mouth.
Slow wound healing. You should not use OMNARIS Nasal Spray until your nose has healed if you have a sore in your nose, have had surgery on your nose, or if your nose has been injured.
Eye problems, including glaucoma and cataracts. You should have regular eye exams while you use OMNARIS Nasal Spray.
Serious allergic reactions. Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical care if you get any of the following signs of a serious allergic reaction:
rash
hives
swelling of your face, mouth, and tongue
breathing problems
low blood pressure
Weakened immune system and increased chance of getting infections (immunosuppression). Taking medicines that weaken your immune system makes you more likely to get infections and can make certain infections worse. These infections may include tuberculosis (TB), herpes simplex infections of the eyes (ocular herpes simplex infections), and infections caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and parasites. You should avoid contact with people who have a contagious disease such as chickenpox or measles while using OMNARIS Nasal Spray. If you come in contact with someone who has chickenpox or measles, call your healthcare provider right away. Symptoms of an infection may include:
fever
pain
aches
chills
feeling tired
nausea
vomiting
Reduced adrenal function (adrenal insufficiency). Adrenal insufficiency happens when your adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones. This can happen when you stop taking oral corticosteroid medicines (such as prednisone) and start taking medicine containing a steroid inhaled into the lungs or for use in the nose. Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency may include:
Tiredness
Weakness
Nausea and vomiting
Low blood pressure
Slowed growth in children. A child taking OMNARIS Nasal Spray should have their growth checked regularly.

### Ozena in immigrants of differing backgrounds [^a1ff2037]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Ozena, or atrophic rhinitis, is a chronic nasal process seen in Africa, India, and the Middle East. It is marked by the triad of fetid nasal discharge, crusting, and atrophy, and is often associated with Klebsiella infection. We present cases of ozena with nasal Klebsiella in three unrelated patients, including two east African children and one Saudi adult. All three patients grew Klebsiella species in culture and required prolonged treatment with multiple methodologies, including antibiotics, saline rinses, and surgical debridement. They differed greatly in time from presentation to diagnosis, and demonstrated various stages of the disease process. Ozena is rarely seen in the United States, and when it is seen, it is often misdiagnosed. Lack of prompt, adequate treatment can lead to long-term sequelae such as obliteration of nasal architecture, anosmia, sinus and skull base destruction, and social disenfranchisement due to the extreme foul smell of the nasal discharge. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for primary atrophic rhinitis when presented with its classic symptoms. Culture-directed and prolonged therapy with appropriate follow-up is a necessary component of a successful treatment plan.

### Cross-cultural adaptation and clinical application of the Russian version of SEPEQoL questionnaire [^e239a975]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Nasal septal perforation (NSP) significantly impacts quality of life (QoL), but no validated Russian-language instrument existed for comprehensive symptom assessment. This study aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the SEPEQoL questionnaire for Russian-speaking populations.

Methods

Following ISPOR guidelines, the SEPEQoL was translated into Russian and administered to 30 NSP patients and 30 matched controls. Psychometric properties were evaluated, including internal consistency (Cronbach's α), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]), and discriminant validity. Surgical outcomes were assessed using validated SEPEQoL in patients undergoing endoscopic septal perforation repair with bilateral mucosal flaps and interposition cartilaginous graft.

Results

The Russian SEPEQoL demonstrated excellent reliability (α = 0.985, ICC = 0.98) and strong discriminant validity (21.6 ± 6.4 vs. 4.4 ± 3.9 in controls, p < 0.01). Postoperative scores improved dramatically (Δ = 15.4 points, d = 2.23, p < 0.001), with 100% resolution of whistling (δ = 0.95) and 94% improvement in crusting. Esthetic concerns showed minimal change (δ = 0.08, p = 0.32), underscoring the need for adjunct rhinoplasty in select cases. Patient age, gender, and perforation size did not impact outcomes.

Conclusion

The Russian SEPEQoL is a valid, reliable tool that captures both functional and esthetic outcomes of NSP repair. Its implementation facilitates standardized outcome assessment and highlights persistent challenges in managing external nasal deformities.

### Testosterone (Natesto) [^bab6e529]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Nasal Adverse Reactions and Limited Long-Term Information on Nasal Safety

Nasal adverse reactions, including nasopharyngitis, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, nasal discomfort and nasal scabbing, were reported in the clinical trial experience with Natesto. All nasal adverse reactions except one (a single case of upper respiratory infection) were reported as mild or moderate in severity; however, long-term clinical trial data on nasal safety is available in a limited number of subjects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should be instructed to report any nasal symptoms or signs to their health care professional. In that circumstance, health care professionals should determine whether further evaluation (e.g., otorhinolaryngology consultation) or discontinuation of Natesto is appropriate.

5.2 Use in Patients with Chronic Nasal Conditions and Alterations in Nasal Anatomy

Due to lack of clinical data on the safety or efficacy, Natesto is not recommended for use in the following patients:

History of nasal disorders;
History of nasal or sinus surgery;
History of nasal fracture within the previous 6 months or nasal fracture that caused a deviated anterior nasal septum;
Mucosal inflammatory disorders (e.g. Sjogren's syndrome); and
Sinus disease.

5.3 Polycythemia

Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require discontinuation of Natesto. Check hematocrit prior to initiating testosterone treatment. It would be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting testosterone treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable level. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^1d9fc0d9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — selected conditions that may mimic rhinitis identify nasal septal deviation (NSD), nasal valve collapse, and turbinate hypertrophy as common anatomic causes of nasal congestion. NSD is described as a common cause of fixed nasal obstruction that may cause bilateral or unilateral congestion, though the importance and effectiveness of septoplasty for NSD does not appear to be universally accepted. The internal nasal valve is the narrowest portion of the nasal cavity and is responsible for more than two-thirds of nasal airflow resistance; nasal valve collapse refers to weakness or further narrowing that can be perceived as congestion, and examination should note valve patency and any alar collapse, with improvement on the Cottle maneuver suggesting nasal valve pathology. Turbinate hypertrophy can account for severe unilateral or bilateral obstruction; while some causes respond to medical therapy, a surgical approach may be required in others, and treatment in refractory cases can include turbinate reduction, which is often performed at the time of septoplasty for unilateral NSD.

IDSA/ASTMH cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) monitoring and consequences — Potential consequences of inadequate treatment include poor cosmetic outcome due to scarring or superinfection, persistence of a chronic wound(s), and, with some Leishmania species, destructive and disfiguring mucosal leishmaniasis (ML); in immunocompromised persons, cutaneous, mucosal, and visceral dissemination may occur (fact, no grade). Persons with CL should be actively monitored by clinical appearance, including careful nasal and oropharyngeal examination periodically up to 1 year, or at least 2 years if at increased risk for ML, and educated to seek medical attention anytime signs or symptoms of relapse or ML appear (strong, low). Symptoms such as chronic nasal stuffiness, epistaxis, hoarseness, or findings such as septal perforation in anyone with a prior or current diagnosis of CL or a scar consistent with prior CL should prompt evaluation for ML, including fiber-optic examination of the affected area if relevant (strong, moderate).

### Small nasal defects [^6badf99e]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The nose occupies an important feature of a person's central face. The size, shape, and proportions of the various characteristics of the face provide a visual basis suggesting the character of the person. Scars, asymmetries, and any abnormalities of the central face are easily recognizable and noted by even a casual observer. Over the centuries, therefore, much attention has been paid to reconstruction of facial and nasal abnormalities of both acquired and congenital etiologies. The purpose of this article is to address the reconstruction of smaller defects of the nose, encompassing surface areas of 1.5 to 2 centimeters.

### What are the primary clinical symptoms of rhinitis and what causes them? [^baa5c28b]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The nose has a limited repertoire of responses regardless of the triggers. These responses primarily serve as a protective mechanism for the lower respiratory tract. Although the nasal reactions to pollens, particles, and pollution may have a beneficial effect for the lower airway, they create symptoms in some individuals that lead to significant morbidity. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis extend far beyond the nose, and the morbidity associated with rhinitis is significant. The nasal symptoms of rhinitis and their causes are the focus of this review.

### Case studies in the surgical management of nasal airway obstruction [^532121a3]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Nasal obstruction is one of the most common complaints evaluated by the otolaryngologist. The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from benign reversible causes to life-threatening diseases. In addition, patients may suffer from a combination of etiologies, further confusing the diagnosis. Surgical management is directed at the underlying origin of obstruction. The clinician therefore must use a careful history and physical examination as well as appropriate sinonasal imaging in accurately identifying the causes of nasal obstruction. To further illustrate these principles, we present two interesting cases of patients presenting with nasal obstruction.

### Midline nasal and hard palate destruction in cocaine abusers and cocaine's role in rhinologic practice [^b6bad829]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Intranasal cocaine abuse can lead to destruction of the palate and perforation of the nasal septum. The pathophysiology of cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions is multifactorial and includes local ischemia secondary to vasoconstriction, chemical irritation from adulterants put in "cut" cocaine, and infection secondary to trauma, impaired mucociliary transport, and decreased humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Cocaine abuse should be suspected in patients with a palatal or septal perforation of unknown etiology.

### Exploring the influence of nasal morbidity on quality of life following endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery: a retrospective cohort study of 95 patients [^2e80c7f5]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic approaches to nasal sinus-centred pathology and the paramedian floor of the anterior fossa (n = 9, including anterior fossa encephalocele and sinonasal tumours)

9/9 (100%) felt that the after-effects of surgery were acceptable, given the underlying reason and outcome of surgery. Free text responses included: " nose symptoms now are not as bad as before ". 9/9 (100%) reported no change or improvement in olfaction following surgery. Figure 4 shows the impact of surgery on nasal symptoms of crusting, discharge, pain, obstruction, headache, whistling, and capacity to achieve rest. In this cohort, these symptoms were mild at worst and often absent. For 3/9 patients (33%), the impact on their nose caused a mild degree of inconvenience.

Surgery for olfactory neuroblastoma (n = 3) – all underwent combined endonasal and transcranial subfrontal approach

3/3 (100%) felt that the after-effects of surgery were acceptable, given the underlying reason and outcome of surgery. Free text responses included: nasal side effects were a " small price to pay " and nasal side effects were " absolutely acceptable ". This pathology directly threatens olfaction, and all three cases were treated by combined endonasal and transcranial sub-frontal approaches. All three patients had subjectively severely worse olfaction following treatment. Figure 5 shows the impact of surgery on nasal symptoms of crusting, discharge, pain, obstruction, headache, whistling, and capacity to achieve rest. Nasal obstruction was a severe problem whilst nasal crusting and nasal discharge were moderately severe. One patient reports severe inconvenience because of nasal morbidity.

### Mini endoscopic septoplasty for high localized nasal septum deviation: surgical technique, outcomes, and comparison with regular septoplasty [^30973cdc]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Nasal septal deviation is a common condition that often results in symptoms such as nasal obstruction, epistaxis, headache, and sinusitis. – The introduction of nasal endoscopy has led to an increased adoption of endoscopic septoplasty, which includes various techniques for addressing nasal septal deviations.–

This study focuses on a specific issue within the context of nasal septal deviations: high localized septal deviation in front of the middle turbinate. Although this type of deviation typically lacks common symptoms, such as nasal obstruction or sinusitis, it poses unique challenges in the context of nasal sinus surgery. High localized deviations can significantly impact the surgical approach and postoperative debridement, potentially affecting the prognosis of sinus lesions. Interestingly, these deviations often escape detection in preoperative assessments like sinus computed tomography scans and anterior nasoscope examinations and are only revealed during endoscopic evaluation following nasal cavity contraction during the procedure.

The decision of whether to correct these highly localized septal deviations presents a clinical dilemma in sinus procedures. Opting for regular septoplasty can be more invasive and time-consuming while neglecting the deviation can have implications for the surgical approach and postoperative care. Surprisingly, limited research is available addressing the management of this specific type of septal deviation.

Our medical center has adopted a novel approach to address high localized septal deviations, particularly in patients with chronic sinusitis and sinus fungus ball requiring surgical intervention. This approach involves mini endoscopic septoplasty before sinus surgery. The main goals of this study are to describe the indications, surgical techniques, and outcomes associated with mini endoscopic septoplasty in this specific context.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^3aa947ba]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Rhinoplasty guideline terminology — Table 1 defines key terms used in this guideline, including rhinoplasty, aesthetic, cosmetic, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nasal cycle, anterior rhinoscopy, and nasal packing. Rhinoplasty is described as a surgical procedure that alters the shape or appearance of the nose while preserving or enhancing the nasal airway, and the primary reason for surgery can be aesthetic, functional, or both and may include adjunctive procedures on the septum, turbinates, or paranasal sinuses. Aesthetic is defined as concerned with beauty or the appreciation of beauty, while cosmetic relates to treatment intended to restore or improve appearance. BDD is a psychiatric disorder consisting of distressing or impairing preoccupation with nonexistent or slight defects in one's appearance. Rhinitis is inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose frequently caused by infection or allergic reaction. OSA is defined by a sleep disorder involving at least 5 obstructive respiratory events per hour. The nasal cycle is the often unnoticed alternating partial congestion and decongestion of the nasal cavities in humans and other animals. Anterior rhinoscopy refers to examination of the anterior part of the nose, including the inferior turbinate, the septum, and the nasal valves. Nasal packing is material placed inside the nose to promote hemostasis, structural support, and reduction of scar formation, with traditional examples including ribbon gauze, expandable nonbiodegradable pads, and nonstick dressing material, and Silastic stents or nasal splints and custom-cut sheeting are not considered packing.

### Advancements in the application of artificial materials in nasal surgery [^03254e89]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical Repair of the Nasal Septum

Patients with nasal septum perforation often experience symptoms such as nasal dryness, congestion, and recurrent rhinorrhea. Those with anterior septal perforations may also hear a whistling sound during breathing, which can significantly impact their quality of life. Therefore, once a septal perforation is identified, prompt surgical intervention is necessary. In patients with a deviated septum or with a spur of nasal septum, separating the mucosa on both sides of the septum may result in mucosal perforation. Consequently, any septal perforation must be addressed and repaired simultaneously. While autologous tissue remains the preferred choice for septal repair, artificial materials are increasingly used due to the limited availability of suitable cartilage. Common artificial materials for septal repair include polydioxanone (PDS), polycaprolactone (PCL), titanium, and acellular dermal matrix (ADM).

### Unilateral inner mucoperichondrium flap from upper lateral cartilage and inferior mucosal advancement flap technique for repair of septal perforations [^7c4762c2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Many surgical technique have been described for repair of nasal septal perforations with different success rates. This study aimed to describe authors' surgical technique and discuss its results as well as those reported in the literature.

Methods

Nineteen patients with nasal septal perforation were operated on between March 2009 and February 2015 at Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical Faculty. The technique described in this article, closure of the perforation with unilateral upper lateral cartilage inner mucoperichondrial flap and inferior meatal advancement flap is an alternative surgical technique.

Results

Nineteen patients with symptomatic nasal septal perforation were operated with this technique. All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon. Neither intraoperative nor postoperative major complications were observed in any patients. Preoperative and postoperative symptom scores for nasal obstruction, epistaxis, nasal discharge, crusting, whistling, snoring, and olfactory loss as well as overall discomfort levels were compared using a visual analog scale. Complete closure of the perforation was achieved in 18 patients (95%).

Conclusions

Small and large perforations may be reliably closed with this technique. Also, this technique can be easily applied via closed or external approach.

### Clinical utility of the inferior turbinate flaps in the reconstruction of the nasal septum and skull base [^9728e4aa]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The inferior turbinate flaps (ITFs) include the anterior pedicle inferior turbinate flap (APITF) and the posterior pedicle inferior turbinate flap (PPITF). The APITF has been used for the repair of the septal perforation, and the PPITF has been used for the reconstruction of the skull base. Because of the technical difficulties of endoscopic preparation of the ITF, clinical studies on endoscopic management with the ITFs have been sporadic.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 11 patients who underwent endoscopic reconstruction with the ITFs at our institutions from 2006 to 2010. The APITF had been used for the repair of the septal perforation and reconstruction of mucosal defect following excision of a septal tumor, and the PPITF had been used for the reconstruction of the skull base. Clinical data included characteristics of septal perforation and skull base defect, including defect size, types of the ITFs, repair techniques, and complications.

Results

Pathology included septal perforation (n = 4), pleomorphic adenoma (n = 2), ethmoid teratocarcinosarcoma (n = 1), and pituitary adenoma (n = 4). The 6 septal lesions were reconstructed with the APITF. The size of the septal mucosal defects ranged from 5 to 18 mm, and the success rate of APITF septal defect repair was 83.3% (5/6 patients). A patient with a tiny residual septal perforation was symptom-free. There was no full-thickness necrosis of the flap. Postoperatively, there was no excessive crusting or empty nose syndrome. The 5 skull base defects following endoscopic skull base surgery were repaired with the PPITF, where the nasoseptal flap was not available because of surgical loss of the nasal septum, operative injury to the posterior nasoseptal artery, or previous use of the nasoseptal flap. The sites of skull base reconstruction included the sellar floor (n = 3), clivus (n = 1), and posterior ethmoid (n = 1). Flap necrosis was noted in 2 patients who underwent surgery in the early period of this series, and the success rate of the PPITF was 60%. However, after acquisition of surgical skills, improved viability of the flap became evident.

Conclusions

Inferior turbinate flaps could be a feasible alternative in the repair of the nasal septum and skull base. Although endoscopic application of ITFs requires a considerable learning curve, increased familiarity with these flaps would improve flap survival and treatment outcome of reconstruction of the nasal septum and skull base.
