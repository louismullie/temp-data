## Question

Is ceftriaxone first line treatment for enterobacter

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ceftriaxone is first-line treatment for Enterobacter infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism-specific resistance risks, especially AmpC β-lactamase induction and derepression. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about third-generation cephalosporins for Enterobacter spp. Next, I will examine the clinical evidence base, including randomized trials and observational data. After that, I need to consider infection site and severity, because recommendations differ for uncomplicated cystitis versus invasive disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note any exceptions where ceftriaxone might still be acceptable.

> Let me first confirm the organism-level risk. Enterobacter species, particularly the Enterobacter cloacae complex and Klebsiella aerogenes, are classic moderate-risk organisms for clinically significant AmpC β-lactamase production; this means they can appear initially susceptible to ceftriaxone but rapidly develop resistance via derepression during therapy, undermining efficacy and risking clinical failure [^111Fe8gu] [^112VtasZ] [^114D33hF].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before drawing conclusions. Multiple high-credibility IDSA guidance documents advise against using ceftriaxone (and other third-generation cephalosporins) for invasive infections caused by Enterobacter spp. because of the risk of on-therapy resistance emergence; instead, they recommend cefepime or a carbapenem as preferred agents, with cefepime favored over ceftriaxone even when initial susceptibility is reported [^115LKHhC] [^111YfRgF] [^112VtasZ].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence. The MERINO randomized trial demonstrated higher 30-day mortality with piperacillin-tazobactam versus meropenem for ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E. coli/Klebsiella bacteremia, reinforcing that third-generation cephalosporin–resistant Enterobacterales infections warrant carbapenem therapy rather than relying on agents vulnerable to ESBL/AmpC hydrolysis. Although MERINO did not isolate Enterobacter specifically, the mechanistic and clinical implications align with avoiding ceftriaxone in moderate-risk AmpC producers like Enterobacter [^112BoJV8] [^115ee7JW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all scenarios. I need to check the infection site and severity. For uncomplicated cystitis due to Enterobacter that tests susceptible, ceftriaxone may be reasonable given high urinary concentrations and the limited bacterial burden, but even there, guidelines frame this as acceptable rather than preferred, and emphasize obtaining susceptibilities and reassessing if there is no prompt clinical response [^111YfRgF] [^112VtasZ].

> Let me consider practical alternatives and dosing nuances. For invasive Enterobacter infections, cefepime is suggested as first-line when active, with extended-infusion 2 g every 8 hours for MICs 4–8 µg/mL, and carbapenems are preferred when cefepime is inactive or in severe disease. For uncomplicated cystitis, nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are preferred if susceptible, with ceftriaxone reserved for intolerance or resistance to those options [^111YfRgF] [^1142eo3Y].

> I should confirm whether any major guidelines endorse ceftriaxone as first-line for Enterobacter outside of uncomplicated cystitis. I do not find IDSA or ESCMID recommendations supporting ceftriaxone as first-line for Enterobacter bacteremia, pneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, or other invasive syndromes; instead, they consistently recommend avoiding third-generation cephalosporins in moderate-risk AmpC producers and choosing cefepime or carbapenems based on susceptibility and severity [^115LKHhC] [^111YfRgF] [^111nXUVJ].

> But wait, what if the isolate is reported susceptible to ceftriaxone at the outset? Does that change the calculus? The IDSA guidance cautions that susceptibility can be misleading in Enterobacter because of inducible AmpC; thus, even with an initial "S", the risk of on-therapy resistance emergence remains, which is why they still recommend cefepime or carbapenems for invasive disease rather than ceftriaxone [^1142eo3Y] [^112VtasZ].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. No, ceftriaxone is not first-line treatment for Enterobacter infections outside of select cases of uncomplicated cystitis when no better options exist. For invasive Enterobacter infections, cefepime or a carbapenem is preferred based on susceptibility and severity, and ceftriaxone should generally be avoided due to the high risk of AmpC-mediated resistance emergence during therapy [^115LKHhC] [^111YfRgF] [^112VtasZ].

---

Ceftriaxone is **not first-line** for Enterobacter infections because of the high risk of inducible AmpC β-lactamase–mediated resistance emergence [^1142eo3Y] [^112VtasZ]. IDSA recommends **cefepime or carbapenems** as preferred therapy for invasive Enterobacter infections, with ceftriaxone reserved only for uncomplicated cystitis when susceptibility is confirmed [^115LKHhC] [^111YfRgF]. Using ceftriaxone for invasive Enterobacter risks treatment failure and resistance selection, so it should be avoided outside of narrow, susceptible cystitis cases [^112VtasZ].

---

## Microbiological considerations

Enterobacter species harbor **inducible AmpC β-lactamases**, which can be rapidly derepressed during therapy with third-generation cephalosporins (including ceftriaxone), leading to clinical failure and resistance emergence [^114D33hF] [^113a54tK]. This risk is well documented, with studies showing that approximately 20% of Enterobacter infections treated with ceftriaxone develop resistance during therapy [^112VtasZ].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Current IDSA guidance **strongly recommends against** using ceftriaxone for invasive Enterobacter infections, citing the risk of resistance emergence and clinical failure [^115LKHhC]. Instead, the following agents are recommended:

- **Cefepime**: Preferred agent due to its stability against AmpC β-lactamases and reliable clinical outcomes [^111YfRgF].
- **Carbapenems**: Meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are preferred for severe infections or when ESBL production is suspected [^115rp3Xo].
- **Piperacillin-tazobactam**: Not recommended for serious Enterobacter infections due to inferior clinical outcomes and higher rates of resistance emergence [^114sctJP].

---

## Exceptions: uncomplicated cystitis

Ceftriaxone may be considered for **uncomplicated cystitis** caused by Enterobacter species when susceptibility is confirmed, given the low bacterial burden and short duration of therapy. However, even in this scenario, alternative agents such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are preferred if susceptible [^1142eo3Y] [^115gXGo1].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks

Using ceftriaxone for invasive Enterobacter infections is associated with:

- **Increased risk of treatment failure**: Due to rapid emergence of resistance during therapy [^112VtasZ].
- **Higher mortality**: Observational studies have linked ceftriaxone use in Enterobacter infections to increased mortality compared to cefepime or carbapenems.
- **Resistance selection**: Facilitates the development of multidrug-resistant organisms, complicating future therapy [^111hDSLi].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended therapy** |
|-|-|
| Invasive Enterobacter infections (e.g. bacteremia, pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections) | - Cefepime <br/> - Or carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin) [^111YfRgF] [^115rp3Xo] |
| Uncomplicated cystitis caused by Enterobacter | - Nitrofurantoin <br/> - Or TMP-SMX if susceptible <br/> - Ceftriaxone only if susceptibility is confirmed and alternatives are unavailable [^1142eo3Y] [^115gXGo1] |
| Severe infections or suspected ESBL production | - Carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin) [^115rp3Xo] |

---

Ceftriaxone is **not first-line** for Enterobacter infections because of the high risk of inducible AmpC β-lactamase–mediated resistance. Cefepime or carbapenems are preferred for invasive disease, with ceftriaxone reserved only for confirmed-susceptible uncomplicated cystitis when no better options exist [^115LKHhC] [^111YfRgF].

Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance — ceftriaxone for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production states: "Ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime or ceftazidime) is not suggested for the treatment of invasive infections" caused by E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes, and C. freundii, but "Ceftriaxone is reasonable for uncomplicated cystitis… when susceptibility is demonstrated". The rationale notes uncertainty and diagnostic limits: "Clinical reports differ on how frequently resistance to ceftriaxone emerges", "there are no CLSI-endorsed approaches for AmpC detection in clinical isolates", and "these organisms may display ceftriaxone resistance for other reasons (eg, ESBL production)".

Purpose Of Review

This article aims to give a state-of-the-art assessment of treatment options for bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, especially those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. In particular, this review assesses whether current data support 'carbapenem-sparing options' for treatment of these serious infections.

Recent Findings

The MERINO trial refuted earlier observational studies some of which showed equivalence in outcomes between beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and carbapenems for treatment of bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. Although numerous factors influence mortality following bloodstream infection, the variability in piperacillin/tazobactam MICs observed in the MERINO trial make this a less secure option than meropenem. However, the search for carbapenem-sparing options continues with four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in progress and a number of other options in clinical development.

Summary

Hard outcomes from RCTs are still needed before intravenous carbapenems can be displaced as the treatment of choice for ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production — third-generation cephalosporins and ceftriaxone use: Available data suggest that the emergence of resistance after ceftriaxone exposure occurs in approximately 20% of infections caused by E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii, and the panel suggests generally avoiding third-generation cephalosporins when treating infections caused by these organisms. Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to avoid using ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime or ceftazidime) for the treatment of invasive infections caused by organisms at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production (E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes, and C. freundii). Consider administering ceftriaxone for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis caused by these organisms when susceptibility is demonstrated.

### Machine learning and clinician predictions of antibiotic resistance in enterobacterales bloodstream infections [^11148FZ2]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

The challenging nature of antibiotic selection meant clinician's choice of beta-lactam resulted in 30% of patients being under-treated, 44% being over-treated and only 26% being optimally-treated. Several modelling approaches were able to improve on this. The main potential application of our models is helping select which antibiotics to start initially, i.e. using the models that do not use species information. Using these models, if total antibiotic use was kept similar, but redistributed, an additional 5% of patients received active treatment, 75% overall, and optimal treatment rose to 33%. Alternatively, if we matched antibiotic use to rates of antibiotic susceptibility and allowed for some over-prescribing of broader-spectrum agents to offset imperfect model performance, then 79% of patients could be actively treated, 9% more than by clinicians, while still only over-treating 45% (similar to clinicians). A simpler approach of switching all first-line antibiotics to ceftriaxone increased active treatment to 89% but caused 65% to be over-treated; the latter could be reduced to 59% if a model rather than a guideline change was used. Additionally, as our models perform better once a species is identified, they could also potentially be used to screen at this timepoint for patients with a high probability of having been started on inactive empirical therapy.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering cefepime instead of ceftriaxone as an alternative option for infections caused by less commonly recovered organisms (such as H. alvei, C. youngae, Yersinia enterocolitica), S. marcescens, Morganella morgannii, or Providencia sepcies with a high bacterial burden and limited source control (such as endocarditis, CNS infections), even if the organism tests susceptible to ceftriaxone.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

Strategy 3 – fixing overtreatment rates, aiming for more active treatment

If prediction thresholds were set by matching clinician over-treatment rates, using the machine learning algorithm 79% of patients would have received an active beta-lactam and 34% would have been optimally-treated, 45% over-treated, and 21% under-treated. This performance was predominantly achieved by moving a subset of patients treated by clinicians with co-amoxiclav to receive ceftriaxone, with fewer given piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem to offset this.

Switching to ceftriaxone as first-line treatment and strategy 4

We also compared performance to a simpler intervention, changing first-line treatment to ceftriaxone, i.e. switching all patients receiving amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav to ceftriaxone. This would reduce the number of under-treated patients to 11%, but also cause 65% to be over-treated. Setting our models to achieve the same level of active treatment allowed over-treatment to be reduced to 59%.

### Efficacy and safety of a structured de-escalation from antipseudomonal β-lactams in bloodstream infections due to enterobacterales (SIMPLIFY): an open-label, multicentre, randomised trial [^1116qJJD]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

De-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics is considered an important measure to reduce the selective pressure of antibiotics, but a scarcity of adequate evidence is a barrier to its implementation. We aimed to determine whether de-escalation from an antipseudomonal β-lactam to a narrower-spectrum drug was non-inferior to continuing the antipseudomonal drug in patients with Enterobacterales bacteraemia.

Methods

An open-label, pragmatic, randomised trial was performed in 21 Spanish hospitals. Patients with bacteraemia caused by Enterobacterales susceptible to one of the de-escalation options and treated empirically with an antipseudomonal β-lactam were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1; stratified by urinary source) to de-escalate to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (urinary tract infections only), cefuroxime, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, or ertapenem in that order according to susceptibility (de-escalation group), or to continue with the empiric antipseudomonal β-lactam (control group). Oral switching was allowed in both groups. The primary outcome was clinical cure 3–5 days after end of treatment in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, formed of patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Safety was assessed in all participants. Non-inferiority was declared when the lower bound of the 95% CI of the absolute difference in cure rate was above the -10% non-inferiority margin. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2015-004219-19) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02795949) and is complete.

Findings

2030 patients were screened between Oct 5, 2016, and Jan 23, 2020, of whom 171 were randomly assigned to the de-escalation group and 173 to the control group. 164 (50%) patients in the de-escalation group and 167 (50%) in the control group were included in the mITT population. 148 (90%) patients in the de-escalation group and 148 (89%) in the control group had clinical cure (risk difference 1.6 percentage points, 95% CI -5.0 to 8.2). The number of adverse events reported was 219 in the de-escalation group and 175 in the control group, of these, 53 (24%) in the de-escalation group and 56 (32%) in the control group were considered severe. Seven (5%) of 164 patients in the de-escalation group and nine (6%) of 167 patients in the control group died during the 60-day follow-up. There were no treatment-related deaths.

Interpretation

De-escalation from an antipseudomonal β-lactam in Enterobacterales bacteraemia following a predefined rule was non-inferior to continuing the empiric antipseudomonal drug. These results support de-escalation in this setting.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (ESCMID) guidelines for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (endorsed by European Society of Intensive Care Medicine) [^1174CB4h]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Scope

These ESCMID guidelines address the targeted antibiotic treatment of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (3GCephRE) and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, focusing on the effectiveness of individual antibiotics and on combination versus monotherapy.

Methods

An expert panel was convened by ESCMID. A systematic review was performed including randomized controlled trials and observational studies, examining different antibiotic treatment regimens for the targeted treatment of infections caused by the 3GCephRE, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Treatments were classified as head-to-head comparisons between individual antibiotics and between monotherapy and combination therapy regimens, including defined monotherapy and combination regimens only. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, preferably at 30 days and secondary outcomes included clinical failure, microbiological failure, development of resistance, relapse/recurrence, adverse events and length of hospital stay. The last search of all databases was conducted in December 2019, followed by a focused search for relevant studies up until ECCMID 2021. Data were summarized narratively. The certainty of the evidence for each comparison between antibiotics and between monotherapy and combination therapy regimens was classified by the GRADE recommendations. The strength of the recommendations for or against treatments was classified as strong or conditional (weak).

Recommendations

The guideline panel reviewed the evidence per pathogen, preferably per site of infection, critically appraising the existing studies. Many of the comparisons were addressed in small observational studies at high risk of bias only. Notably, there was very little evidence on the effects of the new, recently approved, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors on infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Most recommendations are based on very-low- and low-certainty evidence. A high value was placed on antibiotic stewardship considerations in all recommendations, searching for carbapenem-sparing options for 3GCephRE and limiting the recommendations of the new antibiotics for severe infections, as defined by the sepsis-3 criteria. Research needs are addressed.

Enterobacter infections during hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) — first-line and step-down therapy are as follows: Carbapenem therapy is also recommended for invasive Enterobacter spp and K aerogenes infections (B-III). Third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) should not be used to treat invasive Enterobacter infections (D-III). Cefepime may be just as effective as carbapenems and can serve as an alternative agent (B-III). Depending on susceptibility results, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are potential oral step-down therapies after clinical improvement for both ESBL-E and AmpC-producing Enterobacterales infections (B-III).

### Seven versus 14 days of antimicrobial therapy for severe multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections in intensive care unit patients (OPTIMISE): a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial [^1161R1ZK]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Bloodstream infections, pneumonia (with or without mechanical ventilation), or infections at any site (according to the criteria of the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency — ANVISA; supplementary material) accompanied sepsis or septic shock, were considered severe infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and interpretation were performed according to the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, unless otherwise indicated. MDR-GNB isolates were defined as Enterobacterales species, P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii with in vitro resistance to carbapenems, regardless of susceptibility to other antimicrobials; Enterobacterales species with in vitro resistance to both ceftriaxone and cefepime; P. aeruginosa with in vitro resistance to at least one of the following: ceftazidime, cefepime or carbapenems; or A. baumannii with in vitro susceptibility to carbapenems, but not susceptible to other beta-lactams, including ampicillin/sulbactam (if tested and interpreted according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute). If the microbiology laboratory did not carry out susceptibility testing for non-carbapenem beta-lactams and for ampicillin/sulbactam, the A. baumannii isolate was considered resistant to these antimicrobials. These MDR-GNB definitions encompass the bacteria listed by World Health Organization as critical priority antimicrobial resistance profile (i.e. carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales), with the addition of carbapenem-susceptible but other first-line beta-lactams-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii).

Comparison with clinical decision-making

To compare our models with clinical practice, we combined both test datasets and considered patients initially treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic. Beta-lactams were the most commonly used antibiotics in our institution and facilitated establishing a hierarchy of antibiotic choices. We included patients empirically treated with amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem (mostly meropenem; a small number receiving empirical ertapenem), in order of increasing spectrum of coverage. The most common adjunctive antibiotic in our setting was single-dose gentamicin; however, we excluded it from our main analysis considering only the beta-lactam given, as we have previously shown gentamicin does not rescue patients with beta-lactam (co-amoxiclav) resistance from associated increases in mortality in Escherichia coli bloodstream infection. We excluded from the clinical comparison neutropenic patients (as piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem would have been the only appropriate empirical treatments from our beta-lactam hierarchy), patients not started on antibiotics (as there was no clinician antibiotic choice to compare with), patients admitted to an ICU using a different prescribing system not included in the dataset, and blood cultures missing ≥ 1 susceptibility results for the beta-lactams listed above (further details in supplement). No patient allergy data were available.

To compare clinical practice and model predictions, we evaluated the number of patients who were i) optimally-treated, i.e. received the least broad-spectrum beta-lactam to which their blood culture isolate was sensitive, ii) under-treated, given a beta-lactam with resistance present, and iii) over-treated, given an active beta-lactam, but of broader spectrum than necessary. We also described the relative usage rates of each antibiotic.

We evaluated 4 strategies for applying our machine learning predictions (using models without species information), tuning the prediction thresholds using the training data to: 1) match total antibiotic use to total clinician antibiotic use, but potentially distributing it between patients more optimally, 2) match total use to population antibiotic susceptibility rates, 3) match rates of over-treatment by clinicians, while aiming to increase active treatment, and 4) to quantify how much our models could reduce over-treatment if the default antibiotic policy was switched from using co-amoxiclav to ceftriaxone first-line (details in Supplement). Thresholds were then applied in the combined test data and performance summarised.

Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (third-generation cephalosporin-resistant), ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend to consider offering step-down targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, quinolones, TMP/SMX, or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate in all third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales infections.

AmpC β-lactamase — organism risk stratification and AST-guided treatment decisions: For E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii recovered in clinical cultures (other than urine cultures in uncomplicated cystitis), the panel suggests generally avoiding ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ceftazidime even if initially susceptible; basal AmpC β-lactamase production renders these organisms intrinsically resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and first- and second-generation cephalosporins. In contrast, for S. marcescens, M. morganii, or Providencia spp., available data suggest clinically significant AmpC production occurs in less than 5% of these organisms, and when these are recovered from clinical cultures, the panel suggests selecting antibiotic treatment according to AST results. For less common pathogens with inducible chromosomal ampC (eg, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter youngae, Yersinia enterocolitica), it is reasonable to use AST to guide treatment (eg, ceftriaxone if susceptible), but when treating infections with a high bacterial burden and limited source control (eg, endocarditis, central nervous system infections), it is alternatively reasonable to consider cefepime instead of ceftriaxone even if ceftriaxone-susceptible; if an adequate clinical response is not observed after appropriate therapy and source control, clinicians should consider possible emergence of resistance.

### Effect of piperacillin-tazobactam vs meropenem on 30-day mortality for patients with E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance: a randomized clinical trial [^112BoJV8]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases mediate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Significant infections caused by these strains are usually treated with carbapenems, potentially selecting for carbapenem resistance. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be an effective "carbapenem-sparing" option to treat extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers.

Objectives

To determine whether definitive therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam is noninferior to meropenem (a carbapenem) in patients with bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or K pneumoniae.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Noninferiority, parallel group, randomized clinical trial included hospitalized patients enrolled from 26 sites in 9 countries from February 2014 to July 2017. Adult patients were eligible if they had at least 1 positive blood culture with E coli or Klebsiella spp testing nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone but susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Of 1646 patients screened, 391 were included in the study.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, 4.5 g, every 6 hours (n = 188 participants) or meropenem, 1 g, every 8 hours (n = 191 participants) for a minimum of 4 days, up to a maximum of 14 days, with the total duration determined by the treating clinician.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days after randomization. A noninferiority margin of 5% was used.

Results

Among 379 patients (mean age, 66.5 years; 47.8% women) who were randomized appropriately, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and were included in the primary analysis population, 378 (99.7%) completed the trial and were assessed for the primary outcome. A total of 23 of 187 patients (12.3%) randomized to piperacillin-tazobactam met the primary outcome of mortality at 30 days compared with 7 of 191 (3.7%) randomized to meropenem (risk difference, 8.6% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 14.5%]; P = 0.90 for noninferiority). Effects were consistent in an analysis of the per-protocol population. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 5 of 188 patients (2.7%) in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 3 of 191 (1.6%) in the meropenem group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with E coli or K pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance, definitive treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam compared with meropenem did not result in a noninferior 30-day mortality. These findings do not support use of piperacillin-tazobactam in this setting.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114EyVD3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E background — enzymatic activity, prevalence, and laboratory detection are outlined as follows: ESBLs are enzymes that inactivate most penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, and ESBLs do not inactivate non-β-lactam agents such as ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), gentamicin, and doxycycline, although organisms carrying ESBL genes often harbor additional genes or mutations in genes expanding their resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. ESBL genes are most prevalent in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis. Routine ESBL testing is not performed by most clinical microbiology laboratories; rather, non-susceptibility to ceftriaxone (ie, ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] ≥ 2 μg/mL), is often used as a proxy for ESBL production, although this threshold has limitations, and for this guidance document, ESBL-E refers to presumed or confirmed ESBL-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, or P. mirabilis.

AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales — mechanisms and clinical implications: AmpC β-lactamases are produced at basal levels by a number of Enterobacterales and glucose non-fermenting gram-negative organisms and are capable of hydrolyzing a number of β-lactams; increased AmpC production generally occurs by 1 of 3 mechanisms — inducible chromosomal gene expression, stable chromosomal gene de-repression, or constitutively expressed ampC genes. Increased AmpC enzyme production from inducible ampC can occur in the presence of specific antibiotics and can increase MICs to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and piperacillin-tazobactam; an isolate initially susceptible to ceftriaxone may later be non-susceptible after treatment, which this guidance describes as a moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production, and resistance due to ampC induction can be observed after even a few doses.

### Ceftriaxone sodium (ceftriaxone) [^116mJyXF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Before instituting treatment with Ceftriaxone Injection, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ceftriaxone Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Ceftriaxone Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Ceftriaxone Injection is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms:

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens.

ACUTE BACTERIAL OTITIS MEDIA caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains) or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains).

NOTE: In one study lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of ceftriaxone compared to 10 days of oral therapy. In a second study comparable cure rates were observed between single dose ceftriaxone and the comparator. The potentially lower clinical cure rate of ceftriaxone should be balanced against the potential advantages of parenteral therapy.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^116NhJ5m]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Carbapenems are generally considered the empiric agents of choice for treating patients with the most common ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. To avoid excessive carbapenem use, however, de-escalation to other agents, such as piperacillin-tazobactam when a MIC ≤ 8 mg/L (according to the EUCAST breakpoint) is detected, can be considered. Several studies compared piperacillin-tazobactam with carbapenems in the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. In the MERINO trial, the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam versus meropenem in the treatment of BSIs caused by ceftriaxone-resistant E. coli or K. pneumoniae was compared, showing an overall 30-day mortality rate threefold higher in the piperacillin-tazobactam arm than in the meropenem one (12.3% versus 3.7%, p = 0.90). Since the low mortality rate in the meropenem group was an unexpected finding, the results of this study have been debated and several issues may have influenced the outcomes of this trial. Among the debated biases, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment of piperacillin-tazobactam was not optimized, as the trial favoured intermittent 1-h infusion over a prolonged infusion protocol. Also, from a microbiological point of view, the use of the E-test to determine piperacillin/tazobactam susceptibility led to an elevated percentage of OXA-1-producing pathogens being incorrectly identified as piperacillin-tazobactam susceptible (E-test method cannot detect OXA-1). In a second comparative study (MERINO-2 trial), 72 patients with BSIs due to chromosomal AmpC producers were enrolled in a multicenter randomized controlled trial, where they were assigned 1:1 to receive piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem. Piperacillin-tazobactam led to more microbiological failures, although fewer microbiological relapses were observed. Despite several pieces of evidence coming from observational studies showed no significant difference in efficacy and mortality rate between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems among patients with ESBL-producing BSIs, the use of a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) for severe infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales is generally recommended in critically ill patients.

METHODS

Win Ratio Approach

The win ratio approach can incorporate benefits and risks into a hierarchy of outcomes based on clinical importance to assess superiority between treatment groups. Using the unmatched approach, all possible pairs are formed with every patient from the investigational treatment and control treatment groups and compared with respect to the most important outcome. A patient from the treatment group is classified as a "win" or "loss" dependent on who has the event of interest. If an event does not occur, or an event occurs for each of the pair at the same time or end of follow-up, the pair is considered a tie and the comparison moves to the next outcome in the hierarchy until all components are exhausted. The win ratio is the proportion of the total number of pairs where the investigational treatment arm was a win to the total number of losses. A value of 1 corresponds to no difference between the 2 groups, while a value > 1 favors the investigational treatment and a ratio < 1 favors the control treatment. An illustration of an example of the win ratio approach is provided in Figure 1. To account for remaining ties, the "win odds", a modification of the win ratio that includes half of all ties added to the treatment and control groups, was also calculated.

Figure 1.
The win ratio approach: Classifying pairs as wins, losses, and ties, in this example prioritizing time to all-cause mortality before relapse and secondary infection in the hierarchical composite endpoint. Every patient in the investigational treatment group (A) is compared with every patient in the control group (B). If a patient in group B dies before a patient in group A, it is a win to group A. Or if a patient in group A dies before the patient in group B, it is a loss to group A. If none of the patients in the pair die, or if both patients die at the same time, it becomes a tie and the comparison moves to the next outcome in the hierarchy. This comparison continues with each outcome until all outcomes are exhausted. The win ratio is the number of wins for group A divided by the number of losses for group A.

Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### Controversies over the management of infections caused by amp-C-and ESBL-producing enterobacterales: what questions remain for future studies? [^1165Ah31]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The continuous rise in infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- or AmpC-producing Enterobacterales) is a major health concern. Carbapenems are regarded as the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of these infections. However, their indiscriminant use is not without consequences, and has contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. In this review, we discuss the available evidence supporting the use of other betalactams, nonbetalactams and the new betalactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (BLA/BLI) to treat these infections. We also analyze unresolved issues in this field.

Recent Findings

Piperacillin tazobactam (PTZ) was classically recommended as a carbapenem-sparing agent. However, data have emerged against its use and it is now a controversial recommendation. IDSA, European and British guidelines reject the empirical use of PTZ for these pathogens, reserving its use for rare clinical situations. Other issues that continue to generate debate are the use of extended infusion (3h) PTZ, the use of older antibiotics, a shortened course of carbapenems and reserving the new BLA/BLI for these infections.

Summary

New treatment strategies should be based on clinical evidence, local epidemiology and the microbiological activity of these drugs.

### Ceftriaxone [^113fyybQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

Mechanism of Resistance

Resistance to ceftriaxone is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.

Interaction with Other Antimicrobials

In an in vitro study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone.

Antibacterial Activity

Ceftriaxone has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section:

Question 2.2 — Selecting antibiotics for organisms at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: The suggested approach states that several β-lactam antibiotics are at moderate risk of inducing ampC genes and that both induction potential and stability to AmpC β-lactamase hydrolysis should be considered when selecting therapy. The rationale notes a spectrum of induction among β-lactams; aminopenicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin), narrow-spectrum first-generation cephalosporins, and cephamycins are potent ampC inducers, and both low-risk (S. marcescens) and moderate-risk (E. cloacae) organisms hydrolyze these drugs even at basal ampC expression levels, so such AmpC-E isolates will generally test as resistant. Imipenem is also a potent ampC inducer but generally remains stable to AmpC-E hydrolysis; the induction potential of ertapenem and meropenem has not been formally investigated but, similar to imipenem, they are generally stable to AmpC hydrolysis. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and aztreonam are relatively weak ampC inducers, yet available evidence indicates that their susceptibility to hydrolysis makes them less likely to be effective for infections by organisms at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production.

### Comparison of cefazolin and ceftriaxone enterobacterales susceptibilities for inpatient treatment of urinary tract infections and risk of hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection [^115zVRT8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common indication for antibiotic therapy among inpatients in the United States. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is habitually chosen to treat inpatient UTIs due to familiarity, cost, and perceived safety. However, third-generation cephalosporins increase the risk of health care facility-onset Clostridioides difficile infection (HOCDI) more than any other antibiotic group, while no statistical risk exists for first-generation cephalosporins. Recent evidence comparing Enterobacterales susceptibility for first- and third-generation cephalosporins in urinary specimens in the United States is limited. This analysis assessed the comparative activity of cefazolin and ceftriaxone for Enterobacterales urinary isolates and incidence of HOCDI to determine the usefulness of cefazolin as an empirical agent to manage inpatient UTI and limit ceftriaxone collateral damage.

Methods

This was a retrospective single-center observational study. Microbiologic susceptibility data were analyzed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis urinary specimens taken from adult inpatients admitted from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022. Primary outcome was incidence of E coli, K pneumoniae, and P mirabilis susceptibility to cefazolin in uncomplicated UTI (MIC < 16 µg/mL). Secondary outcomes include susceptibility for complicated UTI and HOCDI risk associated with cefazolin and ceftriaxone.

Findings

A total of 1150 urine samples were identified as E coli, K pneumoniae, and P mirabilis in 2022. Susceptibility to cefazolin was observed in 1064 (92.5%) of 1150 isolates using the MIC breakpoint for uncomplicated UTI and to ceftriaxone in 1115 (97.0%) of 1150 isolates (P < 0.001). From 2016 to 2022, either cefazolin or ceftriaxone was administered in 26,462 inpatient admissions, with HOCDI diagnoses occurring in 89 admissions. HOCDI developed in 78 admissions (0.40%) with ceftriaxone exposure, and 11 cases (0.15%) developed in cefazolin-exposed admissions (adjusted odds ratio, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.25–4.76; P < 0.001).

Implications

Cefazolin exhibits high susceptibility for uropathogens commonly implicated in cases of uncomplicated UTI, the most common UTI diagnosis among inpatients. Although ceftriaxone shows a higher susceptibility rate against these common uropathogens, it more than doubles the risk for HOCDI compared with cefazolin. For institutions evaluating opportunities to reduce ceftriaxone use to limit associated collateral damage such as HOCDI, use of cefazolin for uncomplicated UTI may be evaluated by using local susceptibility data.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^111YfRgF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance — cefepime for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production states: "Cefepime is suggested for the treatment of infections caused by organisms at moderate risk of significant AmpC production (ie, E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes, and C. freundii)". For isolates in the susceptible dose-dependent range, dosing is defined as "2 grams every 8 hours, infused over 3 hours" for "MICs 4–8 µg/mL". Although effective for AmpC-E, cefepime "remains suboptimal against infections caused by ESBL-E", illustrated by a Taiwan study where "89% of E. cloacae isolates with cefepime MICs of 4–8 µg/mL… were ESBL-producing", in which "all 10 patients… died within 30 days", whereas "none of the 6 patients… died within 30 days" when ESBL was absent. U.S. data show ESBL gene prevalence varies — among E. cloacae, "3% contained a blaCTX-M gene", and in older Pittsburgh data "15 of 45 (33%)… produced SHV-type ESBLs" with "no association" to cefepime MIC. In a Baltimore series, ESBL genes were found in "22% of K. aerogenes (4/18), 14% of E. cloacae (7/51), and in no C. freundii (0% [0/106])", and "none of the ESBL-producing isolates had cefepime MICs of 4–8 µg/mL". Overall, "Available data do not suggest there is a clear association between cefepime susceptible dose-dependent MICs (ie, MICs of 4–8 µg/mL) and ESBL production".

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^115XEKrr]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

None of the antimicrobials currently in development has activity against the entire spectrum of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria. The mortality associated with the failure rates from the current salvage therapies highlighted above is disconcerting. The treatment of serious infections with CRE remains an enormous challenge. A concerted global commitment to the intelligent use of antimicrobials, better antibiotic stewardship, the implementation of effective infection control strategies, and the development of more effective therapies are desperately needed.

### Ceftriaxone (Easy-ceft) [^114M1Wc4]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action:

Microbiology:

Mechanism of Action:

Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

Mechanism of Resistance:

Mechanism of Resistance:

Resistance to ceftriaxone is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.

Interaction with Other Antimicrobials:

In an in vitro study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^111Wt4YA]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Current treatment options for infections with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae

The optimal treatment of infections with CRE is uncertain, as most data come from retrospective case series and anecdotal case reports; few prospective studies or randomized controlled trials are published on this topic. Since carbapenem-producing organisms are often resistant to other antimicrobial classes in addition to most beta-lactams, additional susceptibility testing to antimicrobials such as colistin, fosfomycin, tigecycline, aztreonam, and rifampin is needed. Consultations from experts in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant organisms may also prove valuable in patient management. The following antimicrobial therapies have been used with various levels of success in the treatment of CRE infections.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for enterobacterales: recommendations from the United States committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^112mtfbS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The USCAST recommendation was also informed by the MERINO trial, which compared definitive treatment with meropenem 1 g every 8 hours (0.5-hour infusion) or TZP 4.5 g every 6 hours (0.5-hour infusion) in adult patients with TZP-S, ceftriaxone-R (CRO-R) E. coli, or K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections. In this international, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial, 30-day mortality was higher in the TZP arm relative to the meropenem arm (12.3% vs 3.7%, respectively; risk difference, 8.6%; 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval [CI] −α to 14.5%; P = 0.90 for noninferiority). Similar trends in favor of meropenem were demonstrated in the secondary outcomes of clinical cure, microbiological cure, and the development of resistance.

To investigate the potential reason(s) for the observed 30-day mortality differences between treatments in MERINO-1, post hoc analyses were performed, and an unexpectedly high rate of nonsusceptibility to TZP was demonstrated using broth microdilution at the central laboratory compared to Vitek or disk diffusion at the local site. When the analysis was limited to patients with TZP-susceptible isolates via broth microdilution by the current FDA, CLSI, and EUCAST TZP susceptible breakpoint of ≤ 8/4 mg/L, 30-day mortality was still higher with TZP but no longer reached statistical significance (9% vs 5%, respectively; 95% CI, −2% to 11%). In the multivariate regression analyses, TZP MIC > 16/4 mg/L was identified as the TZP MIC threshold best associated with 30-day mortality (30-day mortality was 50% [5 of 10] in patients with isolates that had TZP MIC values > 16/4 mg/L vs 9% [13 of 147] in patients with isolates that had TZP MIC values ≤ 16/4 mg/L).

### Is it time to reconsider initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe? [^112WEVzq]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, most reported cases of bacteraemia caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriacae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Europe have been nosocomial in origin. However, increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired bacteraemia and urinary tract infection caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms suggest that the geographical origin of patients should be taken into account as a risk-factor for possible ESBL production. Early identification of patients at high-risk of infection with ESBL-producing microorganisms, based on their geographical origin and travel history, should help to optimise initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe.

The 33rd edition also includes revisions to the general cephems comments (i.e. those in Table 1A footnotes and Table 2A) regarding AmpC beta-lactamase producers. The comments highlight that certain species of Enterobacterales are more likely than others to undergo derepression of their inducible AmpC beta-lactamase within a few days after initiation of therapy with certain third-generation cephalosporins. Derepression is most common with Citrobacter freundii complex, Enterobacter cloacae complex, and Klebsiella (formerly Enterobacter) aerogenes. Therefore, isolates that initially test susceptible may become resistant. M100 Table 1A lists cefepime as a Tier 1 agent for organisms that are of high risk of derepression of the AmpC beta-lactamase. These revisions align with the current IDSA treatment guidelines for certain genera and species of Enterobacterales that commonly produce AmpC beta-lactamase but may initially test susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftaroline.

Statement 14

Antibiotic regimens with activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria should be used for selected patients with IAIs who are strongly suspected or proved to be harbouring a resistant pathogen (Moderate-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Initial antibiotic therapy for cIAIs is typically empiric in nature because standard microbiologic data and susceptibility results generally require 24–72 h after peritoneal fluid specimen collection. Blood cultures are seldom positive in cIAI (< 10%) and therefore largely unreliable. Typical bacterial pathogens in IAIs reflect endogenous gut flora including Enterobacterales such as E. coli and Klebsiella spp. viridans group Streptococcus, and anaerobes (especially Bacteroides spp.). Historically, cIAI pathogens tended to have greater susceptibility in community- as opposed to hospital-acquired infections.

IAIs caused by susceptible bacteria may be managed by beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (e.g. ticarcillin/clavulanic acid or piperacillin/tazobactam), or a non-pseudomonal carbapenem (e.g. ertapenem). Increasing AMR to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid among E. coli and other Enterobacterales worldwide has compromised its clinical utility for empiric therapy; it should only be prescribed as targeted therapy based on demonstrated susceptibility. The comparably broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam makes it still useful in managing severe IAIs. However, the anti-pseudomonal activity of piperacillin/tazobactam is unnecessary for most community-acquired cIAIs, and its use in hospital-acquired infections should be determined based on local microbiologic epidemiology.

Many isolates of E. coli and other Enterobacterales are susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins that, in combination with metronidazole, may be options for empiric therapy of non-severe IAIs. Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a broader spectrum of activity than third-generation cephalosporins. Compared to ceftriaxone, cefepime is poorly hydrolysed by AmpC beta-lactamase, allowing it to be effective against AmpC-producing organisms. For empiric therapy, cefepime must also be given with metronidazole. Fluoroquinolones have been prescribed widely for the treatment of IAIs because of their putative activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria, tissue penetration, and high oral bioavailability. However, resistance of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. to fluoroquinolones has increased substantially over time, limiting their use for empiric treatment of IAIs.

### An international prospective cohort study to validate 2 prediction rules for infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant enterobacterales [^114BjWRu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Second, we simplified the clinical problem to 3GC-R in Enterobacterales, while clinicians also may have to consider other potential pathogens, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, these pathogens were rare in community-onset infections in our cohort.

Third, we only collected susceptibility data of EB isolates for cephalosporins and carbapenems. In the community-onset group, 30 patients with 3GC-R-BSI received piperacillin/tazobactam or cephalosporins plus aminoglycosides for empiric treatment. Some of these patients may have received appropriate treatment. However, aminoglycosides may not be an ideal strategy for empiric treatment. Additionally, co-resistance to aminoglycosides is common in ESBL-producing pathogens, particularly in Klebsiella species.

Fourth, we included patients with a respiratory tract infection, where the a priori risk of bacteremia is low. However, 14% of the 3GC-R-BSI population had a suspected respiratory tract infection according to local physicians. This high percentage may have resulted from the selection of more severe cases in patients with community-onset pneumonia. In these patients, obtaining blood cultures is not always standard care and may be associated with higher disease severity, and thus a higher a priori risk of 3GC-R-BSI.

In conclusion, we externally validated a prediction rule in community-onset infections caused by 3GC-R E that may reduce unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic prescriptions, which can now be implemented and tested for clinical utility.

However, in recent years, the prevalence of resistance between Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli has been so high as to make their use in empirical regimen not recommended.

Aminoglycosides are particularly active against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and act synergistically against certain Gram-positive organisms. They are effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but not effective against anaerobic bacteria. The aminoglycosides may not be optimal for-the treatment of abscesses or intra-abdominal infections due to their low penetration in acidic environments. Therefore they are not recommended for the routine empiric treatment of community-acquired IAIs and may be reserved for patients with allergies to b-lactam agents.

Tigecycline is a parenteral glycylcycline antibiotic derived from minocycline. It is the first representative of the glycylcycline class of antibacterial agents to be marketed for clinical use. Tigecycline has no activity in vitro against P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis but represents a significant treatment option for complicated IAIs due to its favorable in vitro activity against anaerobic organisms, Enterococci, several ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter sp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

The use of tigecycline in the abdominal infections is particularly attractive in view of its pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics properties. In fact the drug is eliminated by active biliary secretion, able to determinate very high biliary and fecal concentrations. A study finalized to the determination of tissue and corresponding serum concentration of tigecycline at selected time points in several different body sites, performed in 104 subjects undergoing surgical or medical procedures, showed that concentration, expressed as the ratio of AUC0-24 was extremely high for bile.

Moreover a PD analysis based on the data of microbiological surveys, performed by the Montecarlo simulation, demonstrated a predicted cumulative response (PCR) fraction for Tigeciclyne in peritonitis over 95% for E. coli and Enterococcus and over 75% for Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp and A. baumannii. Tigecycline (TGC) has demonstrated non-inferiority in terms of clinical efficacy and safety versus imipenem/cilastatin and combination regimen of Ceftriaxone/metronidazole in Phase 3 clinical trials for complicated intra-abdominal infection.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance on the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) [^115269oF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial-resistant infections are commonly encountered in US hospitals and result in significant morbidity and mortality. This guidance document provides recommendations for the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa).

Methods

A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated common questions regarding the treatment of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections. Based on review of the published literature and clinical experience, the panel provide recommendations and associated rationale for each recommendation. Because of significant differences in the molecular epidemiology of resistance and the availability of specific anti-infective agents globally, this document focuses on treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections in the United States.

Results

Approaches to empiric treatment selection, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are briefly discussed. The majority of guidance focuses on preferred and alternative treatment recommendations for antimicrobial-resistant infections, assuming that the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility testing results are known. Treatment recommendations apply to both adults and children.

Conclusions

The field of antimicrobial resistance is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections will continue to challenge clinicians. This guidance document is current as of 17 September 2020. Updates to this guidance document will occur periodically as new data emerge. Furthermore, the panel will expand recommendations to include other problematic gram-negative pathogens in future versions. The most current version of the guidance including the date of publication can be found at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance/.

### A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study comparing ertapenem and ceftriaxone followed by appropriate oral therapy for complicated urinary tract infections in adults [^117S4F6P]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of ertapenem, a new once-daily parenteral beta-lactam, with that of ceftriaxone for the initial empiric treatment of adults with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs).

Methods

In a multicenter, prospective, double-blind study, patients with cUTIs were stratified as to whether they had acute pyelonephritis or other cUTIs (without pyelonephritis) and randomized to receive ertapenem, 1 g once a day, or ceftriaxone, 1 g once a day. After 3 days, patients with a satisfactory clinical response could be switched to an oral antimicrobial agent.

Results

Of 258 randomized patients, 97 (55.4%) in the ertapenem group and 53 (63.9%) in the ceftriaxone group were evaluated microbiologically. Almost all patients in each treatment group were switched to oral therapy. The mean duration of therapy was similar in both treatment groups: parenteral, approximately 4 days; total, approximately 13 days. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli. At the primary efficacy endpoint, 5 to 9 days after treatment, 85.6% of patients who received ertapenem and 84.9% who received ceftriaxone had a favorable microbiologic response, indicating that the two treatment groups were equivalent. The frequency and severity of drug-related adverse events were generally similar in both treatment groups.

Conclusions

In this study, ertapenem was as effective as ceftriaxone for the initial treatment of cUTI in adults, was generally well tolerated, and had a similar safety profile.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Before instituting treatment with Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms:

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens.

ACUTE BACTERIAL OTITIS MEDIA

ACUTE BACTERIAL OTITIS MEDIA caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophi/us influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains) or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains).

NOTE: In one study lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP compared to 10 days of oral therapy. In a second study comparable cure rates were observed between single dose Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP and the comparator. The potentially lower clinical cure rate of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP should be balanced against the potential advantages of parenteral therapy (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS (complicated and uncomplicated) caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

UNCOMPLICATED GONORRHEA

UNCOMPLICATED GONORRHEA (cervical/urethral and rectal) caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including both penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing strains, and pharyngeal gonorrhea caused by nonpenicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE

PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — combination antibiotic therapy: Combination antibiotic therapy (the use of a β-lactam in combination with an aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, tetracycline, or polymyxin) is not suggested for CRE infections. Data do not indicate that continued combination therapy — once the β-lactam has demonstrated in vitro activity — offers improved outcomes, and clinical data indicating prevention of resistance are lacking; randomized trial data comparing novel β-lactams as monotherapy versus in combination are not available. In an observational study, 165 patients received ceftazidime-avibactam and 412 received ceftazidime-avibactam plus a second agent, with 30-day mortality essentially identical at approximately 25% in both arms; accordingly, the panel does not suggest combination therapy for CRE infections when susceptibility to a preferred β-lactam has been demonstrated.

Model performance at baseline

In held-out test data from 2022 (Test dataset 1), predictive performance was broadly similar for the seven antibiotics, with AUCs ranging from 0.680 [95%CI 0.641–0.720] for amoxicillin to 0.737 [0.674–0.797] for ceftriaxone (Table 2 A; Table S4 for training data performance). Jointly optimising sensitivity and specificity, sensitivity ranged from 40.7% (32.7–49.6%) for co-trimoxazole to 62.2% (57.8–66.6%) for amoxicillin, while specificity ranged from 66.4% (60.2–72.3%) for amoxicillin to 91.5% (89.2–93.7%) for co-trimoxazole. Positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs), which are influenced by differences in resistance prevalence, ranged from 19.8% (14.2–26.3%) to 78.0% (73.9–81.9%) and 47.9% (42.6–53.7) to 94.2% (92.2–96.0%), respectively. Alternative values for sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV could be obtained by varying the threshold chosen for identifying resistance (e.g. prioritising sensitivity, Table S5).

Table 2
Model performance for predicting antibiotic resistance at blood culture sampling (A) and at species identification (B) in held-out test dataset 1, 01 January 2022–31 December 2022, Oxfordshire, UK.

Model performance following species identification

Performance improved for most antibiotics when species data were included as inputs to the prediction models, i.e. mimicking the point during laboratory work-up of a blood culture when the species is first identified, but susceptibility results remain pending. For example, AUCs increased for amoxicillin (0.680 [95%CI 0.641–0.720] to 0.827 [0.797–0.857]) and co-amoxiclav (0.684 [0.642–0.722] to 0.771 [0.734–0.805]). Performance increases were seen for other antibiotics, but with minimal improvement for piperacillin-tazobactam (Table 2 B, Table S6 for training dataset).

### Machine learning and clinician predictions of antibiotic resistance in enterobacterales bloodstream infections [^114xnx3E]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

The implied sensitivity of clinicians for detecting resistance, i.e. the proportion of patients with resistance to a given antibiotic receiving treatment with any active broader spectrum beta-lactam was 97% (2005/2064) for amoxicillin, 29% (360/1225) for co-amoxiclav, 19% (61/320) for ceftriaxone, and 6% (11/190) for piperacillin-tazobactam.

Strategy 1 – matching clinician antibiotic use

Model performance without species information was compared to clinicians by attempting to constrain the predictions made to result in the same total number of prescriptions for each antibiotic as used by clinicians. Within the combined test data, clinician prescribing resulted in 70% of patients receiving an active beta-lactam: 44% were over-treated, 26% optimally-treated, and 30% under-treated. Model predictions resulted in more patients being actively treated, 75%, fewer being over-treated, 42%, fewer under-treated, 25%, and therefore more being optimally-treated, 33% (Fig. 4 D). Due to differences in model fit and calibration between training and test data, despite targeting no change, small variations in antibiotic use relative to clinicians were observed (Fig. 4 E, Table 3).

Table 3
Comparison of model predictions to clinician prescribing in test data from 2022–2023 (n = 919).

Strategy 2 – matching antibiotic use to susceptibility rates

Using alternative prediction thresholds that matched total antibiotic use to susceptibility rates resulted in more patients receiving optimal treatment compared to clinician's prescribing, 42% (cf. 26% by clinicians) and reduced over-treatment in 29% (cf. 44%). However, overall active treatment was similar, 71% (cf. 70%). In a sensitivity analysis where 20% reductions in amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav use were allowed relative to susceptibility rates, the percentage of patients predicted to receive active treatment increased to 77%, while overtreatment at 36% remained less than with clinicians' prescribing.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^1153fDy7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy for extra-biliary community-acquired IAIs

Once the diagnosis of intra-abdominal infection is suspected, it is necessary to begin empiric antimicrobial therapy.

However routine use of antimicrobial therapy is not appropriate for all patients with intra-abdominal infections.

In uncomplicated IAIs, when the focus of infection is treated effectively by surgical excision of the involved tissue, the administration of antibiotics is unnecessary beyond prophylaxis.

In complicated IAIs, when infectious process proceeds beyond the organ, causing either localized peritonitis (intra-abdominal abscess), or diffuse peritonitis antimicrobial therapy is mandatory.

The choice of antimicrobial regimen depends on the source of intra-abdominal infection, risk factors for specific microorganisms and resistance patterns and clinical patient's condition (Recommendation 1 C).

The principles of empiric antibiotic treatment should be defined according to the most frequently isolated germs, always taking into consideration the local trend of antibiotic resistance.

The major pathogens involved in community-acquired IAIs are Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and anaerobes. The main resistance problem is represented by ESBL producers Enterobacteriaceae, even today frequently found in community acquired infections.

Many factors can raise the risk of selection of ESBL but prior exposition to antibiotics (mainly third generation cephalosporins) and comorbidities that make frequent the exposure of patients to multiple antibiotic treatments, are the most significant.

Many others factors can contribute to the severity of an intra-abdominal infection and to a patient's risk for a poor outcome, like patient age, underlying co-morbidities, extent of infection, nutritional status and the success of initial source control procedures. Dividing patients with intra-abdominal infections into lower and higher risk categories is not always simple, but attempting to assess a patient's risk of treatment failure is essential to optimize a treatment plan. In this context adding a standardized evaluation of the clinical condition, represented by the sepsis grading, may be extremely helpful.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2022 guidance on the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) [^116W23Bb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. The initial guidance document on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) was published on 17 September 2020. Over the past year, there have been a number of important publications furthering our understanding of the management of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections, prompting a rereview of the literature and this updated guidance document.

Methods

A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections reviewed, updated, and expanded previously developed questions and recommendations about the treatment of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections. Because of differences in the epidemiology of resistance and availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of infections in the United States.

Results

Preferred and alternative treatment recommendations are provided with accompanying rationales, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are also discussed briefly. Recommendations apply for both adult and pediatric populations.

Conclusions

The field of antimicrobial resistance is highly dynamic. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended for the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. This document is current as of 24 October 2021. The most current versions of IDSA documents, including dates of publication, are available at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance/.

### Prostatitis: a review [^113Vvw95]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prostatitis is defined as infection, inflammation, or pain of the prostate gland and affects approximately 9.3% of men in their lifetime.

Observations

Acute bacterial prostatitis consists of a urinary tract infection (UTI) that includes infection of the prostate, typically associated with fever or chills and caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, or Pseudomonas, in 80% to 97% of cases. First-line therapy for acute prostatitis is broad-spectrum intravenous or oral antibiotics, such as intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or oral ciprofloxacin, which has a 92% to 97% success rate when prescribed for 2 to 4 weeks for people with febrile UTI and acute prostatitis. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is defined as a persistent bacterial infection of the prostate, typically presenting as recurrent UTIs from the same strain. Up to 74% of chronic bacterial prostatitis diagnoses are due to gram-negative organisms, such as E coli. First-line therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis is a minimum 4-week course of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) presents as pelvic pain or discomfort for at least 3 months and is associated with urinary symptoms, such as urinary frequency. CP/CPPS is diagnosed when evaluation, including history and physical examination, urine culture, and postvoid residual measurement, does not identify other causes for the symptoms, such as infection, cancer, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) measures symptom severity (scale of 0–43), with a 6-point change considered clinically meaningful. First-line oral therapy for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms is α-blockers (eg, tamsulosin, alfuzosin; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference vs placebo = -10.8 to -4.8). Other oral therapies are associated with modest changes in NIH-CPSI score compared with placebo, including anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen; ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.5 to -1.7), pregabalin (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.4), and pollen extract (ΔNIH-CPSI score difference = -2.49).

Conclusions and Relevance

Prostatitis includes acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and CP/CPPS, each of which is diagnosed and treated differently. First-line treatments are broad-spectrum antibiotics for acute bacterial prostatitis (such as piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin), at least 4 weeks of fluoroquinolones for chronic bacterial prostatitis, and α-blockers for CP/CPPS with urinary symptoms.

### Coverage gaps in empiric antibiotic regimens used to treat serious bacterial infections in neonates and children in southeast Asia and the pacific [^112k42Fz]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Selecting clinically relevant bacteria and syndromes

Pre-specified bacterial pathogens were selected that included the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use of Surveillance System (GLASS) bacteria, plus other pathogens relevant to neonatal and paediatric BSI and meningitis (Table 1). These pathogens were chosen based on the subject matter expertise of the clinicians in the study team as they are likely to be most relevant to significant infections in children, and are problematic in terms of emerging AMR. Neonatal sepsis and meningitis were considered collectively given that these clinical conditions frequently co-occur, while paediatric sepsis and meningitis were treated as distinct clinical syndromes.

Table 1
Pre-defined pathogens for inclusion.

Regimens selected for coverage estimation

The three regimens evaluated in this study were aminopenicillins, gentamicin (WHO recommended first-line treatment for neonatal sepsis), non-antipseudomonal third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime: WHO recommended first-line therapy for neonatal meningitis and paediatric sepsis, or second-line therapy for neonatal sepsis), and carbapenems (as meropenem, classified by the WHO as a 'Watch' antibiotic, is frequently prescribed as empiric therapy in many clinical settings due to increasing non-susceptibility to first- and second-line therapies).

Intrinsic resistance and combination regimens

Pathogens known to have intrinsic in vivo resistance to certain antimicrobials were allocated a susceptibility rate of zero, regardless of any contrary published data. These included aminopenicillins for Klebsiella spp. cephalosporins for Enterococcus spp. cefotaxime/ceftriaxone for Pseudomonas spp. aminopenicillins and ceftriaxone/cefotaxime for Acinetobacter spp. and gentamicin for Salmonella spp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, carbapenem-resistant, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer tigecycline and eravacycline as alternative options for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales infections if β-lactam agents are either not active or unable to be tolerated. Avoid using tetracycline derivatives for the treatment of UTIs or bloodstream infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

Administer a single dose of an aminoglycoside, oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only), colistin, ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, or cefiderocol as alternative options.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^116rgjLj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy

Initial antibiotic therapy for IAIs is typically empirical in nature because the patient needs immediate attention, and microbiological data (culture and susceptibility results) can require up to 48 hours before they are available for a more detailed analysis.

IAIs can be treated with either single or multiple antimicrobial regimens depending on the range requirements of antimicrobial coverage.

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations exhibit in vitro activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms and are viable options for empirical treatment of IAIs. However, the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae observed in community-acquired infections restricts this regimen's empirical use to patients who are not at risk for these drug-resistant microorganisms.

In the past, Cephalosporins have often been used in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. Among third generation cephalosporins, subgroups with both limited and strong activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cefepime and ceftazidime) have been used in conjunction with metronidazole to treat IAIs. Enterobacteriaceae can have acquired resistance to both cephalosporins, while such resistance is intrinsic in Enterococci.

In light of the increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae due to selection pressures related to overuse of cephalosporins, routine use of these antibiotics is strongly discouraged.

Aztreonam is a parenteral synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic and the first monobactam marketed for clinical use. The drug exhibits potent in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of gram-negative aerobic pathogens (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but its routine use is discouraged due to selection pressures favoring resistant strains, and it therefore shares the same constraints associated with cephalosporin use.

Carbapenems offer a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens (with the exception of MDR resistant gram-positive cocci). For more than 2 decades, carbapenems have been considered the agents of "last resort" for multidrug-resistant infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae. In the last decade, increased carbapenem consumption has been associated with an increased emergence of carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriacea, particularly in Klebsiella pneumoniae.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Resolving colistin resistance and heteroresistance in Enterobacter species [^111hDSLi]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Members of the order Enterobacterales are a frequent source of morbidity and mortality associated with bloodstream, respiratory tract, and urinary tract infection in healthcare institutions worldwide. Among the Enterobacterales, Enterobacter are opportunistic nosocomial pathogens listed among the top five species causing bloodstream infections (BSI) –, and are in WHO's priority list for which new antimicrobials are urgently needed. Enterobacter are also present in environmental habitats such as soil and water and exhibit considerable phenotypic and genomic diversity. As a result of taxonomical complexity, pathogenic species are commonly grouped within the Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC). Infections with Enterobacter species are difficult to treat as they often exhibit resistance to penicillin, quinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins. While carbapenems are among the most attractive therapeutic options, Enterobacter species have emerged as the third most common hosts for carbapenemases worldwide forcing the use of colistin as a "last-resort" antibiotic for the treatment –.

Procedures

The 2-year study period was split into two 1-year periods, which differed by the antibiotic policy employed. During the first year, the "conventional strategy period" (CSP), antibiotic therapy was prescribed at the physician's discretion based on national and international guidelines. This strategy included the use of a broad-spectrum antibiotic as initial empirical treatment in the case of sepsis or suspected infection, followed by de-escalation after 48 to 72 h, based on microbiological data. The main regimens were combination therapies with a cephalosporin and aminoglycoside for community-acquired infections, and carbapenem or piperacillin/tazobactam combined with amikacin for hospital-acquired infections. Dosage, timing and duration followed French guidelines.

As part of a stewardship program, a new set of guidelines with a restrictive antibiotic protocol was established by the ICU team, approved by a multidisciplinary team and implemented on 1 January 2015. The "restrictive strategy period" (RSP) was based on seven principles. (1) For suspected infection, microbiological samples were taken immediately, and antibiotic therapy was initiated only after microbiological identification, except for septic shock, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and meningitis. (2) For non-documented septic shock and severe ARDS, an empiric combination therapy including a cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside was immediately started after microbiological sampling according to the ICU protocol. Combined therapy included either second or third cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) for community-acquired septic shock, or cefoxitin for hospital-acquired septic shock (owing to the resistance to the previously listed cephalosporins and the high rate of susceptibility to cefoxitin of the ESBL-E) or an anti- Pseudomonas aeruginosa cephalosporin (ceftazidime or cefepime) for late (> 5 days) ventilation-acquired pneumonia (VAP). The second antibiotic was amikacin, unless a Gram-positive pathogen was highly suspected. Due to the low prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in our hospital, the first-line anti-staphylococcal treatment was cefazolin. (3) No use of piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems for empirical treatment, only for a documented infection without an alternative option. (4) Limited coverage on P. aeruginosa, unless indicated. (5) Limited coverage on subdiaphragmatic anaerobes, unless indicated. (6) Monotherapy as a definitive treatment. (7) Other characteristics of antibiotic treatment were short duration, high doses and de-escalation as soon as possible to the narrowest alternative, with a focus on penicillin, first- and second-generation cephalosporins, according to the attending physician and following ICU protocols (see detailed protocol in Additional file 1). The local epidemiology of resistant strains according to the unit and origin of samples in 2014–2015 is provided in Table 1: Additional file 1.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam susceptibility test interpretive criteria for enterobacterales: recommendations from the United States committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^117KYGdn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 3.
Activity of piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam against ceftriaxone-susceptible Escherichia coli (A) (4867 isolates) and ceftriaxone-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae (B) (2783 isolates) from North America medical centers (2007–2010). Enterobacterales were considered susceptible if the ceftriaxone MIC value was ≤ 1 mg/L. Abbreviation: MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration.

Despite the notable data gaps, USCAST was in favor of these breakpoint recommendations based on the belief that use of TZP will largely be empiric for patients with 3GC-S Enterobacterales infections and that good stewardship practices will foster deescalation in most circumstances to a narrower agent when 3GCs demonstrate susceptibility. It is important to note that the 3GC-S Enterobacterales susceptibility breakpoint of ≤ 16/4 mg/L is contingent upon use of extended-infusion TZP. If institutions find administration of extended-infusion TZP infeasible, a reasonable susceptibility breakpoint with intermittent-infusion TZP would be 8/4 mg/L, as recommended by the FDA, CLSI, and EUCAST. However, the probability of achieving 50% piperacillin f T > MIC would be < 90% for 3GC-S Enterobacterales with TZP MIC values ≤ 8 mg/L among some renal function subgroups with intermittent-infusion TZP (Supplementary Table 3). Based on the Monte Carlo simulation studies that evaluated the effect of varying CL CR on achieving 50% piperacillin f T > MIC, USCAST was not in favor of endorsing a TZP STIC for 3GC-S Enterobacterales that included a susceptible breakpoint for intermittent-infusion TZP dosing. USCAST unanimously agreed that additional preclinical PK/PD studies are needed to assess the piperacillin and tazobactam PK/PD targets associated with efficacy and using such targets to determine TZP dosing schemes necessary to ensure piperacillin's activity against 3GC-S Enterobacterales.

### Response-guided therapy with cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a randomized trial: a validation study of 2021 AASLD practice guidance for SBP [^115mUNrS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin were used as first-line agents. However, considering the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance, it is unclear which of these drugs can be initially recommended. This study aimed to compare the current efficacy of the 3 antibiotics, namely cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, for the treatment of SBP in patients with cirrhosis with ascites, when guided by therapeutic responses.

Methods

This study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. The inclusion criteria were 16- to 75-year-old patients with liver cirrhosis with ascites, having polymorphonuclear cell count of > 250/mm³. We performed a follow-up paracentesis at 48 hours to decide continuing or changing the assigned antibiotics and then assessed the resolution rates at 120 and 168 hours of treatment.

Results

A total of 261 patients with cirrhosis who developed SBP were enrolled. Most of the patients were diagnosed as those with SBP within 48 hours of admission. The resolution rates at 120 hours, which is the primary endpoint, were 67.8%, 77.0%, and 73.6% in the cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively (P = 0.388), by intension-to-treat analysis. The 1-month mortality was similar among the groups (P = 0.770). The model for end-stage liver disease score and the SBP resolution were significant factors for survival.

Conclusion

The efficacy of empirical antibiotics, such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, against SBP was not significantly different. In addition, these antibiotics administered based on response-guided therapy were still efficacious as initial treatment for SBP, especially in those with community-acquired infections.

### Cumulative antibiotic exposure is associated with ceftriaxone resistance among patients with urinary source Gram-negative bloodstream infection: a retrospective cohort study [^111Q4XXk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We investigated the relationship between cumulative, historical antibiotic therapy and the presence of ceftriaxone-resistant (CRO-R) Enterobacterales bloodstream infections (BSI) from urinary sources.

Methods

Adult patients established with primary care at Mayo Clinic with a first episode of monomicrobial Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, or Proteus mirabilis BSI from a urinary source from May 2019-May 2023 were included. Antibiotic therapy over the year prior to BSI was quantified as days of therapy (DOT), cumulative modified Antibiotic Spectrum Index (mASI), and cumulative Days of Antibiotic Spectrum Coverage (DASC) using prescription data. Patients with CRO-R urinary pathogens prior to antibiotic therapy assessment were excluded.

Results

721 adults had monomicrobial Gram-negative BSI, including 70 patients (9.7%) with a CRO-R pathogen and 651 patients (90.3%) with a ceftriaxone-susceptible (CRO-S) pathogen. In the 12 months prior to BSI, levels of antibiotic DOT, mASI, and DASC were significantly greater among patients with CRO-R BSI than CRO-S BSI (p < 0.001). The median time from blood culture collection to appropriate antibiotic therapy was significantly longer in the CRO-R group (24 hours, IQR 16–48) than the CRO-S group (1 hour, IQR 0–2) (p < 0.001). Increasing cumulative antibiotic therapy prior to BSI, as quantified by the mASI, was significantly associated with increased risk of 1-year CDI after BSI (P = 0.027).

Conclusion

Patients with first episode CRO-R Enterobacterales BSI had significantly greater prior antibiotic exposure than patients with CRO-S BSI and experienced significant delay of appropriate therapy. Routine quantitation and reporting of prior antibiotic therapy may improve empiric prescribing.

In 2019, an estimated 929 000 global deaths were caused by 6 antibiotic-resistant bacteria and another 3.57 million deaths were attributable to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, with the 3 most common infectious agents being Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The spread and impact of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in parts of the world worsened during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. It was estimated that during the pandemic, 29 400 people died of antimicrobial-resistant infections in the United States, 40% of whom acquired their infection while in the hospital. These deaths were likely attributable, in part, to longer hospital stays and potentially exacerbated by increased antibiotic use and challenges and limitations imposed on infection prevention and control activities and hospital resources during the pandemic.

Extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (ESCrE) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) represent a clinically important group of antibiotic-resistant bacteria given the magnitude of β-lactam use worldwide and few treatment alternatives, particularly in resource-limited settings. Among inpatients receiving antibiotics in 3 Kenyan referral hospitals, 15%–31% of all prescriptions were ceftriaxone. Carbapenems are infrequently used in Kenyan hospitals — accounting for < 10% of antibiotic prescriptions in public referral hospitals — and may not always be available or affordable. Newer combination antibiotics used in high-income countries to treat CRE (eg, ceftazidime-avibactam) are not currently widely available in Kenya, leaving few treatment options for infections due to these organisms.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, carbapenem-resistant, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as preferred options for the treatment of pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, assuming susceptibility is demonstrated. Administer ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, or cefiderocol as other preferred options. Administer aminoglycosides as an alternative option for the treatment of pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.

### Study details | NCT03903783 | Impact of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone on the emergence and carrying of multidrug-resistant bacteria… [^113yuvop]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant enterobacteria is currently posing a real public health problem. The European antimicrobial resistance surveillance network evaluated, among clinical strains, the resistance rate for 3rd generation cephalosporins at 9. 5% for Escherichia coli and 28% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The consequences of multidrug-resistant enterobacterial infections, which are mainly represented by ESBLs, are currently well known, both from the individual point of view and collective. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime are two injectable injectable third-generation cephalosporins commonly used in clinical practice. Despite their similar spectrum of action, it should be noted that they have substantially different pharmacokinetic properties, especially with regard to their half-life and their elimination routes.

Some works have already been interested in this topic. Grohs et al. carried out a comparative study between ceftriaxone and cefotaxime on the emergence of AmpC hyperproducing enterobacteria. This single-site study demonstrated that, at a hospital level, the preferential use of cefotaxime rather than ceftriaxone had collective and ecological benefits at the service level. Indeed, their results conclude that resistance development is weaker, as well as more limited carriage of HL-CASE Enterobacterial strains by replacing ceftriaxone with cefotaxime. It should be noted, however, that the modification of prescribing practices of C3G has been coupled with various measures to limit the emergence of AmpC hyperproductive enterobacteria.

In a context where the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria continues to increase, it seems appropriate to conduct a study to compare the impact of the use of ceftriaxone or cefotaxime on the emergence of BMR at the individual level. The study will have two periods: Period 1 during which patients hospitalized in the emergency department or in internal medicine and receiving C3G antibiotics will receive ceftriaxone, and the period 2 during which cefotaxime is cephalosporin used in first intention in these same patients.

### Determining the optimal ceftriaxone MIC for triggering extended-spectrum β-lactamase confirmatory testing [^114iN8uE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

As routine testing of clinical isolates for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production (screen plus phenotypic confirmatory testing) is no longer required by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), a number of clinical microbiology laboratories use ceftriaxone MICs as a proxy means of identifying bacteria as potential ESBL producers. Data from 1,386 clinical isolates suggest that a ceftriaxone MIC cutoff of 8 μg/ml is an excellent predictor of ESBL production, with a positive predictive value and negative predictive value approaching 100% and 99.5%, respectively.

How should the correct antibiotic be chosen in patients with IAIs?

14. In patients with IAIs, empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the local microbiological epidemiology, clinical severity, and individual patient risk factors for resistant bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

15. In most patients with IAIs, agents with a narrow spectrum of activity should be preferred. In community-acquired IAIs, the most common resistance problem is posed by alarmingly prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

16. The following risk factors for ESBLs-producing Enterobacterales infections should be always considered: (a) hospitalization for 48 h within the last 90 days, (b) use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 days within the last 90 days, (c) gut colonization by ESBLs within 90 days and (d) patients coming from healthcare settings with a high incidence of MDR bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

17. Antibiotic therapy aimed at enterococcal coverage should not be routinely prescribed in patients with community-acquired IAIs unless they are immunocompromised (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

18. Empirical antibiotic therapy covering MDR Gram-negative bacteria should be considered only in specific settings, and based on country-wide epidemiological conditions, clinical severity, immunological impairment, knowledge of colonization status, prolonged exposure to carbapenems and/or quinolones (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

In the setting of IAIs, inappropriate choice of initial antibiotic therapy in patients leads to more clinical failure, resulting in a longer hospital stay and higher costs of hospitalization compared with appropriate initial antibiotic therapy. Before causative agent(s) and susceptibilities are known, the optimal choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the local prevalence of resistant bacteria and patient risk factors for them as long as available microbiological data (e.g. colonization status).

Microbiology

The bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

In an in vitro study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone.

Ceftriaxone has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.

Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms:

Acinetobacter calcoaceticus

Enterobacter aerogenes

Enterobacter cloacae

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant and beta-lactamase producing strains)

Haemophilus parainfluenzae

Klebsiella oxytoca

Klebsiella pneumoniae

Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains)

Morganella morganii

Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing strains)

Neisseria meningitidis

Proteus mirabilis

Proteus vulgaris

Serratia marcescens

Ceftriaxone is also active against many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

NOTE: Many strains of the above organisms that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides, are susceptible to ceftriaxone.

Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms:

Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains)

Staphylococcus epidermidis

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Streptococcus pyogenes

Viridans group streptococci

NOTE: Methicillin-resistant staphylococci are resistant to cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone. Most strains of Group D streptococci and enterococci, e.g. Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis, are resistant.

Anaerobic microorganisms:

Bacteroides fragilis

Clostridium species

Peptostreptococcus species

NOTE: Most strains of Clostridioides difficile are resistant.

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Ceftriaxone exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ≤ 1 mcg/mL or less against most strains of the following microorganisms, however, the safety and effectiveness of ceftriaxone in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms:

Citrobacter diversus

Citrobacter freundii

Providencia species (including Providencia rettgeri)

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^1179rtXf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — emergence of resistance to newer β-lactam agents and management steps are outlined as follows: Suggested approach: The emergence of resistance is a concern with β-lactam agents used to treat CRE infections, and available data suggest the frequency may be higher for ceftazidime-avibactam than for other newer β-lactams. Estimates of the emergence of resistance after clinical exposure are approximately 10%–20% for ceftazidime-avibactam and < 5% for meropenem-vaborbactam, and cefiderocol resistance appears notably higher in ceftazidime-avibactam resistant versus susceptible Enterobacterales isolates (83% vs 7%). It is recommended to repeat antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for the newer β-lactams when a patient previously infected with a CRE has a sepsis-like presentation, and if a patient with a KPC-producing bloodstream infection received ceftazidime-avibactam 1 month earlier and presents with symptoms suggestive of infection, consider administering an agent such as meropenem-vaborbactam until organism and AST results are available.
